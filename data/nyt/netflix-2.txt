Abstract: None available.

Full text: The breakout girl group went public with complaints against its parent company, Hybe, which has just released a new TV series and film about the control it exerts over stars.
A huge part of the success of NewJeans -- the most creatively promising new K-pop act of the past two years -- has been its music videos: stylistically sophisticated, vividly colorful, palpably joyful. Starting with music that deploys top-shelf songwriting buoyed by production savvy about global microtrends, the group developed a singular aesthetic to go with it, drawing equally from high fashion, lived-in nostalgia and contemporary cuteness.
So it was striking when, a couple of weeks ago, the group released a video performance unlike any that preceded it. In a live broadcast on a burner YouTube account, the group's five members -- Danielle, Haerin, Hanni, Hyein and Minji -- spoke for almost 30 minutes about their dissatisfaction with their parent company, Hybe. They particularly focused on how it had de-emphasized the role of the group's executive producer, Min Hee-jin, in their work.
Here was a group putting its external image and its internal leverage at risk to argue for their creative lives. It is an infrequent scenario at this level in K-pop, a genre and business in which careful choreography -- of music, visuals and star behavior -- is crucial to the power of the art.
This livestream, of course, was as art directed as any of the group's technicolor music videos. The members dressed largely in black, speaking softly in an anonymous office. Out in the world, NewJeans is vibrant, dynamic and approachably fun; in this clip, which some fans speculated was secretly orchestrated by Min, the members were reduced to spiritless cogs, as if trapped and suffocated by the corporation itself.
For almost as long as K-pop has been a global force, it has been an exemplar of the controversial virtues of top-down control. American pop labels essentially abandoned this mode more than a decade ago, following the boy band and Britney-Christina era. The influence of social media in creating bottom-up hits and stars has all but invalidated the label-knows-best mode of creation. But K-pop's commitment to that ethic persists, and has made exactitude into an artistic virtue.
Nevertheless, human beings pulse beneath these constraints, and the NewJeans rebellion -- one of the highest-profile K-pop labor disputes in recent years -- feels like a true rupture. It turned a behind-the-scenes executive tug of war into a game of chicken. Hybe can effectively derail NewJeans's career for stepping out of line, or the members of the group can effectively sacrifice themselves. In the video, NewJeans demanded that Min be reinstated -- their mien is somber, but it's not quite a plea. There is authority and resilience in their presentation, with its frequent mentions of their fans, known as Bunnies -- a group that's loyal to the stars, not the label.
K-pop idols rarely break character, even in unpolished settings. To the extent that Hybe (formerly Big Hit) is interested in transparency, it is only to showcase the intensity of the work its stars put in to appear perfect.
But the NewJeans conundrum makes this a curious and perhaps not totally fortuitous time for Hybe to loudly demonstrate its micromanaging methods. That's the intent of "Pop Star Academy: Katseye," a Netflix series about the making of an English-language global girl group that's part behind-the-scenes documentary, part elimination competition. (The show, and the group, are part of a joint venture between Hybe and the American label Geffen.)
Directed with nervy patience by Nadia Hallgren, "Pop Star Academy" is far more in thrall to the labor being learned and performed than about the art it will be put in service of making.
The first batch of trainee competitors practice for over a year: dance classes, vocal lessons, style makeovers, media training. What the show renders explicit is the extent to which a pop star can be constructed from almost whole cloth -- the star is the training regimen. Even the contestants with ample social media following and defined personalities before joining the competition are slowly broken and tamed.
At one point the Hybe chairman, Bang Si-hyuk -- one of the most powerful figures in K-pop -- decides to accelerate the group's rollout, combining strategy and mischief: "When they wait too long to debut, they get frustrated and lose their spark, which shows in their eyes," he says, speaking Korean, with a glint in his eye.
Critique is offered up like air -- cheap and ubiquitous. "I didn't believe it at all. It felt like nothing, honestly," says one dance instructor; "Are you aware that you're singing out of tune?" asks a mentor with clear exasperation. Competitors are derided for flat facial expressions, for failing to live up to K-pop beauty standards, for having private Instagram accounts. Those who chomp at the bit, or otherwise push back, are largely dismissed (except TikTok-popular Manon, whom the label contrives to make a part of the group despite her seeming lack of vigor for the idea). One of the more emotionally sophisticated contestants leaves the show once it shifts from training to competition, which the participants hadn't been fully informed would happen.
On the one hand, it is bracing and refreshing to hear such plain appraisal. Pop stardom is astonishingly hard work, and the difference between the raw clay on display in the first episode and the polished final product at the show's conclusion is more than striking, it's valorizing.
The final group is scrupulously diverse, apart from height -- those who were comparably short get cast aside. Last month, Katseye released its sturdy debut EP, "SIS (Soft Is Strong)," and unsurprisingly, the best and most popular song from it, "Touch," is the most NewJeans-ish. The group is hawking it relentlessly on TikTok, where they perform its hand-gesture choreography with a variety of K-pop stars, and even Usher.
There is a glimpse of where all of this relentless work might lead in "Jung Kook: I Am Still," a new documentary/performance supercut focusing on the youngest member of BTS, who last year became, in disorientingly short order, the most commercially successful K-pop solo star in American pop.
BTS is the ne plus ultra of Hybe plan -- this film is one of several that has focused on the group or its members. It captures, sometimes just barely, the frantic eight-month stretch in which Jung Kook was thrust into solo stardom before enlisting in South Korea's mandatory military service.
This is what all the hard work of being in BTS was for, ostensibly -- a shot at extending his career beyond the very wide boundaries of the group's accomplishments. Or put more plainly: more hard work.
To the extent that "Jung Kook: I Am Still" is a film at all -- as opposed to a slapdash collection of casual moments, behind-the-scenes fan service clips and music and concert videos -- it is a film about labor. Or more precisely, the inextricable relationship between labor and glamour.
Like "Pop Star Academy," it is decidedly unromantic. Jung Kook is alternately enthused and depleted. Even his purported private moments are commoditized: At one point, he's shown sleeping on a plane. He has a strikingly lithe and sweet voice that's well-captured on his album "Golden," a frothy debut that smoothly yanked Justin Timberlake's comeback lane away from him.
But if Jung Kook is thrilled to be at the top of the charts, he does not show it. Instead, he doubts his vocal range and his natural dance instincts. If he celebrated his ample successes -- including a No. 1 single and No. 2 album on U.S. charts -- the cameras were not there. If he acted out or pushed back, we'll never know.
Like many K-pop entertainment companies, Hybe is vertically integrated, and exerts a significant degree of control over its artists' public presentation. It also builds the metanarratives that become fan manna.
But with success comes courage, or something like it. Not long after NewJeans posted the video about their label concerns, Jung Kook appeared to offer them a measure of support with a pair of cryptic koans: "Artists are not guilty" and "Don't use them." Sure, the words appeared on an Instagram account for his dog, but it was revealing -- and perhaps indicative of table-turning to come -- that they appeared anywhere at all.

With Son's Future in Spotlight, Vance's Mother Faces Her Past: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Here is the way JD Vance introduced his mother to the world in his 2016 memoir, "Hillbilly Elegy":
He described how she hit him. Trapped him in a car, floored the gas pedal and told him they were going to die. Made him pee into a jar so she could use his clean urine to pass a drug test. Moved him around a lot. Overshared. Disappeared. Burned through other people's money. Slit her wrists. Crashed her minivan into a telephone pole.
These days, when Mr. Vance's mother, Beverly Aikins, introduces herself, it is often in far simpler language. "Hi, family. I'm Bev," she said at her regular Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in Middletown, Ohio, one Sunday this month. "I'm an alcoholic addict."
A group of mostly older men murmured back, "Hi, Bev."
She had invited a reporter from The New York Times along on the condition that none of her fellow group members would be identified. They were meeting in a tough-looking part of town, inside a squat brick building with cracked concrete floors and cinder-block walls painted white. Ms. Aikins wore denim overall cutoffs and a white T-shirt, her highlighted hair piled atop her head. She picked up some recovery literature and began to read from it: "These are our 12 traditions. ..."
It has been almost 10 years since she got sober from alcohol and heroin and all other manner of substances she used to put down her throat and up her nose. In that time, the book her son wrote became a best seller and then a movie. He got elected to the Senate. He may very well be this country's next vice president.
His rise has thrust her, unexpectedly, into the world of national politics. This summer, he brought her to the Republican National Convention and shouted out her sobriety, framing the arc of her life as a tale of redemption.
It is all still a bit new to her. She is dimly aware that her son has become the figure of much outrage of late, but, for the sake of her own sanity and sobriety, she says she remains purposefully oblivious to many of the controversies swirling around him.
Last Sunday, after her A.A. meeting wrapped up, she stuck around to explain that she would like to use this new platform of hers to help others who struggle with addiction. "I want people to know to reach out, to try to get help," she said, "and that recovery is hard but it's so worth it."
It was nine years ago that her son first told her about his memoir. They were at a Waffle House. "He said, 'Mom, I wrote a book, and there's probably some things in it that aren't very favorable,"' Ms. Aikins recalled. "I just said, 'Will it help you heal?' He said, 'I think it will."'
She remembered reading it for the first time. "It was heartbreaking in some parts," she said. "But it helped us grow as a family, and it opened up a line of communication that we never really had. Addiction in our house was like the elephant in the room. Nobody ever said anything about it. We do now."
She grew up in an abusive household herself. Her father was an alcoholic who beat her mother, Bonnie Vance, who was known as "Mamaw" to JD Vance. When Ms. Aikins was 19, she had a daughter, Lindsay, who is five years older than Mr. Vance. Mamaw and Lindsay looked after Mr. Vance when his own mother could not.
Ms. Aikins's struggle with addiction began many years ago one day at work. She was a nurse. She got a bad headache and took a Vicodin pill. She loved the way it made her feel. She went home, bathed her children and cleaned her house. Soon she began to purloin stronger pharmaceuticals, such as Percocet. She lost her job and her nursing license and, with it, her access to prescription pills. She began to snort heroin. "My brain loved it," she said.
She lived that way for a long time. "For years, I had made excuses for Mom," Mr. Vance writes in his book. "I had tried to help manage her drug problem, read those stupid books about addiction, and accompanied her to N.A. meetings. I had endured, never complaining, a parade of father figures, all of whom left me feeling empty and mistrustful of men."
She eventually lost touch with her children. Rock bottom came in 2015, when she was living out of her car, a red Chevrolet Aveo. She checked into a sober living facility across the Ohio River in Covington, Ky. After she got out, her daughter helped her find a place to live back in Middletown. But life was hard. "The apartment that I had was in the ghetto, and it used to be a trap house," Ms. Aikins said. "Do you know what that is?"
A "trap house" is a drug den. Ms. Aikins would wake up to find addicts on her front porch, searching for the dealer who lived there before she did. She would threaten to call the police. "I just dug my heels in," she said.
Five years later, her son, who had by that point graduated from Yale Law School and worked in private equity, bought her a house in a safer neighborhood. (She lives there now with her daughter.)
Around that time, Netflix was making Mr. Vance's book into a movie. During production, Ms. Aikins attended a dinner with the film's director, Ron Howard, and the actress who would play her, Amy Adams. It was a manic portrayal, all frizzy-haired and frenzied. "She said she wanted to get my sarcasm down," Ms. Aikins said of Ms. Adams. "I think she did an amazing job. I was very flattered." (This was said unsarcastically.) The real-life Ms. Aikins comes across today as a more hardened, confident character. She has the sort of unfazed affect of a person who has lived many years on the edge.
When the film came out, Ms. Aikins watched it for the first time with her children on Mr. Vance's porch in Cincinnati. At first, she could not understand why they were so emotional. She said they told her: "'Mom, you were out of it all those years. You don't even remember.' It's like, 'Oh, yes, OK. Go ahead and cry."' She laughed and then added, a touch defensively, "It's a movie! Quit crying."
'JD's mom!'
When Republicans gathered in Milwaukee in July to officially nominate former President Donald J. Trump and Mr. Vance as the top of their ticket, one of the more cinematic moments involved an unexpected cheer for Ms. Aikins.
In his acceptance speech, Mr. Vance described "single moms like mine, who struggled with money and addiction but never gave up."
He continued: "I'm proud to say my mom is here, 10 years clean and sober. I love you, Mom." The cameras panned to a teary-eyed Ms. Aikins as the convention hall broke into a spontaneous chant: JD's mom! JD's mom! JD's mom!
It was a surreal experience for a woman who had never even watched a political convention on television before. None of it was remotely familiar, including her seatmate in the V.I.P. box that evening. "I said, 'Hi, what's your name?"' she recounted. "He goes, 'Mike Johnson.' I went, 'What do you do here?' He goes, 'I'm the speaker of the House.' I went, 'That sounds very impressive, but I'm not sure exactly what you do."'
Ms. Aikins's parents were Democrats -- Mamaw had an affinity for Bill Clinton -- but these days she is a registered Republican. She described herself as "bipartisan," but then wondered: "Is that the right word? I don't vote the party. I vote the person." In 2016, the person was Mr. Trump. "Nobody can buy him," she said. She got to meet him at the convention. "He was just very humble and very nice to me, and told me I had a great kid," she said.
Part of the reason her son's book was such a hit was that it was read by elites and the commentariat as a field guide for understanding places like Middletown and its inhabitants, the sorts of people who would send Mr. Trump to Washington. Back in those days, Mr. Vance's view was that Mr. Trump was cynically preying on the despair of a destabilized white working class. How did he go from describing Mr. Trump as "cultural heroin" to becoming his running mate?
"I'm probably not the best person to answer that," Ms. Aikins said. "But I do think that JD saw, when he was in office, that things for people in our area got better. I think that's why he changed his mind."
'Trump country'
The day before Ms. Aikins attended the A.A. meeting in Middletown, she was out in the Appalachian foothills, in Hillsboro, Ohio. It is a place of winding roads and cornfields and tiny graveyards that poke out from hillsides. Off one particularly barren stretch of road sat parked a classic square-body pickup truck. A large sign had been propped up in the bed of the truck for anyone who happened down that lonely way to see. It read: "FENTANYL KILLS."
Beside the truck was a long, narrow drive that led to a field with a pitched roof and a pavilion in the center of it. Gathered there were a few dozen people. There were parents who had lost children to drug overdoses and fentanyl poisoning. And there were children who had lost parents the same way. They were all mad with grief. They wore it on their faces, and you could hear it in their voices.
They had heard that JD Vance's mom was going to be there. Many of them had seen her moment at the convention.
"I was so excited, because I really wanted to meet her," said Debbie Evans, a 68-year-old retiree from Woodbridge, Va. She was wearing a Trump hat that had belonged to her son before he had died. "I like how she came from where she came from, and how he did, and how wonderful he is now, and how far he went," she said.
Margie Perkins, a 66-year-old hospice nurse from Spotsylvania County, Va., brought a copy of "Hillbilly Elegy" with her. "I hope she signs it," she said. "I want her to be an example that family can come back together after all of this," Ms. Perkins said.
It was not a political event, but, as one mother pointed out, "This is Trump country."
Ms. Aikins took a seat a few rows back from a stage at the front of the pavilion. She sipped from a Diet Mountain Dew bottle as people got up to talk about how addiction had robbed them. One young woman wailed while recounting what it was like to grow up the child of an addict, how she had seen the inside of motel rooms and strip clubs and crack houses, and how, finally, her mother had died. The young woman held up a plastic bag that contained her mother's last belongings -- what had been found on her body. There was a bus pass and a cheap piece of jewelry in there. "This is all I have left of my mom," said the woman.
Ms. Aikins was there with two colleagues who work with her at a substance abuse treatment center called Seacrest. The colleagues are also in recovery. One got up and talked about what it was like to get dope-sick while seven months pregnant and in jail.
Then it was Ms. Aikins's turn. She seemed almost shy. "For my five-year clean anniversary, my son bought me a house," she told the crowd. She did not mention who her son was. But everyone knew.
"Wow, this lady's got some street cred," said the man who got onstage after her. The parents in the crowd nodded as Ms. Aikins quietly returned to her seat in the back. "She's got a heck of a story," the man continued, "and if you guys know her, well, you know her."
A small group of mothers approached Ms. Aikins and asked if they could take a picture with her. "You're famous," one said.
'My own little bubble'
Two days after Mr. Vance's convention speech, Ms. Aikins posted a long message on Facebook. "It's been an exciting week," she began, but then the post took a turn: "Seeing how my town, that I choose to live in and love has so much vitriol and hate for my child is devastating to my peace of mind I've fought so hard to have." She wrote that she would stay off social media until after the election.
"You see this hometown boy who's doing so good, you would think no matter what your politics, you would just want to get behind him and root him on," she said after her A.A. meeting in Middletown this month.
But her son's combative style and his commentary about "childless cat ladies" and "the childless left" running the country have turned off many Americans, who find his views to be rather retrograde and judgmental. How could someone who was raised by women -- his sister, his "Mamaw" and Ms. Aikins -- end up being so dismissive of so many women's lives?
Perhaps he has idealized a traditional family unit precisely because he never had one growing up. "I would agree with that statement," his mother said. "For both of my kids, they didn't grow up with a positive family unit. I know that they seemed to gravitate towards that in their adulthood."
Asked how Mr. Vance's wife, Usha Vance, has weathered the scrutiny, Ms. Aikins said: "She's very supportive of JD. She's quite brilliant. They kind of feed off of each other. You will never, ever, ever, ever hear JD ever say anything bad about Usha. That's his No. 1, and I love that for them, and I think she's doing really well."
Three of the most famous women in the world -- Oprah Winfrey, Taylor Swift and Jennifer Aniston -- have all knocked Ms. Aikins's son for his "childless cat ladies" comment. "I just choose to ignore that," she said, "and ignoring the bad, I also have to ignore the good. I can live in my own little bubble and be comfortable."
That bubble is important to her continued sobriety. The morning of her A.A. meeting, her son had given an eye-popping interview to CNN in which he tried to explain why he was spreading a debunked rumor that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were feasting on people's pets. "If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people," he said, "then that's what I'm going to do."
Not only had Ms. Aikins not seen this, she also claimed to have no idea what was happening (or not happening) in Springfield, which is just 50 miles from Middletown. "I'm not even on social media," she said. "I watch Investigation Discovery. Is there something happening in Springfield?"
Cats. Dogs. Haitians. Her son.
"I'm sorry," she said, shaking her head. "I don't know."
She added that she was really too busy with her own work to keep up with the news. She said she got her nursing license back and she teaches at the treatment facility. "This week, we're talking about sexually transmitted infections," she said, "so I've been doing a lot of research on chlamydia."
One political program Ms. Aikins does intend to watch is Mr. Vance's debate against Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, on Oct 1. Asked what she thought of Mr. Walz, Ms. Aikins replied: "I don't really think about him either way. Is that bad?" She thought for a moment. "I've heard he was a teacher, which I have a lot of respect for teachers. If he attacks my baby, he might want to hide from me. But I think my baby can pretty much handle himself."
And yet, this is a dangerous job her baby has taken. It did not end so well for the last guy who had it. When former Vice President Mike Pence tried to certify Mr. Trump's defeat on Jan. 6, 2021, the mob of pro-Trump rioters that attacked the U.S. Capitol chanted, "Hang Mike Pence!" and accused him of being controlled by the Devil. Mr. Trump watched it all on TV.
Ms. Aikins said she did not worry about any of this. "I think that JD is probably the smartest, most amazing young man, and everything he touches turns to gold," she said.
In fact, she added, "JD will be president one day. You know how I know that?"
She said that "he used to watch all these political shows" when he was little. "I would say, 'Why do you watch that?' He would say, 'Mom, this is about our country. I need information.' I would just think, 'What a nerd."'
One night, he was desperate to watch a debate, but his stepbrothers at the time would not give up the remote, because there was a wrestling match on. "So we went and got a motel room, so my baby could watch the debate on TV," Ms. Aikins said proudly.
But who was debating?
"I don't even remember," she said with a laugh. "I was probably high."

Comedy
Hannah Gadsby
Sept. 27-Oct. 27 at Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, Manhattan; abronsartscenter.org.
In the 2018 Netflix special "Nanette," Hannah Gadsby told the audience, "I have to quit comedy." And yet six years, one Emmy and one Peabody Award later, the performer, who uses they/them pronouns, is still out there making us laugh.
Gadsby can't help conspicuously applying their singular perspective to the world around them. Last year, they put their bachelor's degree in art history to use, curating the Brooklyn Museum show "It's Pablo-matic," a roast of Picasso that was not well received by some, including The New York Times.
Their latest project is "Woof!," an hour-plus rumination that maintains a sense of whimsy amid a swirl of anxieties. After performing it at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Gadsby is bring it to the Abrons Arts Center on the Lower East Side for a monthlong residency. Previews begin on Friday at 7 p.m., and opening night is scheduled for Oct. 6. (See the center's website for more showtimes and details.)
Tickets start at $ 60 at OvationTix. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
All Things Go
Sept. 28-29 at 12:15 p.m. at Forest Hills Stadium, 1 Tennis Place, Queens; allthingsgofestival.com.
After a decade in Washington, the festival All Things Go is expanding northward, and will inaugurate a new edition in Queens this weekend.
Since 2018, the festival has prioritized women- and L.G.B.T.Q.-led lineups, prompting some online commentators to playfully dub it "lesbian Coachella." This first New York iteration is no exception. Saturday's bill includes the trio Muna, whose fizzy synth-pop anthems foreground queer joy, as well as the Broadway-actress-turned-pop-star Reneé Rapp and -- separately -- her rock guitarist girlfriend, Towa Bird. Perhaps the most hyped artist on the bill is Chappell Roan, whose meteoric rise this year has been fueled, in part, by her buzzed-about performances at Coachella, Gov Ball and Lollapalooza.
On Sunday, highlights include the fierce Philadelphia-based punk band Mannequin Pussy; the elegiac singer, songwriter and guitarist Julien Baker; and Ethel Cain, a singer of psycho-Americana in the mold of Lana Del Rey. The genre-bending singer Janelle Monáe will close out the festival.
Single-day tickets start at $ 119, and a premium two-day option is available for $ 499, at AXS. OLIVIA HORN

In the midst of a successful tenure as the director of National Sawdust, the composer Paola Prestini now offers us her first full-length opera, "Silent Light," a multisensory exploration of a marriage in crisis.
Based on Carlos Reygadas's 2007 film of the same name, "Silent Light" follows a couple living in an isolated Mennonite community. The husband, Johan, is having an affair with a local woman, Marianne. His wife, Esther, knows, but Johan cannot tear himself away. The film sets their slow-motion implosion against the expansive sky and rolling plains of northern Mexico; it has no soundtrack, only bird chirps, shoe clicks, sharp breaths.
In the opera, Prestini creates an immersive world with sounds, sights and smells to evoke those wide-open plains in the comparatively small space of National Sawdust. Environmental sounds designed by the Foley artist Sxip Shirey slide almost imperceptibly into Prestini's score as her music tracks the elemental forces of passion and betrayal that move just below the surface of this remote, quiet world.
Tickets to the performances, which are at 7 p.m. Thursday through Saturday and at 4 p.m. on Sunday, are $ 122 on National Sawdust's website. GABRIELLE FERRARI

Brooklyn Book Festival Children's Day
Sept. 28, 10 a.m.-4 p.m., at Brooklyn Commons, 5 MetroTech Center; brooklynbookfestival.org.
Even children who say they don't like books might be excited to see one take shape that's inspired by their own imaginations.
On Saturday, the Brooklyn Book Festival Children's Day, an indoor and outdoor event, will offer that experience more than once. Young visitors can attend Mad Libs: Graphic Novel Edition!, in which the authors Booki Vivat and Gale Galligan will create an illustrated book, using audience suggestions. Or kids can investigate Draw Me a Story, which is exactly what the illustrators Ruth Chan and Liz Montague will do when children propose ideas.
Readers who aspire to be writers themselves should head to Goosebumps & Beyond, where the juvenile horror author R.L. Stine will talk, read his work and judge a contest of scary stories that young fans tell. (The prize is a tote bag of spooky delights.)
A Picture Book Stage will cater to preschoolers, and illustrators will engage young artists in multiple craft projects. (A full schedule is online.)
Everything is free, except the thousands of books on offer. LAUREL GRAEBER

New York Film Festival Revivals
Sept. 28-Oct. 12 at Film at Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan; filmlinc.org.
The New York Film Festival fills its (figurative) marquee with the most ambitious new titles in world cinema, but its revivals section is a great showcase for rediscoveries, like the Filipino director Lino Brocka's pitiless "Bona" (on Saturday, Monday, Wednesday and Oct. 10), from 1980. Nora Aunor stars as a fan besotted with a small-time actor who demands her subservience while snubbing her love. Marva Nabili's 1977 "The Sealed Soil" (on Wednesday and Oct. 5 and 9), billed as the earliest surviving Iranian film with a female director, is a slow but startling find. With a distanced camera and long takes, it charts a woman's small acts of resistance to repression.
From 1999, the L.A. Rebellion director Zeinabu irene Davis's "Compensation" (on Oct. 5 and 7) mixes silent-era and contemporary aesthetics to tell mirrored love stories in Chicago. And Robert Bresson's restored, Dostoyevsky-derived "Four Nights of a Dreamer" (on Saturday, Tuesday, and Oct. 7 and 11), from 1971, looks dreamy again. Some screenings are listed as standby, but the festival often releases additional tickets, and there will be rush lines. BEN KENIGSBERG

Full text: The five-part Netflix series tells the story of a female wrestler in the 1980s who might have gone a little too deep into character.
Dump Matsumoto was a reviled -- and thus beloved -- heel in the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling league in the 1980s. "The Queen of the Villains" (on Netflix, in Japanese with subtitles, or dubbed) is a colorful five-part scripted drama based loosely on her young life and early career, and it traces both her rise and the increasing popularity of women's pro wrestling in Japan at the time.
The show lands more as a boppy superhero origin story than as an earnest biopic: It is at times bright and exaggerated, a tidy tale about messy people and an absolute bonanza of retro tracksuits. Yuriyan Retriever stars as Dump, though for much of the show she is simply Kaoru, a young woman with nowhere to put all her anger and ambition. Her father is an abusive drunk who drifts in and out of her life, stealing from her mother and belittling her and her younger sister. As a tween, she learns that her father has a secret other family -- including another daughter also named Kaoru. It's enough to make a good girl go bad.
Our Kaoru falls in love with wrestling, with being encouraged to be strong, tough and violent. A grim determination to simply keep going is as powerful as any suplex, and the ring is one of few places where being a larger woman is an asset.
But it isn't always easy for Kaoru to keep track of what's real and what's just for show, and as she dissolves into her Dump persona, some other wrestlers recoil. It's all a fun sisterhood until Dump brings a chain into the ring and starts choking people. And few friendships survive repeated stabbings in the scalp with a fork.
"Queen" itself reflects Dump's ambiguous realities. We're never sure how cranked up the artifice of it all is, how much of a match is choreographed, the degree to which the wrestlers agree on what is fake. Dump wrestles in a few "hair matches," in which the winner cuts the loser's hair, but she also holds a colleague down and shaves her hair outside the ring, at their dorm. Inept, indifferent management leaves the wrestlers to establish standards on their own. But they don't always agree on what's safe and acceptable, or on whose star-making moves should get priority.
Appropriately for a show about pro wrestling, "Queen" feels both illicit and wholesome. Retriever's performance captures Kaoru's innocence and ferocity -- the turmoil of being proud of and afraid of what's inside you.

Made of Metal, Yet Emotional: [Review]

Full text: Chris Sanders's movie about a robotic assistant and the gosling she raises is defined by dazzling visuals and frank ideas about the circle of life.
Have you ever thought about the many ways animals show emotion? Consider an inquisitive snout wriggling in the air, tails coiled protectively around cubs and ears perky or drooping depending on mood. For creatures who didn't evolve to walk upright, wearing one's heart on one's sleeve is a considerably more anatomical business.
Among the achievements of "The Wild Robot" is a painstaking regard for details like these. Written and directed by Chris Sanders ("How to Train Your Dragon") and adapted from Peter Brown's novel, the movie is a dazzling triumph of animation in which you feel the filmmakers' attention on every frame. In a revivifying turn away from the gag-a-minute, computer-generated extravaganzas clogging up the animated zoological canon, this is a work that cares most about two things: big feelings and great beauty.
That's not to say that its machine is built entirely of new parts. In some ways, this kid-friendly affair about an interspecies found family even leans into its derivative elements. Roz, the bionic hero of "The Wild Robot," seems designed to evoke the title character in "The Iron Giant," sharing that monster's studying eyes and lanky stature. But rather than outer space, she hails from today's sinister science-fiction analog: the conglomerate Universal Dynamics, which specializes in robotic digital assistants. Think Alexa in hulking metal form.
The movie opens as Roz (short for Rozzum Unit 7134) accidentally washes off a cargo ship and ashore a wildlife island, where she swiftly begins scouting for a task that satisfies her serve-at-all-costs programming. After wreaking havoc on some fauna, the robotic assistant (voiced by Lupita Nyong'o) stumbles upon a purpose: raising an orphaned, newborn gosling whose kin she accidentally squashed.
Brightbill, as she names him, is on the runty side, and although Roz grows more sociable -- at first, she can speak only in a Robotese, which is so stilted it might as well be Middle English -- her ward (voiced by Kit Connor, of the Netflix series "Heartstopper") struggles to master the basics of his pond and sky habitats. Tagging along for the child-rearing is a rascally fox named Fink (Pedro Pascal), who alternates between parenting advice and snide remarks. The impending winter imposes a ticking clock on Brightbill's training: Should he fail to become airborne before migration time, he will perish in the cold, assuming he's not eaten first.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The circle of life is visible in "The Wild Robot," which embraces its harsh realities with daring. On top of Brightbill's seasonal countdown, his world contains a pecking order of predators and prey, from worms to woodchucks to bears. All of them are struggling to survive, as proved during the blizzard that Roz and Fink battle to rescue hibernating neighbors. Trudging into the storm, the pair manage to save a small Noah's Ark-worth of nearby dwellers, but come upon at least one burrow where they were too late.
Climate change is also a specter, especially once the story expands to observe a sterile hydroponics production system far from the flourishing ecosystems of the verdant (and notably unnamed) island. We spend most of our time in this Eden, and Sanders seems chiefly concerned with notes of optimism and a message of good will throughout the food chain. But darker moments speak to the tightrope his movie walks between quixotic amity and unsparing truths.
The visuals -- not just good, but spectacular -- take an anti-verisimilitude approach, and are more evocative for it. Envision a craggy cave engulfed in waves, meadows speckled with Monet-inspired wildflowers and a tree trunk blanketed with fluttering monarchs. These impressionistic landscapes are hardly based on actual environments. Their function is to imbue Roz's surroundings with wonder and whimsy, eschewing the lifelike in favor of the exquisite.
Beholding all this loveliness, one longs for a version of "The Wild Robot" with less prattling dialogue -- not to mention nondescript pop melodies -- where the scenery does the singing and the characters inspire swells of uplifting feeling all on their own. Indeed, in the moments where Brightbill and his gander wordlessly soar among feathery clouds, the movie hits its highest peaks.

Privileged Brothers Whose Crime Still Fascinates: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story" chronicles the trials of two brothers who killed their parents in 1989, and their aftermath. Much has changed since then.
On Aug. 20, 1989, Lyle and Erik Menendez, ages 21 and 18, shot and killed their parents in the family's Beverly Hills mansion. Both were sentenced to life in prison in 1996 after two highly publicized trials, the first of which was broadcast on the then-nascent Court TV.
But in the 35 years since the crime, the public has become increasingly divided on whether the brothers were merely the stone-cold opportunists the prosecution said they were. Now Ryan Murphy -- who has a longstanding knack for taking on stories at the intersection of true crime, celebrity and media -- is weighing in with a new scripted version of their story, premiering Thursday on Netflix.
Titled "Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story," the series stars Nicholas Alexander Chavez and Cooper Koch as Lyle and Erik, with Javier Bardem and Chloë Sevigny playing their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez. It is the second installment of the Monster anthology, created by Murphy with Ian Brennan. The first focused on the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.
A lot has happened since 1989 -- including numerous documentaries, podcasts and a "Law & Order" series -- as the case and cultural attitudes have evolved. Need to get caught up? Here's a brief refresher and an update on more recent developments.
The Menendez family story
Jose Menendez was a successful entertainment executive who fled his native Cuba for the United States on his own at the age of 16, shortly after Fidel Castro took power. He married his college girlfriend, Mary Louise Andersen, better known as Kitty. They had two sons, and after some time on the East Coast, the family settled in the Los Angeles area.
Lyle and Erik grew up immersed in wealth and privilege: Their house in Beverly Hills was on one of the most sought-after blocks; Erik became a nationally ranked tennis player; Lyle attended Princeton University (though he was ultimately suspended). But the family had secrets. In court, both brothers testified that their father had begun molesting them at a young age and that their mother had known about it.
Reporting on the trial for The New York Times, Seth Mydans wrote of Lyle, "The defendant was in tears almost from the start as he told a story of a frightened child suffering terrifying pressures from a demanding and cruel father, and expressions of hatred from his mother."
What happened on Aug. 20, 1989?
Kitty and Jose were watching television in their living room when their sons came in and shot them both multiple times at close range with 12-gauge shotguns.
Accounts of the timeline vary, but at some point, the brothers bought movie tickets at a local theater and went to the "Taste of L.A." festival in Santa Monica -- seemingly to create an alibi.
At 11:47 p.m., Lyle called 911, crying, and said "someone shot my parents." The police found that in addition to the fatal shots to the head, Jose and Kitty had been shot in the kneecaps, which prosecutors later said was to make the attack appear to be a mob hit. The brothers weren't viewed as suspects at first. Then people started to notice questionable conduct, including odd behavior at their parents' funeral and excessive spending.
How did the murder trials unfold?
Lyle was arrested on March 8, 1990, after police received a tip from Judalon Smyth, who was having an extramarital affair with L. Jerome Oziel, the brothers' psychologist. Smyth said she had overheard them telling Oziel that they had killed their parents; she also said he had the confession on tape. The tapes were later used as evidence in the trial after Judge James Albracht ruled that doctor-patient privilege did not apply because the brothers had threatened Oziel.
Erik was arrested days later, after returning from a tennis tournament in Israel.
In a trial that began in 1993, the brothers testified that they had killed their parents out of fear for their lives after years of sexual, emotional and physical abuse. Their cousins Andy Cano and Diane Vander Molen both testified that they had been aware of the molestation for years. Erik and Lyle said that in the days before the killings, they had confronted their parents and Jose had threatened to kill them if they didn't keep quiet about it.
The televised trial ended in January 1994 with two deadlocked juries (each defendant had been assigned a separate jury), so a retrial was ordered. It was not televised.
In the retrial, which began in 1995, with a single jury, Judge Stanley Weisberg barred the defense from revisiting much of the abuse argument, including testimony from the brothers' cousins and multiple character witnesses. In March 1996, each brother was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. They were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
Where is the case now?
Over the years, the conversation around the brothers has shifted. At the time of the killings, the difficulty of escaping patterns of sexual abuse, especially when the victims are boys and men, was not always recognized. During the closing arguments of the first trial, the prosecutor David Conn said that Erik "wants you to believe his father is abusing him on a routine basis, forcing him to engage in sexual acts against his will; he expects you to believe it never occurred to him to leave."
More recent treatments of the brothers's stories -- including several documentaries and the scripted series "Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders" -- have been more sympathetic toward the brothers, acknowledging the dire effects that sexual and emotional abuse can have in childhood.
At the same time, new evidence has emerged. The journalist Robert Rand, who has covered the story for decades and written a book, "The Menendez Murders," uncovered a letter Erik wrote when he was 17 to Cano, his cousin, describing the sexual abuse by his father and how afraid he was. A 2023 Peacock docuseries, "Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed," based on reporting by Rand and Nery Ynclan, detailed new accusations by a former member of the Puerto Rican boy band Menudo that he had been sexually assaulted as a teenager by Jose.
Amid the renewed interest, the brothers and their case have become something of a social media phenomenon, with legions of young people advocating their release. In May 2023, Cliff Gardner, a lawyer for the brothers, filed a habeas corpus petition arguing that their conviction should be vacated because of the new evidence.

Reaping Insights From Being A Bad Boss: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: In the most insightful part of "For Your Approval," she says that she was a poor fit to run a workplace but that women leaders are judged differently.
It takes a peculiarly modern chutzpah (or obliviousness) to say -- on a Netflix special -- that you were kicked out of show business.
To be fair, it might feel that way to Ellen DeGeneres, 66, whose hit daytime show, "Ellen," ended in 2022 not long after reports claimed it had a toxic workplace. This followed years of people online pointing out that she was not as friendly as her television persona suggested. Leaving a successful talk show and ending up on the biggest streaming service in the world is not the worst trade, but these days, everyone receives 15 minutes of fame and an hour of cancel culture notoriety. DeGeneres handles hers with pointed offhandedness and light sarcasm, saying on her new special that she was kicked out of show business because she was mean.
"You can't be mean and be in show business," she adds flatly. "No mean people in show business." Then she pauses just long enough for audiences to register the absurdity but not too long to test their patience. "I'm out," she mutters.
Our social media-driven culture incentivizes phony likableness but makes maintaining that facade difficult. DeGeneres, who preached kindness on her talk show, has long been trying to escape this niceness trap. Her previous special, "Relatable," positioned her as the kind of person who doesn't want to hold your baby because it would mess up her sweater. This follow-up, "For Your Approval," premiering Tuesday, mixes observational jokes with a newly confessional style.
We learn about her O.C.D. and A.D.H.D. and her arthritis and childhood neglect and how her need for approval damaged her mental health. It's a messy, revealing self-portrait whose feathery jokes mask a heavier tone. In an old attention-getting gambit, she says this will be her last special, but it's hard to believe. (Remember when Hannah Gadsby retired?)
One of the most gifted low-key comics who ever picked up a microphone, DeGeneres is part of the family tree of patient pausers like Jack Benny and Bob Newhart. She still gets a lot out of a little. Who else receives applause for a modest joke about the parking brake?
DeGeneres is a much better comic than actor. You see that in an unnecessary opening that pictures her backstage surrounded by angry headlines and highlights from her career. She spots an image from her sitcom, and then flashes a knowing smile as if she is pleasantly surprised to see it. It's a corny gesture, but don't underestimate those. DeGeneres built a huge fan base on daytime television in part because she's deft at creating intimacy with the camera, making performing for a crowd seem like a dinner party.
But in her standup, she comes across as a more paradoxical figure: calm but neurotic, cheerful but also haunted, ordinary pal and alien superstar. What anchors her is trusty comic instincts and timing. She's at her best leaning into her prickliness. She says people appreciate it when you tell them something is stuck in their teeth, but "as soon as you tell someone that all of their stories should be 50 percent shorter ..."
Then she stops and allows you to consider the specificity of this point. It sounds authentic. Dressed in sneakers, stretchy suit pants and an expensive-looking watch, DeGeneres wants to appear ordinary by saying she likes nothing more than wearing sweatpants around the house. But when she illustrates the point by saying she refused to attend a dinner party with Mick Jagger, you realize the limit to how relatable her jokes can be.
Becoming a mega-famous daily talk-show host can change a person. It's a point that she makes. "When I'm at a party and I talk to someone for more than five minutes, I have the urge to say: 'Sorry, we have to take a break."' In an interview this year, Conan O'Brien said almost the same thing to me. (His version was a temptation to say, "Let's take a break and be right back.")
Leaving that grind can give one perspective. DeGeneres's most insightful section is not when she's pretending to be like you, but when she explores being a boss. No cultural figure earns less sympathy, which is part of the reason this section of the special stands out as so fresh. You don't hear this point of view on social media as much. DeGeneres says she was an immature boss, a poor fit for the job. But she adds that female bosses are expected to act differently than male ones are.
This leads to a big speech in the special that feels like a dramatic monologue at the end of an Oscar-contending movie in which she describes herself in all of her complexity before abruptly adding: "I'm a strong woman."
It elicits a roar of a response. In a moment when America is about to decide if it will elect its first female president, some might even detect a political subtext here, a hope that we judge female authority with as much complexity as we do men's.
You could see this as DeGeneres changing the subject or avoiding accountability. But that doesn't mean she isn't right.
Men are taught to be confident in a way that women are not, she says, and illustrates this by saying that you see only men, in the middle of any setting, practice an imaginary golf swing. It's a joke that evokes, among other things, Johnny Carson, the gold standard in talk-show likability whose public image was carefully cultivated and who benefited from a media era in which it was easier to project an air of mystery.
"For Your Approval" starts with a dreamy scene in DeGeneres's dressing room as she stares at a mirror showing a younger version of herself telling jokes on Carson's "Tonight Show." Mournful piano plays. Melancholy keeps creeping to the fore. In a serious interlude that stood out among many references she makes to caring what others think of her, she says that in show business you must care, because "it's the only real currency."
I believe she believes that. Popularity and how people see you clearly matter a lot. But there are other currencies to measure success: A joke well-told, the satisfaction of a thought perfectly expressed. DeGeneres has had a remarkable, pathbreaking career, but one of her greatest legacies -- having her sitcom character, essentially an avatar for her, come out of the closet in the 1990s -- led to a drop in the show's ratings and ultimately its cancellation. Only a doomed worldview sees that as failure.
She probably understands this. But you hear it more in the jokes than in the serious parts, the punchlines about the little lies we tell ourselves. "I used to say I didn't care what people thought of me," she says wryly. "Looking back, I realized I said that at the height of my popularity."

Full text: This article has been updated to reflect news developments.
Was social media a good invention? One way to quantify the value of a product is to find out how many of the people who use it wish it had never been invented. Feelings of regret or resentment are common with addictive products (cigarettes, for example) and addictive activities like gambling, even if most users say they enjoy them.
For nonaddictive products -- hairbrushes, say, or bicycles, walkie-talkies or ketchup -- it's rare to find people who use the product every day yet wish it could be banished from the world. For most products, those who don't like the product can simply ... not use it.
What about social media platforms? They achieved global market penetration faster than almost any product in history. The category took hold in the early aughts with Friendster, MySpace and the one that rose to dominance: Facebook. By 2020, more than half of all humans were using some form of social media. So if this were any normal product we'd assume that people love it and are grateful to the companies that provide it to them -- without charge, no less.
But it turns out that it can be hard for people who don't like social media to avoid it, because when everyone else is on it, the abstainers begin to miss out on information, trends and gossip. This is especially painful for adolescents, whose social networks have migrated, since the early 2010s, onto a few giant platforms. Nearly all American teenagers use social media regularly, and they spend an average of nearly five hours a day just on these platforms.
So what does Gen Z really think about social media? Is it more like walkie-talkies, where hardly anyone wished they had never been invented? Or is it more like cigarettes, where smokers often say they enjoy smoking, but more than 71 percent of smokers (in one 2014 survey) regret ever starting?
We recently collaborated on a nationally representative survey of 1,006 Gen Z adults (ages 18-27). We asked them online about their own social media use, about their views on the effects of social media on themselves and on society and about what kinds of reforms they'd support. Here's what we found.
First, the number of hours spent on social media each day is astonishing. Over 60 percent of our respondents said they spend at least four hours a day, with 23 percent saying they spend seven or more hours each day using social media. Second, our respondents recognize the harm that social media causes society, with 60 percent saying it has a negative impact (versus 32 percent who say it has a positive impact).
Turning to their own lives, 52 percent of the total sample say social media has benefited their lives, and 29 percent say it has hurt them personally. Although the percentage citing specific personal benefits was usually higher than those citing harms, this was less true for women and L.G.B.T.Q. respondents. For example, 37 percent of respondents said social media had a negative impact on their emotional health, with significantly more women (44 percent) than men (31 percent), and with more L.G.B.T.Q. (47 percent) than non-L.G.B.T.Q. respondents (35 percent) saying so. We have found this pattern -- that social media disproportionately hurts young people from historically disadvantaged groups -- in a wide array of surveys.
And even when more respondents cite more benefits than harms, that does not justify the unregulated distribution of a consumer product that is hurting -- damaging, really -- millions of children and young adults. We're not just talking about sad feelings from FOMO or social comparison. We're talking about a range of documented risks that affect heavy users, including sleep deprivation, body image distortion, depression, anxiety, exposure to content promoting suicide and eating disorders, sexual predation and sextortion, and "problematic use," which is the term psychologists use to describe compulsive overuse that interferes with success in other areas of life. If any other consumer product was causing serious harm to more than one out of every 10 of its young users, there would be a tidal wave of state and federal legislation to ban or regulate it.
Turning to the ultimate test of regret versus gratitude: We asked respondents to tell us, for various platforms and products, if they wished that it "was never invented." Five items produced relatively low levels of regret: YouTube (15 percent), Netflix (17 percent), the internet itself (17 percent), messaging apps (19 percent) and the smartphone (21 percent). We interpret these low numbers as indicating that Gen Z does not heavily regret the basic communication, storytelling and information-seeking functions of the internet. If smartphones merely let people text each other, watch movies and search for helpful information or interesting videos (without personalized recommendation algorithms intended to hook users), there would be far less regret and resentment.
But responses were different for the main social media platforms that parents and Gen Z itself worry about most. Many more respondents wished these products had never been invented: Instagram (34 percent), Facebook (37 percent), Snapchat (43 percent), and the most regretted platforms of all: TikTok (47 percent) and X/Twitter (50 percent).
Our survey shows that many Gen Z-ers see substantial dangers and costs from social media. A majority of them want better and safer platforms, and many don't think these platforms are suitable for children. Forty-five percent of Gen Z-ers report that they "would not or will not allow my child to have a smartphone before reaching high school age (i.e. about 14 years old)" and 57 percent support the idea that parents should restrict their child's access to smartphones before that age. Although only 36 percent support social media bans for those under the age of 16, 69 percent support a law requiring social media companies to develop a child-safe option for users under 18.
This high level of support is true across race, gender, social class and sexual orientation, and it has important implications for the House of Representatives, which is considering just such a bill, the Kids Online Safety Act. The bill would, among other things, disable addictive product features, require tech companies to offer young users the option to use non-personalized algorithmic feeds and mandate that platforms default to the safest settings possible for accounts believed to be held by minors.
On Tuesday, in response to mounting pressure from child-safety groups and the threat of regulation, Meta announced new settings and features on the Instagram accounts of teen users, to address concerns about safety and sleep deprivation. While we welcome this first step, we remain cautious; Meta has long been accused of prioritizing profit over the safety of its youngest users, which, of course, Meta denies.
Social-media platforms serve as communication platforms, which means any reforms must respect First Amendment protections; the House measure seeks to do this by focusing on what content is being recommended to kids through their algorithms, not on what kids are posting or searching for. But even so, imagine if walkie-talkies were harming millions of young people. Imagine if more than a third of young people wished that walkie-talkies didn't exist, yet still felt compelled to use them for five hours every day.
If that were the case, we would take action. We'd insist that the manufacturers make their products safer and less addictive for kids. Social media companies must be held to the same standard: Either fix their products to ensure the safety of young users or stop providing them to children altogether.

An Actor Basks in the Golden-Hour Glow: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ms. Torres starts with a low-key workout, takes a dance break and ends the day with one of her favorite murder-filled TV shows.
When Gina Torres recalls the heyday of "Suits," the legal drama she starred in, she instantly remembers how "insane" the fan base was abroad. But with the resurgence of the show in streaming on Netflix and NBC's Peacock, suddenly the hype has followed suit in the United States.
"It wasn't until it hit and everything that we got the same attention here," Ms. Torres, 55, said, adding that the renewed excitement had been "very unexpected and really sweet."
Ms. Torres played Jessica Pearson, the stylish and no-nonsense co-founder and managing partner of a prestige law firm, until she departed for the spinoff "Pearson." That project, in 2019, made her the first Afro-Latina to create, star in and produce a television show.
Shortly after, Ms. Torres was tapped to join the cast of the hit drama series "9-1-1: Lonestar" in the role of Capt. Tommy Vega, a paramedic who returns to the work force during the Covid-19 pandemic. In the show's fifth and final season, which will premiere on Monday, Ms. Torres said that her character would show "what a warrior she is."
Ms. Torres, who is the youngest of three children, was born in Manhattan and raised in the Bronx. She attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where she studied opera and jazz. She has been acting in TV and movies for more than 30 years.
Now, she is preparing for her next chapter as a producer and executive producer. Might she reprise her role as Jessica Pearson for the new "Suits" spinoff based in Los Angeles? "They'd have to ask me," she said.
Ms. Torres lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Washington Heights with, she said, "amazing views" of the Palisades and the Hudson River.
SLOW BURN Sundays aren't a hard workout. Sundays are just about reminding my blood that it needs to move through my body and stretching. I like to start with a stretch, and then go, take a nice long walk in Fort Tryon Park at a pace. I'm not a runner, but it's not a stroll. There are stairs that have been built into a cliff line in Washington Heights, and these are stairs that I walked up every single day as a kid to go to my middle school. Of course, the irony is that now I use them as exercises. I run up them two at a time, then I lunge up them the second time around and then I run up them one last time.
GROCERY RUN There's this great market called Frank's Market, and they have everything you could possibly need. I love it because it's such a typical New York little grocery store. No space is wasted. It's beautifully organized, and there's also fresh deli food, there's premade food, everything you could possibly want.
TEA FIX I'm not a coffee drinker. I'm going to have my Cuban card revoked when they find out. I do love tea and Chai, a large soy Chai from Buunni Coffee. My partner, Kevin, and I got a scone and a biscuit.
DAY DATE There are these beautiful grounds where I live, and it's residents only. Usually, there are people picnicking and kids playing, and it just lives right in the shadow of the George Washington Bridge. You feel like you can touch it. There are benches there, so my guy and I just sat on our bench, drank our warm drinks and had our scone and our biscuit. Just took it in, had a nice conversation.
SHOWERING AND SCRIPT READING In between the grounds, there was a shower. I'm all about exfoliation, so I love a good scrub. I have shower gloves, which I think are great. You don't feel like you're getting your bang for your buck for the washcloth. Hydration after that and moisturizing. There was some script reading. These are projects that I'm currently in development for, so it's reading script samples from writers that I'm talking to. It's reading the latest rewrite of a script that I'm working on.
NEIGHBORHOOD DINING At Flor De Mayo, we had dinner with a girlfriend of mine, my partner and I. The Chino-Latino culinary experience is singular to New York, and it's important to get my fried rice, my ropa vieja and my plantains.
ROOFTOP TOAST My friend and I and my partner went back to the apartment, and we went up to a nearby rooftop deck with a bottle of Champagne -- because there was much to celebrate -- and had a dance at golden hour on the rooftop. We danced to '80s music.
MURDER MYSTERY My partner is a huge football fan, so there's inevitably a game on. He loves the Houston Texans and the University of Utah Utes. There's usually a problem when I'm rooting for the Giants. So he gets his football time, and then I get my "Only Murders in the Building" time.

An Artist Moving On From an Installation She Called Home: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: The artist Apryl Miller is selling her colorful, full-floor apartment at 188 East 76th Street for $ 8.75 million. Psychedelic chairs and couches sold separately.
The kaleidoscope of colors enveloping the walls, floors and ceilings of Apryl Miller's home may not be to everyone's liking. But they served a clear purpose for Ms. Miller, an artist who raised her two daughters in the sprawling Upper East Side apartment.
"The idea always was to make a very special home for my children," said Ms. Miller, who bought the unit brand-new with her former husband in 1998 and took sole ownership in 2002. "I wanted my daughters to feel they knew the place was for them. Color is rejuvenating, and colors have souls. I didn't want white walls."
Their vibrant home, much like a livable art installation, encompasses the 29th floor of the 31-story Siena condominium at 188 East 76th Street in the Lenox Hill neighborhood. Over the years, the apartment has been featured in various publications and social media posts, as well as in the Netflix documentary series "Amazing Interiors" and MTV's "Teen Cribs." And it has been part of the Open House New York tours.
Ms. Miller, who is also a jewelry designer and a poet, is proud of the painstaking work she put into the quirky design and décor, with just about every color in the rainbow accounted for in her artwork and furnishings. But with her daughters, Dylan and Lyris, now grown and with living expenses rising, she said, it's time to move on. "I always knew I couldn't keep it forever," she said. "It's too big."
The full-floor condo is on the market for $ 8.75 million, according to the listing brokers, Stan Ponte and Colin Montgomery of Sotheby's International Realty, with monthly carrying costs totaling $ 14,708. The furnishings and artwork are not included in the sale, but they can be purchased separately.
The apartment extends 4,076 square feet and contains five bedrooms and four and a half bathrooms. Throughout the unit are panoramic cityscape and Central Park views from the oversize windows.
"Having this much space with as many windows, you can do with it what you want or keep it as is," Mr. Ponte said. He described the apartment as "upbeat, cheery and positive."
"It's as if your imagination is able to come to life," he said, "and when you're there in person, it makes complete sense." (Potential buyers who prefer a more neutral palette can also view images of virtually staged rooms.)
"When I'm here, I feel energized, but I also feel at peace," Ms. Miller said.
For Ms. Miller's elder daughter, a vintage clothing dealer and a singer/D.J. who goes by Dylan Sparkle, the apartment "made me who I am." She said she would miss its "boundless vibrancy," along with all the family activities that took place there: the "floor picnics," putting on shows on the stage in her sister's bedroom, and keeping the Christmas tree up until June.
The apartment has a circuitous layout. Off a centrally located elevator landing are two entrances, at opposite ends, one opening to the public rooms, the other to the bedrooms.
The main doorway, at the west end, leads to a spacious foyer with a powder room and a walk-in closet. The hardwood floors are covered in paint splatters, in the style of the abstract artist Jackson Pollock.
The foyer leads to an enormous living room and, beyond that, a media room. Both are decked out in swirls of colorful carpeting that give off a playroom vibe. Shades of yellow and green cover the walls. The dining room, also off the living room and with a similar eye-catching aesthetic, is at the south end. The living room showcases pieces from Ms. Miller's "Sculpture Masquerading as Furniture" series.
"Each one of the pieces tells a different story," she said, adding that she used garment fabrics because they were softer to the touch.
Previously known as the chair museum, the dining room had long housed Ms. Miller's art installation of chairs or parts of chairs. That installation was recently removed, and the room now actually has a table and chairs.
The nearby eat-in kitchen has floors painted with splattered and geometric designs, cerulean cabinets with Plexiglas cutouts, and a breakfast bar with (no surprise) mismatched chairs. Ms. Miller is especially proud of the child-friendly kitchen table she designed.
"The kitchen table has clear Lucite legs underneath," she said. "I drilled holes in them and had them designed so that they had little shelves in each leg. My girls liked being underneath the table with their little toys."
The bedrooms are at the other end; three have en suite bathrooms. "What I love about the layout is that the primary bedroom is just as large as the living room," Mr. Montgomery said.
The primary suite features two large walk-in closets and an extra-large bathroom embellished with hand-cut and hand-painted tiles. The vanity has an assortment of vintage drawer pulls.
Ms. Miller has many happy memories in the apartment, like the "Christmas after Christmas" parties she would host, and watching her daughter Lyris, now a professional musician whose band is called Talulah Paisley, perform on the small stage she built in her bedroom.
She realizes the apartment's next owner will probably make changes. "I'm OK with having the whole place gutted," she said. "I made my peace with it. It's an art installation. Art doesn't last forever."
"I know I'll be really sad when it's actually sold," she added. "I'll cry later."

Full text: Influential women in entertainment talked politics, fashion week and fall travel plans at a party to support emerging filmmakers.
Chloe Fineman, the "Saturday Night Live" star known for her impressions of people like Melania Trump and Britney Spears, was headed into a lunch in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday dressed in a white jacket and tiny black shorts with hints of Jackie Kennedy Onassis. She joked she appeared reserved, polished and demure. But she insisted it was just a look.

"My attitude is the opposite of demure," Ms. Fineman said, laughing. "I'm very stressed, very unmindful, very agitated."
"I live in New York," she added. "We have things to do."
It was midday, and Ms. Fineman was joining about 100 other influential women in fashion and entertainment at Locanda Verde, the Italian restaurant in TriBeCa. The actors Olivia Wilde, Whitney Peak and Phoebe Tonkin were there. So were the broadcast journalist Gayle King, the stylist Kate Young, and the television writer and showrunner Joanna Calo.
They had gathered for the Chanel Through Her Lens Program Luncheon, which marked the beginning of a three-day workshop for 10 emerging female filmmakers.
The program, created by Chanel and Tribeca Enterprises, which owns the Tribeca Festival, is in its tenth year. Through mentorship and funding it has helped about 100 women make about 40 short films that have appeared at the Sundance Film Festival and on Netflix and HBOMax, according to organizers.
"These women are being mentored by film composers, costume designers and other great artists," said Ms. Wilde, who is on the jury that helps select participants. "I wish I had done this program."
In the past, the film director Kathryn Bigelow and the actresses Rashida Jones, Courteney Cox and Sarah Jessica Parker were mentors. This year, the list includes the director, actor, and writer Pamela Adlon and the creator and showrunner Mara Brock Akil.
The luncheon fell at the heels of New York Fashion Week and the Emmy Awards, and many guests were still buzzing about the festivities.
AnnaSophia Robb, the actress and model, said she had finally figured out how to make fashion week manageable.
"I came for the tail end of fashion week, and it was lovely," she said. "I went to the Michael Kors show. It was so chaotic, but it was the only show I went to, and I saw all my friends there."
Ms. Calo, a producer and writer known for "The Bear," still couldn't believe Liza Colón-Zayas won the Emmy Award for outstanding supporting actress in her role as Tina Marrero on the series.
"We partied so hard after," she said. "It was so fun. I mean, for me, that is staying out until 1 a.m. because I had to take my child to school the next day."
The actress Rosie Perez gushed that Ms. Colón-Zayas was the first Latina to win the award.
"She made history," she said, "and I hope that transfers into the film industry as well and shows people it's not just about women, it's also about women of color."
Other attendees were getting ready for a busy fall ahead.
Francesca Scorsese, the actress, was headed to Italy and plans to travel throughout the country with her father, the filmmaker Martin Scorsese.
"We always have the best time on trips. We will watch a couple of films," she said, adding, "Maybe we will go out to dinner with a group of people, and then we will go home and chat for an hour."
Ms. Wilde was getting ready to shoot a movie, "I Want Your Sex" with the actor Cooper Hoffman and the singer-songwriter Charli XCX.
"I am acting in this one, and it's been a minute, because I've been directing," she said. "I've read the script about a hundred times."
Ms. Fineman was preparing for "Saturday Night Live" to begin again on Monday.
The vibe is "very back to school," she said. "We are going to have fun with politics, which I'm really excited about."
She was not the only guest thinking about the news.
"I'm leaving for D.C. to do a show at the Kennedy Center," said Beanie Feldstein, the actress, who will be performing in "The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee."
"The show is really fun, so I hope it will bring some levity and joy and silliness to people over there," she said.
Whenever she goes to Washington, D.C., she remembers playing Monica Lewinsky in the 2021 season of "American Crime Story," she said. "I feel her there," she said. "And the Kennedy Center is right across from Watergate, so all the memories come back."
Inside Locanda Verde, partygoers were dressed in bows, jackets, shoes and purses from Chanel. They chatted with one another while drinking Champagne and Arnold Palmers.

Hollywood Producers See A Plot Twist in Their Pay: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Corporate consolidation and technology have upended many jobs in recent decades. But few arcs are more surprising than that of the Hollywood producer.
In more than three decades as a studio executive and producer, Kevin Misher has worked on some of the most beloved movies in Hollywood, including "Rudy," "Meet the Parents" and "Public Enemies."
As recently as 2012, his production company, Misher Films, supported three development executives and three assistants. It had a studio deal worth more than $ 1 million in many years, which allowed it to acquire scripts and hire writers while meeting payroll.
But today, even as Mr. Misher continues to produce high-profile movies like "Coming 2 America" and "You People," as well as television shows, documentaries and podcasts, his company has slimmed down amid the industry's changing economics. Years often pass between the time producers start a project and the time they are paid. Deals for producers have dried up as studios have sought greater efficiencies. Mr. Misher's six employees have dwindled to one, along with a partner who earns a portion of his fees.
"Those deals sustained you -- they were a paycheck," Mr. Misher said. "They allowed you to make a basic wage while waiting for a payout."
The unraveling of these arrangements has not only made life harder for an accomplished producer like Mr. Misher, whose job is to originate movies by identifying promising material, and to oversee the hundreds or thousands of people involved in writing and filming. It has also hollowed out the field's middle tier and made it almost impossible for young people to enter the profession.
"It starts to self-select for people who come in already with money," said Mr. Misher, part of a group of more than 100 producers called Producers United, who are seeking more favorable financial terms through discussions with Hollywood studios. "The perspective gets narrower, it isn't as innovative or diverse."
The pressures are hardly unique to Hollywood. Across the economy, once-valued jobs requiring a high degree of skill and experience have been reined in during an era of consolidation and technological change, trends that promised efficiency gains.
Doctors and pharmacists, whose interactions with patients once defined their jobs, struggle to carve out face time or exercise judgment under the performance metrics imposed by their large organizations. Local journalists, whose reporting was once subsidized by the high-margin business of classified ads, have been laid off in large numbers amid acquisitions and the rise of digital advertising and free online competitors.
But in some ways the demise of the Hollywood producer, a storied figure in an iconic American industry, is most surprising. "I won an Oscar in 2006," said Cathy Schulman, who has produced such movies as "Crash" and "The Woman King" and is part of Producers United. "But even that gold star isn't fully durable." Ms. Schulman said she recently spent the better part of nine years making a movie for which her earnings came to under $ 60,000 a year.
In the early days of Hollywood, studio executives typically oversaw the making of a film. But after government antitrust litigation forced studios to scale back their businesses in the late 1940s, they increasingly turned to outside producers.
Under an arrangement that became common, a studio would pay an outside producer a fixed fee, part of which could be an advance, as well as a share of the movie's revenue or profit, giving the producer a potentially large payday if the project succeeded.
By the 1980s, many studios had added overall deals -- ongoing payments that allowed producers to support themselves and their companies between projects.
The system reliably generated moneymakers into the early 2000s, and came to rely on the producer as a bridge between the studio and the cast and crew. It fell to the producer to pitch the movie or TV show to a studio; assemble writers, actors and directors; and deliver the project on time and on budget.
"You read a script and a good producer can say, that's a $ 55 million movie, that's a $ 60 million movie," said Lynette Howell Taylor, who has produced such movies as "A Star Is Born" and "The Accountant."
Producers competed aggressively to find and develop the next project. "I'd have two breakfasts, a lunch, a drink, dinner," said Mr. Misher, who stepped down as a Universal Studios executive in 2001 to become a producer. "You had to develop a network" that included agents, studio executives and talent. And they were compensated handsomely when their projects succeeded -- often earning millions of dollars from a hit.
Over the next decade, however, studios began to scale back spending on outside project development, according to J.D. Connor, an expert on studio economics at the University of Southern California.
As entertainment companies got bigger, they pushed their studios into an arms race of sequels and superhero spectacles, which could be developed internally and drive profits more reliably. Declining revenue from DVD sales, along with a Hollywood writers' strike and a recession and financial crisis, dented companies' bottom lines and squeezed producers' deals further.
Then, during the 2010s, it became less common for producers to receive a meaningful share of the revenue or profit from a movie. At the same time, their fixed fees were frequently eroded by stars and even managers who demanded a producer credit, too, which both conferred prestige and entitled them to a cut of the producer's fee.
Today, a typical fee for a movie project that takes five to seven years to shepherd ranges from a few hundred thousand dollars to a few million. But these fees are often parceled out among actors, directors and managers, in addition to what Producers United calls the "career producer" who shoulders the traditional responsibilities of that role. (Members of the group say stars credited as producers sometimes take on these responsibilities, but many do not.)
And the career producer sees little or no money until the studio gives the project an official go-ahead, a timeline that many producers say has ballooned over the past few decades from a year or two to several years. "You end up working for free for years till it gets greenlit," Ms. Howell Taylor said.
Those financial challenges have reverberated through the business. While established producers like Mr. Misher, Ms. Howell Taylor and Ms. Schulman can no longer afford a team of producers-in-training whom they groom for larger projects, younger people find it impossible to enter the profession unless they are independently wealthy or willing to endure years of financial hardship.
And the problems have worsened in the past few years because of cost-cutting demands from investors and last year's prolonged actors' and writers' strikes, which delayed or derailed many projects.
After Stephen Love graduated from the University of Southern California's master's program in producing in 2014, he drove for Uber and received government assistance while trying to produce his first movie.
That movie, "The Land," came out in theaters two years later and helped put him in a position to produce several more, including the coming "Shadow Force," starring Omar Sy and Kerry Washington.
But he has continued to struggle financially at times, partly because of the time it takes to be paid for a project. "In 10 years I've made five movies, and that's great," Mr. Love said. "But here I am back in survival mode again."
To preserve their profession's viability, Mr. Misher, Ms. Howell Taylor and Mr. Love have become active in Producers United, which began last year as an informal alliance of prominent producers who normally compete with one another. Members have met with executives at many studios and streamers and asked them to pay career producers an advance on their fees while they are developing a project, so they don't go unpaid until the film or television show gets the go-ahead, and to help fund their health insurance more consistently.
Eventually, they hope to limit producer credits to those actually involved in producing, and want studios to separately pay the fees of talent and managers who get producer credits, to avoid reducing the career producer's take.
The talks have been encouraging, said Jonathan Wang, who won an Oscar for producing "Everything Everywhere All at Once." "We say, 'This is the problem we see,' and they acknowledge it," Mr. Wang added. "Now we're into figuring out how to implement solutions."
Several studios and streamers, including Disney, NBCUniversal, Netflix and Amazon, declined to comment.
Adopting a practical fix could be challenging in a time of industry turmoil, which has led to spending cuts and layoffs at studios.
But some argue that this is precisely the moment that a small investment in producers can yield outsize returns. "Freshness of thought is what brings people back into theaters, not regurgitated old things," said Ms. Schulman, the "Crash" producer. "Producers are the keepers of that vision."

Five Women Allege Rape By Ex-Owner of Harrods: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Multiple former employees told the BBC they had been raped or sexually assaulted by the billionaire businessman, who died last year.
Multiple women have accused Mohamed al-Fayed, the billionaire former owner of Harrods, the luxury British department store, of rape and sexual assault, according to an investigation by the BBC.
Five women said Mr. Fayed, who died in 2023 at age 94, had raped them, while others detailed alarming accounts of sexual assault and harassment while they were working at Harrods.
Mr. Fayed, a tycoon with numerous properties and ships around the world, owned Harrods from 1985 to 2010. Later in his life, he became best known for the romance between his son, Dodi, and Diana, Princess of Wales, who both died in a 1997 car crash in Paris.
In a BBC documentary released on Thursday called "Al Fayed: Predator at Harrods," more than 20 female ex-employees presented harrowing accounts of abuse. The allegations span years and continents, with accusations in London, Paris, St. Tropez and Abu Dhabi.
While the BBC investigation is not the first to accuse Mr. Fayed of unwanted sexual advances or harassment, it offers the clearest picture yet of abusive patterns of behavior and raises questions about how women's accounts were dismissed for so long.
In a 1995 investigation in Vanity Fair by Maureen Orth, an employee said that Mr. Fayed "regularly walked the store on the lookout for young, attractive women to work in his office" and detailed other problematic behavior. Mr. Fayed sued for libel but eventually dropped the case.
In 2017 and 2018, Channel 4, a British broadcaster, spoke to several people who said Mr. Fayed had sexually harassed and groomed female employees. Some of the women interviewed spoke again in the BBC documentary.
Many of the women interviewed by the BBC were granted anonymity, used pseudonyms, or used only their first names when describing the abuse. One, who worked as a personal assistant to Mr. Fayed in the 1990s, described being raped by him at his apartment in London when she was 19.
Others described how Mr. Fayed would scour the department-store floor and pick women to work in his office. They were given intrusive gynecological health checks and tested for sexually transmitted diseases, the results of which were sent directly to him.
Former staff from the department store also said that Mr. Fayed's behavior toward women was apparent.
"It was well known -- everybody knew about it," Tony Leeming, who worked as a department manager in Harrods from 1994 to 2004, told the BBC.
Harrods issued an apology on Thursday, saying that the organization was "utterly appalled by the allegations of abuse perpetrated by Mohamed al-Fayed."
Mr. Fayed sold Harrods to Qatar's sovereign wealth fund in 2010 for 1.5 billion pounds, about $ 2 billion at today's exchange rate.
"These were the actions of an individual who was intent on abusing his power wherever he operated and we condemn them in the strongest terms," the company said. "We also acknowledge that during this time his victims were failed and for this we sincerely apologize. We are doing everything we can to fix this."
The company said it was now "a very different organization" from the one Mr. Fayed had owned and controlled, and added that since 2023, when new information had come to light about allegations of sexual abuse, "it has been our priority to settle claims in the quickest way possible, avoiding lengthy legal proceedings for the women involved." That process is still available for any current or former Harrods employees, the company added.
Harrods also posted instructions for former employees who believe they were victims of sexual misconduct by Mr. Fayed, to complete a form to report the allegations to the company. It said that complaints would be considered individually and that if victims wanted to claim compensation, it had an established process.
Mr. Fayed, an Egyptian-born entrepreneur, moved to Britain in 1974, and bought the Ritz Hotel in Paris, alongside his brothers, in 1979. He controlled oil, shipping, banking and real estate around the world, and Forbes had estimated his net worth last year at $ 2 billion. As his wealth grew, he courted celebrities and grew close to the royal family for a time.
But it was the death of his son that came to be most associated with him.
In the years that followed, Mr. Fayed became a vocal critic of the royal family, whom he blamed for his son's death and that of Diana. Mr. Fayed was depicted, often framed in a positive light, in the final season of "The Crown," the Emmy-winning Netflix series that offered a fictionalized version of the lives of Queen Elizabeth and her family.
Reflecting on the series, one of the women who reported being sexually assaulted by Mr. Fayed told the BBC: "I don't want him to be seen as some kind of hero."

Sports Saga Gets the 'American Crime Story' Treatment: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The buzzy FX series delves into the N.F.L. star who murdered a friend less than a year after playing in the Super Bowl.
The saga of Aaron Hernandez has riveted the sports world and beyond for more than a decade. An N.F.L. star on one of football's best teams killed a man in 2013 even as he chased fame and glory on the field.
Two years after his conviction in 2015, Hernandez hanged himself in prison, leaving unexplained his descent into crime, rumors about his sexuality, and how he was able to hide his off-field life while thriving at America's most popular sport.
Hernandez has been the subject of multiple books, true crime podcasts and documentaries. But his story is getting the Ryan Murphy treatment in a new 10-part anthology series, "American Sports Story: Aaron Hernandez," premiering on Tuesday on FX and Hulu. Its showrunners are trying a playbook similar to one used for dramatizations of other well-known scandals like "The People v. O.J. Simpson" and "Impeachment," about former President Bill Clinton's sexual improprieties. But this time, they're grappling with new terrain: pro football.
Nina Jacobson, an executive producer of "American Sports Story," said showrunners hoped to offer viewers a "more subjective experience," rather than a rehashing of previously reported events.
"I think we try, in all of these shows, to find a way to put people in the shoes of the characters and put themselves in the eye of the storm -- not in a way to excuse anybody's voices or behaviors," she said, "but to give people a chance to maybe see them in a different light."
Ahead of the first installment, here are the key points to know about Aaron Hernandez's football career and murder case, and the TV drama that will depict them.
How good was Aaron Hernandez at football?
From 2007 to 2009, Hernandez played college football at the University of Florida, where his team won a national championship. He was voted the nation's best tight end and played alongside quarterback Tim Tebow, and under the direction of head coach Urban Meyer. (The team was later profiled in the Netflix documentary series "Untold: Swamp Kings.")
But Hernandez also ran into trouble. As a 17-year-old freshman, an altercation at a Florida bar ended in a deferred prosecution agreement for Hernandez. In 2007, according to a report, he was questioned by police investigating a shooting that injured two men. And he was suspended by the team in 2008 after a positive test for marijuana.
Despite his talent, many N.F.L. teams were concerned enough about his behavior to pass him over. He was not selected until the fourth round of the 2010 N.F.L. Draft, joining the New England Patriots. Led by quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick, the Patriots were one of football's most popular and successful teams, and their selection kept Hernandez, raised in Bristol, Conn., close to home.
Hernandez became a key force, helping the Patriots to a Super Bowl appearance in 2012. That year, the team's owner, Robert Kraft, signed Hernandez to a $ 40 million contract, a record at the time.
What happened in Aaron Hernandez's murder case?
In 2013, Hernandez was charged with first-degree murder, accused of fatally shooting Odin Lloyd, a semiprofessional football player who had been dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancée. Lloyd's body was found at an industrial park near Hernandez's home, and prosecutors said Hernandez had been angered that Lloyd spoke with people Hernandez did not like at a bar.
The Patriots released Hernandez shortly after his arrest, and while awaiting trial, he was separately charged with murder in the 2012 drive-by shootings of two men in Boston.
Hernandez was convicted of Lloyd's murder in 2015 and sentenced to life in prison, but acquitted of the other charges in 2017. Days after his acquittal, prison officers said Hernandez hanged himself in his cell with a bedsheet. He was posthumously diagnosed with a severe case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease that has been found in many football players.
In media accounts after Hernandez's death, a childhood friend, Dennis SanSoucie, said he and Hernandez had a sexual relationship as teenagers. Hernandez's brother, Jonathan, said Aaron had come out to their mother shortly before his death.
How was the FX series made?
It is based on "Gladiator: Aaron Hernandez and Football Inc.," a 2018 podcast from The Boston Globe and Wondery. Jacobson and Brad Simpson, another executive producer, said they also relied on court transcripts and game footage to keep the series accurate. Domonique Foxworth, a former N.F.L. player and current ESPN analyst, wrote an episode. Simpson said he had been particularly insightful regarding locker-room culture.
Who plays Hernandez and his teammates?
Though the "American Crime Story" franchise has frequently used well-known actors, in Emmy-nominated performances, much of the cast are relative unknowns.
Hernandez is portrayed by Josh Rivera, 29, known for supporting roles in "West Side Story" and "The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes." Simpson said Rivera put on about 30 pounds for the role.
Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski are played by Ross Jirgl and Laith Wallschleger, former college football players; and Tim Tebow by Patrick Schwarzenegger, a son of Arnold Schwarzenegger.

In ‘Agatha All Along,’ Joe Locke Works Like a Charm

Joe Locke nailed his first audition. He was 6 and up for a part in an amateur production of “The Wizard of Oz,” and he easily secured a callback. But when he was told he would have to return for another audition, the thought of trying out again reduced him to tears. He declined the callback. The role went to a different child. “It did traumatize me a bit,” Locke said.
“And,” he added, ducking his chin toward the neck of his cream-colored hoodie, “I was always a crier.”
Locke got older. He got bolder. He threw himself into school plays, Christmas pantomimes, community theater in his home on the Isle of Man. “I come from a very small place where individuality is less embraced,” he said. Onstage, playing pretend, he could express more.
He planned to apply to drama school. Then a family friend alerted him to an open call for a new TV show, “Heartstopper,” a drama about queer English teens adapted from Alice Oseman’s emotion-heavy comics.
At 17, after multiple callbacks, he beat out thousands of other young men to play 14-year-old Charlie Spring, the only openly gay student at an English preparatory school. “Heartstopper,” which became one of Netflix’s most watched shows when it debuted in 2022, was a showcase for Locke’s boyish, beetle-browed charm and uncanny ability to wear his heart on the sleeve of his rugby shirts.
Locke isn’t accustomed to giving himself compliments, but he offered one here: “I can be quite good at being vulnerable onscreen,” he said.
If Locke became a star playing one untried adolescent, he will most likely become even more famous for playing another, a character known as Teen, in “Agatha All Along.” A Marvel series spun off from “WandaVision,” it follows that show’s witchy villain, played by Kathryn Hahn, as she assembles a coven and tries to regain her powers. The first two episodes premiere Wednesday on Disney+. The third season of “Heartstopper” follows on Oct. 3.
“I’ll play as young as I can for as long as I can if that’s what people think I can play,” Locke said, his lips squeezed into a happy-sad half smile. “And no, I’m not mad about that.”
He was speaking from his London bedroom via a video call, his dark eyes blazing through the screen. He was two weeks shy of turning 21, and if he didn’t seem exactly relaxed — Zooming with a stranger is rarely a recipe for ease — he was confident, self-possessed, a grown-up, almost.
The audition process for “Agatha” was longer and more fraught than anything in his experience. There were self tapes, and then several online callbacks. While rehearsing “The Trials,” a climate crisis play at London’s Donmar Warehouse, he was asked to come in for an online chemistry read with Hahn, so he made a whiplash trip to Los Angeles. Walking into the audition room, he felt unbearably anxious. Then he looked at Hahn and the anxiety fled.
“It felt like everyone else in the room just went away,” he said.
Jac Schaeffer, the “Agatha” showrunner, remembers how Hahn responded to Locke. Hahn is an outsize performer, an extreme weather event onscreen. Though Locke is younger and slighter, he entirely held his own.
“When he came in, everything in the room changed,” Schaeffer said. “He was commanding. He changed Kathryn’s performance.” When the scenes were done, Locke and Hahn noticed that they were wearing the same pair of Vans sneakers, fashion kismet. There were more callbacks after that, but the part was his.
The series shot last year in Atlanta. Locke lived on his own for the first time, in a three-bedroom house, which could be scary. But the set was a joy. He liked to sit and listen to his co-stars playing the witches — Patti LuPone, Sasheer Zamata, Ali Ahn, Debra Jo Rupp, Aubrey Plaza — as they joked and cackled and sang. Having grown up with a single mother and several aunts, this felt like home.
“I remember, my first day, Patti laughing like, ‘Oh God, you’re stuck with all of us,’” Locke recalled. “And I was like, this is where I feel comfortable.”
Occasionally, he would ask the women for advice about certain career moves and they asked him questions, too. “We were like, How did this happen?” Hahn said. “His self-possession and his immediate success right out of the gate, we were just trying to get to the bottom of it.”
Some enigmas remain, especially those surrounding Teen. In the first episode, he presents as an ordinary adolescent with a serious eyeliner habit and a particular interest in witchcraft. (Teen is also gay, which fulfills a personal goal — Locke once told an interviewer that he would love to play a gay Marvel superhero.) Marvel swears its actors to secrecy, and Locke was careful about what he would and wouldn’t say.
“He is mysterious,” he said of Teen, which wasn’t exactly helpful. “He holds a lot of the secrets of the show.”
Locke put a lot of himself into Teen, just as he put a lot of himself into Charlie, and into Tobias, the character he recently played in “Sweeney Todd” on Broadway. “There’s something elemental about him,” Thomas Kail, who directed that production, said. “It’s hard at any age, but especially early in your career, to not be afraid to use yourself.”
Locke doesn’t have that fear, and he doesn’t know another way to create a character. Even in the middle of real-life emotion, he will often find himself thinking about how he can use it in his work.
“Sometimes when I cry, I’m like, ‘Oh, this is great,’” he said.
He doesn’t shy away from difficult material — colleagues say that in some ways, he prefers them. “He finds the trickier stuff, the harder stuff, the darker stuff much more enjoyable and much more fun,” said Kit Connor, his “Heartstopper” co-star.
The upcoming third season explores Charlie’s eating disorder. It also shows the characters, including Charlie, in sexual situations. Locke mostly embraced these more adult scenarios. Though he was nervous in anticipation of the sex scenes, the actual shoot felt easy. Some days it was almost too easy.
“I was so into the character at that point, it’s almost like am I doing enough?” he said.
Locke isn’t really Charlie. Or Teen, for that matter, or any of the other characters he might play. He’s more confident, more assertive, mordantly funny and not so tightly held. “If there’s an alternate-universe Charlie, louder and more annoying, that would be me,” he said.
He had plans for his 21st birthday: He wanted to be home, on the Isle of Man, with his family and a Marks & Spencer cake. He also has plans for his career. He’d love to do a low-budget indie, he said. Something dark, something different. But he isn’t in any hurry.
“I’m really into the idea of proving to myself and to the world that I’m actually an actor,” he said. “But I have so much time. As long as I don’t get hit by a car, I have time to explore.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: From the "Joker" sequel and Timothée Chalamet's Bob Dylan biopic to a handful of festival darlings, it's a jam-packed season. Plan accordingly.
From an outsize Francis Ford Coppola passion project to a "Joker" follow-up that multiplies the madness by two, the fall movie calendar is going big. Reducing it to a select list of noteworthy titles was a daunting task. Alongside major releases, including sequels to "Gladiator" and "Moana," we've included a large number of films that earned acclaim at this year's festivals. Many other titles haven't yet settled on release dates. (All dates and platforms are subject to change.)
September
'A DIFFERENT MAN' Sebastian Stan won best lead performance at the Berlin Film Festival for his turn as an actor with a facial disfigurement. As he pines for a new neighbor (Renate Reinsve), a playwright, he undergoes an experimental treatment. Aaron Schimberg directed this offbeat comedy, featuring Adam Pearson as the Stan character's rival. (Sept. 20; in theaters)
'THE SUBSTANCE' In what would make an excellent Sept. 20 double feature with "A Different Man," Demi Moore plays an aging actress reduced to fitness guru-dom who undergoes an experimental treatment of her own. A mysterious injection will divide her into, essentially, two people. Margaret Qualley plays her counterpart. Coralie Fargeat, who wrote and directed, won the screenplay prize at Cannes. (Sept. 20; in theaters)
'WOLFS' George Clooney and Brad Pitt mastered the art of smooth teamwork over three "Ocean's" movies, but in this action comedy, their characters -- two fixers who wind up on the same job -- are initially at loggerheads. Amy Ryan also stars. Jon Watts ("Spider-Man: No Way Home") wrote and directed. (Sept. 20 in theaters, Sept. 27 on Apple TV+)
'LEE' The celebrated photojournalist Lee Miller got a shoutout in "Civil War" earlier this year. Now she gets a biopic, with Kate Winslet in the role. Josh O'Connor, Andrea Riseborough and Andy Samberg co-star. Ellen Kuras, best known for her work as a cinematographer, directed. (Sept. 27; in theaters)
'MEGALOPOLIS' Francis Ford Coppola's first feature since 2011 is a project he's been talking up for more than 40 years. In an amalgam of contemporary New York and ancient Rome, Adam Driver plays an urban-planning visionary who at various points evokes Robert Moses, Ayn Rand's Howard Roark and Coppola himself. (Sept. 27; in theaters)
'SATURDAY NIGHT' Jumping the gun -- by one year -- on the 50th anniversary of the premiere of "Saturday Night Live," Jason Reitman's film depicts the 90-minute countdown to the first broadcast, on Oct. 11, 1975. Gabriel LaBelle ("The Fabelmans") and Rachel Sennott ("Bottoms") star. (Sept. 27; in theaters)
'THE WILD ROBOT' Nature vs. nurture vs. ... programming? A robot voiced by Lupita Nyong'o is stranded on an island with furry friends and becomes a mother to a gosling. Chris Sanders (one of the filmmakers behind "How to Train Your Dragon") directed this animated feature, based on the first of a trilogy of books by Peter Brown. (Sept. 27; in theaters)
'WILL & HARPER' That would be Will Ferrell and the former "Saturday Night Live" writer Harper Steele. The two of them travel the country -- focusing, in part, on Steele's transgender identity -- in a documentary that was a huge crowd-pleaser at the Sundance Film Festival. (Sept. 27; Netflix)
October
'JOKER: FOLIE À DEUX' Joaquin Phoenix, returning to the role that won him an Oscar, goes, um, gaga for Lady Gaga in this sequel to the 2019 smash. From the trailer, Gaga appears to be playing Harley Quinn. Todd Phillips is back as director. Will the staircase put in an appearance? (Oct. 4; in theaters)
'THE OUTRUN' Saoirse Ronan plays a recovering alcoholic who returns to the Orkney Islands in Scotland, where she grew up. Nora Fingscheidt directed this adaptation of the memoir by Amy Liptrot. (Oct. 4; in theaters)
'WE LIVE IN TIME' Florence Pugh and Andrew Garfield play a couple who meet after her character hits his with a car. This drama from the director John Crowley ("Brooklyn") charts their relationship over many years. (Oct. 11; in theaters)
'ANORA' Sean Baker ("The Florida Project") won the Palme d'Or at Cannes for this raucous (but also serious) comedy largely set in southern Brooklyn, about a sex worker (Mikey Madison) who may or may not have it made after she meets a Russian oligarch's son (Mark Eydelshteyn). (Oct. 18; in theaters)
'RUMOURS' The Canadian filmmaker Guy Maddin, directing with his frequent collaborators Evan and Galen Johnson, takes a break from pastiches of anachronistic film styles to make a comedy set at, of all places, the G7 summit. The leaders of the seven nations struggle to put out a statement responding to a vaguely explained global calamity. Cate Blanchett leads the cast as the chancellor of Germany. (Oct. 18; in theaters)
'UNION' Two years ago, the workers at Amazon's warehouse on Staten Island, N.Y., voted to unionize. The documentarians Brett Story and Stephen Maing captured their efforts and disagreements in the period leading up to the vote. The Amazon Labor Union's founding president, Christian Smalls, figures prominently. (Oct. 18; in theaters)
'BLACK BOX DIARIES' The Japanese journalist Shiori Ito is both the reporter and the subject of this documentary, an account of her efforts to obtain justice after a sexual assault. One of the few women to speak out about rape in her country, Ito is considered a feminist icon there. (Oct. 25; in theaters)
'DAHOMEY' Mati Diop's documentary, which follows the process of returning artifacts from Paris to Benin, won the top prize at Berlin. Writing in The New York Times, Jessica Kiang called it "some kind of miracle, packing an extraordinary amount of information, inquiry and wild, persuasive imagination into a slim, 68-minute runtime." (Oct. 25; in theaters)
'NICKEL BOYS' Based on Colson Whitehead's novel, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 2020, the first non-documentary feature from RaMell Ross ("Hale County This Morning, This Evening") follows two Black teenagers at a brutal and racist reform school in Florida. It will open this year's New York Film Festival. Ethan Herisse, Brandon Wilson, Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor and Daveed Diggs star. (Oct. 25; in theaters)
'THE REMARKABLE LIFE OF IBELIN' After a gamer from Norway died at 25, his parents discovered a large group of online friends they never knew he had. Alissa Wilkinson wrote that of all the Sundance documentaries she saw in January, this one "feels most destined to live in my memory." (Oct. 25; Netflix)
November
'BLITZ' Last year, in the documentary "Occupied City," Steve McQueen mapped the history of Amsterdam during World War II. This drama is set in Britain and concerns a boy's efforts to return to London from the countryside, where his mother (Saoirse Ronan) hoped to keep him safe from the war. Elliott Heffernan and Harris Dickinson also star. (Nov. 1 in theaters; Nov. 22 on Apple TV+)
'CONCLAVE' Ralph Fiennes plays a cardinal organizing the process of electing a new pope. Because the movie is adapted from a novel by Robert Harris, there are secrets and power plays afoot. Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow and Isabella Rossellini also star. Edward Berger, of the bombastic 2022 version of "All Quiet on the Western Front," directed. (Nov. 1; in theaters)
'HERE' Thirty years ago, visual effects allowed Tom Hanks to be inserted into major moments in history in "Forrest Gump." Now they'll enable him and his "Gump" co-star, Robin Wright, to play various ages in an adaptation of a graphic novel by Richard McGuire. The book is set in one location over billions of years. The "Gump" filmmaker Robert Zemeckis directed. (Nov. 1; in theaters)
'A REAL PAIN' Jesse Eisenberg wrote, directed and stars in this film about two cousins (Kieran Culkin plays the other) who travel to Poland, where their grandmother, a Holocaust survivor, came from. The critic Manohla Dargis called it "a touching, beautifully acted, laugh-laced drama" when it played at Sundance, where it won the screenplay prize. (Nov. 1; in theaters)
'EMILIA PÉREZ' Four actresses -- Zoe Saldaña, Karla Sofía Gascón, Selena Gomez and Adriana Paz -- shared a prize at Cannes for their performances in this unlikeliest of musicals, about the friendship between a Mexican cartel kingpin (Gascón) and a lawyer (Saldaña) hired to arrange the kingpin's gender transition. Jacques Audiard directed. (Nov. 13; Netflix)
'ALL WE IMAGINE AS LIGHT' This film from Payal Kapadia ("A Night of Knowing Nothing") was the first Indian feature to compete at Cannes in 30 years; it won the Grand Jury Prize, effectively second place. It concerns two women (Kani Kusruti and Divya Prabha) in Mumbai. One has a husband living abroad; the other is navigating an interfaith relationship that she strives to keep quiet. (Nov. 15; in theaters)
'HERETIC' In a rare villainous role, Hugh Grant plays a man who traps a pair of missionaries (Sophie Thatcher and Chloe East) and subjects them to a test of faith that sounds more like something that Jigsaw would devise than a spiritual debate. (Nov. 15; in theaters)
'GLADIATOR II' Were you not entertained?!? That is the question posed by Ridley Scott's sequel to "Gladiator" nearly a quarter century later. Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal and Denzel Washington are among the stars populating Scott's vision of antiquity. (Nov. 22; in theaters)
'THE PIANO LESSON' Samuel L. Jackson and John David Washington reprise the roles they played on Broadway two years ago -- an uncle and nephew in a family torn over the fate of a piano with a history -- in this screen adaptation of August Wilson's Pulitzer-winning play. Danielle Deadwyler also stars. Malcolm Washington (John David's brother) directed. (Nov. 22; Netflix)
'WICKED' Cynthia Erivo (as Elphaba) and Ariana Grande (as Glinda) try to defy the recent box-office gravity for musicals in this adaptation of the long-running Broadway smash, a "Wizard of Oz" origin story. Jon M. Chu ("In the Heights") directed what is planned as the first of two movies. (Nov. 22; in theaters)
'MOANA 2' There's just no telling how far she'll go. Moana (voiced by Auli'i Cravalho) ventures a great distance in this sequel to the 2016 animated hit; Dwayne Johnson is back as well. Lin-Manuel Miranda didn't do the songs this time, however; the music is by Abigail Barlow, Emily Bear, Opetaia Foa'i and Mark Mancina. (Nov. 27; in theaters)
'THE SEED OF THE SACRED FIG' Mohammad Rasoulof attended the Cannes premiere of his film in May less than two weeks after announcing on Instagram that he had escaped Iran, where he had been sentenced to prison for his filmmaking. The movie itself is a tense drama about the political tensions within a family after the father is appointed an investigating judge. (Nov. 27; in theaters)
December
'NIGHTBITCH' Amy Adams plays a mother who gets in touch with newly discovered canine instincts in this adaptation of the novel by Rachel Yoder. Scoot McNairy and Jessica Harper co-star; Marielle Heller ("Can You Ever Forgive Me?") directed. (Dec. 6; in theaters)
'KRAVEN THE HUNTER' Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the titular Spider-Man nemesis, before meeting the superhero, in the latest installment of Marvel's ever-expanding web of Spidey sagas. Russell Crowe plays Kraven's dad. Ariana DeBose also stars. J.C. Chandor ("All Is Lost") directed. (Dec. 13; in theaters)
'THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE WAR OF THE ROHIRRIM' Peter Jackson returns to Tolkien land -- but strictly as executive producer. This animated feature is set more than a century before the other "Lord of the Rings" films at the fortress not yet known as Helm's Deep. (Dec. 13; in theaters)
'ON BECOMING A GUINEA FOWL' In Zambia, as a death reverberates through an extended family, the deceased's relatives begin to spill secrets they never spoke of when he was alive. Rungano Nyoni ("I Am Not a Witch") directed this Cannes favorite, whose title alludes to the titular bird's distinctive way of issuing warnings. (Dec. 13; in theaters)
'MUFASA: THE LION KING' Ah, here's Lin-Manuel Miranda: He wrote the songs for this prequel to the 2019 version of "The Lion King." The new movie, which also uses photorealistic animation, tells the story of how the orphan Mufasa (voiced by Aaron Pierre) came to be king. Blue Ivy Carter and Kelvin Harrison Jr. also star. Barry Jenkins directed. (Dec. 20; in theaters)
'BETTER MAN' Michael Gracey ("The Greatest Showman") directed this musical biopic of the British singer Robbie Williams. (Dec. 25; in theaters)
'A COMPLETE UNKNOWN' Timothée Chalamet has the hair to play Bob Dylan; all he needs is the voice. James Mangold ("Walk the Line") directed this biopic, which also stars Elle Fanning, Monica Barbaro (as Joan Baez) and Edward Norton (as Pete Seeger). (Dec. 25; in theaters)
'THE FIRE INSIDE' Barry Jenkins wrote the screenplay for this biographical film about the boxing and mixed martial arts star Claressa Shields, played by Ryan Destiny. Brian Tyree Henry also stars. The cinematographer Rachel Morrison ("Mudbound") directed. (Dec. 25; in theaters)
'NOSFERATU' Can you revive something that's undead? Robert Eggers ("The Northman") updates the vampire lineage that gave us at least two great films, F.W. Murnau's "Nosferatu" (1922) and Werner Herzog's "Nosferatu the Vampyre" (1979). Bill Skarsgard embodies the bloodsucker of the title. Willem Dafoe, who played Murnau's star, Max Schreck, in "Shadow of the Vampire," here shifts to a professorial role. (Dec. 25; in theaters)

Hardships and Challenges Don't Stop This Couple: [Society Desk]

Full text: Elizabeth Higgins Clark and Lauren Pomerantz endured quite a bit of grief after their 2018 wedding. Despite times of doubt, loneliness and loss, their relationship remained strong.
The last time Elizabeth Higgins Clark's family gathered for a celebratory event was at her wedding to Lauren Pomerantz on May 27, 2018.
Then came the unexpected bereavements, including a miscarriage.
"Over the past six years there have been wonderful gains, but severe losses, including the death of six family members," Ms. Clark said. The first was Ms. Clark's grandmother, the best-selling mystery author, Mary Higgins Clark, in 2020.
It was at her four-acre home in Saddle River, N.J., where the couple were married. Ms. Clark's aunt, Marilyn C. Clark, a New Jersey Superior Court judge, officiated.
"I found a photo recently and I was the only living person in it, which was unsettling," said Ms. Clark, 40. "I felt my own mortality."
Like many couples, their relationship started with a swipe. In August 2015, Ms. Pomerantz, then 35, an Emmy-winning writer and producer, matched on Tinder with Ms. Clark, then 31, also a writer. Both grew up in New Jersey, about an hour away from each other, and were now living in Los Angeles. Ms. Pomerantz, now 44, was new to Tinder and newly out; Ms. Clark, was not new to either.
Over the next two years, their relationship moved thoughtfully. Cautiously. Wonderfully.
After their wedding in 2018, they returned to Los Angeles. Ms. Pomerantz continued writing for "The Ellen Show"; Ms. Clark for "Spinning Out," a competitive figure skating drama for Netflix.
Ms. Pomerantz said 2018 was "filled with fun, freedom and love." She added, "Elizabeth was the first woman I dated. She was my person. Once I met her, everything made sense."
For Ms. Clark, marriage gave the couple stability. "Before, I had a tendency to catastrophize something being over if we got into a fight, as if there were no way forward," she said. "Now those thoughts aren't there."
The following year, they honeymooned in South Africa. Ms. Pomerantz turned 40. They purchased a three-bedroom, French Normandy storybook house in Los Feliz, Calif.
"That was a milestone, and brought feelings that big things would happen here," Ms. Clark said.
The couple started to plan for a family, and in October 2019, Ms. Clark began intrauterine insemination, or I.U.I. By November, she was pregnant.
2019 was euphoric; 2020 was not.
In January, while Ms. Pomerantz attended a friend's wedding in Mexico, Ms. Clark, who purposely stayed behind because of the Zika virus, had a miscarriage.
"It was the most traumatic thing that had ever happened to me. The only person I wanted to go through it with was Lauren, and she couldn't get a flight back. I was alone with this huge emptiness," she said.
"It was horrible," Ms. Pomerantz said. "We stayed home, laid in bed together for days crying and trying to process."
That same month, Ms. Clark's grandmother died.
The couple were racing through the Atlanta airport in hopes of making their connecting flight to Naples, Fla., to see her grandmother, when they got the news she had died.
"We were on the escalator and Elizabeth broke down," Ms. Pomerantz said. "I felt helpless but grateful we were going through this together. That she wasn't alone this time. That was part of marriage to me."
Covid entered like a tsunami. The pair remained in their new house, moving through their grief.
"I was terrified. It was challenging, but we fell deeper in love," said Ms. Pomerantz, a self-proclaimed germaphobe. "We learned a lot about each other."
In April, despite paralyzing pandemic fears and still devastated by the miscarriage, they returned to the fertility center once it reopened. Six months after several rounds of failed I.U.I.s, they switched doctors and procedures, to in vitro fertilization, or I.V.F.
"Because of Covid, I couldn't be with Elizabeth to hold her hand and be supportive," said Ms. Pomerantz, who described feeling alienated, excluded and disconnected from the experience because of the circumstances. "I was scared for her. I knew she couldn't go through another miscarriage."
In November, after being told they had a single-digit chance of having twins, they agreed to implant two embryos. A month later, when the blood test said Ms. Clark was pregnant, they were cautiously optimistic. When the ultrasound revealed two heartbeats, they were warned about vanishing twin syndrome, a condition in which one of the fetuses dies in utero and is then partially or completely reabsorbed, and told not to purchase a double stroller just yet.
They did the only thing they could: They held onto hope and each other.
Ms. Pomerantz returned to work, and Ms. Clark continued sheltering in place, recalling this period as lonely and isolating. "Once you lose one pregnancy, you don't expect the next one to go well," she said. "I held my breath at every appointment."
By the spring of 2021, their caution proved justifiable. At 25 weeks, Ms. Clark's ultrasound revealed that one fetus's placenta was not attached correctly, and warned that the fetuses, which weighed just over one pound each, may not come to full term. Then, while leaving her doctor's office, Ms. Clark found out her grandfather had died.
Care and bedrest proved somewhat helpful. On June 1, 2021, at just 34 weeks, Ms. Clark delivered Freddy and Emma by emergency C-section. After eight days in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU, the twins were able to go home.
"The first year was joyous, but so hard. The volume of work was exhausting. There was no sense of catching up and everything was nonstop," Ms. Clark said.
Of their parenting partnership, Ms. Pomerantz said, "I teach the kids caution; Elizabeth teaches them adventure. She lives life the way it's meant to be lived; I'm teaching them not to sit on the bed in street clothes."
As their children grew, so did Ms. Pomerantz's career. Dakota Johnson agreed to star in her screenplay, "Am I OK?" which Ms. Pomerantz wrote and produced, and which aired on MAX in 2024. Ms. Pomerantz also became an executive producer for "Strange Planet" for Apple.
To celebrate Freddy and Emma's first birthday in June 2022, the foursome migrated to New Jersey so the children could connect with their grandparents and cousins, many of whom they had not met. A trip to Dennis, Mass., on Cape Cod followed in July. That was the first time Ms. Clark said she felt normal since her miscarriage and her grandmother's death. "My anxiety and feelings of isolation started to lift," she said. I finally exhaled from January 2020."
Talk of moving East surfaced. The couple attended open houses with a broker. They wanted a community with same-sex couples near their families. In September 2022, Ms. Clark found a house on Zillow in Montclair, N.J., 30 minutes from her parents, who saw the property for them. A week later, Ms. Clark and Ms. Pomerantz purchased it sight unseen.
East coasters by birth, splitting their time now between Los Angeles and New Jersey was an easy adjustment.
"We have incredible friends in L.A. who are like family and helped us transition into parenthood, but it's different than having grandparents who want to babysit or having first cousins to play with," Ms. Clark said. "I have parents in their 70s; my brother has special needs. I'm their only other child. Our kids' upbringing became the priority."
With all their losses, losing each other has not been one of them.
"I fell in love with Lauren as my wife, but now differently as a parent," Ms. Clark added. "We came from strong families that we were close to, but this is our family now. We have prioritized our relationship and made sure to keep dating each other through parenthood."
For the first time, the pair is working, writing and producing together on two projects: a puppet series for preschoolers called "Wooby & Fotty," shown on YouTube and a one-hour crime drama about a grandmother and granddaughter crime-solving team based on Mary Higgins Clark's books.

Full text: On a morning in mid-August, a breeze stirred Central Park's midsummer leaves. Children skipped, dogs lolloped, a bunny peeked out from a hedge near the Great Lawn while a nearby saxophone ruined "Isn't She Lovely." It was a very nice day to fall in love.
The actors Kit Connor and Rachel Zegler were there, hiking up to Belvedere Castle and then down to the Shakespeare Garden. Connor, 20, and Zegler, 23, don't plan to fall in love. But the next day, at rehearsal, in Brooklyn they would discover how to make the characters they play fall desperately, terribly in love.
As the stars of the "Romeo + Juliet" that opens on Broadway on Oct. 24, they will die for love, they will die for each other, eight times a week. Both are making their Broadway debuts and both have the not exactly enviable task of making a 16th-century play with (apologies for centuries-old spoilers) a famously grim ending feel breath-catchingly new and vital.
Daunting? Not at all.
"It should be fun," Connor said, not without some anxiety. Zegler gave him a sardonic look. "It will be fun," he said.
Connor, a British star of the Netflix teen romance "Heartstopper," and Zegler, an American who made a thrilling film debut in Steven Spielberg's "West Side Story," had never met until March, shortly after they each agreed to star in the revival, dreamed up by the Tony-winning director Sam Gold, with music by Jack Antonoff. They had been offered the roles separately, without the benefit of a chemistry read. That spring day, Gold brought them to Circle in the Square Theater, where previews will start Sept. 26, then bought them cups of coffee at the Cosmic Diner.
Chemistry, Gold said, speaking now during a break rehearsal, is something a director can't predict. "Man, if I could guess that, I'd be more successful than I am," he said. "It's hard. I have failed at that before."
If Gold had failed again, if the March meeting had sputtered, they all might have gone their separate ways. "It was scary, when we first met," Connor said. He recalled hurrying in a few minutes late. "When you're meeting a romantic interest, you have to keep your fingers crossed because you just can't fake it. And when you do the greatest love story of all time -- "
"Oh, yeah," Zegler said, completing the sentence. "We should probably have chemistry."
Happily they did. Gold recalled an immediate effervescence, a sparkle under the diner's punishing lights. "They could have been scared, tentative, guarded," Gold said. "But it just felt super easy."
That was how it felt to Zegler and Connor, too -- an instantaneous comfort, a liking. "On first meeting, I was like, oh, we'll be fine," Zegler said.
This ease was not a surprise to the actors who have played Connor's and Zegler's love interests in past projects.
Joe Locke, a "Heartstopper" co-star, praised Connor's openness and vulnerability. "Kit made everything so easy," he said, adding, "It's hard not to fall in love with him," clarifying that this love was friendly rather than romantic.
Tom Blyth, Zegler's co-star in "The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes," described a similar connection. "It was very easy for us to portray love," he said. "Rachel has an ingénue thing about her, but she's not just an ingénue. She's wise beyond her years."
After their meet-cute at the diner, Zegler and Connor met again for a half day, in suburban New Jersey, to shoot a teaser trailer for the show, a moody music video, and then months later in London for a photo shoot, followed by a reading of the play. Gold joined them via a video chat, and he liked what he saw. "The two of them were off book, falling in love in this conference room," he said. "It was as if they started floating above their chairs, it was so good."
But competing movie shoots made any other hangouts impossible, so this morning, in Central Park, was their first chance to really get to know each other. Zegler had arrived early, as is her way, in matching Thom Browne separates and heeled loafers, which were not perhaps designed for the park's more rustic paths. Connor, a few minutes late, was in wide-legged jeans and a white shirt, with ripped shoulders.
"Yeah, I ripped them myself," Connor bantered. "On the way here. So nervous." Then he kidded Zegler for her rabbit-shaped purse. "I find that quite alarming," he said. "I don't like it at all."
"Don't be weird," Zegler said.
She had flown in the day before from Los Angeles; he'd arrived two days prior from London. He claimed not to feel jet lag. She did. She knew the park well, having often visited it when she was growing up in New Jersey. He'd been once and hadn't cared for it -- too curated, too crowded. They headed up to the castle, a fantastical former meteorology station. "It's very Disney," Connor said. "I love America."
In the Shakespeare Garden, Connor pointed out Ophelia's flowers. Zegler led them onto a path that accidentally trespassed on the construction site for the Delacorte Theater. Suddenly, a helicopter thwapped overhead.
"Kit, they know you're here," Zegler said.
"They follow me everywhere," Connor fake-sighed.
Together, the actors seemed more like longtime friends than brand-new ones, with an energy more akin to big sister and little brother than star-crossed lovers. With luck and the hard work of rehearsal, that energy would change. They had some trepidation (Zegler: "I hope I don't let him down"), but mostly they trusted the script, the process, each other.
"I can joke with you, which is nice," Zegler said to Connor. "If I can't joke with you, how are we going to fall in love every night to the point that makes us suicidal?"
"It's really important that the two of us have trust and intimacy," Connor added. "It's nice that we have a level of safety."
Safety was a good thing. Both were suffering from some degree of Shakespeare-induced impostor syndrome. "I'm not actually meant to be here," Zegler said. "I am meant to be doing my high school production of 'Shrek' until I die."
Connor, whose only previous flirtation with Shakespeare was an extremely minor part in the play within a play in "Hamlet," felt the same. "You feel a sense of, 'Am I cut out for this?"' Connor said. And in an intimate theater like Circle in the Square, which plays mostly in the round, there is nowhere for an actor to hide.
But that fear has an upside. It would give their performance a newness, a freshness. In casting the play, Gold had sought actors, he said, "who could make the audience feel the first-timeness of their love story. It's really important that this feels like these are kids who have never experienced before, the things they're experiencing." (He joked that working with actors this young "is getting me out of my midlife crisis.")
Of course, Zegler and Connor, have experienced these things before, in performance and in life. Maria of "West Side Story" is modeled on Juliet, and Lucy of "Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" has a lot of the character in her too. Nick on "Heartstopper" is a version of a Romeo. And each is young enough to recall, vividly, the intensity of real first love.
"First love is rough," Connor said.
"It's like a rite of passage," Zegler added.
"These feelings, they were world ending."
"Really."
They don't expect to feel anything quite as intense in rehearsal or performance. If feelings do arise, each has an outlet -- songwriting for her, poetry for him. (Locke had confirmed this: "He's the most textbook Romeo. He writes poems, for God's sake.") And if their emotions overflow those containers, well, they can just put that into their performances.
"If you have a bit of spillover, save it for the next night," Connor said.
"Spillover is good for the yearning," said Zegler.
Connor misheard "yearning" as "urinating," which provoked general laughter.
So for now, there was no spillover, no tragedy, no sorrow, sweet or sour -- just a lot of affectionate ribbing, mostly from Zegler. When Connor mentioned a book he'd recently read, she lightly trolled him, "You read? Wow." There was more teasing about his haircut and his shirt. Connor took it in good humor.
After the castle and the Shakespeare Garden and the trespassing, Zegler and Connor wended their way down to the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater, clowning on the offered play, a puppet show about a cow. They were buoyant, breezy, ready to begin the work of falling in love. Maybe this time it would end well for Juliet and Romeo, they joked.
"Thank God we don't die at the end," Connor said.
"Thank God we have a happy ending," said Zegler.
"That's what sets our production aside," Connor said.

Fee Dispute With Disney Shows Perils Of DirectTV: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: While the cable TV business is declining quickly, satellite TV is decaying even faster.
It's no secret that the TV business is in upheaval. And in the sea of struggling companies, satellite TV distributors may be in the most precarious position.
That unforgiving economic reality has been thrown into sharp relief by a bitter dispute between DirecTV and Disney that has dragged on over the past two weeks.
In many ways, the two businesses are engaged in a routine fight between a television programming company and its distributor that results in a service disruption. In this case, many of the satellite provider's roughly 11 million customers haven't been able to watch popular programs like the U.S. Open and Monday Night Football.
But DirecTV has significantly less negotiating leverage than its competitors in traditional TV. That's because satellite companies don't have the same hook to retain customers when the channels go dark: internet access.
Unlike Comcast and Charter -- U.S. cable TV heavyweights whose businesses are anchored by broadband internet access -- satellite TV companies like DirecTV and Dish are primarily TV services, making it easier for customers to cancel in favor of streaming alternatives like YouTube TV, Hulu Live+TV or Fubo, a sports-focused streaming service.
Satellite TV's other disadvantage: Unlike cable TV, basic satellite TV technology does not allow viewers to watch content on demand. Instead it offers a large menu of shows and movies, with the option to record with a DVR. But satellite TV still resembles a traditional broadcaster and is out-of-step with the current era of streaming video.
"Satellite started to lose ground to cable even before cord-cutting," said Craig Moffett, an analyst for MoffettNathanson. "Then subscription-video-on-demand models like Netflix really started to take off. Once they did, everybody was at a disadvantage. But satellite is particularly disadvantaged."
The numbers bear out a dire situation for satellite TV. Just 13 million U.S. households subscribe to it, a decrease of about 15.3 percent from last year, according to figures from MoffettNathanson. (Cable TV subscriptions fell 11.2 percent from the previous year, to about 33 million U.S. households.)
DirecTV, which is owned by AT&T and the private-equity firm TPG, is among the biggest satellite TV providers in the United States, alongside Dish Network. In a nod to the rising power of streaming services, DirecTV also sells an on-demand TV service, DirecTV Stream, which offers subscribers access to a bundle of channels without a satellite dish. The company recently told customers it was raising its prices for DirecTV Stream to "remain competitive in the marketplace."
A spokesman for DirecTV referred The New York Times to remarks from its chief financial officer, Ray Carpenter, who acknowledged on a call with analysts last week that competitors like Charter have "other products that they can sell," adding that DirecTV needs "something that is going to work for the long-term sustainability of our video customers."
"It doesn't mean that we're not going to work as hard as we can to find some sort of agreement," Mr. Carpenter said, "but we definitely did not go into this thinking, let's just see how much of this we could leverage before the Monday Night Football game comes around, and then we'll make a deal."
DirecTV also said in a statement that it had made "considerable progress" in its negotiations with Disney on issues including market rates and "the ability to offer smaller, more flexible packages."
As is customary in such contract disputes, both Disney and DirecTV have blamed the other side for the recent outage. Disney has said that DirecTV "undervalues our portfolio of television channels," depriving customers of must-see programming like the National Football League. DirecTV has argued that Disney wants to charge traditional TV customers more money for less content, pointing to the company's considerable investment in streaming services like Disney+.
"Consumer frustration is at an all-time high as Disney shifts its best producers, most innovative shows, top teams, conferences, and entire leagues to their direct-to-consumer services while making customers pay more than once for the same programming on multiple Disney platforms," said Rob Thun, DirecTV's chief content officer. "Disney's only magic is forcing prices to go up while simultaneously making its content disappear."
Though disputes between TV providers and media companies like Disney happen regularly, the outage with DirecTV has been notable, in part, because of the programs that haven't been made available.
On Sunday, DirecTV filed a lawsuit against Disney claiming that the company was forcing providers to pay for a bundle of channels that includes "less desirable" programming, while offering its Disney+ subscribers a smaller bundle that they actually want.
Despite the inflammatory rhetoric, the dust-up between Disney and DirecTV may soon be over. Entertainment companies usually reach a deal with their traditional TV customers within a few weeks, partly because long-term outages aren't good for either side. Deals with satellite TV companies are still highly profitable for companies like Disney, and DirecTV needs ESPN to keep its customers happy.
Last year, Disney reached a deal with Charter after channels went dark for roughly a week, agreeing to offer Charter's customers streaming subscriptions at a wholesale rate. The only questions this year are whether the two sides will reach an agreement before DirecTV's customer losses begin piling up -- and how long satellite TV can put off the inevitable decline of its business.

John Mulaney to Star on Broadway in a New Comedy About Love: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: "All In: Comedy About Love," a new play by Simon Rich, includes a celebrity cast taking on the roles of pirates, dogs and other zany characters.
John Mulaney is coming back to Broadway.
The comedian will star in a new play, "All In: Comedy About Love," staged as vignettes about relationships, marriage and heartbreak and written by the humorist Simon Rich, Mulaney's former "Saturday Night Live" collaborator.
The production, set to feature a rotating group of actors, will be directed by Alex Timbers, who helmed Mulaney's most recent Netflix special, "Baby J," as well as his Broadway debut, the 2016 comedy "Oh, Hello on Broadway."
"It's a weird fantasy camp of things I always wanted to do with my very good friends," Mulaney said in a video interview.
The comedian, who has two Emmy Awards for his stand-up specials "Kid Gorgeous" and "Baby J," will lead an ensemble cast of four actors portraying pirates, the Elephant Man, dogs looking for love and other characters: Initially, Mulaney will be joined by Richard Kind ("Spin City," "Mad About You"), Renée Elise Goldsberry ("Hamilton," "Girls5eva") and the "S.N.L." alum Fred Armisen.
"We jump around between eras and countries and species, but they're all love stories," said Rich, a former "S.N.L." writer who is making his Broadway debut with the play, which is adapted largely from tales that have previously been published in his 10 short story collections and in The New Yorker.
The idea for the show, which will also feature songs from the indie band the Magnetic Fields, came about when Timbers approached Rich about adapting some of his short stories for the stage. And once Mulaney, who first met Rich when they were writing partners on "S.N.L." from 2008-11, was on board, the built-in rapport between the two proved irresistible, Timbers said.
"It was a chance to work with two heroes," said Timbers, who won a Tony Award for his direction of "Moulin Rouge! The Musical."
"All In" is a return to the theatrical stage for Mulaney. His performance as the elderly Upper West Sider George St. Geegland in "Oh, Hello" -- a show he wrote and performed with a fellow comedian, Nick Kroll -- was critically acclaimed.
"There's an underserved audience for comedy on Broadway, and comedy that really speaks to the taste and style of today," Timbers said, adding that the show "also has this incredible heart."
The production, which is slated to run for 10 weeks, will begin performances on Dec. 11 at the Hudson Theater, with an opening night yet to be announced. Mulaney, Kind and Armisen are set to be in the show through Jan. 12. Goldsberry will perform through Dec. 30, with the "S.N.L." comedian Chloe Fineman taking over from Jan. 2 through Jan. 12. Casting for the rest of the run will be announced later.
The show is being produced by Seaview and the "S.N.L." creator and producer Lorne Michaels, who was also a producer of the Broadway premieres of the Tom Stoppard play "Leopoldstadt" and the musical adaptation of "Mean Girls," in association with New Yorker Studios.
"There's something so exciting about doing something this funny around the holidays, all together," Mulaney said. "It's an enormously gratifying thing."

Lincoln Center Theater Chooses a New Leadership Team: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: DeBessonet, currently the artistic director of Encores!, will work alongside Bartlett Sher, who will serve as executive producer.
Lincoln Center Theater, a leading nonprofit theater with a long track record of producing luxe Broadway musical revivals as well as contemporary plays, has chosen new leadership for the first time in more than three decades.
The theater's next artistic director will be Lear deBessonet, 44, a stage director who specializes in musical revivals as the artistic director of the Encores! program at New York City Center. DeBessonet will succeed André Bishop, who has led Lincoln Center Theater since 1992, most recently with the title of producing artistic director; he is retiring in June.
DeBessonet will work with Bartlett Sher, 65, a Tony-winning director who is a resident director at the organization, and who will now assume the title of executive producer. DeBessonet will select and oversee the theater's shows and its day-to-day operations; Sher will focus on strategic planning, fund-raising and global partnerships. They will both report to the board's chairman, Kewsong Lee.
In an interview, DeBessonet said that "there is no greater job I can imagine" than running Lincoln Center Theater. "The American theater is the great passion of my life," she said. "I've wanted to be a director and to run a theater since I was a 5-year-old in Baton Rouge."
The changes come amid a tidal wave of turnover throughout the American theater, prompted by a variety of factors, including the retirements of many regional and Off Broadway theater pioneers, as well as the ousters of some leaders who lost support. Across the industry, leaders are facing a new reality: These jobs have become increasingly challenging as nonprofits face rising costs, dwindled audiences, pressures to feature programming that advances social justice but also sells tickets, and changing entertainment consumption habits.
Lincoln Center Theater, with an annual budget of about $ 40 million and about 55 employees, says it is financially healthy at a time when much of the industry is struggling.
"Lincoln Center Theater is the pre-eminent not-for-profit theater in America, with the good fortune of a significant endowment and strong resources," said Lee, the board chairman. "We are in great shape, but not immune to the difficulties the industry is facing, which is why it's so important for our new leadership to enable us to evolve and change."
The theater's Tony-winning productions have included revivals of the musicals "The King and I" and "South Pacific" and stagings of the plays "Oslo" and "The Coast of Utopia." Its newest Broadway production, "McNeal," an A.I.-themed play starring Robert Downey Jr., is now in previews.
It has the only Broadway stage that is not located in Midtown -- the Vivian Beaumont, which is at the Lincoln Center campus on the Upper West Side. The organization also has an Off Broadway stage, the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, and a rooftop Off Off Broadway venue, the Claire Tow Theater.
DeBessonet, a native of Baton Rouge, La., is a longtime proponent of the idea that theater can create community and further social change. This interest led her to create the Public Theater's Public Works program: musical pageants adapted from classic works and featuring a mix of professional and amateur performers. Many of those productions, often staged outdoors around Labor Day, have been artistic successes, and the program has been adopted by other theaters around the country and in Britain.
Her tenure at Encores! has been a bit of a roller coaster. She started in 2020, at the height of the pandemic, and her earliest productions underwhelmed critics and alienated some audience members who felt that politics was being prioritized over storytelling. But she found her footing with a rapturously received revival of "Into the Woods" that transferred to Broadway, and followed that with one success after another; her Encores! production of "Once Upon a Mattress" is now running on Broadway. She has committed to directing one more production for City Center: A starry revival of "Ragtime" this fall.
In recent years she has become ever more interested in the idea that the arts can create public health benefits, and she conceived this summer's 18-city Arts for EveryBody project, modeled after the Federal Theater Project.
What does she hope to accomplish at Lincoln Center Theater? "I feel very passionate about holding strong to the great legacy André has created," she said, "producing new plays, new musicals, revivals and classics, in a rich balance." She also hopes to focus on "creating theater that is an event -- that is unmistakably different than watching Netflix on your couch."
She said she will seek to expand, but not replace, the theater's audience. "People create a false binary: 'Do you want to retain the audience that's there or find a new audience?"' she said. "I want every person that has come to Lincoln Center Theater before to keep coming and to find satisfaction and delight, and I also want to continue to widen the embrace. I don't see those things as oppositional."
Sher, who has been directing at Lincoln Center Theater for two decades and who has been on staff for 15 years, said, "I'm primarily here to support Lear." He said he believes that his experience will allow him to provide a measure of continuity as the leadership changes, and also said he wants to "give back" to the theater industry by helping secure its financial position.
Both deBessonet and Sher said they expect to continue to direct shows.
Lincoln Center Theater is one of four nonprofits that have their own Broadway houses, and is the second of those to name new leadership this year. Second Stage Theater recently named Evan Cabnet (who previously ran Lincoln Center Theater's Off Off Broadway programming) as its new artistic director, following the 45-year tenure of Carole Rothman; Roundabout Theater Company is expected soon to name a successor to Todd Haimes, who ran that theater for 40 years until his death last year. Manhattan Theater Club continues to be led by Lynne Meadow, who has run that organization for more than 50 years.

Full text: The frothy Netflix show frustrated Parisians with its portrait of their city. Now its heroine is heading to Rome -- and the showrunner doesn't care if residents there feel the same way.
"Emily in Paris," the hit Netflix series about a young American living a life of romance and luxury in France, has ignited a blaze of indignation since it premiered in late 2020.
Emily's clumsy grasp of the native tongue, brash designer clothes and exaggerated encounters with dashing chefs and flamboyant artists left some Parisians irate and American expatriates embarrassed, even as it became one of Netflix's most popular comedies.
Now in its fourth season -- split into two installments, with the second arriving Thursday -- the show continues to both charm and vex with its sunny vision of what the French newspaper Liberation has called "Disneyland Paris."
But in the new batch of episodes, Emily (Lily Collins) departs Paris and heads to Rome. Invited by her new Italian love interest Marcello (Eugenio Franceschini), she zooms around on his scooter, offering a picture-postcard view of the Eternal City with stops at touristic hallmarks like the Trevi Fountain, the Colosseum and the Spanish Steps. As he entices Emily to move on to a new European capital, Marcello makes a pitch that doubles as the season's mandate: "Forget about crepes. We'll be eating pizza."
Darren Star, the creator and showrunner of "Emily in Paris," said that Emily "was becoming very comfortable in Paris. I wanted to throw her into some unfamiliar waters." He added that "we were able to live Emily's life in Paris, and now we're going to do the same thing in Rome."
The show's depiction of Rome is about as romantic as it gets: gleaming arches, ruins at golden hour and plate after plate of Parma ham and carbonara, with none of the grime, litter and graffiti that are equal parts of the real Roman experience.
Many other Italian archetypes abound in the episodes, including food-loving nonnas and men who exclaim "bellissima!" at passing women. The series also channels classic Italian iconography through homages to films like "Roman Holiday" (as well as one of Emily's less esteemed favorites, "The Lizzie McGuire Movie," also set in Rome).
As Emily exclaims shortly after her arrival, eating a heaped cup of gelato, "Look around us! Isn't this amazing?" Star said this was all was by design. "We ran with the beauty of the city of Rome," he said. "I'm not trying to depict Rome as the overcrowded, garbage strewn, graffiti infested place -- that's not the Rome that Emily is experiencing."
It remains to be seen whether this romanticized portrayal will impress native Romans, or if they, like Parisians before them, will be offended by the one-dimensional sketch. Will scenes of Emily tossing coins into the Trevi, musical cues like "Mambo Italiano" and references to movies like "La Dolce Vita" and "Gladiator" endear Italians? Either way, Star insisted that he doesn't care. "I'm not concerned with that," he said of possible objections from Italian viewers. "I don't really take those criticisms to heart.."
Italy was a particular draw for Star, he said, for its deep connection to the fashion industry, which made the move feel "organic," given Emily's work in that field. But he also felt that the cultural differences between Italy and France would make for an interesting tension: there's "a certain warmth" that Italians have, Star said, that the French do not: a "family feeling" that he wanted Emily to experience.
The longstanding cultural rivalry between France and Italy also seemed "fun to play with," Star said. Emily's French boss Sylvie (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu) has a fraught history with Italy, which has been foreshadowed since the second season, and that connection shapes the action as it unfolds.
The showrunner always had it in the back of his mind that Emily might travel to a different city, he said. "People that live in cities in Europe, they leave their city," Star said, "they're not just sitting in Paris and never leaving Paris." To that end, Emily in Rome -- or elsewhere in the European Union -- was perhaps something of an inevitability.
With only two full episodes in Rome, Star said these new episodes "really only scratched the surface of telling the story of Emily in Rome, or Emily in Italy." Should the show be renewed for a fifth season, he might have the chance to explore further: the season ends with the suggestion that Emily's time in Italy is far from over.
Still, Star made it clear that "Emily in Paris" isn't moving permanently. "Paris is not done," he said. "She doesn't change her Instagram handle to @emilyinrome. I think the show still has its feet firmly planted in Paris." That might mean "Emily in Paris" will prove to be a more adventurous, city-hopping adventure in the future.
It also means that frustrated Parisians aren't free of Emily just yet.

Full text: This specialty streamer offers live TV along with a robust collection of free, ad-supported movies.
If we're being honest, the streaming app that your correspondent uses most -- more than Netflix or Amazon Prime or Hulu, and more than any of the less-recognizable subscription streamers we've previously spotlighted here -- is Plex, though for reasons owing less to its current iteration than to its humble beginnings.
Plex launched in the late 2000s as free media-server software, allowing its users to set up a client-server on either their home computer or on a network-attached storage device for their personal libraries of movies, television episodes and music. Setup and integration are fairly simple, and once the app has been directed to the user's files, it matches titles to its database of films and shows, which can be streamed to a variety of devices (including Roku, Apple TV, Amazon Fire and smart TVs). Best of all, you can share your libraries with friends, and vice versa, for either individual or "watch together" viewing. It's a nifty way to watch whatever you want, wherever you want -- for free, at least in its basic form. (The paid "Plex Pass" offers additional bells and whistles.)
Of course, it's difficult for a service to make money functioning solely as a free app for personal streaming, so Plex began expanding its offerings and utility in recent years. In 2019, the app added live TV streaming and DVR functionality, allowing its users the option of full-on cord cutting for an additional monthly fee. The following year, Plex introduced its ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) streaming service and free-to-stream live TV channels. As with Tubi, Pluto TV and other AVOD services, the automated commercial breaks aren't always executed with finesse; the breaks sometimes fall mid-scene, or even midsentence. But it's hard to complain when it comes with a $ 0 price tag.
This February, Plex launched another feature: a VOD rental service, allowing viewers to shell out a few bucks to stream new releases in the app, rather than in Amazon, Apple or Vudu. Sure, it's a revenue-generator, but it also helps make Plex, in its own words, something of a concierge service. With the "Universal Watchlist" function, you tell the app which streaming services you use, and thereafter, whenever you add a movie or show to your watchlist, it will show you where to find it: via one of your other services, in a media library (yours or a friend's) or through Plex's own AVOD or VOD portals. It essentially makes the app the center of your streaming universe, and in an increasingly convoluted digital media landscape, that's a useful function indeed.
Here are a few highlights from their current AVOD offerings:
'Master of the Flying Guillotine': This 1976 wuxia epic from the writer, director and star Jimmy Wang Yu is one of the era's most beloved martial arts extravaganzas. Technically a sequel to Wang Yu's smash "One-Armed Boxer" from the previous year, this tale of a blind warrior seeking revenge against Wang Yu's antihero is full of clever innovations and complications in its plentiful action sequences. Most impressively, the filmmaker shoots his action scenes the way a fighter fights, up close and personal, with the graceful camera right in the middle of the bone-cracking action.
'I'm Not There': With the James Mangold-directed Bob Dylan biopic "A Complete Unknown" hitting theaters at Christmas, here's your periodic reminder that there's already a fabulous Dylan movie out in the world -- albeit one perhaps too experimental and elliptical for the current cradle-to-grave iteration of the form. The director Todd Haynes instead adopted an approach mirroring the chameleonic nature of his subject, casting six different actors (of varying races and sexes) to play the singer-songwriter at various points of his colorful life, in shifting cinematic styles. The result is a picture as unpredictable, exhilarating and occasionally baffling as the figure at its center.
'BPM (Beats Per Minute)': The 2017 winner of the Cannes Grand Prix, this fierce and ferocious docudrama tells the story of the Paris chapter of the activist group Act Up, and its actions protesting government officials, pharmaceutical executives and public apathy toward AIDS patients in the 1990s. Much of that work is planned in the group's meetings and strategy sessions -- heated, passionate and complicated combinations of brainstorming and conflict resolution. In that way, the film is a process picture, and a fascinating one, but the writer and director Robin Campillo makes room for the tender stories of what happens outside of those rooms, and how the urgency of both halves of these activists' lives begin to blur. It's a tense, tough, candid dramatization of a fight where the stakes are truly life and death.
'Enemies, A Love Story': The director Paul Mazursky capped off a spectacular run of 1980s work with this tonally complex adaptation of Isaac Bashevis Singer's novel. Ron Silver (in perhaps his finest hour onscreen) stars as Herman Broder, a Holocaust survivor who has made a new life for himself in New York City circa 1949 -- more than one life, in fact, as he splits time between his wife (Malgorzata Zajaczkowska) in Coney Island and his mistress (Lena Olin) in the Bronx, an arrangement further complicated by the arrival of his presumed-dead, prewar wife, played with a seen-it-all wariness by Anjelica Huston. Mazursky, who wrote the script with Roger L. Simon, mines the comedy-of-manners (and outright farce) elements with expected grace, but he also lends proper weight to the morality of the tale, conjuring an underlying melancholy throughout, which surfaces adroitly in the affecting conclusion.
'QT8: The First Eight': The director Tara Wood's 2019 documentary covers, per its title, the filmography of Quentin Tarantino through "The Hateful Eight," via behind-the-scenes footage, copious clips and an impressive array of interviews (though not with the man himself, alas). It's not all softballs, thankfully, as she covers several of his controversies and the then-recent fall of his regular distributor and financier, Harvey Weinstein. But it offers plenty of context for fans both rabid and casual, cleverly adopting the director's cinematic trademarks (chapter headings, animations), and informatively breaking down his process.

They've Shed Some Light on the Dark Side: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: From "Beetlejuice" to its sequel, these are the actresses and roles that made us embrace the darkness.
Is it just fashion? No, it's an attitude, a lifestyle. And a beloved character type. The goth girl is the lovable-yet-scary outcast whose grim and ghastly exterior belies wit, smarts and a dry sense of humor that never fails to cast an honest light on the disappointing world around her. As "Beetlejuice Beetlejuice" brings together two generations of legendary goth girls -- Winona Ryder and Jenna Ortega -- we look at some of the actresses and roles that have defined the archetype since the original "Beetlejuice" in 1988.
Winona Ryder Sets the Standard
When Lydia Deetz appears in her family's new Connecticut home early in "Beetlejuice," she glances around curiously, her eyes wandering beneath her short, spiky black bangs, stopping at the sight of a spider in a web along the stairwell. Unlike her shallow, distracted parents, Lydia is clued in to the supernatural happenings of her new surroundings and has no trouble befriending the undead residents of the house.
The role was one of Winona Ryder's earliest in a career largely defined by goth girls and dark-attired outsiders. In the black comedy "Heathers," Ryder played Veronica Sawyer, the reluctant friend to the popular girls, who prance around in bright matching outfits. Veronica, however, dresses in blacks and grays and gets drawn into a string of homicides that leaves multiple teenagers dead.
Ryder came full circle with her role in the Netflix series "Stranger Things," where she plays Joyce Byers, an eccentric mom who gets entangled in the spooky occurrences in her town.
A Wednesday for a New Generation
There's deadpan, and then there's Wednesday Addams's deadpan. In the 1960s "Addams Family" series, Wednesday (played by Lisa Loring) is a cheery but macabre young girl, but the Wednesday in the "The Addams Family" is a few years older, doesn't smile and has developed a love for torture and destruction.
Though Christina Ricci is forever associated with the pigtailed sociopathic member of the Addams family, she has built a reputation for thriving in gothic roles even beyond Wednesday. Her other characters have befriended the undead ("Casper"), faced headless horsemen ("Sleepy Hollow"), joined satanic cults ("Bless the Child"), fought werewolves ("Cursed") and gotten away with a double homicide so famous it inspired nursery rhymes ("Lizzie Borden Took an Ax," "The Lizzie Borden Chronicles"). And in 2022 Ricci appeared as Marilyn Thornhill, the secret evil mastermind in "Wednesday," hearkening back to her own tenure as the titular character.
An Instant Cult Favorite
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
An essential entry in the grand tradition of goth-girl cinema, "The Craft" is a cult favorite in the vein of "Heathers" for its bleak portrayal of teenage brutality -- but with the addition of dark magic. Of this junior coven of witches, who each have their own goth moments, Nancy Downs, played by Fairuza Balk, is the epitome of anarchic doom-and-gloom goth energy. There are the usual telltale signs of her role as goth queen -- the heavy eyeliner and severe lipstick, religious accessories like cross pendants and rosaries -- but her story arc, which includes her megalomaniacal ascension to god-level powers, ends with her left powerless and in a straitjacket.
The Difference Between Alt and Goth
Sure, Daria Morgendorfer and Jane Lane, the leading ladies of "Daria," the bone-dry, peak-MTV-era animated satirical comedy series, are prime examples of alt girls, but it's Andrea (that's pronounced An-DRAY-uh) who's the actual goth girl outsider of the show. Black hair, black makeup, fishnet accessories and an ankh necklace -- Andrea certainly has the goth look but mostly serves as a background character in a series that parodies every imaginable teen stereotype. But in the fourth episode of Season 1, Andrea shows just how goth she can be by reciting a grim Emily Dickinson-esque poem at a coffeehouse open mic.
Prime-time TV's Happiest Goth
Abby Sciuto's outfits -- girlie, preppy goth style with skulls, spikes and platform combat boots -- and her job, on the "NCIS" forensics team, may seem morbid, but this upbeat science nerd's demeanor is far from it. This girl with a spider web tattoo loves her job as much as she loves thinking about death, gruesome biological incidents and the supernatural, and is described as "the happiest goth you'll ever meet." The character, portrayed by Pauly Perrette, was on the show for 15 seasons, and given the popularity of the long-running and much-beloved procedural drama, she became one of the defining goth girls of the 2000s -- and one of the best known goths on television, period.
She Wasn't Always a Prom Queen
She ended up a prom queen, but Tina Cohen-Chang of "Glee" certainly didn't start out that way. An original member of McKinley High School's glee club, Tina, played by Jenna Ushkowitz, was first introduced as a mall goth with a love for arm warmers and a fake speech impediment. Her goth wardrobe is so prominent that in one episode, the principal even bans Tina's dark attire because he fears she's a wannabe vampire.
Revenge of the Eurogoth
Lisbeth Salander, the no-nonsense antiheroine of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, is an asocial computer hacker and assault survivor who serves as a kind of vengeful reaper for men who abuse women.
While each adaptation of Lisbeth's character shares the same underground goth look, each of the three actresses who've embodied her gives her own variation on it: Noomi Rapace's Lisbeth pulls off a more hardened heavy-metal vibe, with dramatic sweeping bangs in the Swedish version of "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo." Rooney Mara's is a wispy uber-chic punk with shaved eyebrows, geometric haircuts and a vast collection of piercings in the American version from two years later, far-flung from Claire Foy's comparatively clean-cut and conservative Lisbeth in "The Girl in the Spider's Web" (2018).
Dark Humor
Goths are just like us! Kind of. Mundane-meets-macabre is the joke behind the goth skits in "Portlandia," where a performatively gothic couple played by Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein gets on with normal daily tasks, like shopping or renting a car, but with unusual twists. Jacqueline loves midnight, hearses, lace gloves, her collection of tears from a Scottish deerhound and her pet bat, Bella. She does not, however, love the dust left from the disintegrating animal skeletons in their apartment -- and unfortunately, as she finds out, her witches' brooms are really just ornamental.
Scream Queen Becomes Goth Queen
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Jenna Ortega was christened with the name "scream queen" after appearing as the character Tara Carpenter in the 2022 and 2023 "Scream" movie sequels, along with roles in horror-thrillers like "X" and "American Carnage."
She soon became most associated with the titular role in the much-loved Netflix series "Wednesday," where a teenage Wednesday Addams enrolls in the eldritch Nevermore Academy and solves mysteries while dealing with adolescent dramas. Ortega's deadpan rivals Ricci's in the role, with Ortega's rendering of Wednesday updated with some contemporary flair. Wednesday's famous dance scene in the series -- choreographed by Ortega, and inspired by actual goth dance moves -- in a Victorian black dress provoked an endless flurry of internet memes and impersonators. Now Ortega adds another entry into goth girl history with her role as Astrid Deetz in "Beetlejuice Beetlejuice."

How Mickey's Realm Became a 'Snake Pit': [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: At 5 p.m. on Feb. 25, 2020, Bob Chapek and Bob Iger settled into matching directors' chairs on the Disney studio lot for a series of live media interviews. The company had just shocked pretty much everybody by announcing that the little-known Mr. Chapek would be replacing the wildly popular Mr. Iger as chief executive.
The bald and stocky Mr. Chapek and the graying but still debonair Mr. Iger struck an immediate contrast, even though both were dressed in navy suits and open-collar white shirts and both were named Bob. To avoid confusion, some referred to them as "Bob One" and "Bob Two," or "Big Bob" and "Little Bob" (even though Mr. Chapek was taller and heavier). And then there was "Handsome Bob" and "Boring Bob."
In an interview with Julia Boorstin of CNBC, Mr. Chapek fawned over his predecessor. "I obviously have huge shoes to fill," he said with wide eyes, hailing Mr. Iger's "magic" running Disney. Mr. Iger's 15-year tenure as chief executive had been so successful that he had considered running for president as a Democrat. Queen Elizabeth II knighted him just before she died.
Mr. Iger said he and Mr. Chapek had worked together "extremely well," but in the next breath qualified that praise: "Actually, our senior management team has worked together quite well."
Mr. Chapek listened in vain for something more effusive, more personal.
As the questions -- and the attention -- shifted entirely to Mr. Chapek, Mr. Iger's usually relaxed demeanor stiffened. His gaze shifted down, away from Mr. Chapek, and he looked increasingly uncomfortable. He crossed his arms.
Mr. Chapek was intimately familiar with Mr. Iger's body language and expressions. "This is not good," he thought.
He was right about that. But little did he realize that he and Mr. Iger were about to face off in an epic corporate power struggle with few rivals in business history.
When Mr. Iger stepped down as chief executive -- abruptly, just weeks before the coronavirus pandemic plunged Disney into the worst crisis in its history -- the company's board agreed that he could stay on as "creative director" and executive chairman of the board for another two years.
That agreement nearly fell apart over the issue of whom, exactly, Mr. Chapek would answer to: Mr. Iger or the board. A last-minute compromise, reached without a board vote, had Mr. Chapek reporting to both. That proved a recipe for conflict -- as Mr. Chapek soon began to realize.
Just weeks into his tenure as chief executive, Mr. Chapek expressed frustration. "I can't survive another two years of this," Mr. Chapek told Arthur Bochner, his chief of staff. Mr. Iger is "not going to leave. He'll be here until he dies."
Mr. Bochner worried that Mr. Chapek would quit. Mr. Chapek was ultimately deprived of even that option. The board fired him just before Thanksgiving in 2022.
As he had feared, his successor was Mr. Iger.
The New York Times has pieced together what happened inside Disney during those fateful months by talking to scores of people directly involved. Many of them talked extensively for the first time about what transpired, some only on the condition of anonymity because of their nondisclosure agreements with Disney. In each instance in which a past conversation is reconstructed in this article, the spoken words have been confirmed by multiple people with knowledge of the conversations.
Those conversations reveal how Disney's board and executive ranks were consumed by conflict and drama just as the company was facing historic upheaval in the entertainment industry. When the pandemic hit, right as Mr. Chapek took over, the company had to temporarily close its highly profitable theme parks. In spring 2022, the streaming bubble burst, causing investors to flee all media stocks, including Disney's.
But inside Disney, much of the focus was on trying to manage the tensions between Mr. Iger and Mr. Chapek.
Those problems have renewed importance now, as Disney embarks on yet another quest to find someone to succeed Mr. Iger, whose contract ends on Dec. 31, 2026.
The 'Snake Pit'
For a company that bills its theme parks as the "Happiest Place on Earth," Disney's corporate headquarters have long been anything but -- a hotbed of intrigue and power struggles. Mr. Chapek's former chief of staff told people the company's sixth-floor executive suite was a "snake pit."
Mr. Iger ascended almost two decades ago, after a power struggle between Michael Eisner, a long-serving chief executive, and Roy E. Disney, Walt Disney's nephew and a Disney board member. By that time, Mr. Eisner had already elevated and then dispatched two handpicked successors, Jeffrey Katzenberg, who became a co-founder of DreamWorks, and Michael Ovitz, once the most powerful agent in Hollywood.
Mr. Iger, who started his career as a weatherman on a cable channel in upstate New York, had vowed to never follow in Mr. Eisner's footsteps. To friends, he mocked Mr. Eisner's fears about leaving Disney -- that his calls to power brokers would go unreturned, and that he wouldn't be able to get reservations at top restaurants. He told Mr. Chapek and others that he would never stay more than 10 years.
Mr. Iger seemed well on his way to honoring that pledge. Once, while Mr. Chapek was running Disney's consumer products division, Mr. Iger paid a rare unscheduled visit to Mr. Chapek at his office several miles from corporate headquarters. Mr. Iger asked whether Mr. Chapek thought Jay Rasulo or Tom Staggs, two top lieutenants, should succeed him as chief executive.
"Do you want my honest answer?" Mr. Chapek replied. "Neither."
"That's what I thought you'd say," Mr. Iger said, according to Mr. Chapek, and then proceeded to list their respective faults.
It was Mr. Chapek's first inkling that he might be Mr. Iger's actual choice as successor.
But his hopes were dashed when, in February 2015, Mr. Iger named Mr. Staggs, then the theme park chairman, as chief operating officer and presumptive heir. Around the same time, the board extended Mr. Iger's contract two years, to 2018, with the expectation that Mr. Iger would spend much of that time grooming Mr. Staggs as his successor.
But Mr. Iger soured on him. He complained that Shanghai Disneyland, Mr. Staggs's project, was behind schedule and over budget. Mr. Iger pushed out Mr. Staggs in April 2016.
Mr. Chapek was back in the running.
He had started at Disney in 1993 in the VHS tape department, eventually rising to oversee all movie distribution. In 2011, he took over Disney's consumer products division, which soon became flush with "Frozen" merchandise sales. By 2015, Mr. Chapek had been promoted to run theme parks, overseeing at least $ 24 billion in capital investments, including new "Star Wars," "Avengers" and "Toy Story" rides.
Mr. Chapek was the consummate company man, loyal to Mr. Iger to the point of obsequiousness. Alone among Disney senior managers, he routinely called Mr. Iger "Boss" rather than "Bob," which Mr. Iger found endearing.
At the same time, Mr. Chapek lacked Mr. Iger's charisma and wasn't a natural communicator; even Mr. Chapek acknowledged that he had low "E.Q.," or emotional intelligence. Mr. Iger urged him to work on his bedside manner.
Mr. Iger told Mr. Chapek to schedule a series of one-on-one meetings with Disney's directors to build a rapport and lay out his vision for the company's future. But in late 2017, Disney reached a deal to buy the entertainment assets of 21st Century Fox. Mr. Iger received a big bonus for consummating the deal -- stock awards of up to $ 142 million at the then-current share price -- and the board extended his contract for a sixth time. He would now retire at the end of 2021.
Mr. Chapek canceled his plans to meet directors.
Is There Life After Disney?
A Disney chief executive is an instant celebrity. He (they've all been men) presides over what are perceived as some of the most powerful and glamorous businesses in the world: the Marvel, Disney, Pixar, Lucasfilm and 20th Century movie studios; the ABC broadcast network and news division; cable channels like ESPN, FX and National Geographic. Its 12 theme parks attracted a combined 142 million visitors in 2023. And even by chief executive standards, the pay is enormous. Forbes estimates Mr. Iger's net worth at over $ 700 million.
With a yacht, corporate jet, power and influence, Mr. Iger and his wife, Willow Bay, a former television anchor and the current dean of the University of Southern California's journalism school, hobnobbed with a rarefied crowd: Barack and Michelle Obama, Jeff Bezos, Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Oprah Winfrey, to name just a few.
Once in the job, Mr. Iger wondered, as did Mr. Eisner before him: If stripped of his power and multimillion-dollar compensation at Disney, would his allure diminish? For several years, the license plate holder on Mr. Iger's silver Porsche posed the question, "Is there life after Disney?"
There were aspects of the job that Mr. Iger didn't especially enjoy, like earnings presentations and being grilled by Wall Street analysts. He had grown tired of budget meetings.
He often complained to Mr. Chapek (and board members) about his compensation. It was a frequent source of tension between him and Susan Arnold, who sat on the compensation committee for many years. Mr. Iger pointed repeatedly to Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, who was paid more than him even though CBS was much smaller and less complex. In 2017, Mr. Moonves made $ 69.3 million, Mr. Iger $ 36.3 million, barely half that. One Disney director called it "Moonves envy." In 2018, shareholders rejected Mr. Iger's compensation in a nonbinding vote; Disney won approval in 2019 only after Mr. Iger agreed to a smaller package.
Mr. Iger also pondered a conversation he'd had with Steve Jobs shortly before the Apple co-founder died in 2011. Mr. Jobs had urged Mr. Iger not to stay so long at Disney that he ended up depriving himself of some of the great things life had to offer.
When the company's board met in December 2019, Mr. Iger broached the idea of stepping back -- but not leaving entirely. "Why don't we accelerate the process?" Mr. Iger suggested. Mr. Chapek was his choice to succeed him. Mr. Iger told the board that Mr. Chapek knew the brand well, respected it and would do no harm. He also said Mr. Chapek had great integrity.
One of Disney's directors, Mark Parker, had recently decided to step down as chief executive of Nike and become executive chairman. Mr. Iger pitched doing the same thing. That model would allow him to stay at Disney for the remainder of his contract doing what he liked best, overseeing the company's creative endeavors. Mr. Chapek would become the C.E.O. and handle everything else. A crucial element was that all the division leaders would report to Mr. Chapek, but Mr. Chapek would report to Mr. Iger, leaving Mr. Iger ultimately in charge. There was an obvious financial incentive as well: Mr. Iger still had more than $ 100 million in unvested stock options and his leadership could help protect its value.
Safra Catz, the chief executive of Oracle and a Disney board member, pushed back. Why make Mr. Chapek chief executive rather than chief operating officer?
Mr. Iger said he didn't want a rerun of the situation with Mr. Staggs, in which people thought Mr. Staggs was merely auditioning for the top job and they could outmaneuver him by going to Mr. Iger.
But in a rare show of resistance, the board was unpersuaded. It agreed to consider the issue over the holidays.
By the time board members met in late January 2020, in Los Angeles, they had come around. Mr. Iger told Mr. Chapek the good news immediately afterward, saying an announcement would be made in just three weeks on Feb. 25.
Why the rush? Zenia Mucha, Disney's chief communications officer and a close adviser to Mr. Iger, counseled delay; she disagreed with the entire plan, including the selection of Mr. Chapek. But Mr. Iger was adamant.
By mid-February, the coronavirus was spreading widely, and the pressure it could put on the company was becoming clear. Mr. Iger had received a detailed briefing in New York from the ABC News team covering the story. Disney's theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong had already closed.
David Jefferson, a Disney spokesman, said the pandemic had nothing to do with the timing of the leadership change. Board members agree but, when pressed, offer no explanation for the haste other than that was what Mr. Iger wanted.
'Don't Step on His Toes'
When Mr. Chapek shared the good news of his promotion with his wife, Cindy, she was skeptical. "We've heard that before," she told him. But the board's lead independent director, Ms. Arnold, flew from her home in Oregon to meet with Mr. Chapek in the Rotunda, as Disney's executive dining room is known. There, she confirmed that he was the board's unanimous choice to succeed Mr. Iger as C.E.O. "This is happening," Ms. Arnold assured him.
Mr. Chapek was told there was no time for him to meet with other directors. While they had met with Mr. Chapek in his previous roles, the idea that there was no time or no need to interview him to assess his capacity to serve as chief executive, not to mention explore his vision for the future of a company in the midst of profound change, seems inexplicable.
Ms. Arnold recognized that the unusual arrangement, in which Mr. Iger would be staying on as executive chairman and chief creative officer, posed a potential for conflict. She urged Mr. Chapek to show him deference. "Give him a wide berth" on creative matters, she advised. "Don't step on his toes."
Notably, Mr. Chapek would not be joining Disney's board, which was unusual, given that nearly all chief executives also serve as board members, in many instances as chair. But the board wanted a probation period for Mr. Chapek, and wanted to emphasize that he would be reporting to Mr. Iger. It would be awkward if Mr. Chapek were also a member of the board responsible for Mr. Iger's oversight.
In the days before the announcement Mr. Iger told just a handful of top executives, among them Christine McCarthy, the chief financial officer. Like almost everyone who learned the news, she was taken aback. While pledging to help Mr. Chapek succeed, she pointed out some of his weaknesses: He knew next to nothing about the television business, he didn't know anything about sports programming, he didn't have many relationships with Hollywood talent, he hadn't dealt with Wall Street.
Mr. Iger agreed that Mr. Chapek didn't come across as especially creative. But Mr. Iger had faced the same criticism when he was named president of ABC Entertainment in 1989.
"I think he can do it," Mr. Iger insisted. "And I'll still be around."
A Last-Minute Hitch
On Feb. 24, the eve of Mr. Chapek's announcement, the succession plan nearly fell apart.
Alan Braverman, Disney's long-serving general counsel, called Mr. Iger to say that under the company's bylaws, the chief executive had to report to the board -- not to Mr. Iger. For Mr. Iger, that was a nonstarter. He wanted to retain ultimate control.
It was Mr. Braverman and Ms. Mucha who came up with a hastily conceived compromise: Mr. Chapek would report to both the board and Mr. Iger.
That was OK with Mr. Iger since, from his perspective, Mr. Chapek still reported to him. Mr. Iger insisted that the announcement be made the next morning as scheduled -- even though board members hadn't discussed as a group, let alone approved, the new dual reporting arrangement.
No one told Mr. Chapek about the change to the reporting structure. But Mr. Chapek wasn't very concerned about it, because Mr. Iger had always been such a strong supporter of his.
In another sign that Mr. Iger intended to maintain a visible presence, he decided to stay in the office that both he and Mr. Eisner had occupied as chief executives. Mr. Chapek was relegated to smaller quarters nearby. The arrangement only added to internal confusion about Mr. Chapek's new status.
Some board members weren't thrilled with the office decision or the dual reporting change. But, as it had in so many instances, the board went along with what Mr. Iger wanted.
Mr. Chapek and Mr. Iger faced the cameras as planned the next day. The company's announcement said the change was "effective immediately."
The sudden move shocked and baffled Hollywood. Paul McCartney, a close friend of Mr. Iger's, called him to ask if he was sick.
Iger's 'Lap Dog'
About two weeks later, on March 11, Mr. Chapek was scheduled to make his formal debut as chief executive at Disney's annual shareholder meeting. Mr. Chapek was nervous, all the more so because public speaking had never been his strength.
Before the meeting, Disney's investor relations personnel assembled thick briefing binders covering every conceivable data point and question that might arise. Armed with these binders, Mr. Iger and Mr. Chapek settled into the front compartment of the Disney Gulfstream jet for the four-and-a-half-hour flight to Raleigh, N.C., the site of that year's meeting, for what Mr. Chapek expected would be an extended preparation session.
Several passengers, including Mr. Chapek, recalled that Mr. Iger pulled out his iPad and started flipping through recent photographs, telling the stories behind them. There were photos of himself with Mr. McCartney and recent dinner guests in New York. Mr. Chapek said he tried to steer the discussion back to the annual meeting, but Mr. Iger interrupted: "Did you see my new yacht design?"
Flustered by Mr. Iger's digressions, Mr. Chapek got up and moved to the plane's rear compartment.
(Others on the flight said Mr. Chapek immediately went to the back of the plane and didn't recall his having any iPad chitchat with Mr. Iger.)
Mr. Chapek's extended absence was noted in the front cabin. "Does Bob want to get briefed or not?" Mr. Iger asked his fellow passengers, Ms. McCarthy, Ms. Mucha and Mr. Braverman. Finally, Mr. Iger stood up and went to find Mr. Chapek.
"Bob, do you want to sit with us so we can brief you?" Mr. Iger asked.
"Isn't it all in here?" Mr. Chapek replied, holding up the binder. Mr. Iger said the book couldn't convey the nuances. But Mr. Chapek said he'd review the book and let him know if he had any questions. He went back to his reading.
"He doesn't want to be prepped. He says the book is enough," an incredulous Mr. Iger told his fellow passengers when he returned to the front compartment. Mr. Iger suddenly felt as if he were at the wedding altar with the bride walking down the aisle. He realized he'd made a terrible mistake. But it was too late.
On the way back to California, Gov. Gavin Newsom called Mr. Iger before announcing that he would restrict public gatherings in California because of Covid. But he thought Disneyland might stay open. The governor didn't want people to panic -- and he feared they might if Disneyland closed.
Mr. Iger argued to Mr. Newsom that keeping the theme park open was a bad idea, given the health risks to both guests and employees. Mr. Newsom later publicly praised Mr. Iger's advice and cooperation.
Mr. Chapek didn't disagree with the decision to close the parks, but he was furious that Mr. Iger had excluded him. The decision had nothing to do with Mr. Iger's creative mandate.
Disney's executives worried about the shock that the park closures would have on the company's cash flow. Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Chapek made the decision to quickly furlough, albeit with health benefits, more than 90,000 employees at the theme parks.
But Mr. Iger overruled them. He decided to wait until the government passed a Covid relief bill.
Two months earlier, when Mr. Chapek and Mr. Iger had appeared together on CNBC, Mr. Iger brushed aside a question about the potential for confusion over who was in charge. "Bob is going to be running the company," Mr. Iger said. But now it seemed to Mr. Chapek that Mr. Iger was acting as though nothing had changed -- Mr. Iger was still chief executive in all but name.
Mr. Chapek's wife told him he was little more than Mr. Iger's "lap dog."
'He's Killing Me'
However marginalized Mr. Chapek felt, the two maintained at least a facade of cooperation. Because of Covid, no one went into the office, but Mr. Chapek spoke to Mr. Iger weekly by phone and sometimes went to see him at his home in Brentwood, an upscale Los Angeles neighborhood where they took walks wearing masks. Mr. Iger never went to see Mr. Chapek at his home in Westlake Village, a far-flung suburb. (A spokesman for Mr. Iger said he had never been invited.)
At Mr. Chapek's request, the two held a series of employee town-hall meetings, where Mr. Iger was supposed to reinforce the message that Mr. Chapek was now in charge. "My goal is for Bob to be successful, and to the extent that I can help him do that, I will," Mr. Iger said at the first town hall they held in February 2020. "I think it's got to be a balance between giving him the freedom to make the decisions and do things the way he wants to do them because, you know, they will feel right to him. On the other hand, I've got a fair amount of experience doing a lot of these things. And, you know, it's not quite about throwing him into a swimming pool when he's never swum. So it'll be a balance."
But nearly everything Mr. Chapek did (or didn't) do reinforced Mr. Iger's sense that naming Mr. Chapek as his successor had been a huge mistake. Mr. Iger expressed his frustration with friends in Hollywood. Word spread, and someone contacted The New York Times's media columnist at the time, Ben Smith, to say Mr. Iger was reasserting control. Mr. Smith called and spoke to Mr. Iger, too, who followed up with an email.
On Sunday, April 12, Mr. Chapek hosted a belated late-afternoon party for family and friends at his home to celebrate his promotion. A friend emailed him Mr. Smith's column, which had just appeared online. Mr. Chapek stepped out of the party and read it.
"After a few weeks of letting Mr. Chapek take charge, Mr. Iger smoothly reasserted control," Mr. Smith wrote. Mr. Chapek read with mounting disbelief.
Mr. Smith called Mr. Chapek "the new, nominal chief executive" and even speculated that the choice of Mr. Iger's successor "may be open again."
Mr. Smith quoted Mr. Iger as saying in an email that "a crisis of this magnitude, and its impact on Disney, would necessarily result in my actively helping Bob [Chapek] and the company contend with it, particularly since I ran the company for 15 years!"
Mr. Chapek immediately called Ms. Mucha, the communications executive. "What the hell is this?" he demanded. Trying to calm him, she argued the column wasn't that bad.
"He's killing me," Mr. Chapek responded.
Mr. Chapek didn't sleep that night. Early the next morning, he confronted Mr. Iger on the phone.
Mr. Iger denied that he had spoken to Mr. Smith, which only further enraged Mr. Chapek, who pointed out that Mr. Iger's quote came directly from an email. Mr. Iger said he didn't understand why Mr. Chapek was so upset. What was wrong with saying he was reasserting control in the midst of a crisis?
"You've cut my legs out from under me," Mr. Chapek said. "I've never felt worse in my life."
The conversation became heated, and both men raised their voices.
Mr. Iger told several people immediately afterward that he'd never been treated with more disrespect by anyone in his entire life.
As far as Mr. Iger was concerned, his relationship with Mr. Chapek was over.
'This Too Shall Pass'
Starting at 6 a.m. on Monday, Jayne Parker, Disney's chief human resources officer, called Disney directors to alert them to Mr. Chapek's fury. She got one out of bed to take the call.
An enraged Mr. Chapek got on the phone with Ms. Arnold, the board's lead independent director. This was the first time he'd broached the feud with a director. He hadn't wanted to call attention to something that seemed petty compared with a global pandemic, but he felt this could no longer be ignored.
Mr. Chapek, who deemed some other board members fiercely loyal to Mr. Iger, felt he'd developed a good rapport with Ms. Arnold, who had spent most of her career in the Midwest at Procter & Gamble, eventually becoming it's first woman president. Mr. Chapek, the son of a machinist from Hammond, Ind., had gotten his start in packaged goods, working in the pet-food division at Heinz and helping to market Kraft cheese.
Ms. Arnold also knew something about corporate succession: She'd been a leading candidate to become Procter & Gamble's chief executive but took herself out of the running and left the company in 2009, partly because, as a prominent gay executive, she didn't want her personal life to be publicly scrutinized, something that would most likely accompany the job.
Ms. Arnold was taken aback by the vehemence of Mr. Chapek's reaction to the column. She thought he seemed paranoid that Mr. Iger was out to destroy him. She urged him to calm down and defer to Mr. Iger, as she had advised before.
"What will be left of my reputation?" Mr. Chapek pleaded.
"This too shall pass," she responded. Mr. Iger would be gone in 20 months, and the C.E.O. prize would be Mr. Chapek's alone.
Mr. Chapek all but begged to be named to the board as a show of confidence in him. Ms. Arnold conferred with several other directors. None was aware of the depth of the hostility that had developed between Mr. Iger and his designated successor. But they agreed it could damage his standing. The board now felt it had no choice but to name Mr. Chapek a director as a show of support.
Ms. Arnold called Mr. Iger and chastised him for the column. She told him it was the worst thing that could have happened to Mr. Chapek. She pointed out that, had Mr. Iger taken the board's suggestion to initially name Mr. Chapek chief operating officer rather than chief executive, none of this would be happening. In any event, the sniping had to stop.
Mr. Iger was taken aback by both the tone and substance of Ms. Arnold's call. She seemed to be siding with Mr. Chapek -- even though he had been C.E.O. for less than two months and Mr. Iger was still ultimately in charge. She and other board members should be happy he was stepping back up during a crisis, Mr. Iger thought, especially when Mr. Chapek's leadership had been so lackluster.
On April 15, three days after Mr. Smith's column published, Mr. Chapek was named to Disney's board.
In June, the board scheduled private sessions by video call with both men to address the conflict. Mr. Iger went first. He aired his complaints about Mr. Chapek's leadership, including that he hadn't sought Mr. Iger's advice and counsel. Mr. Chapek had no standing in the creative community and hadn't made any efforts to improve it. He'd skipped creative meetings that Mr. Iger had invited him to.
Mr. Chapek said he was sorry their differences had become a board issue. But he was incensed when Mr. Parker, the board member who had led Nike, questioned Mr. Chapek's lack of contacts in the Hollywood creative community, since that was supposed to be Mr. Iger's jurisdiction. He insisted that he hadn't skipped meetings but rather that Mr. Iger had scheduled them without telling him. Mr. Chapek said Mr. Iger had ceded little authority, something Mr. Chapek said he had accepted without complaining. "I was just trying to be a good soldier," Mr. Chapek said.
The board's message to both men: The company was in crisis, and they needed to start acting like adults and work together.
Later, in an audit committee board session with Ms. McCarthy, Ms. Catz, the board member who had questioned Mr. Chapek's readiness, asked if she thought Mr. Chapek was up to the job. Ms. McCarthy, the chief financial officer, didn't immediately answer.
"I don't like the fact that you're hesitating," Ms. Catz said.
"I'm giving you a qualified answer," Ms. McCarthy said. "If he will start to listen. If he will listen. We're all trying to help him, but he doesn't listen."
In the ensuing months, Mr. Iger seemed increasingly cranky about the board's reaction to Mr. Smith's column. "Why are you so hostile toward the board?" Mr. Chapek finally asked during one of their calls, which had continued despite the tensions.
Mr. Iger told him that he couldn't handle the truth, and then proceeded to say that before the board had agreed to name Mr. Chapek chief executive, the directors had assured Mr. Iger that, if he didn't think it was working out, he could fire Mr. Chapek and return as chief executive anytime he wanted. (Given the dual reporting structure, it is unclear whether Mr. Iger had that authority.)
Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for Mr. Chapek, confirmed that account. She said Mr. Chapek "was shocked and surprised when told by Mr. Iger that he believed he could have his job back if and when he wanted it."
Immediately after the call, Mr. Chapek called Ms. Arnold. "What is he talking about?" he asked.
Ms. Arnold tried to make light of it. "Well, you know Bob," Ms. Arnold answered. "He may think so, but just let it go."
It wasn't the answer Mr. Chapek was hoping for.
Mr. Jefferson, the Disney spokesman, said there was never any such understanding between Mr. Iger and the board. The claim that he could return at will was "not something Mr. Iger would have said," Mr. Jefferson added.
For Mr. Chapek, it was a turning point. It wasn't just paranoia: He was now convinced that Mr. Iger was trying to get rid of him and return as chief executive, and that the board might let him.
'This Is His Company to Run'
As Covid shutdowns continued into the fall of 2020, it wasn't just Disney's theme parks that bore the brunt. Disney's movie and television production had ground to a halt, just as consumers were staying home and turning to streaming services. Wall Street had been obsessed with subscriber gains, and Disney+ had delivered, surpassing 70 million, hitting its initial five-year goal after only nine months of operation. But it needed new content, which had all but dried up. Subscriber growth was slowing.
Mr. Chapek pleaded with his studio heads -- Pete Docter of Pixar, Kevin Feige of Marvel, Jennifer Lee of Disney Animation -- and encountered resistance: All of them wanted to hold back their best material for debuts in theaters with star-studded premieres. Mr. Chapek had no idea when, if ever, those days would return. In the meantime, Disney needed cash flow to meet interest payments on the enormous debt it had racked up under Mr. Iger to buy most of 21st Century Fox.
One of Mr. Chapek's perceived strengths was corporate organization. He proposed remaking the company around a new division, Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, to give priority to streaming services (Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+) and to guarantee they received a steady flow of Disney's best content. DMED, as it became known, would now have bottom-line responsibility for all the company's entertainment, and would decide where films and programs would appear -- in theaters, on television or, as was increasingly likely, on Disney+. It would be Mr. Chapek's signature initiative as chief executive.
There was logic to Mr. Chapek's plan. But its seemingly benign, business-school rationale belied a reality: To strip Disney's creative heads of authority over spending, as well as where their movies and shows would be distributed, would be a huge loss of power and status. Moreover, Hollywood talent wanted guarantees of where projects would end up before committing to a deal. Although the division heads would still report to Mr. Chapek (and indirectly to Mr. Iger), it was a huge demotion. In many ways, their new boss would really be the head of DMED.
For that role, Mr. Chapek approached Alan Bergman, then the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, a figure both well known in Hollywood and respected by Disney's creative teams. Mr. Bergman said he'd think about it and called Mr. Iger to ask what he should do. Mr. Iger said he should tell Mr. Chapek what he really thought, which was that DMED was a terrible idea. Mr. Bergman turned down the offer.
Exasperated, Mr. Chapek turned to a loyal former lieutenant at consumer products, Kareem Daniel. A 13-year Disney veteran, Mr. Daniel was nonetheless barely known outside the company and had little experience with movies or television. Overnight, he would be running a division with more than $ 50 billion in annual revenue and would be in the spotlight as Disney's highest-ranking Black executive. Like Mr. Bergman, Mr. Daniel had his doubts about the wisdom of the proposed restructuring.
Mr. Chapek spent hours, both on the phone and in person at Mr. Iger's house, selling Mr. Iger on the idea. Mr. Iger was unenthusiastic but didn't object.
By early October, after a two-hour meeting at Mr. Iger's house, Mr. Chapek thought he'd gotten Mr. Iger's blessing. He was in his car heading back to Westlake Village when Mr. Bergman called him. "Iger just told me we're not doing the reorganization," Mr. Bergman said, according to Mr. Chapek. "He said he hates it."
Mr. Chapek was dumbfounded. He'd left Mr. Iger just 10 minutes earlier. "No, it's on. We're doing it," Mr. Chapek replied.
Mr. Chapek said he immediately called Mr. Iger, and asked if he'd said that to Mr. Bergman. "Yes, I hate it," Mr. Iger confirmed.
"Why didn't you say that to me?" Mr. Chapek asked.
Mr. Iger didn't answer.
A more seasoned chief executive might well have paused at this juncture, given the lack of internal support. At least a dozen senior Disney executives had told Mr. Chapek that the reorganization was a bad idea. But the Disney board gave Mr. Chapek its strong backing for the creation of Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution after extended discussions in which Mr. Iger raised questions but said nothing to oppose it. Mr. Iger was on such thin ice with the board at that time that there was little he could say without appearing to undermine Mr. Chapek. "This is his company to run," Mr. Iger said to directors at one point. The reorganization, and Mr. Daniel's promotion, were announced on Oct. 12, 2020.
Mr. Chapek had finally accomplished something, and he was proud of it. As he later told a reporter at The Times, "It was singularly the best thing I could have done to transform this culture."
In June 2021, the board gathered at Aulani, a Disney resort in Hawaii, for its first in-person meeting since the pandemic. Few companies had been as hard hit as Disney. For a time, revenue from its theme parks and movies had all but been wiped out. But it was on a rebound. Disney World had reopened. Disney+ subscriber growth had pushed Disney's stock to near a record high.
Mr. Iger opened the board retreat with a paean to creativity, "the essence of who we are as a company." He warned that data and algorithms would never supplant creativity and that "not everyone is born with the ability to be wildly creative, and not everyone is born with the ability to manage wildly creative, or sometimes wild and creative, people." He didn't mention any names, but directors said they knew whom he was talking about.
Mr. Iger asked Ms. Arnold if she wanted to run the executive session along with him, but she told him to leave and asked Mr. Chapek to stay. Mr. Iger was taken aback, but took a seat outside the room, expecting to be called back after Mr. Chapek finished.
"We know it's been hard," Ms. Arnold told Mr. Chapek once Mr. Iger was out of the room. She complimented the stock price and his operational leadership during the pandemic. Directors nodded in agreement.
When the session with Mr. Chapek ended, the meeting adjourned and directors left the room. No one thought to tell Mr. Iger, who was left outside to fume.
For the first time since his promotion to chief executive, Mr. Chapek let himself think that Mr. Iger had been vanquished.
But trouble soon arose.
That summer, Disney was locked in negotiations over the release of "Black Widow," Marvel's big new superhero film, with its star, Scarlett Johansson. Now that DMED was up and running, Mr. Chapek wanted to see a return on the $ 350 million cost of the movie.
On July 9, a few days into the annual gathering of media moguls in Sun Valley, Idaho, Disney released "Black Widow" in theaters and on Disney+, even though Ms. Johansson's contract called for an exclusive theatrical release and her pay was pegged to the theatrical box office. Releasing it on Disney+ would obviously cut into ticket sales, costing her as much as $ 50 million, her agent contended. "She's not happy," her agent told Mr. Chapek when he ran into him at the conference. This was exactly the kind of problem Mr. Bergman had warned about when DMED was created.
"Black Widow" took in $ 80 million at the domestic box office during its first three days, sharply less than previous Marvel films had. A few weeks later, when Ms. Johansson sued Disney, the company took a hard line. In a statement approved by Mr. Iger, Disney called the suit "especially sad and distressing," accused Ms. Johansson of a "callous disregard" for the impact of Covid on theatergoers and said she'd already been paid $ 20 million. Talent relations fell under Mr. Iger's purview as creative head, but Mr. Chapek also contributed to the contents of the statement and signed off on it.
"Attacking Johansson so personally was a pretty spectacular unforced error," wrote Kim Masters in The Hollywood Reporter. "And many observers are laying that at the feet of C.E.O. Bob Chapek. The person who isn't getting the blame? Outgoing chairman Bob Iger."
Mr. Chapek was stunned that he -- and not Mr. Iger -- was blamed for the debacle.
'Fasten Your Seatbelts'
That fall, as his end-of-year retirement date approached, Mr. Iger said he didn't want a farewell ceremony or party at Disney. The thought of Mr. Chapek hosting such an event was too galling. Instead, he and his wife decided to host their own party at their home in Brentwood. Mr. Iger chose a date when he knew Mr. Chapek would be in Orlando, Fla., for an event.
Mr. Chapek canceled the trip.
On Nov. 19, he arrived for the party at the same time as Thomas Schumacher, the longtime president of Disney's Broadway division. Ms. Bay, Mr. Iger's wife, was outside greeting guests as they arrived. "Tom Schumacher, it's been too long," she gushed. "I can't believe you came all this way." She embraced Mr. Schumacher. Mr. Chapek stood awkwardly by until she finally turned to him. "Hi, Bob. I see you all the time," she said. She turned back to Mr. Schumacher.
A guest who witnessed the exchange recalled Bette Davis's memorable line in "All About Eve": "Fasten your seatbelts. It's going to be a bumpy night."
About 80 guests were seated at three long tables outdoors behind the house. Mr. Iger was flanked by Mr. Spielberg and Ms. Lee of Disney Animation. Mr. Chapek was in the middle of the table farthest from Mr. Iger's.
Mr. Iger began a speech recognizing people who'd helped and inspired him. In one of his first jobs at ABC, Mr. Iger had worked as an assistant to the acclaimed sportscaster Al Michaels, who was at the party. Mr. Iger mentioned that back in the day he and Mr. Michaels had covered dirt-track racing in Terre Haute, Ind., for "Wide World of Sports." Mr. Iger looked toward Mr. Chapek and went off script: "That's your area, isn't it Bob?" he asked, referring to Terre Haute, in rural southwestern Indiana. "You'd know all about dirt tracks."
Mr. Chapek's hometown of Hammond is near Chicago. He seethed at what he felt was a put-down.
Mr. Iger pushed on, worked his way through his career thanking people and then paused when he reached the present. "I think I'll just stop there," he said. "Thank you all for coming." There was no praise, and no further mention, of Mr. Chapek.
Mr. Chapek reddened as he felt every gaze turn on him. He stood up and stalked out.
'It's Going to Get Worse'
On Nov. 30, in ABC's old board room at Disney's West 66th Street offices in New York City, Mr. Iger presided over his last meeting as chairman. He'd given considerable thought to what he'd say, discussing it with his wife and making detailed notes. He could have reflected on his accomplishments and made a graceful exit, something that he'd considered and that some board members expected.
But he didn't.
During an executive session without Mr. Chapek, Mr. Iger began by apologizing for not having had more interaction with board members since the meeting in Hawaii. Then he said, "There are things that I feel I must leave you with, that you must know because there are things that you need to watch." He then unleashed a broadside.
Mr. Iger asserted that under Mr. Chapek, the collegial culture he'd built over 15 years was crumbling. Disney was a company that depended first and foremost on creativity, and Mr. Chapek's DMED reorganization had damaged Disney's creative engines. The company, he said, had become distracted by a deep rift -- Mr. Chapek and his allies on one side, Disney's creative executives and the Hollywood talent community on the other.
Mr. Iger didn't go so far as to say the board should fire Mr. Chapek. Nor did he ask to replace him as chief executive or to remain as chairman.
Afterward, Mr. Iger seemed unusually subdued at the board's farewell lunch for him. They showed a video tribute. Mr. Parker gave him a pair of custom Nike sneakers. Mr. Chapek gave him two gold coins embossed with Mickey Mouse to be placed under the mast of his new yacht, a good-luck custom to ward off pirates.
Mr. Chapek felt a chill. "It's going to get worse," Mr. Chapek told Ms. Arnold after lunch. He worried that, once he was gone, Mr. Iger would feel more emboldened to criticize Mr. Chapek.
In conversations with allies at the company, he started referring to Mr. Iger as an "assassin."
A Mea Culpa
During Mr. Iger's tenure, the studio had greenlighted a bevy of projects with progressive social and political themes. But Mr. Chapek worried the development slate had veered too far left on social issues. Disney was being pulled into partisan political debates more frequently, a worrisome situation for a brand that was supposed to stand for everyone.
Some board members agreed. Coming up through the pipeline was "Strange World," Disney's first animated film focusing on an openly gay teenager. Ms. Catz, a board member, was so opposed to the character that she told Mr. Chapek she'd have him fired if Disney released the film. He reported the threat to Ms. Arnold.
The film was too far along for Mr. Chapek to block it, but his fears about Disney's becoming a cultural flashpoint soon materialized. In January 2022, the Parental Rights in Education bill was introduced in Florida. Opponents labeled the bill "Don't Say Gay" because it prohibited classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity for young students. The Human Rights Campaign, a prominent L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy organization, soon had more than 100 corporate signatories to a letter opposing anti-gay legislation in various statehouses. Media companies like Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, had signed on. But Disney, one of the largest employers in Florida, was conspicuously absent.
Mr. Chapek realized that staying silent might cause controversy. He called Ms. Arnold, who had succeeded Mr. Iger as chairman, to discuss his view that Disney had become too politicized. He mentioned the Florida bill and the pressure on Disney to publicly condemn it.
Ms. Arnold agreed that Disney should stay above the fray. But she said the company should sign the Human Rights Campaign letter. Since so many companies had already signed -- including Nike, General Motors and Oracle, whose chief executives sat on Disney's board -- she didn't envision Disney's being singled out for criticism: There was safety in numbers. Mr. Chapek agreed.
On Feb. 1, at the board's first meeting with Mr. Iger no longer at the company, Geoff Morrell, the new chief corporate affairs officer, gave a presentation arguing that Disney should stay out of divisive social and political issues, especially at the state and local levels, unless necessary. Disney should fight "the wars not the battles," he said. He also said Disney's employees, accustomed to Mr. Iger making public comments supporting progressive positions, would need to be "reconditioned." The board agreed.
The Florida legislation soon vaulted to national attention. On Feb. 8, President Biden issued a statement on Twitter: "I want every member of the LGBTQI+ community -- especially the kids who will be impacted by this hateful bill -- to know that you are loved and accepted just as you are."
Disney remained silent and soon faced an internal revolt. Creative employees -- many of them gay or staunchly supportive of gay colleagues and friends -- were still seething over the DMED reorganization. And now this?
On Feb. 24, Mr. Iger put a match to kindling by reposting Mr. Biden's comment and adding: "I'm with the President on this! If passed, this bill will put vulnerable, young LGBTQ people in jeopardy."
A few days later, a Disney L.G.B.T.Q. employee group sent a letter to Mr. Chapek and other high-ranking executives demanding that Disney oppose the bill and denounce similar legislation pending in other states. Mr. Chapek met with the group the next week, describing the discussion as "meaningful, illuminating and at times deeply moving."
In the midst of this, Disney's board held an emergency meeting to discuss the mounting controversy. Mr. Chapek told the board that, in keeping with the company's new policy, Disney had not signed the Human Rights Campaign petition. Ms. Arnold was taken aback. "I'm confused," she said. "You told me Disney was going to sign it."
The discussion moved on, but Ms. Arnold was visibly upset. Mr. Chapek sent her a text: "My bad. We decided not to sign. I got busy and forgot to tell you."
Ms. Arnold was furious.
Despite the pressure from employees, Disney's board agreed to stay the course. Mr. Chapek and his corporate affairs team drafted a statement defending Disney's decision not to comment, which was circulated to Ms. Arnold and the rest of the board: "Corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds. Instead, they are often weaponized by one side or the other to further divide and inflame."
The memo, distributed to employees and the news media on March 7, backfired in spectacular fashion. Letters and calls from prominent people criticizing Disney's failure to speak out poured in to Mr. Chapek. Abigail Disney, granddaughter of the co-founder Roy O. Disney, said on Twitter that she was "deeply angered." The Los Angeles Times called Disney's policy "corporate cowardice."
With pressure on Disney increasing, Ms. Arnold advised Mr. Chapek to reverse course and condemn the bill. "You're losing the creative community," she warned him. "You have to stand with your team."
On March 9, Ms. Arnold's first shareholder meeting as chair, Mr. Chapek extolled the company's recent accomplishments in a taped video, then delivered a mea culpa. "I understand our political approach, no matter how well-intentioned, didn't quite get the job done," he said. He announced that Disney would sign the letter and give $ 5 million to the organization. The Human Rights Campaign promptly said it would take the money only after Disney demonstrated it was following through on its promises.
Two days later, Mr. Chapek went even further in another memo to employees: "You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights, and I let you down. I am sorry." Taking direct aim at Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, he also halted political contributions in the state.
There were those at Disney, including Ms. Arnold, who thought Mr. Chapek had now gone too far in the other direction. The about-face and abject apology did little to assuage Disney's outraged L.G.B.T.Q. community. And it gave Florida's governor a national platform to mock the company as "Woke Disney." "If Disney wants to pick a fight, they chose the wrong guy," Mr. DeSantis said. Florida moved to revoke Disney World's special tax status and Disney and the state were soon battling it out in court.
Mr. Chapek thought it unfair that he was being blamed for a policy that had been endorsed by the board at every step. And he saw Mr. Iger's "assassin" fingerprints all over the ensuing firestorm, starting with his tweet. His suspicions only hardened on March 31, when Mr. Iger appeared on CNN. Mr. Iger never mentioned Mr. Chapek by name, but he didn't need to. "To me, it wasn't about politics," Mr. Iger said on the air. "It is about what is right and what is wrong, and that just seemed wrong."
As the bad press continued, Mr. Chapek insisted that his contract as chief executive, set to expire on Feb. 28, 2023, be extended as a show of board support. Terms for a new three-year contract were agreed to by late March. But Ms. Arnold declined to make the agreement public, saying the time wasn't right given the furor over the Florida legislation.
She was also trying to buy time. The board was having its first serious discussions about whether Mr. Chapek had been the wrong choice for the job. Two directors, Mr. Parker and Mary Barra, GM's chief executive, were especially critical of Mr. Chapek. The board discussed the possibility that Mr. Parker of Nike could step in to replace Mr. Chapek on an interim basis while it conducted a search, but he declined. In side discussions, a couple directors explored the idea of an office of the chairman led by Ms. Arnold, but she shut down that suggestion, saying she was happily retired from the daily slog of corporate life. The possibility of asking Mr. Iger to come back wasn't suggested.
Unnerving Calls
In most respects, Mr. Iger was pleasantly surprised by life after Disney. While a rumored appointment as ambassador to China or Britain never materialized, his calls were returned and restaurant reservations remained easy to come by. He spent time on his yacht, wrote a draft of a second book and acquired stakes in companies like Funko, a maker of pop culture collectibles, and Gopuff, the rapid-delivery start-up. He joined Josh Kushner's firm Thrive Capital as a venture partner and gave more than 20 talks at corporations seeking his wisdom.
Mr. Iger insisted he'd put Disney behind him and vowed not to talk about Mr. Chapek unless others brought him up. Evidently, many did. Mr. Chapek fielded a steady drumbeat of unnerving calls from people who had met with Mr. Iger. They told Mr. Chapek that Mr. Iger had heaped criticism on him and wanted to talk about little else.
Mr. Chapek complained about Mr. Iger's whisper campaign to Ms. Arnold and other board members, some of whom had independently heard about Mr. Iger's trash talk. But now that Mr. Iger had officially retired, the board had no leverage on him. No board member ever reached out to him, according to Mr. Jefferson, the Disney spokesman.
Despite the board's growing reservations about Mr. Chapek, and given the lack of any alternative, Ms. Arnold agreed to announce Mr. Chapek's new contract, which allowed for a $ 20 million annual bonus, up from $ 15 million. On June 28, the board said: "Bob is the right leader at the right time for The Walt Disney Company, and the board has full confidence in him and his leadership team."
'We Have to Save Chapek'
Since becoming chief executive in 2020, Mr. Chapek's sometimes rocky tenure had been buoyed by Disney's strong share price. But since hitting a record high in March 2021, it had been falling, along with stocks of other entertainment companies grappling with the new economics of streaming and the decline of cable. In April 2022, Netflix reported it had lost subscribers for the first time in 10 years, panicking Wall Street. Netflix shares lost 35 percent in just one day. Seemingly overnight, investors went from caring only about subscriber numbers to focusing on earnings and losses. The streaming honeymoon was over.
By the time the board announced Mr. Chapek's new contract, Disney shares had dropped almost 50 percent from their peak, so low that activist investors like Dan Loeb and Nelson Peltz were circling the company, seeking board seats and calling for management changes.
Mr. Peltz knew a good deal about Disney and Mr. Iger, thanks to his neighbor in Palm Beach, Isaac ("Ike") Perlmutter, who had sold Marvel to Disney in 2009 and stayed on as Marvel's chairman. The deal made Mr. Perlmutter one of Disney's largest shareholders.
The irascible Mr. Perlmutter had clashed with Mr. Iger over the years. In 2015, Mr. Perlmutter tried to fire Mr. Feige, Marvel's celebrated movie chief, amid a disagreement about budgets; Mr. Iger saved Mr. Feige and effectively demoted Mr. Perlmutter by stripping superhero movies from his oversight. In 2019, Mr. Iger further marginalized Mr. Perlmutter, taking away the television portion of his job and leaving him with only a tiny fief involving comics publishing and a few consumer products. Mr. Perlmutter had been glad to see Mr. Iger step down.
But Mr. Perlmutter had sources in the company who convinced him that Mr. Iger was plotting a return. Mr. Perlmutter warned Mr. Chapek, fanning Mr. Chapek's own anxieties about Mr. Iger's intentions.
With Mr. Perlmutter's encouragement, Mr. Chapek met with Mr. Peltz in July at Disneyland Paris and the two men forged a rapport. Soon after, Mr. Perlmutter called several board members, including Ms. Catz, lobbying them to add Mr. Peltz to the board. If not, he warned, Mr. Iger "would be back at Disney," as Disney later put it in a proxy filing.
In a call to Horacio Gutierrez, the company's new general counsel, Mr. Perlmutter told him: "We have to save Chapek. We can't allow Iger to come back."
Mr. Chapek told Ms. Arnold that he thought inviting Mr. Peltz made sense. It would spare Disney a costly and distracting proxy fight. But Ms. Arnold said the board would never offer Mr. Peltz a seat, partly because of his friendship with Mr. Perlmutter. The board was wary of Mr. Perlmutter given the antagonism between him and Mr. Iger and also because of Mr. Perlmutter's campaign against Mr. Feige, whom the board had come to view as a crucial employee.
'I Am Telling the Truth'
To prepare for that fall's earnings report, Mr. Chapek and Ms. McCarthy, the chief financial officer, met around Labor Day to preview the numbers. They discussed a looming shortfall between Wall Street's forecasts and the actual results, but Mr. Chapek wasn't especially concerned given strong streaming subscriber growth. He told Ms. McCarthy that Mr. Daniel, the DMED chief, had assured him that streaming was "killing it."
But that changed a few weeks later when Ms. McCarthy led board members through a presentation of the expected results. The first slide disclosed that Disney's earnings per share would be 27 cents below Wall Street's estimates -- far more than what she and Mr. Chapek previously discussed, and a result sure to shock Wall Street. Disney's streaming business was still signing up subscribers at a fast pace. But soaring programming and marketing costs meant that streaming was now heading toward a $ 1.5 billion quarterly loss, up from $ 630 million a year earlier -- just when investors had been promised there would be light at the end of the tunnel.
Board members started pelting Mr. Chapek with questions. How could the results be this bad?
Mr. Chapek felt blindsided. Ms. McCarthy had distributed projected earnings results nine days earlier to the board that prominently highlighted the 27-cent miss. But Mr. Chapek hadn't read that board package -- he had assumed the material in it reflected what he and Ms. McCarthy had discussed when they met.
Ms. McCarthy continued through the slide presentation as board members appeared to grow more agitated. About an hour into the meeting, Mr. Chapek was visibly annoyed. He stared at Ms. McCarthy, tapped his watch, then took it from his wrist and began swinging it back and forth like a pendulum, signaling Ms. McCarthy to finish up.
During the ensuing break, he confronted her.
According to Ms. McCarthy's recollection, he accused her of upsetting the board. "I am telling the truth," she replied. "I never lie, and I'm not starting now. The numbers are the numbers."
Mr. Chapek said he didn't attack her, and simply asked why she'd blindsided him. He said she didn't offer any explanation.
The board met in executive session with Mr. Chapek, and then Ms. McCarthy. Ms. McCarthy said Mr. Chapek had attacked her during the break for being truthful. Ms. Catz again asked if Mr. Chapek was up to the job.
This time, Ms. McCarthy answered, "He can't do it."
Ms. Catz and others told Ms. McCarthy she had to hold the place together.
Afterward, an angry Ms. Arnold called Mr. Chapek.
"How could you attack Christine?" she demanded.
"She'd never told me the numbers!" Mr. Chapek exclaimed.
Petting a Hippo
Worried that Mr. Chapek was in denial about the gravity of the shortfall, Mr. Gutierrez, the general counsel, called for meetings during an October management retreat in Orlando. Mr. Gutierrez invited the senior leadership team, saying he wanted to ensure a common understanding of the situation and plan for what would surely be a difficult earnings call.
Mr. Chapek didn't attend Mr. Gutierrez's meetings. Instead, during one, Mr. Chapek greeted park visitors and petted a hippo at Disney's Animal Kingdom resort. (Mr. Chapek's spokeswoman said he went to every meeting he was told about, adding that the hippo encounter was part of an effort, encouraged by the board, to come across as more personable.)
Pressed by Mr. Gutierrez that a crisis was looming, Mr. Chapek offered him a meeting at 6:30 a.m. on Friday. Mr. Gutierrez declined, saying that several participants were scheduled to leave Orlando that morning.
The week before the earnings call, Kristina Schake, who had replaced Mr. Morrell as communications chief, tried to warn Mr. Chapek that the quarterly results would prompt a cascade of negative news articles. He chided her as an "Eeyore," a reference to the gloomy donkey from the Winnie-the-Pooh franchise.
Mr. Chapek unveiled the earnings as scheduled on Nov. 8. They fell short of estimates by 26 cents a share, only a penny better than the forecast. In his upbeat presentation to analysts, Mr. Chapek avoided mentioning the $ 1.5 billion in streaming losses, instead saying only that the red ink had hit a "peak." He spent more time extolling the post-Covid comeback of the theme parks.
On CNBC, Jim Cramer called the results "one of the most disappointing quarters I've ever seen at a major company."
Disney stock dropped 13 percent over the next 24 hours.
With the stock seemingly in free fall, creative personnel revolting and Mr. Chapek no longer on speaking terms with Ms. McCarthy, the chief financial officer, Mr. Gutierrez called Ms. Arnold.
Mr. Chapek didn't have the credibility or leadership skills to continue as C.E.O., Mr. Gutierrez told her. The only person who could solve the problems was Mr. Iger.
"You aren't the first" to suggest that, she replied.
Alarm Bells
A few days later, Mr. Iger went for separate walks with Mr. Bergman, the movie chief, and Dana Walden, who oversaw television operations. Each vented their frustrations with Mr. Chapek and told Mr. Iger how bad things were.
"Don't talk to me, because I can't do anything about it," Mr. Iger said. "Talk to the board."
Each said they already had. They told him everyone had.
Ms. Walden asked Mr. Iger if he'd consider coming back. "I might," he said. "But they'll never ask me."
"Would you call Susan Arnold?" Ms. Walden asked.
Mr. Iger was still on bad terms with Ms. Arnold, partly because of the column by Mr. Smith, and hadn't spoken to her since he left. "If she wants to talk to me, she knows how to reach me," he said.
That weekend, Mr. Chapek was in Palm Beach, Fla., to meet again with Mr. Peltz, even though Mr. Jefferson, the Disney spokesman, maintained that board members had instructed Mr. Chapek in August not to meet alone with any activist investors.
Mr. Chapek "never received any such admonition," Ms. Davis, the spokeswoman for Mr. Chapek, said. Mr. Chapek deemed communicating with activists and other large investors to be an essential part of his duties as chief executive. He "faithfully followed the board's direction on all matters," she said.
Mr. Chapek went to Mr. Peltz's oceanfront mansion, where the investor and one of his sons made their case for change at Disney. The meeting lasted about two hours. Afterward, Mr. Chapek met Mr. Perlmutter of Marvel and briefed him on the meeting.
Mr. Chapek didn't tell anyone on the board about the trip, but Mr. Iger nonetheless found out about it soon after it happened. (There appear to have been few secrets within Disney's upper ranks.) Mr. Iger assumed Mr. Chapek had been in Palm Beach solely to see Mr. Perlmutter.
On Nov. 17, the Disney board held a special meeting to discuss the Peltz situation. Mr. Chapek was in Disney's New York offices and participated by video. He mentioned that he'd had conversations with Mr. Peltz, but not that they'd met in person a couple days earlier. The board reaffirmed its decision to rebuff Mr. Peltz.
Soon after the meeting ended, Ms. Arnold called Mr. Chapek, ordering him to have no further contact with Mr. Peltz, even if other Disney executives were with him. Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Gutierrez would be the only "designated points of contact" with the investor, as Disney said in one of its proxy filings.
The order set off alarm bells for Mr. Chapek. He'd met earlier with Mr. Loeb, who had dropped his campaign to shake up Disney. The board had praised Mr. Chapek for that. Now, he was barred not only from meeting alone with Mr. Peltz but also from communicating with him at all. He sensed a growing lack of trust.
There were two Disney premieres in New York that week, the Searchlight film "The Menu" and the FX series "Fleishman Is in Trouble." Mr. Chapek, preoccupied by the mounting pressures on both him and the company, didn't show up. Ms. McCarthy stood in for him.
That Friday, Ms. Walden called Mr. Iger and canceled a walk they had planned for that afternoon. Ms Walden said Ms. Arnold would be calling him instead. Mr. Iger reported this to his wife.
"They're not asking you back," she said.
Mr. Iger agreed, but wondered, "What if they do?"
Ms. Bay said he'd have to accept. "If they're asking you to come back, they must be desperate. And second, you love the company and the people, you kind of owe it to them."
Ms. Arnold called as scheduled at 3 p.m. After brief pleasantries, she said she wanted to apologize for their rupture. That was important to Mr. Iger. Without an apology, he wouldn't consider a return. He accepted it and said they should move on.
"Would you come back?" she asked.
He accepted without hesitating, with three conditions: He wanted it to be announced immediately, no later than Monday, because it was too big a secret for him to keep. It had to be for a limited period -- they decided on two years. And he wanted to serve without pay, because he didn't want anyone to think he was doing it for money.
Ms. Arnold said she'd have to get back to him on that.
The call lasted all of 15 minutes.
Ms. Arnold told Mr. Gutierrez to convene a virtual meeting of the board's independent directors for Sunday without telling Mr. Chapek. During the meeting, Ms. Arnold asked for Mr. Gutierrez's assessment. He said that Mr. Chapek had lost the support of the senior leadership team and that there was a serious risk of losing some key creative talent. He'd become dysfunctional. He'd missed important meetings in Orlando preceding the disastrous November earnings call. In a moment of crisis, rather than charting a way forward, he was in denial. He seemed depressed.
The board voted unanimously to terminate Mr. Chapek and instructed Ms. Arnold and Mr. Gutierrez to call him.
That night, Elton John was giving a concert at Dodger Stadium that was being livestreamed on Disney+. Mr. Chapek planned to attend, but was still at home in Westlake Village when the call came.
Ms. Arnold got straight to the point: "Effective immediately, you're out." He wasn't even offered the face-saving gesture of resigning.
Despite his anxieties, Mr. Chapek was unprepared for something this sudden. "Why?" he asked.
"We lost confidence."
Iger's Last Extension?
Four hours later, the news broke about who would be replacing him. Mr. Chapek wasn't surprised.
Mr. Iger moved swiftly to dismantle Mr. Chapek's legacy and stifle any internal opposition. DMED was abolished within days of his return, its functions returned to the creative executives. Mr. Iger ousted Mr. Daniel. Mr. Perlmutter lost his job four months later. Next, Mr. Iger demanded Ms. McCarthy's resignation. Ms. Arnold left the board in March 2023, when her one-year extension as board chair came to an end. Ms. Catz left the board this July.
Mr. Iger returned to a company beleaguered on nearly every front. He soon faced a debilitating strike by Hollywood writers and actors, then a bitter proxy fight waged by Mr. Peltz. "Wish," a high-profile Disney animated film released in late 2023, became the fifth big-budget Disney film to bomb at the box office that year.
Disney shares rose immediately after Mr. Iger's return, but soon turned down again. After Mr. Peltz lost the proxy contest in April 2024, Mr. Perlmutter sold all of his 25.6 million shares, saying he had no confidence in Mr. Iger and Disney management. Disney shares this week were trading at less than $ 90, down 55 percent from March 2021.
Predictably, the board rebuffed Mr. Iger's suggestion that he work for nothing. A securities filing revealed he earned $ 31.6 million last year.
Mr. Chapek departed with over $ 20 million in severance payments (after earning just over $ 24 million for 2022), but his reputation was in shreds.
After he was fired, Mr. Chapek hired Bryan Freedman, a lawyer in Los Angeles known for handling high-profile media departures. Mr. Freedman told The Times he had advised Mr. Chapek that he had "a very strong legal claim against Bob Iger for illegally interfering with his ability to do his job." But Mr. Chapek told him that his children and grandchildren were a "Disney family" and he couldn't bring himself to file a lawsuit that might hurt the company, Mr. Freedman said.
Disney responded with a statement saying that Mr. Chapek was fired by the board because "he was no longer the right person to serve as C.E.O. during an increasingly complex period of industry transformation."
Muzzled by a severance agreement, Mr. Chapek has stayed in the background in the face of what he considers unflattering, unfair and, in some cases, inaccurate accounts of his leadership. Though he joined the board of a medical technology firm, few opportunities have come his way.
From the outset, as Disney's C.E.O., Mr. Chapek faced daunting challenges beyond his control: the onset of a global pandemic, upheaval in an industry being transformed by streaming and the overt hostility of a much admired and still-powerful predecessor.
At the same time, he certainly contributed to his own demise. Soon after he was named chief executive, he stopped ingratiating himself with Mr. Iger. And, by the end, nearly his entire executive team had turned against him, even people he'd hired and promoted. So did the board -- not just Ms. Catz, skeptical of him from the outset, but also Ms. Arnold, once his strongest defender.
Mr. Chapek, his spokeswoman said, "remains deeply proud" of navigating Disney through the "unprecedented terrain" of the Covid crisis, "all while working to transform Disney into a media company poised for future success. Mr. Chapek is confident that, absent his predecessor and ultimate successor's campaign against him, this collective vision would have been realized under his leadership."
Current Disney executives say Mr. Iger has restored morale and brought needed stability to the management ranks. Marvel and Pixar had big summer hits in "Deadpool & Wolverine" and "Inside Out 2," both started while Mr. Iger was still creative head. Though Disney stock remains in the doldrums, the streaming combination of Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ eked out a profit in the quarter ending June 29, three months ahead of projections. Mr. Iger was greeted by fans with delirious applause when he appeared onstage at this summer's D23 fan gathering in Anaheim, Calif. Mr. Iger was so moved that he had to fight back tears before speaking.
In the annals of corporate governance, there are surely few failures that rival the Disney board's handling of Mr. Iger's transition. The influential shareholder advisory service ISS called it a "failed succession" and cited "major missteps" by the board. Among the more startling were the board's failure to formally interview Mr. Chapek for the job, its failure to fully consider the unworkable reporting structure in which Mr. Chapek reported to both the board and Mr. Iger, and its failure to curb the debilitating conflict that erupted between the two men.
Few feuds among top executives have ever reached the level of intensity and bitterness of the one between Mr. Iger and his handpicked successor. Mr. Iger has called hiring Mr. Chapek for the top job the worst mistake of his career. Still, the question lingers: How could Mr. Iger have so misjudged Mr. Chapek after working with him for nearly 30 years? "I've tried hard to conduct my own post-mortem, just so that we as a company don't do it again," Mr. Iger said at The New York Times's DealBook Summit last year, but declined to disclose any conclusions.
Disney said Mr. Iger had nothing further to add.
Last summer, Disney's board extended Mr. Iger's contract yet again, until late 2026. Mr. Iger is adamant that this will be the last extension.

Sure, His Parents Have Long Coattails: [Style Desk]

Full text: In a series of videos, Jack Robbins has been lampooning nepo baby culture -- and embracing it -- with help from his parents and Steven Spielberg's daughter.
For Jack Henry Robbins, the day begins with stretching and meditation, followed by two to three seconds of tooth brushing. After visiting his favorite neighborhood coffee shop, a Nespresso boutique on the Upper East Side, he returns home to begin work.
"Every day, I like to wake up and I either sell a show to HBO or Netflix based on my mood," Mr. Robbins tells the camera. "Today, I'm pitching a TV show I thought of yesterday that is basically 'Star Wars' set in a sewer system -- I sold it!"
Triumphantly closing his laptop, Mr. Robbins adds, "I'm off to visit my famous mom."
That, anyway, is how Mr. Robbins, the son of the actors Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon, portrayed himself in "Day in the Life of a Nepo Baby," a video he posted to Instagram last November that has been viewed more than three million times.
Since then, Mr. Robbins, 35, has released a series of over-the-top clips on Instagram and TikTok purporting to pull back the curtain on what it's like to be the child of celebrities.
The phrase nepotism baby -- nepo baby for short -- has been used to attack people whose professional accomplishments are perceived by some to stem from family connections rather than talent alone. In his videos, Mr. Robbins appears to lampoon the concept of being the pampered, freeloading son of Hollywood royalty, but also embraces it.
As Mr. Robbins put it in a phone interview, he is playing a character that amounts to "the worst version of me that could have ever happened."
He added of his alter ego: "Here's this painfully out-of-touch, delusional person, who for all his advantages is the world's least successful nepo baby. I'm having fun completely satirizing my biggest insecurity."
Last week, Mr. Robbins added a guest star, posting a video in which he and Sasha Spielberg, the musician daughter of the director Steven Spielberg and the actress Kate Capshaw, try to make a film together.
"Sasha and I are fed up with the lie that nepo babies can't make art without help from our parents," Mr. Robbins says. Their brainstorm session, naturally, consists of recycled ideas from their parents' filmographies. And to avoid comparisons with her famous father, Ms. Spielberg adopts a pen name: S. Spielberg.
Mr. Robbins said the videos were inspired by a 2022 article in New York magazine about the nepo baby phenomenon that generated a wave of discourse about prominent celebrity children.
"When the article came out, I had this complicated emotional response -- this insecurity," said Mr. Robbins, who by then was already trying to make it as a filmmaker and had several shorts and a feature length movie, "VHYes," under his belt. "I didn't know how to represent how I felt about the topic," he added. "I thought, 'I'm going to lean into it."'
Like many broad satires, Mr. Robbins's nepo baby videos contain a grain of truth. They also press on a personal wound. He related a story about attending a fashion show in New York with Ms. Sarandon when he was a child. Backstage, a woman asked why a 10-year-old was there. The young Mr. Robbins pointed to his mother in explanation.
"The woman told me, 'You're either going to be incredible at this" -- meaning show business -- "or let everyone down,"' Mr. Robbins said. "That was something that I'll never forget."
Later, while promoting his 2016 short film "Hot Winter: A Film by Dick Pierre" at the Sundance Film Festival, Mr. Robbins discovered what the children of notable people soon learn when their own careers are discussed: "First question I was asked in every interview: 'How did your parents inspire this film?"'
That seems to have led him to the creation of another clip, in which Mr. Robbins travels in character to Huntington Beach, Calif., ("the epicenter of Hollywood," as he calls it) to meet with a talent manager.
"I think we need to capitalize on your mom a little more," the manager says. "What if we put your mom's name in your name?"
With that, his alter ego took on a new name: Jack Susan Sarandon Robbins.
Helping sell the gag are Mr. Robbins's famous parents, who appear in his videos from time to time, usually playing exasperated versions of themselves. For Mr. Robbins, collaborating with them has been one of the benefits of the project.
"To have a format where we get to play together as actors was something I never thought we'd get to experience, because I never wanted to be an actor," he said.
Another positive has been the freedom to control every aspect of a project.
"There's no holdups," he said. "There's no years and years of development to not make a pilot.
"The process of waiting to convince X, Y and Z to make something happen was really taking a toll on me."
Mr. Robbins said he has not heard from others of his ilk, Ms. Spielberg aside -- "There's no text thread" for nepo babies -- but the response on social media has been overwhelmingly positive and has raised his profile.
If some people don't realize he is playing a monstrous version of himself, that's OK.
"My favorite thing in life is to make people laugh," Mr. Robbins said. "If people are laughing, if people are having a great time with it, I don't care if 25 percent think it's real. I have no shame."

This Actress Finds Her Own Way: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The daughter of a rock star, Eve Hewson is not yet a household name herself, but that could change in the coming months.
Eve Hewson keeps getting discovered.
The Irish actress, whose credits date back to 2008, started generating heat in 2014 for her performance as a reserved young nurse in Steven Soderbergh's period drama "The Knick." Her turn as the eerie, emotionally unstable wife in the Netflix mini-series "Behind Her Eyes," in 2021, had fans stopping her on the street.
It happened again with "Bad Sisters," the darkly comic Irish drama. Released in 2022 on Apple TV+, the show became a phenomenon in Dublin, Hewson's hometown, where weekly watch parties in pubs turned her into a local sensation. And in 2023, she was the talk of Sundance, when the film "Flora and Son," where she plays the titular role, sold for a record-breaking $ 20 million to Apple TV.
Yet, partly because streaming services have dramatically increased the volume of television while atomizing viewing habits, Hewson, 33, is not quite a household name.
That may change in the coming months. The actress is starring opposite Nicole Kidman and Liev Schreiber in the buzzy Netflix adaptation of Elin Hilderbrand's "The Perfect Couple," premiering Sept. 5, and she will be back for the second season of "Bad Sisters" on Nov. 13, reprising her role as the youngest and wildest sister, Becka Garvey. She just finished filming a part in Noah Baumbach's new movie, which stars George Clooney and Adam Sandler, and is about to start a television pilot from Alec Berg ("Barry") set in the world of Formula 1 racing.
Hewson has long had a complicated relationship with fame -- understandable given that her father is Bono, the U2 frontman and global activist. It's easy to feel invisible when your dad is gobbling up all the attention.
Routinely deemed a "nepo baby" before the phrase was in vogue, Hewson has long since given up on defending where she came from as the reason for her success. She knows that having a famous father certainly helped. Her first acting gig came from a tutor she had while on the road with U2, an aspiring filmmaker who cast her in a short. She loved the experience and never looked back.
Hewson said she never worried about how she would be perceived, going into a business that would -- if she were successful -- bring her own fame and attention.
"I was just like, I'm going to do this; I'm obsessed with this; this is just going to happen," she said over lunch in Los Angeles, where she now lives. "I kind of can't believe I did it."
Genuinely funny in conversation, Hewson displays a relatability that belies her self-described upbringing "among rock stars and super models." As a child, she constantly questioned whether people were her friends because they liked her, or because they liked her father. (Or because they liked her swimming pool, which in Dublin are almost as exotic as rock stars.)
But one upside of such uncertainty is a stronger sense of self.
"I don't really believe in other people's opinions," said Hewson, dressed in a black silk skirt and a black T-shirt with "Every woman has a fantasy," emblazoned on the chest. "Obviously it affects me, but I've learned to trust myself and trust my gut and trust my taste."
Still, she said that unlike some of her experiences growing up, she is able to take in and appreciate others' appraisals of her acting without questioning their motives. The thing that feels the most "real" to her is pretending to be someone else.
"When people come up to me and say, 'You're the crazy wife from that show on Netflix,' I'm like, 'Oh, you're actually recognizing me and my work,"' she said. "They probably have no idea of the connection or don't even care. It's a nice feeling."
In "The Perfect Couple," Hewson plays Amelia Sacks, a down-to-earth Central Park zookeeper who is about to marry into a wealthy Nantucket family ruled by a matriarch named Greer Garrison Winbury (Kidman), a best-selling author obsessed with maintaining her family's pristine image. A death on the eve of the wedding threatens to disrupt the facade.
Hewson's character is a kind of audience surrogate, there to be alternately fascinated and horrified by the lifestyles of the rich and famous. Privileged eccentricities are familiar for Hewson -- what was demanding was grappling with the overwhelming grief her character faces in the series. Even amid an ensemble cast that also features Dakota Fanning and Jack Reynor, Hewson's role as the outsider was isolating, especially since her character feels far bigger emotions than anyone else.
"I luckily haven't fully experienced a death that's so close to me," she said. "It was hard for me to wrap my head around what that would feel like. Am I in denial? Am I completely engulfed in grief? I felt like my character had a lot of weight to it, and was the emotional beat of the story. That was the most challenging."
She also had to go toe to toe with Kidman, whose character considers Hewson's Amelia to be both beneath her son and a threat to the family.
"Eve holds her own," said Susanne Bier, the director of the six-episode series. "It's not even difficult for her." Bier added that she cast Hewson because she wanted her "normal" protagonist to be played by "a complex human being who had secrets."
"You look at her face; you look at her eyes," Bier said. "You know that she does show you part of what she's thinking, but not all of it."
Hewson felt far more vulnerable playing Becka in "Bad Sisters," who she said is the closest of any character she has played to her own personality. But she had to work for the part. The show's creator, Sharon Horgan, said Apple executives asked for another audition because they weren't sure the actress could do comedy. While playing Becka did involve recalling distinct, and often unpleasant, emotions from her childhood -- feeling like a screw-up, feeling misunderstood -- one thing she was confident about showcasing was her comic ability.
Hewson discovered that talent when, at 25, she starred opposite Andie MacDowell in a small romantic comedy called "Paper Year" (2018), written and directed by Rebecca Addelman.
"I was like, oh, yeah, I'm good at this," Hewson said. "I should do more of this."
Horgan said, "She can kind of do anything. She can break your heart and make you laugh."
Hewson thinks a lot about the symbiotic connections she has had with directors like Horgan and Bier. The occasional Soderbergh aside, whom she also reveres, she has tended to work with female filmmakers -- others on her wish list include Greta Gerwig and Marielle Heller.
"It's a very bizarre relationship between actor and director -- it's almost like you're a baby and you're, like, being breastfed or something," she said, laughing. "It's like this weird trust that you have to have in this person who's going to protect you and nourish you and give you everything that you need."
Horgan, for one, would be happy to keep working with Hewson. "I think she's going to have a ridiculous career," Horgan said.
"She can be all sorts of different people -- a teenage girl and an adult woman," she added. "The main thing is, she makes me feel something."

To Persuade a Reluctant Tween to Read, Try Cash: [Op-Ed]

Full text: This summer, I paid my 12-year-old daughter $ 100 to read a book. As far as mom maneuvers go, it was definitely last-ditch, and the size of the payout was certainly excessive. I can't say I am proud -- but I am extremely satisfied. Because the plan worked. It worked so well, I'd suggest that other parents of reluctant readers open their wallets and bribe their kids to read, too.
My daughter is a whip-smart kid, definitely smarter than I was at 12. But until I resorted to bribery, she'd never read an entire chapter book for pleasure. She'd read books for school, but getting her to do that was like pulling teeth, and on her own she'd read a few graphic novels and listened to the audiobooks of the "Harry Potter" series. None of those activities became a gateway to any habit of what I might call classic deep reading -- with two eyes in front of paper, and nothing else going on.
When I faced this truth a few months ago, it felt like a parenting failure. Even though we'd read many storybooks when she was younger and we live in a house stuffed with books, I'd not managed to instill one of life's fundamental pleasures in my kid.
Just before the pandemic, a depressing federal survey revealed how much reading for pleasure had dropped among children. Almost 30 percent of 13-year-olds said they "never or hardly ever" read for fun, a substantial increase from the 8 percent who said the same roughly 35 years earlier. Given that screen time among children also increased significantly during the pandemic, it's fair to conclude that leisure reading is an increasingly endangered pursuit among children.
For those of us who are lifelong readers -- who value our night stands stacked with teetering towers of books; who hold in our minds like friends the ideas and characters we've collected over the years from the printed page -- conveying the importance of reading shouldn't be hard. We all understand how reading enhances the fabric of our experience. Yet I found it weirdly difficult to communicate any of this to my reading-reluctant daughter. She claimed to dislike reading. Furthermore, she didn't care to like it. And she didn't see any of this as a problem. Lots of her friends, she explained to me, just "weren't into" reading. I realized that if I wanted to communicate the joy of reading to my child, I had to clarify what the joy was for myself.
Certainly, my daughter's having landed a smartphone last year -- a secondhand iPhone with a zillion parental controls and time limits baked in -- is part of the problem. Before the phone, I had a child who was like a gregarious Tigger, squealing with delight at something as simple as a new dessert cooling in the fridge. Post-phone, I had a monosyllabic blanket slug who wanted only to stay in her room with the blinds down, door closed, under a duvet, palming that little rectangle as if unhanding it would make her social life disappear. If it wasn't her friends or it wasn't her phone, it was only one thing: "boring."
Have you ever tried cheerfully to tell a nearly-13-year-old enduring a couple of parentally imposed phone blackout hours to pull out the old watercolors set? Or maybe try origami? Unless you want your hair to instantly fall out from teenage eyeballs laser-hating you through tiny slits, I'd suggest don't.
But I held a candle for reading. Because I could see that what my daughter was looking for, like so many her age, was escape. To me, that felt developmentally appropriate. The problem was that the easiest way for her to find escape was to plunge into the addictive chaos of her smartphone.
So I campaigned. I told her she needed to read because novels are the best way to learn about how people's insides work. She said she could learn more from watching the people she followed on social media, who were all about spilling their insides.
I said books offered storytelling. She said, "Netflix."
I said books taught history. She said, "The internet."
I said reading would help her understand herself, and she said, "Um, no thank you. I'll just live."
I promised, extravagantly, that I'd buy her all the books she wanted and construct bookshelves in her room so that she could see the spines of all the books she loved from her bed. She said, "Mama, welcome to your dream."
I could not win our debates, I realized, because few of my daughters' arguments against reading seemed wrong to me. Yes, reading is a way to broaden your universe and discover new worlds -- but so is the entire internet. So these discussions, which annoyed both of us, would inevitably whittle down to my wheedling about cognition and attention and how reading is "good for you."
That's not why I wanted my daughter to pick up a book. It wasn't about optimizing her brain function but about being privy to a certain subtle magic. You know when an author sums up a feeling you didn't even know you've had, and 100 lightbulbs go off in your head in a kind of epiphany? I wanted her to have a chance at feeling that. As Neil Postman wrote in 1982 in "The Disappearance of Childhood," a screen-based medium like TV or video can't create this kind of relationship because, by its nature, the medium must fill in all the blanks for you. Books leave space for blanks -- and for the internal invention they can inspire.
So I decided to cut through all the reasoning with a cold, hard practicality: cash. I told my 12-year-old I would pay her $ 100 to read a novel. She said: "What? Really?"
Then, of course, she said yes.
I canvassed friends with teenagers about what book would work to ignite her reading desire. While some weirdos suggested things like "The Little Prince" and "Wuthering Heights," the book suggested most often by people who know my daughter was Jenny Han's "The Summer I Turned Pretty," which had been turned into a popular Amazon Prime series that my daughter had watched and loved.
I brokered the deal: $ 100 if she finished the book within a month. We then embarked on a beach holiday, along with my boyfriend, to a romantic Greek island -- an extended event involving bathing-suit-clad middle-aged bodies so mortifying to a 12-year-old that it was better not to look up. Perfect!
The holiday was eight days long, and before the seventh day was done, my daughter had finished the book. When we got back home, she asked for the sequel, then finished that one in about two weeks -- at no extra charge.
Will this lead to her reading "Little Women"? To tearing through "Catcher in the Rye" and "White Teeth"? Will it result in a long reading life full of teetering night-stand stacks of books that she will come to see as friends, teachers, cheerleaders and balm for whatever her troubles of the day may be?
I don't know. What I do know is that my daughter now has $ 100 worth of new Sephora items that I'd spent the past year refusing to purchase. I also know that together, we finally opened a new portal for her to the printed page: a quiet personal place that I imagine -- I hope -- will serve her for a lifetime. That feels like the best money I ever spent.

Andy Cohen Lists His Light-Filled West Village Duplex for $14 Million: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The TV host is trading his 3,500-square-foot apartment, painstakingly assembled over nearly 21 years, for a penthouse in the same neighborhood.
Andy Cohen, the TV host, author and longtime producer, spent 21 years building his dream West Village home -- a fantastical assemblage of four apartments that he turned into a single 3,500-square foot home where light floods nearly every room.
It's a showstopper, the kind of eye-watering real estate you'd see on reality TV shows like "The Real Housewives" franchise, which he has produced for more than two decades.
"The first time I ever walked into Andy's apartment, I said, 'Whenever you are willing to part with this, even if I have to pull it from your grip, please let me know. Because it's a one of one,"' said Ryan Serhant, owner of the eponymous luxury brokerage SERHANT and star of "Owning Manhattan" on Netflix.
That time has come.
Mr. Cohen is selling what Mr. Serhant calls the ultimate bespoke apartment, and Mr. Serhant is the listing agent. "It's one of those treasures that you wait your whole career for to find something like this that you get to bring to market and sell," Mr. Serhant said.
The asking price is $ 14 million.
Mr. Cohen and Mr. Serhant became friends more than a decade ago, when Mr. Serhant made his reality TV debut in 2012 on "Million Dollar Listing," a program on Bravo, where Mr. Cohen has long served as a host and executive producer.
The pair met at a time of transition for Mr. Cohen. He was moving on from his role as an executive at Bravo to spend more time in front of the camera, and was just kicking off his renovations. Nine years earlier, in 2003, he had purchased a unit for $ 1.4 million that is now the ground floor of his duplex. He got to know the neighbors and the doorman in his prewar, Bing & Bing-designed building. A doorman tipped him off to the fact that the unit directly above his might be vacant soon.
Mr. Cohen bought that unit, then two additional adjacent studios, working with the architect Gordon Kahn to meticulously merge the apartments like life-size Lego pieces.
When the pandemic shut down the city in 2020, Mr. Cohen had finished most of his renovations (a fourth unit was added in 2022). His home is now a custom two-story apartment with three bedrooms plus an office, den and nanny's suite. A custom glass, walnut and steel staircase designed by Mr. Kahn unites the two floors. The apartment is bounded by windows on every side and features wood-burning fireplaces, a steam room, and the most elusive of New York City amenities -- generous closets and three additional storage units.
If the walls could talk, they would have a lot of tea to spill: Mr. Cohen has thrown many holiday parties in his home, with guests including Madonna, Sarah Jessica Parker, John Mayer, Ralph Fiennes and Kelly Ripa.
When the parties went on pause, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Serhant realized they had two very important things in common: their children. Mr. Cohen's son, Benjamin, was born just a few weeks before Mr. Serhant's daughter, Zena.
With a pair of 1-year-olds, fatherhood fostered their friendship, and the pandemic made them a sort of pod. They began spending long hours in the apartment's candy-colored rooms while their children played. In the living room, the sofa is a Paul Smith series of green, yellow, brown and baby blue Maharam stripes, like Crayola crayons standing at attention. Color continues with a denim love seat and burlap wallpaper by Ralph Lauren, and on the walls -- in one bathroom, Mr. Cohen opted for Brooklyn-based Flavor Paper's Cherry Forever wallpaper; in the kitchen and adjacent sitting room, he has a whimsical floral mural, Field of Daydreams, by the same company.
"Our relationship changed a few years ago when we both became dads," Mr. Cohen said. Benjamin and Zena are now 5, and Mr. Cohen has since also welcomed his daughter, Lucy, 2.
During one of their play dates in the early months of the pandemic, Mr. Cohen asked Mr. Serhant how he would price the apartment if he were to sell. Mr. Serhant had been hoping for such a question.
"It's like moving into a magazine," Mr. Serhant said.
After spending two decades painstakingly building his dream home, Mr. Cohen hesitated about leaving. But no matter how many units he purchased and combined, there was one thing that eluded him -- outdoor space.
His new home is a four-minute walk away, in another Bing & Bing-designed West Village building. This one, a penthouse that he bought for more than $ 18 million, has 3,000 square feet inside and a 2,000-square-foot terrace.
"It was a once in a lifetime opportunity," Mr. Cohen said of the penthouse coming on the market. "I had to take it."
He doesn't generally mix business with his personal life, he said, but he's excited to work with his friend.
"It'll be like being on one of Ryan's shows," he said.
Whether Mr. Cohen's home sale will actually appear as a plotline in "Owning Manhattan" remains to be seen -- when asked, Mr. Serhant said he preferred not to comment.
"Bravo and Netflix might have an issue with that," he said. "But it would be like Deadpool and Wolverine, real estate style. That's basically the two of us."

Icahn Loses The Trust Of Investors: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The value of the 88-year-old activist investor's company has fallen by nearly $ 20 billion. Mr. Icahn said that he was "absolutely not selling."
Chief executives of public companies have long feared Carl C. Icahn. The 88-year-old investor made a name and billions for himself by questioning the decisions and strategies of corporate leaders and agitating for change at companies like Apple, RJR Nabisco and Netflix.
But now Mr. Icahn is under intense scrutiny from Wall Street investors, who are rapidly selling his company's stock. In the past year and a half, shares of Icahn Enterprises, his publicly traded investment company, have dropped more than 75 percent, losing nearly $ 20 billion of value. After dropping more than 30 percent since mid-August alone, it now trades at $ 10.53 a share, its lowest level in more than two decades.
Mr. Icahn owns roughly 86 percent of the shares, so he has personally lost about $ 17 billion.
"There's a confidence game and he's lost the confidence of investors," said Don Bilson, who focuses on activist investing as the head of event-driven research at Gordon Haskett Research Advisors.
Some Wall Street investors are now worried that the stock's continuing fall could threaten the health of the entire company and that it could be forced to sell companies it holds. Icahn Enterprises holds a mix of public stocks, real estate and other investments, according to interviews with Mr. Bilson and several other market watchers.
Investors have been questioning whether Mr. Icahn himself has been selling his stock. He has taken out personal loans using his stock as collateral. Banks that offer these loans typically have strict requirements related to the value of a company. A sharp drop in a stock price could force a lender to sell shares.
In an interview this week, Mr. Icahn said that he was "absolutely not selling." He also said there had not been any so-called margin calls on personal loans backed by his stock. Margin calls occur when a lender forces a borrower to sell stock to settle a loan. "I don't foresee margin calls," he said.
Shares in Mr. Icahn's company started tumbling in May 2023 when Hindenburg Research, the short-selling firm run by Nate Anderson, published a report questioning Icahn Enterprises' financials. Among other things, Hindenburg accused Icahn Enterprises of having a "Ponzi-like economic structure" and paying a dividend it couldn't afford. (It has since cut its dividend.) He also questioned Mr. Icahn's use of personal loans backed by the stock.
Mr. Anderson said in an interview this week that he expected Icahn Enterprises' stock would still fall further. He continues to hold a short position, betting against the stock. He said Mr. Icahn's extensive use of personal loans is still dangerous to the company's future. "He's got too much debt and needs cash. He's really cornered himself," he said. "There's no safe exit."
In April 2023, Icahn Enterprises stock traded around $ 50 to $ 55 a share.
But investors became increasingly skeptical of Mr. Icahn after the Hindenburg report was released, as evidenced by the sharp sell-off. The move out of the stock intensified after the firm cut its dividend in August that year.
The pressure mounted even further since last month, when the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Mr. Icahn with failing to disclose that he had personally pledged his own stock as collateral for margin loans worth billions of dollars. The settlement called for Mr. Icahn to pay $ 2 million in fines.
The stock has since continued to drop. Some investors said they are worried that Icahn may be forced to cut its quarterly dividend again.
Even with its rapid fall in share price, Icahn Enterprises still trades at a premium to its so-called net asset value, the value of a public company's stakes, real estate and private company holdings, minus debt and liabilities. Many publicly traded investment firms trade at a discount to net asset value because of a presumption that certain stakes would lose value if the manager were forced to sell.
At Icahn Enterprises, Mr. Icahn holds the largest stake in certain public companies, and some have fared poorly. Shares of CVR Energy, a Texas-based oil refiner, for example, are down more than 30 percent in the past year, and Icahn Enterprises owns roughly 65 percent of the stock, one of Mr. Icahn's largest holdings.
In the interview this week, Mr. Icahn said that Mr. Anderson's statements on him and his firm are "what we consider to be compete and total lies and extremely misleading."

Aaron Pierre: From Action Prince to Lion King

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Aaron Pierre was an unsure British teenager when he took his first acting gig: a narrator in a secondary-school production of “Moby Dick.” The school didn’t have a dedicated drama program and produced a play once every three years; Pierre had focused on athletics before giving the stage a try.
As he recalled during a recent video call from his apartment in Los Angeles, his adolescent mind was thinking, “What’s going to happen to me walking through the halls if I do this play?”
The show turned out to be painless. He went out, hit his mark at the corner of stage left and looked at the audience as he said his few lines. “I remember getting backstage and just being like, ‘That was amazing,’” Pierre said.
The roles have grown a bit larger. Pierre, 30, played the hard-luck soldier Cassio in a 2018 production of “Othello” at the Globe Theater. Film and TV director Barry Jenkins saw him and was impressed enough to reach out to the actor on Twitter. That led to Pierre’s role as the yearning and enslaved Caesar in Jenkins’ miniseries “The Underground Railroad.”
Since then, Pierre has played an ill-fated rapper in M. Night Shyamalan’s thriller “Old” (2021) and Malcolm X in the anthology series “Genius: MLK/X.” He currently has another major role, in “Rebel Ridge” (streaming on Netflix), directed by Jeremy Saulnier (“Green Room”); Pierre plays Terry Richmond, an ex-Marine who faces off against civil forfeiture and a corrupt police force. In December, he voices the digitally animated lead of “Mufasa: The Lion King,” reuniting with both Jenkins and actor Kelvin Harrison Jr., who played the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in “Genius.”
Pierre didn’t appear to be too caught up in the anticipation. “I don’t take myself seriously, but I do take my craft extremely seriously,” he said.
He talked about donning boxing gloves to train for “Rebel Ridge,” his reunion with Jenkins and how his admiration for James Earl Jones spurred his excitement to play Mufasa. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: You signed on to “Rebel Ridge” after John Boyega left the production . Did it take extra processing to fill the role?
A: I was made aware that Jeremy was searching for a Terry Richmond. And the moment I knew he was searching for a Terry Richmond, we connected. He sent me the script. I read it, no kidding, within probably five minutes of being sent it. I probably finished it within 90 minutes and then reconnected with him. I have a list of three things that are really important to me when I engage in a project. That is the filmmaker, it’s the script and it’s the character. All three of those were undeniable.
Q: How did you prepare to star in your first action film?
A: Jeremy Saulnier is, in my view and the view of many, one of our greatest filmmakers. He really creates an environment in which the artist that he’s collaborating with feels safe and they can also thrive.
So, he and the stunt team set up this enormous DIY gym. We had wrestling mats, we had boxing bags, we had boxing gloves, we had kneepads for when we were wrestling. It was phenomenal. I trained hard. I wrestled, I boxed, I sparred. I did all of these things just to get as close to the best version of myself that I could.
Q: “Rebel Ridge” is a more obviously physical role, but is there a physicality to quieter dramatic material?
A: There is physical preparation for that, also, because each individual is unique. It’s more than just physique. It’s physicality. It’s how you hold your frame. It’s how you engage with others. How you engage with the world, right? Even how I’m sitting right now, with my arms crossed and leaning forward. It’s all of those things.
Q: What was your relationship with “The Lion King” before being cast?
A: I have a really sort of personal connection to it, partly because it came out the year I was born. So I’ve always sort of rocked with that fact. It was definitely my most watched of any Disney film. Even today, having filmed this now for a few years and attended [the D23 fan event], which was awesome — after all this time, I’m still pinching myself.
I say this all the time, and I will continue to say it in every interview because it’s the truth: James Earl Jones is one of my greatest inspirations. And to have the opportunity to, in a small way, add to the legacy of a character that James Earl Jones created is just a dream come true.
Q: How has the actor-director relationship changed between you and Barry Jenkins coming from something like “The Underground Railroad” to “Mufasa”?
A: What stays the same is the way that he leads and the way that he helms these projects. You’ll find on set that the energy of the filmmaker, the energy of the director — that sets the tone for the duration of the shoot. And with Barry, he is so calm. He is so team focused.
On “The Underground Railroad,” he just ensured that everybody’s mental, emotional, spiritual and physical well-being was exactly where it needed to be to tell this deeply important story. And truthfully, he’s done the same on this.
Q: Did the way you work onstage have an influence on the way you approached this vocal performance?
A: When I’m in the theater, I do all sorts of things that are unique and specific to me. Maybe it’s weird, but I’ll need to be barefoot on the stage. I’ll need to place my hand on the floor of the stage and on the set to feel connected.
The action may not exactly be the same, but the intention of wanting to be connected is. So, when I do go into the studio, I still make sure that I feel connected to the space because that makes me feel safe, it makes me feel comfortable, and it therefore allows me to just give my best and hopefully achieve whatever the filmmaker is desiring me to achieve in these particular scenes that we’re doing that day.

Asian Men Are Finally Getting the Girl, or Guy: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It was not long ago that the actor and writer Joel Kim Booster first began going to auditions only to quickly realize that the roles available to him as an Asian American man were severely limited.
"It does not get better from here, no matter how many Chinese-food delivery boys you play," he recalled being told by other Asian American actors.
But Booster kept at it. And eventually, in 2022, he got to portray a gay Asian American man in "Fire Island," a groundbreaking rom-com that he also wrote. "So much of that movie," Booster said, "is just a literal transcript from my life."
As it turned out, things did get a little better for Asian American men in Hollywood during the decade that Booster spent toiling. And he senses that the momentum has continued in the two years since "Fire Island" debuted.
Many of the newest Asian and Asian American stories seem unconcerned with "the white gaze," he said. And so "the conversation has sort of moved on for a lot of people," he said, adding that his movie "almost feels a little retrograde now."
Indeed, since the 2018 blockbuster "Crazy Rich Asians" became a box office hit, Asian and Asian American stories and characters have proliferated in American pop culture. And after decades of degrading, often emasculating portrayals, Asian and Asian American men like Booster have been at the center of the new work, often playing the sort of hunky hero parts that Hollywood long kept out of reach.
The year "Crazy Rich Asians" premiered, HBO's "Insecure" introduced Alexander Hodge as the romantic interest known as "Asian Bae." The next year Randall Park co-starred with Ali Wong in "Always Be My Maybe," which Park and Wong co-wrote with Michael Golamco. And in 2021, Jimmy O. Yang starred in a Christmas rom-com, "Love Hard."
Asian American men like Booster and Park have seized the moment to work behind the scenes, too. Park directed "Shortcomings," the 2023 film that stars Justin H. Min as an angsty, flawed Asian American protagonist. And Sean Wang's coming-of-age film "Dìdi" premiered this summer, offering a look at what it was like to grow up Asian American in the early days of social media amid California skateboard culture.
Waves of representation can be cyclical, and those who study film and TV are quick to point out that representation is still lacking and that many of the characters who do manage to make it onscreen are often still marginalized in frustrating ways.
But as the number of Asian Americans has risen across the United States and audience members have shown an appetite for their stories, many actors, writers and directors say it is clear that roles for Asian American men have evolved, and the smattering of new, more nuanced parts is helping to propel a shift in how Asian American men are perceived.
"All of us want to push that narrative of Asian males being more desirable," said Manny Jacinto, who got his break playing a hot but dumb "himbo" on NBC's "The Good Place" and is now gearing up to star as Lindsay Lohan's husband in an upcoming "Freaky Friday" sequel after a stint in "The Acolyte" as a Star Wars Sith Lord.
"And the thing is," he continued, "those opportunities aren't really being given to us. So it's very much up to us to create them."
Emerging from a racist history
Many 20th century depictions of Asian American men in American cinema were stereotypical at best: the Chinese supervillain Fu Manchu; Long Duk Dong, a socially maladjusted foreign exchange student in "Sixteen Candles" who enters scenes to the sound of a gong; and bucktoothed Mr. Yunioshi in "Breakfast at Tiffany's," played by Mickey Rooney with a wildly over-the-top accent.
Even the virtuous early Asian and Asian American heroes -- the Bruce Lees, Jackie Chans and Pat Moritas of the film world -- were lauded for their martial arts mastery but largely seen as asexual.
(Asian women in Hollywood have frequently encountered the opposite problem: hyper sexualization, fetishization and objectification. One celebrated pioneer, Anna May Wong, began her ascent to global fame as early as the 1920s, breaking out in "The Thief of Bagdad" and starring in films like "Shanghai Express.")
South Asian men, meantime, were often slotted as terrorists, taxi drivers or caricatures of effeminate mama's boys: "Either the most dangerous or the least dangerous thing," the actor Kumail Nanjiani said. "Nothing in between."
Over the years, this lack of meaningful representation took a toll on many Asian American men.
"'I'm not into Asian guys' -- I heard that a ton of times when I was single," Park said. "What can you say to that? It's like, 'OK, that's your preference.' But if you really dwell on it, there are a lot of things that go into that worldview. And I do think the images we see play into it."
That is part of the reason some actors, writers and directors have pushed to show audiences different sides of themselves -- and to present different ideas about what an Asian American man can be.
Nanjiani, for instance, became a superhero. He was featured in the 2021 Marvel blockbuster "Eternals" at the same time that Simu Liu was starring in "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings." (Though, notably, neither of their characters has a love interest.)
Nanjiani said he "didn't want the first brown superhero to also be the first nerdy superhero."
"I wanted to look like someone who could take on Thor and Captain America," added Nanjiani, who reshaped his body, adding significant muscle for the part. "I wanted this guy to be like a playboy, you know? I kind of wanted him to be like a brown Iron Man or Batman."
Love stories without 'grand statements'
Many of the Asian American actors who have been cast in leading romantic roles in recent years emphasized that they did not seek them specifically to counter dated tropes. Instead, they said, it is worth studying smaller, more subtle creative choices in the films and series they have been a part of because it is there that the shifts in representation may be most visible.
Park winds up with Wong in "Always Be My Maybe" even though he plays the average-Joe best friend and is competing for Wong's affection with Daniel Dae Kim, in the role of the rich heartthrob, and Keanu Reeves, playing a parody version of himself.
"The goal was to tell a great love story, not to think too hard about countering any specific stereotype or making any kind of grand statement about Asian American identity," Park said.
Min recently starred as a romantic lead in "The Greatest Hits" opposite Lucy Boynton, and said his character was not specifically written as Asian. Once it was decided the character would be Korean American, "it didn't require a scene where, like, he's suddenly eating kimchi jjigae with his parents," Min said.
And in the Christmas rom-com "Love Hard," Yang's character, Josh Lin, gets his happy ending after initially trying to catfish his love interest.
Lin, Yang said, is "a really good man who ends up getting the girl. And I think that's very romantic."
Imperfections on display
Some of what Asian actors and writers have sought to portray about themselves and their romantic lives when given the chance is complicated -- and intentionally unflattering.
Booster said he was confident and sexually active until he graduated college and downloaded Grindr, where he quickly discovered that as an Asian man, he was unwanted.
"It taught me to hate myself in a way I never even realized I was supposed to before," he said of the racism he encountered. "I had no idea I was undesirable until I moved to a major city and was exposed to a gay community like that."
He baked that experience and others into "Fire Island," which he then starred in alongside Bowen Yang, a "Saturday Night Live" favorite.
Wang's new film, "Dìdi," similarly works to reflect aspects of his own life growing up in the Bay Area in the 2000s.
The protagonist, Chris, is told he's "pretty cute for an Asian" by his crush. A squirrel is shown telling Chris that no one loves him. And after he is labeled "Asian Chris" by new skateboarding friends he is trying to impress, he insists to those friends that he is actually half Asian, which they later discover is a lie.
"Girls would say to me, 'Oh, you're the cutest Asian I know,"' Wang said. "When I was 13, I really wore that as a badge of honor. They meant it as a compliment. No one was trying to be subtly racist."
"But when you're 13," he added, "you just internalize all of that."
Uneven progress
Actors and scholars agree that it will take a lot more than a few years of improved Asian American storytelling to erase a century of poor portrayals. Some acknowledged that progress is usually followed by regression.
Although 2023 saw "Everything Everywhere All at Once" win the Best Picture Oscar and surfaced several shows like "Beef" and movies like "Joy Ride," 2024 has offered up relatively little outside of "Dìdi," which debuted in late July.
Gedde Watanabe has seen a lot of these sort of stops and starts in the 40 years since he played Long Duk Dong in "Sixteen Candles." He knows that movies wield power, and he wonders what would have happened if he had more power on set back in the 1980s. How might he have addressed the gong, the accent and the use of the word "Chinaman"?
But for all of his character's flaws, Watanabe insists that Long Duk Dong did reflect some important aspects of reality.
"He wanted a girlfriend, he wanted to fit in," Watanabe said. "Those are things that, universally, I can understand."

Full text: The dispute started in the early days of the pandemic when the organization expanded access to a free online collection of books.
When libraries across the country temporarily closed in the early days of the pandemic, the Internet Archive, an organization that digitizes and archives materials like web pages and music, had the idea to make its library of scanned books free to read in an online database.
The question of that library's legality became a long-running saga that may have finally ended on Wednesday, when an appeals court affirmed that the Internet Archive violated copyright laws by redistributing those books without a licensing agreement.
The decision, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan, is a victory for the major book publishers that brought the lawsuit in 2020, and could set a precedent over the lawfulness of broader digital archives.
"The defendant attempted to do what no one had done before, which was to call unauthorized distribution of entire books 'lending' without permission," said Maria A. Pallante, president of the Association of American Publishers, which helped coordinate the industry response. "Obviously we are delighted" with the decision, she said.
A federal court ruled against the Internet Archive in March 2023, and the archive removed many works from its online library of books. It appealed the decision last September.
A final appeal could potentially be taken to the Supreme Court. In a statement, the Internet Archive said it was "reviewing the court's opinion and will continue to defend the rights of libraries to own, lend and preserve books."
In its appeal, the nonprofit argued that its Free Digital Library was protected by so-called fair use laws, and that scanning the books was a transformative use of the material done in the public interest. The court firmly rejected that claim.
To construe the Internet Archive's "use of the works as transformative would significantly narrow -- if not entirely eviscerate -- copyright owners' exclusive right to prepare derivative works," the decision said. "Were we to approve IA's use of the works, there would be little reason for consumers or libraries to pay publishers for content they could access for free on IA's website."
The library existed long before the pandemic, utilizing a system it called "digital lending," which allowed users to read copies of scanned books one at a time. The Internet Archive threw out the viewing limits during the pandemic.
In a petition to publishers to reverse the lower court's decision, the Internet Archive said it had removed over 500,000 books from its public archive.
"People are worried about book bannings and the defunding of libraries, but I don't know that there is really an awareness of what's going on in the movement toward license-only access to electronic material," Brewster Kahle, the founder and digital librarian of the Internet Archive, said in an interview on Wednesday.
Libraries are "not just a Netflix reseller of books to their patrons," he added. "Libraries have always been more than that."
Unlike traditional libraries, which pay licensing fees to publishers to make their books available for lending, the Internet Archive acquires copies through donated or purchased books to scan and put online. The nonprofit is also known for the Wayback Machine, a popular database of past web pages.
Ms. Pallante of the publishers association said she hoped the ruling would have implications for artificial intelligence companies that scrape data from book publishers and elsewhere for their products, potentially undercutting a publisher's so-called derivative rights of what is done with its works.
"It's not OK to just usurp those derivative rights," she said.

Full text: Among this month's picks, there's a blend of sci-fi and Hindu mythology, plus Nicolas Cage in postapocalyptic times.
'Kalki 2898 AD'
Stream it on Netflix or Amazon Prime Video.
Like the historical drama "RRR," Nag Ashwin's blend of science fiction and Hindu mythology is a product of the Southern Indian film industry. Whether the new movie will be a crossover hit like its Academy Award-nominated predecessor remains to be seen, but odds are in its favor. American viewers might not be familiar with some of the sources of inspiration, like the ancient epic "The Mahabharata." But others will ping instantly: the rogue bounty hunter Bhairava (Prabhas) has more than a touch of Han Solo; the future's dusty dystopia is very "Mad Max"-esque; the evil overlord Supreme Yaskin (Kamal Haasan) floats like Baron Harkonnen.
With rebels hiding in a secret city that stands in stark contrast to the baddies' high-tech quarters, the general plot combines Yaskin capturing women for nefarious ends and the possibility that one of them (played by Deepika Padukone) could be pregnant with the prophesied savior of humanity. Because the M.O. here is maximalism, the Indian cinema star Amitabh Bachchan fittingly appears as a gigantic immortal being, while the art direction and action scenes are eye-popping throughout. And because more is more, the movie ends with the promise that the "Kalki cinematic universe continues ..."
'Arcadian'
Stream it on Shudder.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Nicolas Cage is touted as the star, but this creature feature actually centers on his character's teenage sons, Thomas (Maxwell Jenkins) and Joseph (Jaeden Martell). All three have somehow managed to survive in a postapocalyptic world in which monsters come out and attack at night. When the sun sets, the family barricades themselves in their house. During the day, Thomas often spends time at a neighboring farm, where he has gotten close to a girl named Charlotte (Sadie Soverall). In the meantime, the bookish, methodical Joseph has a longer view of survival; he even manages to capture one of the (excellently designed) critters so he can study it. Of course, the arrangement is fragile in such a hostile environment, especially when it becomes clear that the nocturnal attackers are smart enough to develop plans.
The director Benjamin Brewer does not reinvent the wheel, but he knows when to linger (on the affectionate relationship between the boys and their dad, on quotidian tasks) and when not to (there is no back story or explanation as to how the world went to pot). This is a lean, effective story of survival and sacrifice -- and Cage, if you must know, is wonderfully restrained.
'The Blue Rose'
Rent or buy it on most major platforms.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
An ambitious exercise in retro sci-fi noir, "The Blue Rose" is not without issues: The pace often lags, the acting is all over the place, the plot can be hard to follow. And yet I found myself unable to stop watching. Maybe because like Wile E. Coyote, the movie keeps jumping off the narrative cliff, then bouncing right back up.
The writer-director George Baron wears his influences on his sleeve: It's impossible not to think of David Lynch (Ray Wise, of "Twin Peaks" fame, even has a small role here), with lovingly shot production design, mysterious blue roses, a nightclub named the Red Bloom Room and a pair of freakishly young detectives (Olivia Scott Welch and Baron) trying to solve a murder. But this is a teen-movie version of the Lynch universe, simultaneously over- and undercooked. The likely reason is that Baron actually was a teenager when he made the film so "The Blue Rose" is set in a kind of netherworld that looks and sounds not so much like the 1950s or '60s but like a member of Gen Alpha's idea of those decades, which is fascinating in itself. The movie takes big swings. Some of them crash but enough of them land to make Baron someone worth following.
'Sanitatem'
Stream it on Tubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This is overpraising Michael Kleinfeld's minimalist, interestingly modest film, but at times its main character's gloomy meandering reminded me of early-period Wim Wenders. Ilay (Felix Hoefner) does have a purpose: finding insulin for his daughter in a ravaged postapocalyptic Germany where everything, including pharmacies and hospitals, has been reduced to rubble. But compared to the action dads American movies have accustomed us to, Ilay lacks a certain urgency -- he is alive but already has a ghostly presence, often compounded by the snowy landscapes he travels through. Kleinfeld does not really fill in the blanks, but the mention of high radiation suggests something nuclear.
After Ilay finally gathers the 10 liters of gas he needs to trade for insulin, his fixer falls through and he has to source the precious medication on his own -- well, with the help of Loana (Margaux Tiltmann), a former doctor he meets in his travels. The film foreshadows a big plot point in a clumsy manner, but its slow, pensive pace offers a detached take on survival that's surprisingly poetic at times.
'Tomorrow's Game'
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video or Tubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Sci-fi sports movies don't make up a thriving subgenre: "Rollerball"? "Space Jam"? Now the directors Jonathan Coria and Trevor Wilson's family-friendly combination of time travel and baseball is at the very least giving the streaming platforms' algorithms something new to feed on.
Despite having an uncle who is about to be inducted into the hall of fame, the teenage Daniel De La Rosa (Alejandro De Anda) is completely uninterested in the national pastime. We are in 2002 and he much prefers his hand-held console to whatever is happening on a diamond. That is, until he is freakishly sent back to 1957, on the day his uncle, Santiago (Carlo Mendez), is making his debut as the first Dominican player in the major leagues. How Daniel will make his way back to his own era is the supposed point, but the real one is his discovery of baseball. His guides are another teenager, Sally (Miranda Meadows), and the excitable Jorge (Jerry Hernandez, along with the comedian Paul Rodriguez in the 2002 timeline), who teach Daniel how to appreciate a game. A subplot involving a bigoted broadcaster (Michael Broderick) touches on the prejudices Dominican players faced. As a baseball heretic, I can't say that I was converted to the sport's appeal, but it's enough that Daniel was -- and we believe in his epiphany.

Tubi's Free Streaming Explodes in Popularity, Outpacing Rivals: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tubi has exploded in popularity over the past 18 months, outpacing some competitors with much bigger budgets.
When Nicole Parlapiano joined Tubi as its marketing chief two years ago, one of the most searched questions about the decade-old streaming service was, "Is it a scam?" It was free, after all, and consumers were skeptical.
"Would it put a virus on your computer?" Ms. Parlapiano said. "People wouldn't even touch it."
That's not an issue now.
Tubi has exploded in popularity over the last 18 months, establishing itself as one of the most popular streaming outfits in the United States. It now consistently outranks Peacock, Max, Paramount+ and Apple TV+ in total viewing time, according to Nielsen -- and is drawing even with Disney+. Only YouTube, Netflix, Amazon and Hulu are still ahead.
The streaming service, which is owned by the Fox Corporation, runs a different business model from those competitors. In addition to being free -- with revenue coming from advertising -- it doesn't require an account to use, making it more similar to services like Roku and Pluto. And it comfortably commands more engagement than those peers, according to Nielsen.
"We're like the little engine, and it's just getting better and better," Anjali Sud, Tubi's chief executive, said.
Its sudden rise has come as something of a shock to many competitors, as well as investors.
Unlike its biggest rivals, which allocate huge budgets for original programs or premium sports rights like the N.F.L. or the N.B.A., Tubi's library contains tens of thousands of older shows and movies, many that seem to have been collected from the bargain bin. Some popular programs on the service include the 1970s procedural "Columbo," and an early 2000s UPN sitcom, "Everybody Hates Chris."
Horror, thriller and true crime programs also do particularly well, executives said. Tubi also has reruns of older network programming like "Empire" and "Scandal."
Tubi makes some original shows and movies, but often at a low budget. One recent example: "Slay," a Tubi original movie released this year that features a biker bar and a battle between drag queens and vampires. "We have rejected the notion that quality comes from budget size or critical acclaim," Ms. Sud said.
Or, as Ms. Parlapiano put it, Tubi viewers are "not embarrassed to say they're spending their time watching 'VelociPastor' instead of the biggest show on HBO."
("VelociPastor" was a 2017 horror-comedy movie made on a $ 35,000 budget that has been streaming on Tubi since 2020.)
For the vast majority of the last decade, Tubi was not a serious player in the streaming wars. Ms. Sud said that before she joined the company last year, she was only dimly aware of it. "None of my family, none of my friends were Tubi viewers," she said.
Fox bought Tubi for $ 440 million in 2020, the media company's effort to move into streaming. It has since become something of a favorite for Lachlan Murdoch, Fox's chief executive, who often touts its growth to investors in earnings calls.
Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners, said that consumers have become increasingly tolerant of commercials on streaming, and Tubi's popularity boils down to one thing: "People love free."
Another analyst, Tim Nollen of Macquarie, said that he was caught off guard by the sudden success of Tubi, along with other free streaming services.
"They seem to be largely venues for people to find random old things that they wouldn't have normally thought to watch," he said. "In many households, they have replaced the TV set that people would just leave on all the time. Now they put on Tubi and leave it on."
Tubi has also established a particularly strong following among Black viewers. In June, 46 percent of Tubi's audience was Black, far more than its competitors, according to Nielsen. It is the only major streaming service that has a greater share of Black viewers than white viewers. (The average share of Black viewers for all streaming services in the United States is 20 percent.)
"We have literally thousands -- thousands -- of shows and films that star Black talent or are created by Black talent," Ms. Sud said.
The Tubi audience also skews older. A little more than half its audience is over the age of 50, according to Nielsen. The audience of paid streaming services is generally younger than that. (Tubi executives said that adults under the age of 50 is one of its fastest-growing groups).
There is also a catch to Tubi's rise, even if it is not currently bothering investors. The streaming service, which relies entirely on advertising revenue, is not yet profitable. Ms. Sud said that the company was continuing to invest to reach greater scale. "Our lack of profitability is a conscious choice," she said.
Revenue is growing. Mr. Nollen, the analyst, estimated that Tubi drew about $ 900 million in revenue over the last year compared to $ 775 million from the year before. (A Tubi spokeswoman declined to comment.)
At this point, there are advantages to forgoing a subscription business. Profits have been difficult to wrangle in streaming for major media companies, and cancellation rates are surging. Between April and June, there were roughly 45 million sign-ups in the United States for video subscription services, but also 43 million cancellations, according to Antenna, a subscription research firm. That's the narrowest quarterly margin since Antenna began keeping records.
But Tubi executives also said that the volatility of the streaming business is benefiting them. As other companies raise prices -- the Disney+ no-commercial tier will increase to $ 16 a month this fall, up from $ 7 a month just five years ago -- and produce fewer shows and movies, a free service like Tubi is helping fill the vacuum for consumers, they said.
And Tubi executives remain confident that their frugal strategy can continue to thrive in that environment.
"We took what people thought were Tubi's perceived weaknesses -- older content, no stars, lower-budget movies -- and we made it our strength," Ms. Parlapiano said. "To be tied with Disney? That actually blows my mind. Their team is probably 100 times my size and I can't imagine what their budgets are.
"But because we have those constraints," she continued, "that's where creativity wins."

Trump Biopic, Denounced by Candidate, Is Coming Oct. 11: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The movie, which stars Sebastian Stan as a young Donald J. Trump, is scheduled to hit theaters on Oct. 11, ahead of the presidential election.
"The Apprentice," a biopic about the rise of a young Donald J. Trump that has been in search for a distributor in the United States since premiering at the Cannes Film Festival in May, is set to hit theaters this fall.
The movie is scheduled to be released on Oct. 11 -- ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election -- by Briarcliff Entertainment, a distributor founded by Tom Ortenberg, who was a producer on "Spotlight" and "W." The news was confirmed by two people familiar with the negotiations.
"The Apprentice," which is directed by the Iranian filmmaker Ali Abbasi and written by the journalist Gabriel Sherman, received mostly positive reviews at Cannes. But challenges began almost immediately when the former president threatened to sue, with a spokesman for his campaign slamming the movie as "malicious defamation."
One of the original financiers of the film, Kinematics, eventually tried to sell its stake in "The Apprentice," which is named after the television program Mr. Trump long hosted. (Daniel Snyder, a backer of that company and the former owner of the Washington Commanders, is a friend of Mr. Trump's.)
Several studios in Hollywood -- including Focus Features, Sony, Searchlight, Netflix, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Amazon's Prime Video and A24 -- declined to pick up the film, with some worrying that audiences on both sides of the political spectrum might find reasons to avoid it. Then Mr. Ortenberg, who has a history of championing polarizing fare -- including Michael Moore's "Fahrenheit 9/11" -- stepped into the fray.
The Hollywood Reporter earlier reported the Briarcliff deal.
"The Apprentice" features Sebastian Stan ("Avengers: Endgame") as Mr. Trump, and the "Succession" star Jeremy Strong as his former mentor Roy Cohn. Briarcliff is expected to mount an awards season campaign for both.

The Highly Deceptive, Deeply Loved, Down-to-Earth Carol Kane

NEW YORK — Do you hear Carol Kane before you see her? The voice that can go pipsqueak high or deep rasp, wavering at just the right moment? Or do you imagine first the mass of golden curls, which telegraph unruliness while actually framing exactly what she wants you to experience?
She modulates that distinctive quaver to match the character, too — “whether it should be lower, or denser, or higher, or an accent,” she said. “I work a lot on that. I get it as specific as I can.”
It’s nearly absent in her “Annie Hall” graduate student, and filtered through quiet Yiddish in “Hester Street,” the 1975 immigrant drama that earned her an Oscar nomination at 23. It swings from the pinched cadences of Simka, with her invented language on the sitcom “Taxi,” to the brash Lillian, the batty, mouthy New York landlord on “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.”
And in her newest film, the Sundance favorite “Between the Temples,” in which Kane stars opposite Jason Schwartzman, she runs the gamut from vulnerable to sharp — a vocal confidence scale that’s not far from how her own real-life lilt changes.
More than an eccentric character study, Kane, 72, who has been acting professionally for nearly 60 years, is actually a deceptively versatile performer who, through friendship and dedication to craft, is connected to Hollywood’s golden age — but also appeared at a sci-fi convention last month.
That she became known for comedy “was a surprise to me,” she said. This despite a four-decade sweep that includes that Emmy-winning performance in “Taxi,” holding her own opposite Andy Kaufman, and scene-stealing moments as a witchy wife in “The Princess Bride” and a fairy abusing Bill Murray in “Scrooged.”
Did she think of herself as funny? Not really. She started in theater and her first film role — at 17 — was in the Mike Nichols drama “Carnal Knowledge.” But she knew enough to heed the call when people such as Gene Wilder, James L. Brooks or Tina Fey beckoned.
“A lot of people are funny-adjacent. And Carol’s really funny,” Fey, a creator of the Netflix series “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” said by phone. “She’s so cuddly, and her eyes are enormous. Her hair is like spaghetti. But, you know, she is very much in control of her timing.” On some level, Fey said, Kane is “a machine inside” who takes a precise approach. “But she’s a proper actor, too,” Fey added. “And so you can get vulnerability and real feeling from her very easily.”
IN “BETWEEN THE TEMPLES,” directed by indie filmmaker Nathan Silver, she plays Carla, a retired elementary school music teacher who runs into a former student, Ben (Schwartzman), now a cantor, albeit a depressed one who can’t sing. They strike up a friendship (or maybe more) while Carla studies for a deeply belated bat mitzvah. The movie — funny, idiosyncratic, sad, neurotic and, yes, Jewish — hangs on their dynamic as widowers seeking something outside themselves. Many critics have called Kane’s performance among the best of her career.
Silver, who wrote the movie with C. Mason Wells, said he created it for Schwartzman. But it was not until Kane joined that it came into focus. When Schwartzman and Kane met on a video call for a chemistry test, “within a minute, they were comfortable with each other, doing a screwball comedy kind of back-and-forth,” Silver said, “and I knew we had a movie.”
Schwartzman, 44, said he grew up watching — being fascinated by — Kane, and even pictured her “Princess Bride” scene while they were shooting a pivotal moment in “Between the Temples.”
The story was personal in some ways for Kane, who is also Jewish (but wasn’t bat mitzvahed). It reminded her of her mother, Joy, a composer and music educator who, at 97, still plays the piano daily and who at 55 uprooted her life to move to Paris to study and teach. Kane said she drew on that as inspiration for “someone that, later in life, wanted to learn and become a fuller person.” Today, mother and daughter live together on the Upper West Side, so Kane can care for her mother.
Over a delightful lunch in Manhattan, she seemed most proud to share a poem her mother had just written.
She collects lifelong friendships with co-stars easily. “What took you so long? She’s an important actress!” Billy Crystal, her partner in “The Princess Bride,” said when I called to talk about her. They met years before their 1987 movie, at a party in Jamie Lee Curtis’ West Hollywood apartment. Curtis, Kane and Bette Davis all lived in the same building, and Kane befriended Davis, too.
In “The Princess Bride,” Rob Reiner’s classic fairy-tale comedy, Crystal and Kane are Max and Valerie, a decrepit, bickering couple of potion-sellers, and Kane has one of cinema’s great entrances, screaming “Liaaaarrr!” at her husband as she runs in, white hair flowing. She is on screen for about 90 seconds. And she is indelible.
“It’s just a little jewel in the middle” of the movie, Crystal said.
KANE FELL IN LOVE with performing instantly when she was around 7 and her mother took her to see children’s theater in her native Cleveland. Her family moved around a lot, with stints in Paris and Haiti, following the career of her father, Michael, who was an architect. When her parents divorced, her mother settled in New York, where Kane attended the Professional Children’s School.
Kane was a late addition to the small cast of “Carnal Knowledge,” Nichols’ 1971 marital drama. Arriving on set, she met the filmmaker and immediately went to see the dailies. Watching beside screenwriter Jules Feiffer and stars Jack Nicholson and Art Garfunkel — she played his teenage girlfriend — “I’m just like what? Just paralyzed with shock, you know?” she said. Nichols put her at ease.
“The best direction he gave to me was that he let me know — because I was terrified — that I would be enough, that I couldn’t do anything wrong because I was perfect for the part,” she said, and started crying at the memory.
“I loved him so much,” she said, “and that was such a generous way to welcome someone into the world that he was creating.” (Nichols died in 2014.)
THE LOW-BUDGET FILMMAKING of “Between the Temples” was her speed in some ways, but a challenge in others: It had no real screenplay. Silver prefers “scriptments,” more like a novella, which the filmmakers worked on with Schwartzman and Kane for months before shooting.
For Kane, the movie reflects what she has learned about her vocation and the pleasures she still finds in acting.
“When I was young,” she said, “I was a perfectionist to the degree where it’s painful. That’s what Bette Davis was. People think she was difficult, but she wasn’t difficult. She just wanted it to be perfect.”
“But that’s a costly way to live your life,” she continued. “I’ve learned, as I grow older, that I have to let a lot go. You have no control about what’s going to happen.” She’s in it for the moment, not the endpoint. “So, I’m enjoying it more.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An opening-night gala featured celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda, Alec Baldwin, Anna Wintour and Mr. Roddick (who won the tournament in 2003).
"This isn't my normal U.S. Open," said Andy Roddick, the former professional tennis player.
It was early in the evening on Monday, the first day of the U.S. Open tennis tournament. Mr. Roddick had just walked a red carpet inside Arthur Ashe Stadium in Queens, N.Y., and was chatting with a friend on a beige couch inside the President's Suite. The sprawling two-story space, with unbeatable views of the court, is by invitation only. Mr. Roddick, despite having won the Grand Slam in 2003, had never been inside -- until now.
"I used to see everyone go inside in their nice clothes when I was a player," he said, laughing. "Now I can finally see inside."
The occasion was the U.S. Open Opening Night Gala, an annual event that supports the U.S.T.A. Foundation's pledge to help 150,000 underserved young people in America play tennis. This year it raised $ 2.2 million and attracted 173 guests, including the songwriter Lin-Manuel Miranda, the actor Alec Baldwin, the ballet dancer Misty Copeland, the former tennis player Stan Smith and, of course, Mr. Roddick.
"It's really nice here," Mr. Roddick said. Indeed, the suite was full of friendly servers passing around unlimited champagne and Honey Deuces. One wall had a candy bar; another, an espresso bar. Snacks appeared throughout the evening. Guests arrived through a dedicated entrance.
"I'm going to come back even if I'm not invited," Mr. Roddick joked, clarifying he had some experience entering forbidden sections of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. When he was 9, he sneaked into the players' lounge as workers took out the trash.
That caper showed him the perks of being a professional tennis player: "There was free food and video games," he said.
For many partygoers, the U.S. Open marked the end of summer and the start of New York City's busy fall season. Guests used the evening to catch up with one another, both personally and professionally.
"Hi, girls," Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue, said as she waltzed into the room in a black-and-white floor-length dress and greeted the designer Vera Wang as well as the philanthropist Cheryl Scharf.
Mr. Miranda spent most of the evening in deep conversation with his wife and parents. "I am off duty," he said early in the evening.
Ryan Serhant, the real estate broker and star of the show "Owning Manhattan" on Netflix, was working the room.
"It's good to be at parties like this, in places where our clients are," he said. He was specifically trying to find a buyer for a $ 250 million penthouse at Central Park Tower, which was featured in "Owning Manhattan."
Just after 6 p.m., guests moved upstairs for a seated dinner of primavera tarts and green peppercorn filets with champagne served out of silver U.S. Open goblets.
Chris Evert, a former tennis player, gave a speech toasting Mr. Roddick, who received an award for his foundation. Mr. Baldwin led a spirited auction of items like a personal design session with Ms. Wang and lunch with Tommy Haas, a retired player who was also in attendance.
In between courses, Ms. Copeland revealed that this was her first trip to the Open. "I'm not not a fan," she said. "It's just not something I grew up watching."
Ms. Copeland hadn't researched the game, but she said she had watched the movie "Challengers." "I'm excited to just experience it all for the first time," she said.
Ally Love, the fitness instructor, said she had been watching tennis since she was a child. "When I first came to New York for school, I used to get the cheapest tickets I could get and sit there all day in the seat at the very top of the stadium," she said. "It was a great time."
She reflected on how popular tennis seemed to be at the moment -- the U.S. Open set a record with 200,000 visitors during this year's fan week, a 37 percent increase from last year -- and offered an explanation.
"Many different types of people are seeing themselves on the court on the faces of Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka," she said. "You see the diversity on the court, you see yourself represented, and that makes the sport enticing."
Mr. Roddick also noted that the tournament had expanded its food, beverage and fashion offerings. "They've done a great job of creating an event outside the actual event," he said.
Mr. Haas, who is also the tournament director of the Indian Wells Open, said he believed tennis had improved its offerings as well. "I'm all for making an experience for fans," he said. "It's very important that they feel comfortable and have all the amenities they need and are entertained."
A few minutes after 7 p.m., guests were ushered back downstairs where they watched the tournament's opening ceremony, followed by its opening match, in which Sloane Stephens of the United States lost to Clara Burel of France in three sets.
On the way out, guests were given a party gift: an autographed Stan Smith shoe in a commemorative glass box.

What Toni Braxton Snacks on Pre-Show: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "I love a good debate," said the R&B singer and actress, who can be seen alongside her sisters in the TV series "The Braxtons." "It doesn't always make you smile, but it always provokes thought."
Toni Braxton wasn't initially enthusiastic about rebooting "Braxton Family Values," the reality show in which she starred for seven seasons with her sisters, Traci, Towanda, Trina and Tamar.
"Not that I don't love hanging out with my sisters -- I'm just not comfortable with people being in my space like that," she said. "I'm old school. I'm a bit aloof."
She ultimately did it for Traci, who died of esophageal cancer in 2022 and who had been adamant that her sisters continue with the show.
Grief and healing are the main themes in the all-new series "The Braxtons," which airs on We TV and is available on the streaming service ALLBLK.
It isn't the same without Traci, Toni Braxton said. "Part of our DNA is missing. Everyone is trying figure out how to live in this heartache."
Besides "Braxton Family Values," Braxton is known for her roles on Broadway ("Beauty and the Beast," "Aida," "After Midnight") and for her many R&B hits, including "Breathe Again," "Another Sad Love Song" and "Un-Break My Heart" -- which she performs in "Love & Laughter," her joint Las Vegas residency with Cedric the Entertainer.
In a video interview from Los Angeles, she spoke about the thing she bought when she became famous, why she travels with two Apple TVs and what she snacks on before going onstage. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Victoria Beckham Satin Kajal Black Eyeliner
I love how it is elegant, simple. You get all these products sent to you sometimes when you're a celebrity and you're like, "Man, that's not great." This is a great product. And I don't have an endorsement deal.
Nude Sugar Refined Sugar Hair Mist
Sometimes I wear wigs, and I just spray a little bit of that mist on. It's great for natural hair; it doesn't matter the hair type. It's great for shampoo-and-go kind of hair. It just gives it that extra little "ooh, what's that smell?"
My Cast Iron Skillet
My sisters may disagree, but I feel like I'm the best cook in the family. And I think with the cast iron skillet, you can do anything from a steak to pineapple upside down cake. It's so versatile, and that's a must-have in every kitchen. I think every chef would concur. My mom gave us some when we moved out, so it's generational for us.
'The View'
I stay in my pajamas to the third act of "The View." That's, like, my thing. I'm a huge fan of Whoopi. I'm not really a news person. Sometimes it depresses me a little bit, but if I watch that show, it gives you a little bit of everything from what's going on in pop culture to what's going on in the world. I love a good debate. It doesn't always make you smile, but it always provokes thought.
Butter Pecan Ice Cream
My favorite ice cream in the world. And I had some last night. I started with half the pint, but now I'm up to the whole thing, and that's not good. So I can only do it once, twice a month. I don't indulge too much.
Apple TV
I have two of them especially for traveling, so I could have one in my bedroom and one in the sitting room. I have all my apps on it, from BritBox to PBS to Netflix. I love the reruns of "Sex and the City." "Suits" is my favorite. And I love PBS anything. It's not a game. I subscribe, I donate. What would be my favorite show right now? I love "Presumed Innocent" with Jake Gyllenhaal on Apple TV+. I like that they're remaking all the old shows again.
My Swift Run Leopard Print Adidas Sneakers
I have them on right now. They're old, they're crunchy. You have to take the shoestrings out. They're so comfortable, like sneaker flip-flops. People know me by this shoe.
My Chanel Backpack
When I first got famous, I went to Paris and I went to Chanel and I bought this backpack. It is a little discolored. It's my absolute favorite bag. It's almost like my good luck charm.
My Water Pik
Every day. Gum health. I'm into that.
Haribo Gummy Bears
I have to have four gummies before I go onstage. Just four, because you don't want to get juicy-mouthed when you're singing. That is my ritual. It reminds me of when I first got into the business and makes me feel like a kid.

Potential Futures Are Now Back in Play, and Reinvigorated: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" was a megahit in 1991, and every installment of the franchise since has been at least a little disappointing. Until now: The Netflix anime series "Terminator Zero" is a smart take on the lore, channeling familiar themes without feeling like a retread.
Developed by Mattson Tomlin, "Terminator Zero," does not focus on Sarah and her son, John Connor, the protagonists of James Cameron's first two movies and many of the follow-ups. (The short lived Fox show "Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles" was actually pretty fun.)
Instead, "Terminator Zero" takes place in Japan and centers on a scientist named Malcolm Lee, voiced in the English dub by André Holland, who gives the character the requisite gravitas for his philosophizing. It is 1997, which "Terminator" fans will recognize as a significant year: That's when the so-called "Judgment Day" takes place and the artificial intelligence known as Skynet turns on humanity and launches a nuclear attack. Malcolm knows this is coming and has built a competing A.I. he calls Kokoro, voiced by Rosario Dawson.
At the same time, Malcolm's three children and their nanny (Sumalee Montano) are being pursued by two visitors from the future: A Terminator (Timothy Olyphant) -- this one comes with a crossbow arm -- and a resistance fighter (Sonoya Mizuno). Their true target is Malcolm, because of the impact he might have on potential futures.
Directed by Masashi Kudō, there is a haunting beauty to "Terminator Zero," particularly when Malcolm consults with Kokoro in his lab. As the A.I. debates the case for humanity's survival with its tormented creator, it is personified by multiple ghostly hovering figures. The score by Michelle Birsky and Kevin Henthorn, a lighter riff on Brad Fiedel's clanging "Terminator Theme," is less abrasive but often even more chilling.
Through a mixture of stunning animation, extravagantly bloody action and heady philosophical questions -- What kind of future is worth fighting for? Who is worth sacrificing for the greater good? -- "Terminator Zero" breathes new life into a franchise that has often seemed stuck in a time loop of its own.
A Terminator voiced by Timothy Olyphant is among the menaces here. (PHOTOGRAPH BY NETFLIX) This article appeared in print on page C2.

Exorcising Many Demons, Real and Inner: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lee Daniels directs Andra Day and Glenn Close in an exorcism tale that includes melodrama along with the scares.
The director Lee Daniels frees his actors to exorcise their demons with audacious performances that rank among the most memorable of their careers. (If you've yet to see the mischief Nicole Kidman gets up to in "The Paperboy," you're in for a hoot.) With "The Deliverance," a riotously wacky horror flick, Daniels adds actual demons, too, sending his latest troubled heroine, Andra Day, straight over the edge. Day, a Grammy-winning musician, earned a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination for her performance in Daniels's "The United States vs. Billie Holiday." Not only can she sing and act -- here, she's an outrageous scream queen.
Day plays Ebony, a single mother plagued by bills, alcohol addiction and her own violent temper. Her three glum children -- Andre (Anthony B. Jenkins), Nate (Caleb McLaughlin) and Shante (Demi Singleton) -- have endured years of abuse even before something wicked in their new home urges the tykes to hurt themselves and each other. Adding to the pressure, Ebony's born-again, floozy mother, Alberta (Glenn Close), has moved in to recover from cancer (and criticize her daughter's cooking), while a social worker named Cynthia (Mo'Nique) drops by to monitor the kids' bruises, and, when pushed out the door, hurls as many nasty quips as she gets. When the spooky business starts, Ebony barely notices. She simply slams the basement door and keeps on trucking.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The script by David Coggeshall and Elijah Bynum is a riff on the 2011 case of Latoya Ammons, whose claims that evil spirits had overtaken her family were corroborated by a Department of Child Services case manager, a medic, a police captain and a priest. But "The Deliverance" is driven by Ebony's struggle to convince anyone to believe her -- the pitiless authorities refuse to look past her own flaws. To the audience, however, she deepens into a riveting character study, particularly in one close-up where Ebony agonizes over whether maintaining her truth is worth the terrible personal consequences.
The usual possession beats are here -- creepy crawling! smoking crucifixes! shivering violins! -- and given their own quirky spins. (One key revelation takes place over coffees at McDonald's.) Yet, Daniels carves space for the intimate moments that matter to him, like a shot of three generations of women braiding each other's hair while lip-syncing to "Valley of the Dolls" playing on TV. Religion plays a role, although the film dances right on the line between preaching to the choir and inviting hecklers to snicker. Similarly, we absolve the odd logic jumps and clumsy sound design choices in our zeal for the big, brazen moments engineered to make us race out of the theater and tell our friends what we've just seen.
The kids suffer a trauma montage designed for gasps, but Close's Alberta commands the most outlandish scenes. Sashaying in a peekaboo hot-pink bra and a pair of jeans so ripped they'd burst if she sneezed, Close has a blast seducing her chemotherapy nurse (Omar Epps) and hissing a jaw-dropping zinger calculated to bring down the house. You might not be scared during the movie, or have nightmares after, but I sure expect to see people costumed like Alberta on Halloween.
The Deliverance
Rated R for cursing and slapping, plus a bit of gore. Running time: 1 hour 51 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

The Wait For Shows Is Changing Everything: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Remember "Severance"? Remember "Stranger Things"? Today's leisurely TV schedules are taxing memories and changing the experience.
Time moves slowly in Middle-earth. Ages last for millenniums. Elves are immortal. Villains menace the land, are defeated, then are nearly forgotten before they re-emerge eons later.
By this measure, it has been a blink of an eye since we last saw "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power" on Amazon Prime Video. But in terms of our brief mortal lives and the traditional calendar of TV, it has been a while. Galadriel and company will return for Season 2 on Thursday, nearly two years to the day since Season 1 began in 2022.
This is the Ent-like pace at which TV moves these days. The "Game of Thrones" prequel "House of the Dragon" took nearly as long to come back for its second outing. "Severance," likewise a member of the debut class of '22, will return in January, almost three years since we last saw it. The teen drama "Euphoria," whose second season began in January 2022, will start shooting a third season ... sometime in 2025. By the time it airs, one assumes its characters will be eligible for Social Security.
More and more, rejoining a favorite series is like trying to remember the details of high school trigonometry. Which hobbit did what to whom? What did they do all day in that "Severance" office again? Was "Stranger Things" set in the 1980s, or was it actually made then?
There are, of course, different reasons for shows to take their time returning. We had a pandemic. There were labor strikes in Hollywood. Streaming platforms have been retrenching. Individual shows can have creative or staffing issues. Ambitious productions take longer.
But the practice is widespread enough to become a new, lackadaisical norm, which is frustrating to TV junkies who just want our damn stories -- and it's changing both the experience of the medium and our connection to it.
Like many elements of TV, this change in form is driven by the business and technology of the industry. The early days of broadcast -- no streaming, no DVRs -- had to forge habits in order to put the same butts in the same seats at the same time every week.
That meant rolling out seasons like cars off an assembly line. They would begin in September and chug along until May. TV was part of the rhythm of life. It moved with you around the calendar. Watching "ER" or "Cheers" was like being in a long-term relationship.
Cable TV changed the pattern but didn't completely break it. Seasons tended to be shorter and not wed to the September-May calendar, but series would often still be seasonal. ("Entourage" was almost always a summer show.) The longer breaks made it feel like more of an event when a big series came back, but it was still news when "The Sopranos" took over a year and a half between seasons.
As with so many things, streaming accelerated the trend. Its nature was to sever the relation between time and TV. The calendar meant nothing to streaming; there was no "fall season" to fill out. Meanwhile, as more money poured into TV, certain series became monumental productions that required much longer to remount. (The first several seasons of "Game of Thrones" were spaced a year apart; by its end, a single battle took months to shoot.)
At best, this can make a new season feel momentous and worth anticipating. At worst, absence can make the heart grow indifferent. I kept watching "House of the Dragon" through its second season; the plot still tugs me along, but I can't get invested in it the way I did with "Game of Thrones."
Some of that has nothing to do with the production calendar; "Dragon" is simply a drier story without the kind of vivid characters that drew me into "Thrones." But certainly it doesn't help that, watching a mere eight episodes after nearly two years, I spent much of my viewing time on Google trying to sort my Rhaenys from my Rhaenyra.
Granted, a yawning gap between seasons doesn't make a series any better or worse. If you're that bothered by long hiatuses, I suppose, you could always binge the show when it's finished, monitoring your cholesterol level closely in the hope that you live long enough to see the finale.
But these changes in the rhythms of TV make one's parasocial relationship to the medium less intimate and constant. Your favorite show was once like a family member. Now it's your friend who blows into town every few years, regales you with wild stories, then jets off until who knows when.
At heart, this is one more way in which TV is becoming like the movies, at least at the big-budget, mass-audience level. Now you can go years between installments, the way you once waited years for the next "Star Wars" movie. (At the same time, franchises like "Star Wars" have literally become TV.)
This pattern isn't likely to change soon, as the merger of tent-pole movies and tent-pole TV continues. This fall, "Dune" -- whose two recent movies felt like the severed halves of a TV season -- will expand to HBO with Season 1 of the prequel series "Dune: Prophecy," set among the mysterious sisters of the Bene Gesserit.
When will we see a Season 2, if we do? My vision of the future is cloudy. Like the Bene Gesserit's, TV's plans are now measured in centuries.

Mainstream Hits, From the Fringe: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Francesca Moody has put on some of the Edinburgh Fringe's biggest breakout hits. This year, she has three shows that she's hoping will go global.
One day in fall 2018, the British theater producer Francesca Moody was rummaging around in her bag for something to read during a train ride when she found a script she'd been meaning to look at for weeks.
Glancing at its first page, she read a scene in which a man logs onto his voice mail. "You have 50 new messages," the cellphone's robotic voice says. The messages are all from a woman named Martha.
For the rest of the train journey, Moody couldn't take her eyes off the script of "Baby Reindeer," a one-man play about a comedian's struggles with a female stalker who he occasionally, with self-destructive results, encourages.
"It was just a thriller," Moody recalled in a recent interview. "And what was amazing was it wasn't a normal victim-perpetrator narrative. It was about all the gray areas in between."
When the train reached its destination about an hour later, Moody didn't get up. She stayed in the empty carriage to devour the script's final pages. By then, Moody recalled, she'd already decided two things: That she had to produce this play, and it had to be at Edinburgh Festival Fringe -- the best place in Britain to generate buzz for new plays and musicals by lesser-known writers.
Success there, she knew, could propel the show to success in London. Maybe in New York, too. Although at that moment, she couldn't predict that "Baby Reindeer" would also secure a Netflix deal and 11 Emmy nominations.
Every August, over 3,000 acts head to the monthlong Fringe to perform daily in tiny venues -- anywhere from a dingy pub to a converted lecture theater -- hoping that critics or TV commissioners notice them. Most productions struggle to secure even a newspaper review, but every few years a debut show -- such as "Six," the hit musical about the wives of Henry VIII, which was at the Fringe in 2017 -- generates such word-of-mouth success that it sells out its run, and eventually goes global.
Over the past decade or so, Moody, 36, has been a driving force behind two Fringe breakout hits. Before "Baby Reindeer" (2019), she produced "Fleabag," Phoebe Waller-Bridge's 2013 show about a sexually adventurous cafe owner struggling to cope with a friend's death.
Now, Moody is such a Fringe name that theater fans, critics and TV producers make a beeline for her shows. This year, she has three: "V.L." a comedy about teenagers trying to land a first kiss; "I'm Almost There," a musical comedy about a gay New Yorker's romantic struggles; and "Weather Girl," a fast-paced drama in which a weather presenter has a breakdown against the backdrop of California's wildfires.
"Weather Girl," written by Brian Watkins and starring Julia McDermott, is one of this year's hot Fringe tickets, with a sold-out run and rave reviews. "Look out for the inevitable Netflix adaptation," wrote Allan Radcliffe in The Times of London.
Moody said "the whole world and its wife" was now begging her for tickets to that show, and she was hoping for London and Off Broadway runs. But she dismissed questions about whether the play had potential to emulate the success of her previous hits. "For me, it's unhelpful to look at plays thinking, 'Is this going to be the next 'Fleabag'?"' she said. "If you do that, you'll fail."
All producers in Edinburgh have a tall order to make their shows stand out. But Sonia Friedman, the Tony Award-winning producer of Broadway plays including "Stereophonic," said by phone that this also had its benefits. The Fringe, she said, was a great and cheap "petri dish" for working out if a show actually chimed with audiences.
Friedman said she'd had plenty of her own Fringe successes, including talent-spotting Rachel Weisz at the festival early in her career. More recently, she saw "The Shark Is Broken," a play about the making of "Jaws," that she then staged on the West End and took to Broadway.
Moody also seemed to be flourishing in Edinburgh, Friedman said, adding, "She has that keen eye for new groundbreaking, thought provoking, boundary pushing work." In the end, Friedman said, Moody simply had "great taste."
That sensibility has been shaped by decades of attending the Fringe, an event that Moody said had been the center of her life for almost 20 years. At school she wanted to become an actor, and first came to Edinburgh when she was 17 as an intern for Scamp Theater, a tiny company.
During that summer in 2005, Moody recalled seeing a play called "Angry Young Man" that changed her perception of what theater could be. Previously, she'd seen flashy musicals including "Fame" and "Blood Brothers," but "Angry Young Man" was "four guys all playing the same person -- no set, no props -- and it was funny and physical," Moody said. "I remember thinking, 'Oh! You can make theater like this as well!"'
She befriended Alex Waldmann, who was part of the show's cast, and a few years later, he asked Moody to help him produce a Fringe show. Soon, she was putting on her own shows, too.
In 2013, another friend and colleague, Waller-Bridge, showed her a half-page sketch for a comedy monologue that begins with a character eating a "very slutty pizza." It was still a work in progress, and Waller-Bridge had no budget, but she and Moody decided to take the play to Edinburgh.
Moody secured a venue for the show, called "Fleabag," and went about raising funds online. (The project's Kickstarter page is still viewable.) Then, to force Waller-Bridge to finish writing the play, Moody said she locked her and the director Vicky Jones in a London rehearsal room.
Waller-Bridge recalled via email that a few days before the play was set to open at the Fringe, she still hadn't written the ending and was panicking -- until Moody came into the room "and gave the most beautiful speech." That "grounded us all hugely, and we got back to work," Waller-Bridge said, although when she went to the bathroom shortly afterward, she discovered Moody "crying with panic in a cupboard." It was at that moment, Waller-Bridge added, that she realized "how insanely hard" Moody's job was.
Moody "has more passion for new theater than anyone else I've met," Waller-Bridge said: "Once she believes in your play, she will not stop until it is in front of an audience."
In a video interview, Richard Gadd, the writer and star of "Baby Reindeer," was similarly effusive. Moody "very much has a belief of letting the creatives be," he said, rather than deluging them with suggestions for how to change a script.
For all Moody's hits, there have been misses, too. In 2012, she produced "Nola," a verbatim play about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill that she said she had struggled to sum up in a pithy sentence and which didn't grab audiences. Moody said she put that play on in a too-big, 220-seat theater. "We were getting 100 people a day, which is a great number for Edinburgh," Moody recalled, but she said it was disastrous: "It felt empty." Now, she said, she tends to put shows on in small venues because if they sell out, that generates buzz.
There are benefits of being a well-known producer at the Fringe, including that fans seek out your productions so more tickets sell and budgets increase. When Moody first staged "Fleabag," she could only spend about 10,000 pounds, or about $ 12,700. This year, each of her shows has a budget of some £85,000, about $ 108,000 -- money that Moody said she won't recoup in Edinburgh, but might if a production transfers to London.
Even if Moody's funds are now gigantic by Fringe standards, she still can't avoid the realities of life at the festival, including the teething problems that many shows experience. At a recent performance of "Weather Girl," Moody walked into the auditorium to find it filled with smoke because of a faulty haze machine. Shortly afterward, she learned that 10 people had sneaked in without tickets, so the venue was overcapacity and the play couldn't start.
Moody walked across the stage waving fog away with a flier, and went into a back room to explain the situation to Julia McDermott, the show's star. "You're getting a real Fringe experience," Moody recalled telling her. Then, Moody headed back into the auditorium to fix the machine and evict the interlopers. "A producer's work is never done," she said.

Full text: I cover news in China and Taiwan with a focus on the technology sector for The Times. Based in Seoul, I stay connected with my homeland in Taiwan and explore the world through film, music and books. Here are five things I've been watching, reading and listening to.
Dear Ex
A widow struggles to reclaim her husband's insurance money after discovering the benefactor has been changed to his male lover. Set in Taiwan, this emotionally gripping comedy navigates the complexities of love through its richly human characters, including the lead actors, Hsieh Ying-xuan and Roy Chiu.
Kinakaian
The singer Abao is a member of the Paiwan, an Indigenous group in Taiwan. Her album "Kinakaian," which translates to "mother tongue," quickly became a hit after its 2019 release. I was immediately hooked by its blend of electro and pop with traditional ballads, despite not understanding the lyrics.
A City of Sadness
This 1989 masterpiece by Hou Hsiao-hsien explores one of Taiwan's deepest collective traumas: the Feb. 28, 1947, massacre of thousands of Taiwanese by Chiang Kai-shek's Chinese Nationalist Kuomintang government. It serves as a bitter reminder of the strides the country has made toward freedom and democracy.
Assignment China
I'm embarking on a journey through post-World War II China, guided by the accounts and behind-the-scenes stories of China correspondents. Mike Chinoy, a former Beijing bureau chief at CNN, chronicles these journalists' records of Tiananmen Square, Covid-19 and more in this collection of oral histories. It is a source of profound inspiration.
Suits
"Suits" tops my list for a feel-good show after a long day. Witty, humorous and sexy are typical descriptors for the series, but it is the chemistry among the main characters that makes it so captivating. Plus, you get to learn all the legal jargon, in case you need it one day.

Philosopher President, Near His End, on How to Be Truly Free: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A decade ago, the world had a brief fascination with José Mujica. He was the folksy president of Uruguay who had shunned his nation's presidential palace to live in a tiny tin-roof home with his wife and three-legged dog.
In speeches to world leaders, interviews with foreign journalists and documentaries on Netflix, Pepe Mujica, as he is universally known, shared countless tales from a life story fit for film. He had robbed banks as a leftist urban guerrilla; survived 15 years as a prisoner, including by befriending a frog while kept in a hole in the ground; and helped lead the transformation of his small South American nation into one of the world's healthiest and most socially liberal democracies.
But Mr. Mujica's legacy will be more than his colorful history and commitment to austerity. He became one of Latin America's most influential and important figures in large part for his plain-spoken philosophy on the path to a better society and happier life.
Now, as Mr. Mujica puts it, he is fighting death. In April, he announced he would undergo radiation for a tumor in his esophagus. At 89 and already diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, he admitted the path to recovery would be arduous.
Last week, I traveled to the outskirts of Montevideo, Uruguay's capital, to visit Mr. Mujica at his three-room home, full of books and jars of pickling vegetables, on the small farm where he has grown chrysanthemums for decades. As the sun set on a winter day, he was bundled in a winter jacket and wool hat in front of a wood stove. The treatment had left him weak and hardly eating.
"You're talking to a strange old man," he said, leaning in to look at me closely, a glisten in his eye. "I don't fit in today's world."
And so we began.
This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
How is your health?
They did radiation treatment on me. My doctors said it went well, but I'm broken.
(Unprompted.)
I think that humanity, as it's going, is doomed.
Why do you say that?
We waste a lot of time uselessly. We can live more peacefully. Take Uruguay. Uruguay has 3.5 million people. It imports 27 million pairs of shoes. We make garbage and work in pain. For what?
You're free when you escape the law of necessity -- when you spend the time of your life on what you desire. If your needs multiply, you spend your life covering those needs.
Humans can create infinite needs. The market dominates us, and it robs us of our lives.
Humanity needs to work less, have more free time and be more grounded. Why so much garbage? Why do you have to change your car? Change the refrigerator?
There is only one life and it ends. You have to give meaning to it. Fight for happiness, not just for wealth.
Do you believe that humanity can change?
It could change. But the market is very strong. It has generated a subliminal culture that dominates our instinct. It's subjective. It's unconscious. It has made us voracious buyers. We live to buy. We work to buy. And we live to pay. Credit is a religion. So we're kind of screwed up.
It seems you don't have much hope.
Biologically, I do have hope, because I believe in man. But when I think about it, I'm pessimistic.
Yet your speeches often have a positive message.
Because life is beautiful. With all its ups and downs, I love life. And I'm losing it because it's my time to leave. What meaning can we give to life? Man, compared to other animals, has the ability to find a purpose.
Or not. If you don't find it, the market will have you paying bills the rest of your life.
If you find it, you will have something to live for. Those who investigate, those who play music, those who love sports, anything. Something that fills your life.
Why did you choose to live in your own home as president?
The cultural remnants of feudalism remain. The red carpet. The bugle. Presidents like to be praised.
I once went to Germany and they put me in a Mercedes-Benz. The door weighed about 3,000 kilos. They put 40 motorcycles in front and another 40 in back. I was ashamed.
We have a house for the president. It's four stories. To have tea you have to walk three blocks. Useless. They should make it a high school.
How would you like to be remembered?
Ah, like what I am: a crazy old man.
That's all? You did a lot.
I have one thing. The magic of the word.
The book is the greatest invention of man. It's a shame that people read so little. They don't have time.
Nowadays people do much of their reading on phones.
Four years ago, I threw mine away. It made me crazy. All day talking nonsense.
We must learn to speak with the person inside us. It was him who saved my life. Since I was alone for many years, that has stayed with me.
When I'm in the field working with the tractor, sometimes I stop to see how a little bird constructs its nest. He was born with the program. He's already an architect. Nobody taught him. Do you know the hornero bird? They are perfect bricklayers.
I admire nature. I almost have a sort of pantheism. You have to have the eyes to see it.
The ants are one of the true communists out there. They are much older than us and they will outlive us. All colony beings are very strong.
Going back to phones: Are you saying they are too much for us?
It's not the phone's fault. We're the ones who are not ready. We make a disastrous use of it.
Children walk around with a university in their pocket. That's wonderful. However, we have advanced more in technology than in values.
Yet the digital world is where so much of life is now lived.
Nothing replaces this. (He gestures at the two of us talking.) This is nontransferable. We're not only speaking through words. We communicate with gestures, with our skin. Direct communication is irreplaceable.
We are not so robotic. We learned to think, but first we are emotional beings. We believe we decide with our heads. Many times the head finds the arguments to justify the decisions made by the gut. We're not as aware as we seem.
And that's fine. That mechanism is what keeps us alive. It's like the cow that follows what's green. If there is green, there is food. It's going to be tough to give up who we are.
You have said in the past that you don't believe in God. What is your view of God in this moment of your life?
Sixty percent of humanity believes in something, and that must be respected. There are questions without answers. What is the meaning of life? Where do we come from? Where are we going?
We don't easily accept the fact that we are an ant in the infinity of the universe. We need the hope of God because we would like to live.
Do you have some kind of God?
No. I greatly respect people who believe. It's like a consolation when faced with the idea of death.
Because the contradiction of life is that it is a biological program designed to struggle to live. But from the moment the program starts, you are condemned to die.
It seems biology is an important part of your worldview.
We are interdependent. We couldn't live without the prokaryotes we have in our intestine. We depend on a number of bugs that we don't even see. Life is a chain and it is still full of mysteries.
I hope human life will be prolonged, but I'm worried. There are many crazy people with atomic weapons. A lot of fanaticism. We should be building windmills. Yet we spend on weapons.
What a complicated animal man is. He's both smart and stupid.

Full text: Freshman engage in some fairly predictable debauchery in this routine high school gross-out comedy streaming on Netflix.
"Incoming," a bawdy teen comedy from the directors Dave and John Chernin, opens with a familiar gag: an awkward adolescent boy (Mason Thames) delivers a speech to the camera professing his love, only for a cut to reveal that he's actually rehearsing in the mirror. In a genre rank with cliché, this is not a very promising start -- it suggests that the Chernins, who also penned the screenplay, are satisfied with whatever joke is closest to hand.
The rest of the movie does little to dispel that impression. Its story of high school freshmen navigating a libertine house party follows exactly the trajectory you would expect, with few laughs and even fewer surprises. If there's a cute girl incoming, she'll be introduced in a slow motion montage. If a couple leans in for a kiss, they'll be interrupted by a lewd gag. Will the dork score with the hottie? Will the rowdy teacher get out of hand? Cue the record scratch sound effect!
A generous interpretation is that "Incoming" is derivative as an act of loving homage. In practice, it just feels old hat. The movie is heavily indebted to the teen gross-out comedies of the late 1990s and early 2000s, like "American Pie" and "Van Wilder," which were themselves indebted to the teen sex comedies of the 1980s, like "Porky's" and "Screwballs," and it's so far from an original idea or point of view that it's hard to see the point.
All it offers is ribald escalation: Instead of beer bongs, there are lines of ketamine; instead of fart jokes, there's diarrhea in a Tesla. Maybe that's progress. But I'd say the filmmakers flunked.
Incoming
Rated R for strong language, drug use, sexual innuendo, mild violence and "Porky's"-style shenanigans. Running time: 1 hour 31 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

Full text: Edgar Bronfman Jr. and his bidding group now have until September to sell Paramount on their offer.
Paramount on Wednesday decided to extend its deadline to evaluate a takeover bid from the media executive Edgar Bronfman Jr., the company said, a sign that the company is taking the offer seriously.
The bid, submitted at the 11th hour, could shake up the company's existing deal to be acquired by Skydance, an up-and-coming Hollywood studio. The $ 8 billion deal with Skydance was reached after months of negotiations. That deal is backed by Larry Ellison, the Oracle founder, whose son, David, runs Skydance.
"There can be no assurance this process will result in a superior proposal," the company said, adding that it "does not intend to disclose further developments unless and until it determines such disclosure is appropriate."
Mr. Bronfman and Skydance declined to comment.
Mr. Bronfman and his backers will now have until early September to convince a special committee of Paramount's board of directors that their offer is superior. Skydance also has the right to improve its bid to beat other suitors, which could further prolong the process.
Mr. Bronfman has assembled a group of investors that includes deep-pocketed private equity firms like Fortress Investment Group and a crypto kingpin who starred in a film from the "Mighty Ducks" franchise. Collectively, they have proposed to pay $ 6 billion for a controlling stake in National Amusements, Paramount's parent company, along with a minority stake in the media conglomerate.
The Wall Street Journal earlier on Wednesday reported updated details of Mr. Bronfman's offer.
The bidding group also has ties to people associated with Shari Redstone, Paramount's crucial controlling shareholder. Jonathan Miller, who partnered with Ms. Redstone at an investment firm, is an adviser to the bid, according to people familiar with the arrangement, who would speak only anonymously because the discussions are private. Mr. Bronfman is also friendly with Ms. Redstone and met with her in recent weeks to discuss his bid, the people said.
This week, Mr. Bronfman and his allies have been working frenetically to persuade Paramount to take their bid seriously. The group secured commitments for additional financing in the last day, and met with Paramount on Tuesday to present their vision for the company.
So far, investors seem encouraged by having another bidder at the table. Mario Gabelli, an influential Paramount shareholder, posted on X on Tuesday that the company's special committee should extend the negotiation window with Mr. Bronfman, noting that there was little downside to continuing to bargain.
Mr. Bronfman's bidding group has some international ties, which may draw concerns from U.S. regulators who oversee foreign investment, especially because Paramount owns the CBS broadcast network. Fortress, for example, is partly owned by Mubadala Investment Company, an Emirati sovereign wealth fund, though it is still controlled by Fortress management, which is based in the U.S.
The tug of war over Paramount has dragged on for months. In June, just as Paramount's special committee was preparing to vote on the Skydance deal, Ms. Redstone's lawyers scuttled the discussions. After a brief cooling-off period, the two sides continued negotiating and announced a deal a few weeks later.
Skydance would be a formidable rival in any bidding war. The company has access to nearly limitless capital through Mr. Ellison's family and pre-existing business relationships with major entertainment powerhouses like Netflix and the National Football League.
But Mr. Bronfman is a veteran executive in his own right. The former chairman of Warner Music Group, Mr. Bronfman is currently the chairman of Fubo, the sports streaming service that recently sued to block the formation of a competitor from Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in the case last week.

J.&J. to Acquire V-Wave For Up to $ 1.7 Billion
Johnson & Johnson said on Tuesday that it would buy privately held V-Wave for up to $ 1.7 billion, the health care conglomerate's second deal this year aimed at boosting its presence in the market for heart disease devices.
J.&J. said it will pay $ 600 million upfront, with payments of up to $ 1.1 billion contingent on regulatory and commercial milestones.
The deal is the latest in a string of acquisitions by J.&J. as it looks to drive growth beyond 2025, when blockbuster psoriasis drug Stelara is expected to face biosimilar rivals.
In April, J.&J. said it would buy Shockwave Medical in a deal valued at $ 13.1 billion including debt. Other recent deals include its $ 1.25 billion acquisition of Numab's skin disorder drug, and its $ 850 million deal for Proteologix.
The V-Wave deal pushes J.&J. further into the high-growth market for heart failure devices, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Shagun Singh. Reuters
STREAMING
Netflix Sees 150% Surge In '24 Upfront Ad Sales
Netflix saw a more than 150 percent surge in upfront ad commitments for this year, the streaming giant said on Tuesday, thanks in part to the National Football League games coming to the platform on Christmas Day.
In its second year of upfront negotiations -- where networks and media companies aim to secure ad commitments for upcoming shows -- Netflix successfully closed advertising deals with all major holding companies and independent agencies.
The company secured partnerships for several high-profile properties, including the popular series "Squid Game" and the upcoming movie "Happy Gilmore 2."
As competition intensifies in the streaming space, major players like Warner Bros Discovery's Max and Walt Disney's Disney+ have also turned to ad-supported plans and streaming bundles to boost growth. Reuters
TRANSPORTATION
Waymo Doubles Paid Trips In Its Robotaxis Since May
Alphabet's Waymo said on Tuesday that it had doubled its paid rides to 100,000 per week in just over three months as the autonomous ride-hailing firm expanded its areas of service and allowed more people to ride its robotaxis.
Waymo's expansion comes just a month after Alphabet said it was planning a multi-year $ 5 billion investment in the company even as autonomous vehicle technology continues to face widespread skepticism, tight regulatory scrutiny and federal investigations.
Waymo, which has about 700 vehicles in its fleet, is the only U.S. firm operating uncrewed robotaxis that collect fares. The company opened its service to everyone in San Francisco in June without joining a waitlist while expanding its operations in metro Phoenix. This month, Waymo extended services to the San Francisco Peninsula and to certain parts of Los Angeles.
Tesla is expected to unveil plans for its robotaxi product in October. Reuters

Full text: I'm a food columnist for The New York Times Magazine. I also write about cooking and develop recipes for the Food section and NYT Cooking. Though food is at the heart of how I experience and move about this world, there's nothing like animated television, A.S.M.R. videos and K-pop harmonies to refuel my creative stores. Here are five things I've recently relished in watching, reading and hearing.
BoJack Horseman
To call Raphael Bob-Waksberg's arsenic-sweet Netflix show a "comfort watch" might seem concerning. But the writing is so sharp and funny that I actually enjoy playing it in the background while I cook dinner or develop recipes. I've binged all six seasons multiple times and return to the show whenever I need multiple hits of instant gratification.
Cosmic
The K-pop band Red Velvet's latest single, "Cosmic," proves that five is the ideal number of vocalists for a girl group. Each voice is pristinely deployed (i.e., no one sings for longer than a few seconds). The choreography matches this sonic egalitarianism: Like the best 10-year-long friendships, Irene, Seulgi, Wendy, Joy and (my favorite) Yeri take turns sharing the center.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A.S.M.R. Crumbl Cookie Reviews
As an insomniac, I rely inordinately on A.S.M.R. videos to fall asleep every night, and my latest obsession is a popular genre where YouTubers taste and review Crumbl Cookies. I love watching people eat these elaborate, sometimes stale, stodgy and underbaked cookies. Are they too sweet? Too rich? Too much? Probably. But they make the best eating sounds.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Open Book
The first CD I bought as a preteen was Jessica Simpson's "Sweet Kisses." As a longtime fan, I've delighted in the concise storytelling in her memoir, "Open Book." The narrative also outlines her experience with addiction, which she writes about plainly and with grace. Most urgently, she sets the record straight on the whole "Chicken of the Sea" debacle.
Cute Animal Videos
My queues and feeds are just a series of viral animal videos: say, a baby elephant napping with its mother; an owl father meeting his newborn owlets for the first time; a drove of donkeys closing their eyes while a man sings "Country Road" to them. For a hit of serotonin in the morning, there's nothing better.

Full text: Summer on the island is packed with cultural events, and for many celebrities, politicians and filmmakers, the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival is a highlight.
"Ready for the Supremes?" the Legendary Chris Washington called out from a D.J. booth inside the packed auditorium at Martha's Vineyard Regional High School on a recent August evening, as he played Motown hits for the crowd.
It was one of the biggest nights of the 22nd annual Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival, a nine-day event devoted to celebrating Black filmmakers. The festival held on Martha's Vineyard, the quaint Massachusetts island, has drawn luminaries like the actress Jennifer Hudson, the director Spike Lee and former President Barack Obama in summers past.
Wednesday night's crowd of about 800 was there for the premiere of "The Supremes at Earl's All-You-Can-Eat," the director Tina Mabry's adaptation of the best-selling novel about a trio of lifelong girlfriends who call themselves the Supremes, after the 1960s girl group. Backstage, Uzo Aduba, Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor and Sanaa Lathan, who star in the film, were posing for a row of photographers as they prepared for the debut screening.
Ms. Aduba, who grew up in Massachusetts and occasionally visited the island as a child, said it was her first time attending the festival.
"To see culture and art and our stories presented in this incredibly placid and elegant and green backdrop, which feels like it weds so many historic vacation moments for Black culture," she said, "is wonderful."
Floyd and Stephanie Rance, a husband-and-wife team, started the film festival in 2002. At the time, he was a filmmaker running the production company Run & Shoot Filmworks, and she was working in marketing and looking for a role that would allow her to balance a career and children. They had visited the island when they were dating, and had long been drawn to it.
"Martha's Vineyard is such a special place to everyone, and it has a special history for African Americans," Ms. Rance said, "And I find that when people come to the festival, they're just like, 'Oh, my God, this is amazing. It's our happy place."'
They booked the local high school to hold the first festival, and as Ms. Rance tells it, only about 10 people showed up. But they weren't deterred: The next year, the couple pivoted to a smaller venue, a conference room at the Mansion House Inn, and kept going.
"They had a little room in the back with those old five-disc players, and that was the projection," Mr. Rance remembered.
"The mission is always to showcase the best of the best filmmakers of color," Ms. Rance added.
As the crowds grew, the screenings returned to the high school, and for Ms. Rance, running the annual operation became a full-time job. Over the years, the event has shown both indie films and big studio productions, and several years ago, it received accreditation as a qualifying festival for the short film category at the Oscars. In 2022, "Descendant," the Netflix documentary produced by the Obamas' production company, Higher Ground, opened the festival with a surprise appearance from the former president and first lady.
"There was a void that we were filling," Mr. Rance said. "Thankfully, it's just kind of kept going and kept going and kept going. It's like 'The Little Engine That Could."'
On Aug. 2, the festival opened with the new A24 film "Sing Sing" and an appearance from Colman Domingo, the film's star, alongside Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. This year, the festival screened about 70 films, including shorts, features and documentaries. Between screenings, there were panels, parties and high-profile networking events around the small island.
On Thursday morning, about a 130 women, many of them clad in brightly colored daytime dresses, walked by pastel hydrangeas and into the Harbor View Hotel, overlooking the Edgartown lighthouse. Inside, Ms. Rance was hosting a networking event for C-suite executives and other powerful figures.
"My ultimate goal is to get more Black women on corporate boards because that's where the power lies, right?" Ms. Rance said, explaining her vision for the day.
As attendees mingled, waiters offered trays of raspberry spritzes and mini lobster rolls. Ms. Aduba chatted with Ms. Mabry. Abby Phillip, the CNN anchor, took a selfie with Nicole Avant, a former U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas and the wife of Ted Sarandos, the co-chief executive of Netflix.
Marsha Cooke, the vice president and executive producer for ESPN Films and 30 for 30, the presenting sponsor of the festival, said that guests were talking about "joy, community, friendship and Kamala."
Over lunch, several executives including Melonie Parker from Google; Liliahn Majeed from L'Oréal; Tinisha Agramonte with the Walt Disney Company; and Stephanie Oueda Cruz of Tiffany & Company shared tips for navigating corporate America during a panel discussion. Sunny Hostin, a co-host on the View, interviewed Keke Palmer, the actress and singer, who made a surprise appearance.
"You are surrounded by folks that are engaged, that have had the same life experiences as you," said Trudy Grant, who works for a civil rights nonprofit and had come from Charleston, S.C., for the festival. "So it's almost like going to the movies at a family reunion."
Black vacationers have traveled to Martha's Vineyard for generations, many drawn by its reputation as a haven. In the early 20th century, Black Americans were barred from many beaches, pools and resorts in the country, but the island town of Oak Bluffs was an exception. The destination attracted Black families as well as prominent political figures and artists including Martin Luther King Jr.; Edward W. Brooke, the senator from Massachusetts; and the writer Maya Angelou.
The first few weeks of August are now some of the busiest for tourism there, and the summer social calendar includes Martha's Vineyard Black Book Festival and Martha's Vineyard Comedy Fest.
"What the festival has done is it has created an institution of creativity and gathering based on a 150-year history of gathering," said Kahina Van Dyke, who grew up visiting the island, and operates several inns in Oak Bluffs including Dunmere by the Sea. "And the people who have been gathering here have been artists and writers and politicians and academics and business people, and they came in the summer."
On Saturday, the closing night of the film festival, the Loft, a local nightclub in Oak Bluffs just past the beach, was transformed into a lavish lounge filled with roses, disco balls and plush red carpets.
More than 350 people turned out to celebrate "Fight Night: The Million Dollar Heist," a new series from the executive producer Will Packer, which premiered earlier that night for a sold-out crowd.
The show, which will be released Sept. 5 on Peacock, is set in Atlanta. It tells the story of a brazen armed robbery, which took place on the night of Muhammad Ali's famous return to the ring in 1970. Keisha Lance Bottoms, the former mayor of Atlanta, stood by the nightclub's red couches near several of the show's stars, including Don Cheadle, Taraji P. Henson and Chloe Bailey, as caterers circled with trays of pizza and macaroni and cheese.
D.J. Trauma, playing a mix of hip-hop and R&B, quickly pulled a crowd to the dance floor that included Mr. and Ms. Rance, as well as Alex Tyree and Nick Arrington, cast members of Bravo's "Summer House: Martha's Vineyard."
Ms. Henson, who had arrived after trips to Bali and Paris, said she enjoyed watching the premiere episode of "Fight Night" with the audience.
"In a community like this, they want to see you succeed, that's what I love about festivals," Ms. Henson said. "This place is very charming. But I want to know: Who is Martha?"

Full text: A report acknowledged that users of GPT-4o form unusual bonds with the software's voice response feature, which the company says warrants further study.
In a report released this week, OpenAI revealed that it had considered the potential for users to form an emotional reliance on its new, humanlike voice mode, which is featured in its popular artificial intelligence chatbot, ChatGPT.
Cue all references to the Netflix show "Black Mirror" and the Spike Jonze movie "Her."
The company noted in the report, which concerned safety steps that were taken during product development, that during early testing, users were observed engaging in language that might indicate the formation of a connection with the model. The software participates in conversation by receiving and responding to voice commands, images and videos.
"For example, this includes language expressing shared bonds, such as 'This is our last day together,"' according to the report. "While these instances appear benign, they signal a need for continued investigation into how these effects might manifest over longer periods of time."
The voice feature was announced this spring as part of the ChatGPT app's newest model, known as GPT-4o. The new version of ChatGPT was unveiled in May and the voice capability was made available to paid users last week. It is expected to roll out to all users in the fall.
The report detailed a variety of the model's capabilities, limitations and safety evaluations, including the ability to respond to audio inputs in about 232 milliseconds, with an average of 320 milliseconds, which the company said was similar to human conversation response time.
The risks of anthropomorphization, which is the act of attributing humanlike behaviors and characteristics to nonhuman entities like A.I. models, are heightened by GPT-4o's audio capabilities, which allow for a natural conversation with the model, according to the report.
It also stated that the humanlike voice feature might reduce the need for human interaction, which can be an upside for those experiencing loneliness but it could adversely affect "healthy relationships."
Blase Ur, a computer science professor at the University of Chicago who studies human-computer interactions, said that after he read the report, it was clear that OpenAI found reason to be comfortable with what it was doing, but that it had also found reasons for concern. Therefore, he isn't sure if the current testing is "enough," he said.
"When you think about things like car safety and airplane safety, there's a huge, huge, huge amount of testing and external validation and external standards that we as a society, and as a group of experts, agree upon," Mr. Ur said in a phone interview on Friday. "And in many ways, OpenAI is kind of rushing forward to deploying these things that are cool because we're in this kind of A.I. arms race at this point."
(The New York Times sued OpenAI and its partner, Microsoft, in December, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
Beyond OpenAI, companies like Apple and Google are working swiftly to develop their own artificial intelligence. Mr. Ur said that it seemed as though the current approach in monitoring models' behavior was to look out for concerns as the model was being used, instead of designing it with safety in mind at the fore.
"To the extent that we are in a post-pandemic society, I think a lot of people are emotionally fragile," Mr. Ur said, referring to instances of emotional manipulation involving A.I. voice features. "Now that we have this agent that, in many ways, can toy with our emotions -- it's not a sentient agent, it doesn't know what it's doing -- we can get into these situations."
This is not the first time that OpenAI's voice feature has been in the news. Shortly after the product was announced in May, there were concerns that the feature might be too lifelike in a rather specific way. The actress Scarlett Johansson, who voiced an A.I. technology in "Her," said OpenAI had used a voice that sounded "eerily similar" to her own despite her refusal of an offer to license her voice. She then hired a lawyer and insisted that OpenAI stop using the voice, which it called "Sky," which led the company to suspend its release.
In "Her," the protagonist, played by the actor Joaquin Phoenix, falls in love with the A.I. software voiced by Ms. Johansson, and is later left heartbroken at the revelation that the A.I. has relationships with other users as well.
OpenAI's report, it would seem, is an extreme example of life imitating art, with the company openly acknowledging risks that have the potential to affect people in the real world.
The company said that the additional research of "more diverse user populations, with more varied needs and desires from the model," as well as "independent academic and internal studies," will help it more accurately define the potential risks.
It added: "We intend to further study the potential for emotional reliance and ways in which deeper integration of our model's and systems' many features with the audio modality may drive behavior."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The one-name star of the HBO show "Industry" is composed under pressure.
On a humider-than-humid afternoon in July, Myha'la stepped into a teahouse in her Brooklyn neighborhood and joined the line leading to the front counter.
She was wearing a khaki skirt and a matching cropped jacket that revealed the panther tattoos on either side of her abdomen. Her nails were red -- she had politely rejected her stylist's suggestion to paint them brown -- and her pixie cut was slick with gel.
The menu seemed endless, with lists of flavors and foams that slowed down several customers placing their orders. Myha'la, a star of HBO's Gen Z financial drama "Industry," knew exactly what she wanted: An oolong latte with almond milk, boba and grass jelly.
The woman she plays on the show, Harper Stern, is similarly decisive. As her fellow bright, young overachievers crumble beneath the fluorescent lights of a British investment bank, Harper sees each wobble by a colleague as an opportunity to place an even riskier bet on herself.
"She's got the sort of killer, quiet confidence that's actually very dangerous," Myha'la, 28, said, having installed herself at a counter facing State Street.
When she landed the role on "Industry," which returns for its third season on Sunday, it was her biggest acting job since she graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 2018. She didn't have to look too hard to find common ground with the character, an ambitious young Black woman in an elite, cutthroat environment.
"No way is she going to let anyone know that she's this insecure or feels this underqualified," Myha'la said. "She has to show up like, 'Nobody mess with me, I'm the one."'
"Industry" overcame a muted initial reception to become something of a sleeper hit. This season, HBO has given the series the marquee Sunday night slot previously occupied by "The Sopranos," "Game of Thrones," "Succession" and "House of the Dragon." It probably helped that production of the series, which is shot in Wales on British contracts, was not interrupted by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes.
Now both the show and its star are eager to break out of "intriguing newcomer" status. Myha'la drew blood in "Bodies Bodies Bodies," the 2022 Gen Z slasher released by A24, then held her own with Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali in "Leave the World Behind," Netflix's 2023 adaptation of the apocalypse novel by Rumaan Alam.
The films represent paths that Myha'la might take from here: edgy indie darling or prestige drama star. She said she prioritized a well-written script, adding, "But I also don't mind if it ends up being huge."
She had just returned to New York from Los Angeles, where she had wrapped "Swiped," a movie starring Lily James as a dating app mogul based on the former Bumble chief executive Whitney Wolfe Herd. Myha'la confessed that she had not spent much time on the apps herself.
"I don't like meeting strangers," she said. "I don't like bars. I don't like small talk. I have five friends, and that's enough."
On her left hand was a chunky silver ring she had received a few weeks earlier from her fiancé, the actor Armando Rivera. The two met in 2020, when Mr. Rivera was assigned to interview a celebrity for a class at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. (Stephen Colbert, his first choice, was not available.)
Mr. Rivera, 25, proposed in their shared apartment in Brooklyn in early July, wearing an Etsy T-shirt plastered with Myha'la's face. "I'm her No. 1 fan," he said.
Myha'la was born Myha'la Jael Herrold-Morgan. She started going by Myha'la last year, a change that is reflected in the "Industry" credits for Season 3.
She was raised in San Jose, Calif. Early on, she had a penchant for breaking the dress code of the Catholic school she attended. Her mother, a hairdresser, had an eclectic closet that stoked Myha'la's interest in fashion. "She's always been like, 'I found these Prada loafers from Goodwill,"' she said.
Myha'la grew obsessed with musical theater thanks to a video she watched as a child of the original Broadway production of Stephen Sondheim's "Into the Woods," with Bernadette Peters in a leading role. As part of her application materials for Carnegie Mellon's musical theater program, she sang "I'm a Star" by Scott Alan. Before graduation, she landed a spot on the national tour of "The Book of Mormon."
Her plan to pursue a career on the musical stage was put on hold in 2019, when she read the scripts for the first four episodes of "Industry." "I just was like, I've never read anything like this," Myha'la said. "I've never imagined a young, 20s, Black American woman at the center of a finance drama. She goes left every time you think she should go right. She holds contradictions, she's complex, she's not idyllic in any way."
Harper is an underdog without a college degree, cutting her teeth at a British bank crawling with entitled Oxford and Cambridge guys. Myha'la plays the part with a compressed intensity, telegraphing anxiety, triumph and frustration through the twitch of an eyelid or a barely perceptible nod.
"We struck gold when we found her," said Mickey Down, the show's co-creator and writer, along with Konrad Kay. "In the first season, she brought a composure to the performance that was quite astounding to see from someone who is relatively inexperienced."
If the show subjects its characters to the stress test of an intense trading floor, it has done something similar for its young stars, most of whom were not widely known before being cast on the show. Marisa Abela, Myha'la's "Industry" castmate who went on to play Amy Winehouse in the biopic "Back to Black," said the two had become close through the "intimate" experience of breaking out in the same show, on the same timeline.
"She doesn't have much self-doubt, which I think is rare, especially for actors," Ms. Abela said. "Myha'la has a lot of strength in her convictions."
Myha'la is still adjusting to the expectations -- and the scrutiny -- that come with her raised profile. She has been vocal on social media about the Israel-Hamas war, posting calls for a cease-fire and resharing posts from Bisan Owda, a Palestinian journalist, about the two Al Jazeera journalists killed in an Israeli airstrike last month.
"When I first started to be outspoken, my manager called me and said: 'Hey, I just want to let you know that I've had a couple calls from producers, CEOs, whoever's in the industry that are calling me and asking, 'Is she antisemitic?"' Myha'la said.
She added that she was frustrated by what she said felt like pressure from industry higher-ups not to comment on the war. She said that she did not plan to change her approach, and that she operated from a place of love.
"I don't want to be led by fear, you know?" Myha'la said. "I can't not -- it makes me emotional talking about it or thinking about it -- I can't not do what feels right to me."
On Monday night, the season premiere of "Industry" took place at the Metrograph, a theater on the Lower East Side. Myha'la and Ms. Abela walked the red carpet side by side and posed with castmates against an HBO-branded backdrop for a squadron of photographers. Myha'la wore a silver Miu Miu minidress with reflective shards that made her look like a disco ball.
After the showing of the season's first episode, the crowd made its way to a party at Nine Orchard, a hotel on Canal Street with a rooftop bar where they downed green Jell-O shots and scooped caviar from a Gaetano Pesce vase. Myha'la appeared in a floor-length black gown.
Had she changed her outfit before or after the premiere?
"I didn't watch it," she said.
She had gone to get sushi instead.

Bond With Ashley Park In the Magic of Theater: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: TV shows like "Emily in Paris" and "Beef" are raising her profile, but she's still a fan of "the magic of a live audience."
Ashley Park has heard the criticism of "Emily in Paris." The costumes can be garish. (Bucket hats? In the office?!) The characters can be cartoonish. The biggest worry for Emily, the protagonist, is often whether to cut trauma bangs or what outré dress to wear next.
"Just relax. We want the show to be fun," Park, who plays Mindy Chen, Emily's best friend and an aspiring singer, said in a phone call from her home in Los Angeles. "You can fold your laundry to it. It's a really easy watch."
In Season 4 of the Netflix comedy series, whose first five episodes begin streaming on Aug. 15, the action moves temporarily to Italy, on a Roman holiday. Another change: For the first time, viewers of the show will get to see winter in Paris.
"I don't think anyone enjoyed that -- Paris winter is hard -- but the fashion is to die for," said Park, 33, who previously split her time between New York and California.
That move reflects the fact that Park, who earned a Tony nomination as Gretchen Wieners in the Broadway musical "Mean Girls," has increasingly found herself in demand as a television and film actress.
"When John Hoffman, the showrunner of 'Only Murders in the Building,' calls you and says, 'Hey, I would love for you to play this part; you do a duet with Meryl Streep,' there's literally zero percent, if not negative percent, hesitation," said Park, who appeared in Season 3 of the series.
On a sunny afternoon -- with her mother in the next room -- Park shared why she opts for hard-copy books, why she's never without a disposable camera and why she sends thank-you cards for everything. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Live Performance
It doesn't even have to be Broadway or Off Broadway. I love community theater and high school theater youth groups -- really any time I get to witness storytelling in its most pure and honest form. One thing I've found about live theater from doing a lot of screen work recently is the magic of a live audience. Even when I sit next to a stranger, we're all laughing or crying at the same thing. That's what builds community and is so entrancing and special.
Farmers' Markets
The first thing I looked up when I moved to my neighborhood is where the farmers' markets were. I have these wooden bowls that I got at the farmers' market in my boyfriend's parents' town in the south of France that I keep all my keys in. And so whenever I go to open this door or that door, it's nice to have a little piece of that here.
Books on Paper
It's probably not good for the environment, but my brain can't process stuff unless I'm reading a hard copy. There's something so sacred about magazines, newspapers and books.
School Music Programs
I went to public schools growing up in Ann Arbor, Mich., and I remember getting to have music class once a week, and getting to pick an instrument in the fifth grade. School music programs are vital as a place for kids to put their excess energy, find themselves and take ownership over their own rhythm or melodies. I didn't realize that other kids didn't have access to that.
Refillable Water Bottles
I'm drinking out of my Stanley right now. I'm so terrified about what's happening with our climate, mostly because so much is going on with weather and water and pollution and things that aren't normal -- did you see that orange sky in N.Y.C.? -- that if the one thing I can do is not go through 24 plastic water bottles a day, that's great.
Handwritten Thank-You Cards
One of the first lessons I learned in college, from one of my musical theater professors, Brent Wagner, was gratitude. Any time I've left a show, ever, I hand-make a thank-you card, and now I'm talking to The New York Times, which maybe says something.
Home-Cooked Meals
I've always been so scared of the kitchen. I'm really bad at cooking, but I'm never more fulfilled than when people make me something. It's fun to see them so joyful.
Arts and Crafts
It's the best therapy, whether I'm doing it freehand or following directions. I love watercolor painting specifically -- there's no wrong answer, you can just make a beautiful design with no rhyme or reason.
Game Nights
If you were like, "Ashley, do you want to go to this really V.I.P. club, or do you want to host a Monopoly or Settlers of Catan game night?" there would be no question -- I would pay money not to do the former!
Disposable Cameras
Since the beginning of the pandemic, I've been carrying either a Fujifilm or a Kodak disposable camera at all times. If you look at any purse I've worn for any event, it's always one that can fit that. In our digital age, there's pressure to have to make something perfect, but I love having a candid moment.

Even at 50, a Gory Film Propels Visions of Horror: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Eli Roth, Paul Feig and other directors with movies out this month explain how this gory horror classic has inspired their work.
The movies never recovered after "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" hit theaters in 1974. Focused on a family of cannibalistic, butcherous crazies living in a rural house of horrors, Tobe Hooper's sleaze-oozing film rattled audiences and was banned in some places. It also inspired filmmakers to take horror in new, more brutal directions.
Fede Álvarez, director of the forthcoming "Alien: Romulus," said that the "unapologetic savagery" of "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" influenced his work.
"It's a humbling reminder of how a hard dose of unsolicited anarchy onscreen is a key ingredient for any horror movie that hopes to endure the test of time," he said.
Beginning Aug. 8, the Museum of Modern Art in New York will offer a weeklong run of the film timed to its 50th anniversary, and will follow that with a retrospective (Aug. 13-20) of Hooper's other less shocking but still daring genre films from the 1980s, including "Poltergeist" (1982) and "Invaders From Mars" (1986).
MoMA didn't dawdle in taking "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" seriously: It added the film to its collection two years after the movie came out.
"Its power hasn't dimmed," said Ron Magliozzi, a curator in MoMA's film department and the organizing curator for the series. "It has matured."
Four directors with films out this month recently shared their memories of seeing "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" and explained how it inspired them. Their responses have been edited and condensed.
Eli Roth, "Borderlands" (in theaters Friday)
When I finally saw "Texas Chain Saw Massacre," it was almost a letdown. I was expecting so much more violence. I'd already seen Juan Piquer Simón's "Pieces," and that film delivered the goods. You saw the chain saw cutting into the flesh, the camera never cuts away.
But "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" unnerved me in ways I didn't expect. I didn't know it was going to start with those solar flares, and the strange music that blurs the line between score and sound design. The actors didn't feel like actors. I wasn't scared by it. I wanted to live in it. It was a movie just dripping with mood and atmosphere, and it felt like it had been made by serial killers.
Maybe it was the boring gray, overcast, endless late-fall weather I grew up with in Massachusetts, but something about the Texas heat and the strange world of this Manson-like family living in a shack appealed to me. I was terrified that people could live this way, it seemed too real to be a movie.
The film endures because Tobe saw what was coming: men being replaced by machines, and the dreaded feeling of uselessness. What do you do with those skills when a machine replaces you?
Hollywood is currently facing that same problem with A.I. What happens when we're no longer needed? What happens when a computer does it for us? What do we do with all of those ideas still in our head? Are we doomed to go crazy in our houses, turning them into slaughterhouses for our own creativity, writing ideas that no one will ever see because a machine has done it for us? It's about the fear of becoming obsolete. We are now all the family in "Texas Chain Saw Massacre."
Lee Daniels, "The Deliverance" (Netflix, Aug. 30)
It was wild. You didn't know what to expect and you didn't know what was coming at you. As a kid, I think the closest thing that was like it was "Night of the Living Dead" -- massacres and blood and everything and anything. The gloves were off. I remember thinking that Tobe played into the fun elements of horror, where there was no fun in "The Exorcist."
Tobe's audaciousness inspired me as a filmmaker. It's hard because executives will tell you what audiences want to see, but audiences want to see what you want to see. I don't think you could get away with "Texas Chain Saw" today at a studio. Everyone is so politically correct. Tobe took chances. That's what great filmmakers do: You're bold in your thought processes, and you take major risks even if they don't work. That's why "Poltergeist" and "Texas Chain Saw" work: Crazy-ass things happen.
Paul Feig, "Jackpot!" (Amazon Prime Video, Aug. 15)
I have a strong memory of seeing "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" at the Nuart Theater in Los Angeles, with a completely packed audience. What threw me about it was how hyper-realistic the tone was, starting with that John Larroquette narration, and the fact that there's no music, just the sound effects that sound like the inside of a slaughterhouse. The acting is all pretty raw. It skirted between having a B-movie vibe and a documentary vibe. That tone makes everything more scary. "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is not that far off from a found-footage film.
It's also not far off from "The Office." The cameras are loose, and it's not precise. It feels real because it's so messy. Audiences have gotten used to the style. All the videos we've been watching over the years on YouTube aren't polished. It's cats creating havoc and people falling down. It's a garage-band ethos. It sounds cruel to say, but the idea of manipulating an audience that heavily into a giant emotion is what we do in comedy, too. After they scream, they laugh.
JT Mollner, "Strange Darling" (in theaters, Aug. 23)
I wasn't born when the original "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" came out. My first experience with it was from stumbling upon a movie on late-night TV called "Terror in the Aisles," hosted by Elvira. I was fascinated with it because my parents would not let me watch rated-R horror films. This movie showed clips from iconic horror films, and it was a way for me to get a little glimpse into all the movies I wasn't allowed to see.
A scene from "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" came on. It was quick but visceral: A woman in distress, standing in front of a sliding door. The door opens. Leatherface emerges, grabs the woman. She struggles but is no match for him. He's like a wild animal, ferocious. He drags her into the room he came out of and slams the door shut, violently. That was it: narratively simple but deeply disturbing. It was more terrifying and impactful than any complete horror film I'd ever watched. Years later, when I finally saw the full movie, it didn't disappoint.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lyles said he started feeling ill two days ago and knew it was more than just soreness from winning the 100. In Paris, there are no testing requirements, and national governing bodies develop their own protocols.
Almost as soon as he crossed the finish line in the 200-meter dash on Thursday night, Noah Lyles looked winded. He lay on his back on the purple track at Stade de France, after finishing third in a race he had dominated for the last three years, and struggled for breath.
Four days after winning a gold medal in one of the most thrilling endings to an Olympic sprint, Lyles took the bronze in the 200 and considered it, he said afterward, a remarkable achievement. Lyles learned that he had tested positive for the coronavirus around 5 a.m. Paris time on Tuesday, less than 36 hours after he won the 100 in a photo finish that was a stunning start to an Olympic campaign he hoped would position him as the next great American track and field star.
But on Tuesday, after waking up with chills, aches and a sore throat, symptoms he had experienced during previous exposures, Lyles left the athletes' village to quarantine in a nearby hotel. He said he was taking the antiviral treatment Paxlovid, and that he had not once considered dropping out or revealing his condition in advance of the 200 final. Athletes are not required to test or to report Covid-19 cases.
"We didn't want everybody to go into a panic, we wanted them to be able to compete," Lyles, wearing an N-95 mask, told reporters about 45 minutes after finishing in 19.70 seconds, behind Letsile Tebogo of Botswana (19.46), who won his country's first Olympic gold medal in its history, and the American Kenneth Bednarek (19.62). Lyles added: "And you never want to tell your competitors you're sick. Why would you give them an edge?"
The Paris Olympics are the first to be held without the pandemic-era bubbles of the Tokyo Games in 2021 and the Beijing Games in 2022. In Tokyo, athletes were tested every four days. In Beijing, they were tested daily. When athletes tested positive, they were placed in quarantine. Most were forced to withdraw from the Games entirely.
National governing bodies have been tasked with creating their own Covid protocols. Few have specific policies, and many have resorted to something that resembles common sense. A positive test has not stopped athletes from competing.
Zac Stubblety-Cook, an Australian swimmer, had Covid when he won silver in the 200 backstroke. The British swimmer Adam Peaty learned he had Covid a day after winning silver in the 100 breaststroke. Lani Pallister, another Australian swimmer, tested positive for Covid and decided to race two days later as part of the 4x200 relay team, which won gold.
For Lyles, who also has asthma, the first clue that he was not at full strength emerged on Wednesday, when Tebogo raced past him in a semifinal heat; Lyles had won the last two world titles in the 200 -- and had not lost in the event since 2021 -- and so it seemed it was likely that he was lagging on purpose, conserving energy before Thursday's final and the upcoming 4x100 relays.
When Lyles was introduced on Thursday night, he darted out of the tunnel, spinning and shouting and pointing to the crowd. The crowd chanted "U.S.A.! U.S.A.!" until they were shushed over the arena loudspeakers.
At the gun, Lyles got off the blocks slower than the seven other finalists. But unlike Sunday, when he trailed for the first 90 meters before edging Kishane Thompson of Jamaica at the end, Lyles lacked endurance and speed, particularly around the bend.
Afterward, Lyles sat near the track, breathing heavily. He got up slowly and called for water, after which medical officials led him to a seat and spoke to him.
"Our primary commitment is to ensure the safety of Team U.S.A. athletes while upholding their right to compete," U.S.A. Track and Field, the sport's national governing body, said in a statement on Thursday night. "We respect his decision and will continue to monitor his condition closely."
Lyles entered these Olympics eager to reassert his primacy after floundering at the Tokyo Games, where he finished with a bronze medal in the 200 and opened up about his struggles with his mental health. He called his medal "boring" as he spoke through tears to reporters, the only people who were in the stadium.
Lyles, 27, thinks of racing as performance art. He loves to race and win, but he loves to race and win in front of a full stadium even more -- the bigger and louder and feistier the crowd, the better.
He has ripped his speedsuit in triumph after winning world championships, presented anime cards to the camera before and after races, and has become a ubiquitous figure on his Peacock series, YouTube channel and the Netflix docuseries "Sprint."
At the 2023 world championships in Budapest, he turned in the performance he had long said he was capable of, winning the 100, 200 and the 4x100 meter relay. He had been eager to go for that trifecta in Paris, too, and perhaps add a gold medal in the 4x400 to it.
Instead, the rest of Lyles's program is in doubt. He did not win the sprint double, like Usain Bolt or Carl Lewis or Jesse Owens, and it wasn't clear on Thursday whether he would run in any relays.

Full text: A Dickensian tradition finds a new audience on TikTok.
Time is money. That age-old aphorism is particularly true on TikTok, where holding onto viewers for even a single second longer can translate into greater algorithmic reach and, thus, higher earning potential.
It makes sense, then, that a content style has emerged that favors epic sagas broken down into shorter clips. If Homer were a TikTok influencer, Odysseus' encounter with Polyphemus the Cyclops would cut just before our hero blinds the monster. For that, you'd have to watch the next video. And the next, and the next.
Creators have perfected the craft of offering just enough plot to keep viewers hooked and scrolling to find out what happens next. In February, Tareasa Johnson, better known as Reesa Teesa, captivated millions with a series entitled "Who TF Did I Marry?!?" Her creation, which comprised more than 50 videos, unspooled the many apparent fabrications of Ms. Johnson's ex-partner, Legion, who Ms. Johnson said had lied to her about his career, family and wealth.
Scrolling through her account, the videos blur together into a grid of images of Ms. Johnson as she speaks directly to the camera in clips totaling over six hours of watch time. The clips, easily digestible dopamine hits, seemed to scratch a particular cultural itch in an era when attention spans are often short.
In the months since, a number of influencers and content creators have taken their cues from Ms. Johnson, stylizing their personal stories into multipart narratives. Recently, Brooke Schofield, the content creator who hosts the podcast "Cancelled" with Tana Mongeau, posted a series in which she accused an ex-boyfriend of telling a number of falsehoods during their brief relationship. Ms. Schofield's former paramour, the musician Clinton Kane (best known for his song "Chicken Tendies") has since rebutted with his own lengthy series of video clips. His series is titled "Who Did I Date Not Marry," in a nod to Ms. Johnson's opus.
Inspired by Ms. Schofield, the content creator Chris Olsen scored millions of views across a 19-part series about a negative experience in a past relationship. Haley Kalil, known online as @haleyybaylee, posted a similarly dramatic tell-all about an ex-boyfriend she claimed was a billionaire. (She has since deleted the videos and faced criticism online for the series, which some users believe she fabricated. Ms. Kalil did not respond to a request for comment.)
On social media, where fact-checking is often second to entertaining, fantastic and wild stories have become the coin of the realm. But telling stories in installments is a -- pardon the pun -- storied tradition. The modern-day iterations hearken back to the age of serialized fiction published in newspapers and pamphlets. Readers reportedly stormed the docks in New York City in 1841 when the final installment of "The Old Curiosity Shop" by Charles Dickens arrived from across the pond. (Spoiler alert: The ending wasn't a happy one for the story's protagonist, Little Nell Trent.)
On YouTube, extra-long videos are known as storytimes, a format popularized largely as a result of the platform's monetization structure. (The longer the video, the more ads that could be played during said video.) A Twitter thread from 2015 about a road trip to Florida was eventually adapted into the feature film "Zola," directed by Janicza Bravo. In the 2010s, the self-publishing platform Wattpad offered amateur writers a space to tell tales in installments. (Some of Wattpad's biggest success stories even got the Hollywood treatment; among them, One Direction fan fiction by Anna Todd was adapted into five Netflix movies.)
With each new platform, users reinvent the same storytelling style, often with an eye toward potential profits. The state of the attention economy means every millisecond counts. TikTok creators who meet certain criteria -- like age and minimum follower count -- are eligible to earn commission from the platform's creator rewards program. And even for those creators whose videos are not eligible for monetization, getting more viewers is still a good thing: Each view increases the chance that the platform's opaque and powerful algorithm will prioritize their content.
Your attention time has value, and these creators know it.

Bloomberg's Charity Donates $600 Million to Historically Black Medical Schools: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bloomberg Philanthropies gives what are thought to be record-breaking gifts to the endowments of Meharry Medical College, Morehouse and Howard University.
Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire and former New York City mayor, is giving $ 600 million to the country's four historically Black medical schools, which account for a significant percentage of all medical degrees awarded to Black doctors.
Through his charitable organization, Bloomberg Philanthropies, Mr. Bloomberg is giving $ 175 million each to Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta and Howard University College of Medicine in Washington. These donations are believed to be the largest ever to any single H.B.C.U., surpassing the $ 100 million gift that Spelman College in Atlanta announced in January.
The foundation is also giving $ 75 million to Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles and an additional $ 5 million to help start a new medical school at Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans.
Dr. James E.K. Hildreth, president and chief executive of Meharry Medical College, said in an interview that the gift was "just a major, major investment that will have generational impact."
The money is targeted at the medical schools' endowments, which an announcement on Tuesday morning described as "significantly underfunded" as a result of entrenched discrimination and lagging federal and state support.
Despite their small number, the historically Black medical schools are strong engines of social mobility for their graduates, and contributors to the well-being of Black communities, research shows.
Only about 5 percent of U.S. doctors are Black, according to a 2022 report from the Association of American Medical Colleges. But H.B.C.U.s play an outsize role in their education. Graduates of historically Black colleges and universities account for half of the country's Black doctors, according to the United Negro College Fund. And in 2021-22, 10 percent of medical degrees to Black graduates were awarded by H.B.C.U.s, according to federal data.
Mr. Bloomberg's donation comes as medical schools are grappling with a new and possibly more forbidding environment around the quest for a diverse student body. The Supreme Court has banned race-conscious admissions, a move that could further influence who is admitted to medical school, especially elite medical schools.
And at least three medical schools -- New York University, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Johns Hopkins University (in an initiative funded by Mr. Bloomberg in July) -- have instituted free tuition for most or all students. There is some evidence that free tuition, while intended to provide more opportunity for lower-income students, can drive medical school admissions to become more competitive, in turn making them less diverse.
"We have much more to do to build a country where every person, regardless of race, has equal access to quality health care, and where students from all backgrounds can pursue their dreams," Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement.
The donation aims, in a sense, to right a historic blow to Black medical education. The Flexner Report of 1910, an exposé of medical education in general, led to the closing of five of the seven historically Black medical schools then in existence. It recommended that only Meharry and Howard should survive. Ever since, there has been a struggle to increase the number of Black doctors, who are likely to go into Black communities to practice, and who research has shown achieve better outcomes for their Black patients.
"For decades after that, most of the Black doctors in this country came out of Howard and Meharry," Dr. Hildreth said. "African Americans were being excluded for the most part from white schools in the South, and they were looking to Meharry in particular for their training. It's a legacy on one hand we're proud of. On the other hand, it's not a happy one for the country, I think."
This is not Mr. Bloomberg's first contribution to H.B.C.U.s. In September 2020, his Greenwood Initiative announced a $ 100 million gift to the four H.B.C.U. medical schools to reduce student debt.
Dr. Hildreth said the four college presidents had learned of Mr. Bloomberg's newer, bigger gift last week at a gathering to celebrate his 2020 gift to them. He said he was excited that "it shows the rest of the country and the world" that Mr. Bloomberg and his philanthropic organization value H.B.C.U.s.
The United States has a long lineage of H.B.C.U.s. The first, now Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, was founded in 1837, before schools such as the University of California and Cornell University. But there has been limited financial support for them.
Even though government funding is the most substantial revenue source for H.B.C.U.s, the schools generally receive far less money than other institutions. Last year, the federal government sent letters to 16 governors, complaining that in recent decades their states had severely and illegally underfunded H.B.C.U.s. The cumulative toll, the Biden administration said, approached $ 13 billion.
And the United Negro College Fund, in a report released in January, noted that no H.B.C.U. had an endowment valued at $ 1 billion or more, a threshold exceeded by more than 100 schools in the United States. Most H.B.C.U.s were working with less than $ 100 million, according to the fund.
Still, since the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, H.B.C.U.s have enjoyed a surge of enormous gifts.
In January, the Lilly Endowment announced it would give the United Negro College Fund $ 100 million. The college fund said that the money would add $ 2.7 million to each of its 37 members' endowments -- a sum that it said doubled the value of some schools' accounts.
A week later, Spelman announced its $ 100 million gift from the billionaire couple Ronda Stryker and William Johnston. Some $ 75 million, the college said, would be used for endowed scholarships, with the rest dedicated to priorities like student housing and the development of what the college described as "an academic focus on public policy and democracy."
There have been other head-turning donations, too. After her divorce from the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, MacKenzie Scott poured more than $ 500 million into H.B.C.U.s. And four years ago, after Mr. Floyd's death, the Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings and his wife, Patty Quillin, spread $ 120 million among the college fund, Spelman and Morehouse.
The gifts announced on Tuesday, along with the affirmative action decision, could spur some students of color seeking a "more welcoming, supportive" environment to apply to H.B.C.U.s, Dr. Hildreth said.
"I think it could have an impact on enrollment, and that needs to be matched with investments," he added. "That's the reason we're so excited about this."

Podcast King Takes the Stage And Plays Dumb for Laughs: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On his podcast, Rogan indulges his own obsessions and eccentricities. But in "Burn the Boats," his Netflix comedy special, contempt for the crowd is a theme.
On Saturday night, Joe Rogan started glitching.
Minutes into his live comedy special "Burn the Boats," the movements of his mouth did not match what he was saying. Audio went in and out. Certain phrases repeated, Max Headroom-style. Someone as conspiracy-minded as Rogan might wonder: Was this payback for his criticism of vaccines and lockdowns? Is the mainstream media behind this? Aliens?
More likely, just boring old technical difficulties. Livestreaming remains a work in progress for Netflix. Following stand-up hours by Chris Rock and Katt Williams, Rogan became the third comic to try this experiment, putting out his first special in six years. You could see the logic of getting him to do it during election season but oddly, he didn't address the latest developments in the presidential campaign. Rogan made more news last week on his podcast, where he suggested that the assassination attempt on Donald J. Trump has been "memory holed" and that Kamala Harris could win. He also suggested that the reason President Biden sometimes seems more coherent is that he uses a body double.
Part of the reason that Rogan has built the most popular podcast in the world is that he promises to explore ideas that he says the mainstream media ignores or downplays. Was the Moon landing faked? Are aliens landing in Roswell the reason we invented fiber optics? Does wearing a mask make you seem like less of a man? Joe is on it.
And yet, there is one question you don't hear investigated on his podcast, one relevant to his success but taboo in certain precincts of the comedy world: Is Joe Rogan good at standup comedy?
That can be a dangerous one for some comics to touch on because Rogan has become a powerful gatekeeper, the owner of a club in Austin, Texas, and a host who drives viewers to specials and movies. Rogan tends to be talked about as a political or sports figure, a guru for bros, a symptom of a culture rampant with conspiracy, transphobia and misinformation. But his current notoriety is all built on a decades-long career of standup, which provides a contrast with his other media job.
Whereas he performs patient thoughtfulness in his podcasts, his standup is frantic, animated, full of unmodulated yelling. His eyes pop out and his face reddens. Midway through "Burn the Boats," a jagged line of perspiration forms on his tight yellow shirt, making him look like Charlie Brown on steroids. Even if it seems too hammy for a close-up, there's a cartoonish aspect to his persona that tells you to not take him seriously.
His jokes rely on the most well-worn of stand-up subjects. Pat-downs at the airport. The comedy of old people having sex. Describing a drug trip, man. When it comes to sex, men (have you heard?) are different than women. The variation with Rogan is an additional sentence mocking the straw man of those who think the differences are purely cultural.
His joke constructions are also familiar -- the things you think but don't do, the words you can't say. His leans into stereotypes that have cracked up drunken club crowds for generations. When he discovers from a genetic test that he has some African ancestry, you just know a joke about penis size is on its way.
In a possible effort to exploit the live aspect of the show, he tries crowd work, asking an audience member to speak up when they yell out something after he worries aloud about the influence of China. Then when they shout out "cobalt mine," he appears oddly irritated. "Congratulations," he sneers. "You know a thing."
Contempt for the crowd is a theme. He pokes fun at the idea that he has any responsibility for the information he hosts on his podcast. "If you're getting your vaccine info from me," he asks, "Is it really my fault?"
In one of his more persuasive self-deprecating riffs, he says the funniest way for him to die would be from Covid. "The memes would never end," he says.
It will surprise no one that Rogan brings up getting canceled and reminds the crowd that this is "just jokes." This of course is key to his brand, the dangerous comic bucking conventional wisdom, annoying the scolds and owning the libs. There is plenty in this show to get people mad. He says he believes in Pizzagate. He compares gay men to mountain lions ("I am glad they exist, but I don't want to be surrounded by them") and says slurs for cheap laughs.
Not only will nothing he say here get him in real trouble, but it bonds him to his audience, who are told repeatedly that critics are humorless and the media is unfair, deceptive and weird. Long before the Kamala Harris campaign embraced "weird" as an insult, Rogan used it, perhaps more than any other. He doesn't set up his conspiracies with a web of connections. He does it by saying we live in weird times.
While his stand-up here is cliché, his podcast is not. It's less dogmatic or more paradoxical than his fiercest critics allow. He can make the ugliest jokes about shooting homeless people in one episode with the comic Tom Segura, then have a serious discussion about the stigma that this population faces with Alan Graham. (Graham created a nonprofit organization in Austin with affordable housing and meals for people living on the street.)
On his podcast, Rogan can be deeply cynical (about the media and the government), then staggeringly gullible (name a conspiracy). He can also have long, interesting conversations if the subject is one of his preoccupations (drugs, Mixed Martial Arts) like his recent talk about the Nazis' role in the creation of psychedelics with the author Norman Ohler.
Rogan is interested in ideas on his podcast, whereas in his new special, he prefers playing dumb. He describes his mind wandering when talking to Elon Musk, whom he calls the smartest person alive, which might be the most unintentionally effective troll of the special.
As a showcase for him as a comic, the live format did not benefit Rogan. He came off more assured in his earlier specials, and even, occasionally, a little introspective. In his first one, "Triggered," a title that now seems like a parody of a title for a special by him, he even gives voice to a critique that people have of him. "I sense a lot of macho posturing," he says, articulating it. Then he agrees with them and describes how we all respond to what people like and veer away from what they don't.
Rogan has found a podcast audience that likes conspiracies and picking culture war battles with the left. And he gives it to them. But he also indulges his own obsessions and eccentricities. That's missing in his conventional comedy. You can sense him busily trying to serve an audience in his stand-up. He's giving people what has already worked. And he's hustling doing it. But comedy is trickier than politics. Audiences want more than just what they want. Sounds like nonsense, I know. But we live in weird times.

Has the Men's 100 Meters Lost Some of Its Luster As Star Power Has Faded?: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lacking star power and tense rivalries, the event was not even the most anticipated 100-meter race at the Paris Games.
Noah Lyles, the brash American with dreams of Olympic gold in Paris, rarely cedes the spotlight.
He is, after all, the biggest star in what historically has been track and field's most high-profile event, the men's 100-meter dash. But ahead of the Olympic final on Sunday, he is also enough of a realist to acknowledge that the race no longer has the cachet it once did.
The men's 100 might not even be the premier event in the sport anymore. Even Lyles, who doubled as the 100- and 200-meter champion at last year's world championships, conceded as much at a meet in London a few weeks ago.
"I think the 400 hurdles, men and women, are definitely trying to take it," Lyles said.
The men's 100 is steeped in history. Past winners include some of the most luminous figures in Olympic track history: Jesse Owens. Carl Lewis. Bob Hayes. Usain Bolt.
Other former winners, like Ben Johnson, who was famously stripped of his gold medal in 1988, and Justin Gatlin, whose win in 2004 was later tainted by a doping suspension, are forever linked to infamy.
Either way, the 100 has long had an allure. The story of the last time the event was held in Paris, after all, produced not just a gold medal for Harold Abrahams but also four Academy Awards for the film about his triumph, "Chariots of Fire."
It was inevitable that the event would suffer from a bit of a vacuum after Bolt retired in 2017, as the most decorated sprinter in history and the winner of the 100 (and the 200) at three consecutive Olympics from 2008 to 2016. Bolt's 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds from 2009 remains untouched. (He also owns the 200 world record.)
The thing about Bolt, though, was that his charisma matched his talent. He possessed a sort of magnetic energy whenever he stepped on the track. He was must-see TV, his popularity transcending the relatively niche world of track and field.
"He was a once-in-a-generation star," Ato Boldon, the NBC analyst and four-time Olympic medalist, said in a telephone interview. "So, no, it's not the same sort of oh-my-gosh, you-have-to-see-this-guy-before-he-retires type of energy."
In his absence, athletes in other events have emerged as headliners. In the men's 1,500-meter race, Jakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway and Josh Kerr of Britain are worthy of their own telenovela. They do not care for each other, which makes for compelling theater.
Consider, too, the 400-meter hurdles. On the men's side, Rai Benjamin of the United States, Karsten Warholm of Norway, and Alison dos Santos of Brazil have combined to run the 17 fastest times in history. Among the women, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the United States and Femke Bol of the Netherlands are pushing the event to new levels. McLaughlin-Levrone, who is on billboards across Paris, holds the world record. Bol is the world champion.
And any list of marquee track and field events in Paris would be incomplete without a mention of the women's 100, where Jamaica's Olympic dominance has most recently been threatened by the American star Sha'Carri Richardson, who had to settle for a silver in a thrilling final on Saturday.
Lyles and the men are scheduled to run on Sunday.
"I look at where Sha'Carri's star is now," Boldon said, "and I go, 'Woo hoo!' Can you imagine if Sha'Carri wins the first 100-meter gold in the Olympics for the United States since 1996, and then she has four years of hype leading into 2028 Games in Los Angeles?"
The men's and women's 100 were the focus of the first season of "Sprint," Netflix's behind-the-scenes docuseries that detailed the lives of several sprinters through last year's world championships in Budapest. Richardson and Lyles were front and center. The producers did not choose the 100 on a whim. They chose it because of its mystique and its accessibility.
"Everyone gets being the fastest man or woman in the world," said Jon Ridgeon, the chief executive of World Athletics. "It's pretty sexy. But we've got a wonderful array of disciplines, and wouldn't it be great to feature some other disciplines going forward?"
In Paris, Lyles seems determined to keep at least some of the attention on himself. True to form, he scoffed theatrically last month in London when he was asked about vying for Olympic gold against Kishane Thompson and Thompson's Jamaican teammates. (Thompson has the fastest 100 time in the world this year.)
"I beat everybody else that I touch," Lyles said, stoking a rivalry that his event could probably use. "I don't see why they're any different."

Full text: The contestants in the internet star's "Beast Games" expected outlandish challenges and signed contracts that acknowledged risks of serious injury and death. Still, few were prepared for the conditions on set.
Jimmy Donaldson is the internet's fairy godmother.
Better known online as MrBeast, Mr. Donaldson, 26, has made a name for himself as a benevolent YouTube star who has racked up hundreds of millions of subscribers for his provocative brand of philanthropy, like the time he paid for 1,000 people to receive cataract surgery. The resulting eight-minute video was hyperbolically titled "1,000 Blind People See for the First Time."
Extravagant prizes have become his calling card. He's given away homes, cars, a private island and lots and lots of cash. Usually it comes with a dark twist: Once, he offered a man $ 10,000 a day for each day he was willing to live in a grocery store without leaving. In his most popular video, " $ 456,000 Squid Game in Real Life!," 456 people competed in a game show inspired by the dystopian Netflix drama "Squid Game." (In the Netflix show, down-and-out contestants play deadly versions of children's games to win $ 38 million.)
When in March Mr. Donaldson and Amazon MGM studios announced "Beast Games," a reality competition show in the mold of MrBeast's popular videos, thousands of people jumped at the chance, posting on Reddit threads about the application process and waiting hopefully to be accepted.
The prize: $ 5 million.
Familiar with MrBeast's content and with the lengths to which those who appear in his videos must go in order to win, many expected outlandish and even potentially risky challenges.
During an intake process this year, several contestants told The New York Times that they had been asked whether they would be willing to be buried alive or travel to outer space. One contestant recalled being asked if she would be able to swim to shore if thrown overboard from a boat. "I understand that such activities may cause me death, illness, or serious bodily injury, including, but not limited to exhaustion, dehydration, overexertion, burns, and heat stroke," read a line in a contract, reviewed by The Times, that applicants were required to sign. (Such language is commonplace in reality television contracts.)
What they did not expect, however, were the more mundane yet potentially dangerous inconveniences that they said had befallen them during the competition.
Speaking with The New York Times on the condition of anonymity due to nondisclosure agreements, over a dozen people who participated in the first installment of "Beast Games" said that they had not received adequate food or medical care and that some competitors had suffered injuries from the physical challenges. (The event was being filmed for Mr. Donaldson's YouTube channel to select contestants to participate in the Amazon MGM show later this summer.)
Some contestants left the competition arena on stretchers, a contestant said, though it was unclear if any of those contestants had faced serious medical conditions. Another described watching fellow contestants vomiting and appearing to pass out. There were several hospitalizations.
In a text message, a spokesperson for MrBeast said the shoot "was unfortunately complicated by the CrowdStrike incident, extreme weather and other unexpected logistical and communications issues." The spokesperson said MrBeast had started a formal review and had "taken steps to ensure that we learn from this experience."
Representatives for Amazon MGM Studios declined to comment.
Mr. Donaldson's content has always relied on the willingness of others -- often strangers -- to go to extremes to create highly watchable videos. During his meteoric rise to mega-virality, some former employees have spoken out about safety concerns on MrBeast sets, but his vast fan base has continued to see him as fundamentally charitable and well meaning. Now, amid allegations about "Beast Games" as well as recent accusations about inappropriate language used by Mr. Donaldson and a former collaborator, his reputation, as well as his multimillion-dollar YouTube empire, are on the line.
"We signed up for the show, but we didn't sign up for not being fed or watered or treated like human beings," one contestant told The Times.
The Games Begin
Mr. Donaldson and the executives at Amazon MGM Studios had ambitions for "Beast Games" typical of MrBeast's penchant for superlatives. In a news release this year, the studio said the show's $ 5 million prize would be the biggest prize in streaming and television history.
"We were blown away by his ambition to make 'Beast Games' the biggest reality competition series ever," Vernon Sanders, head of television at Amazon MGM Studios, said of Mr. Donaldson, who is the host and executive producer of the show.
Shooting for the competition started in July, with 2,000 contestants gathered in Nevada at Allegiant Stadium, home of the Las Vegas Raiders, for several days. Competitors ate, slept and lived inside the stadium while competing in challenges like moving heavy objects and an extreme game of capture the flag. Some stayed up to three nights.
Before they arrived at the stadium on July 18, the contestants had to turn in their phones and belongings, including medications. The group ranged in age from members of Gen Z to a competitor who said he was 82, a contestant said.
Right from the start, things seemed off. Some contestants said they had originally been told that the competition would have 1,000 participants. (This was also the figure advertised by Prime Video earlier this year.) But upon arrival, contestants received a video message from Mr. Donaldson, reviewed by The Times, informing them that the number of contestants was higher.
"Obviously, there's 2,000 contestants," Mr. Donaldson said in the video. "I don't remember if I said that publicly or not, but there is." A spokesperson for MrBeast said the intention had always been to have 2,000 competitors during that phase to winnow down to the 1,000 for the Amazon MGM show.
Like many of the people who appear in MrBeast's YouTube videos, some of the contestants said they needed the cash to pay for things like student loans and medical debt. After learning they would be competing against twice as many people, some said they felt they had been misled about their odds of winning.
Several contestants also said they had not been warned about how little they would be given to eat and how infrequently. They described going long stretches without being fed by the production; one said she had gone over 20 hours, both during the games and while they were in Las Vegas before and after filming. (Contestants said they had expected the production to provide them with meals for the duration of their time in Nevada.)
One meal, described by several contestants, included a tiny portion of cold oatmeal, one hard-boiled egg and a few pieces of raw vegetables.
Meals throughout the games were small and sporadic, contestants said. It was difficult to keep track of time without watches or phones, but contestants estimated they had been fed twice a day, once in the early morning and again in the afternoon or evening. A spokesperson for MrBeast said contestants had been offered three meals a day.
On a few occasions, the production staff passed around small Feastables chocolate bars, a brand created by Mr. Donaldson, and filmed some people eating and praising the candy, contestants said.
People with food allergies and dietary restrictions said they had experienced even more trouble. Before the competition, contestants filled out forms detailing their dietary needs. An F.A.Q. document provided to contestants in advance of the event, and reviewed by The Times, said that all dietary and food restrictions would be "taken into consideration."
But several contestants said they had been served food they were allergic to and that alternatives had not been provided.
"We were treated horribly," a contestant said. "They took on this challenge of 2,000 competitors. They should have known they needed an enormous crew to handle this correctly."
Hungry, Bruised and Bleeding
Mr. Donaldson presided over the field as the first scenes of the competition were filmed in the stadium. Contestants described how he had stepped out of a shrinelike structure and onto a platform above $ 5 million in cash as they were instructed to cheer. "We're all just looking up at the sky, screaming at him like he's god," one contestant said. Guards dressed entirely in black, complete with face coverings, flanked the field.
During the opening speeches, one contestant recalled, Mr. Donaldson encouraged the participants to speak up and ask for help from the staff if they needed it. A psychologist also introduced himself to the competitors at the outset, explaining that health and safety were priorities on set, several participants recalled. Reached by phone by The Times after the games, that psychologist, Barry Goldstein, declined to comment on the event.
Several contestants said that when they had sought out production staff members for assistance with medical care, food and hygiene issues, the staff members were often not helpful and appeared disorganized. Some staff members yelled and cursed at contestants, one participant said.
Despite reassurance that contestants' medications would be distributed to them when needed, several contestants said they had not received their medication on time -- including one contestant who needed insulin -- instead receiving it hours, or even days, after their scheduled dosing times. One contestant said she had initially been denied the food she required to take her medication and had been told by staff members that she didn't actually need to eat. After asking repeatedly, she was given half a banana.
Contestants were instructed to supply the production staff with a Ziploc bag containing five days' worth of undergarments, which would be distributed to contestants once the games were underway. But several contestants said they had waited hours or even days to receive their clean underwear.
One woman said that when she and a group of contestants who were menstruating during the event had asked the production staff about getting their underwear more quickly, she had been told that it was "not a medical emergency," and she recalled that a nearby member of the production staff had laughed at the women's pleading.
Contestants felt that the staff was overwhelmed by the volume of competitors.
In addition to these behind-the-scenes issues, things did not appear to run much more smoothly when it came to the competition itself.
The first challenge involved five teams of 400 people pulling ropes attached to 10,000-pound weights as fast as possible. The issues began, participants said, when they were broken into those teams. A scramble for team pinnies quickly became chaotic and frightening, several said, describing a crush of people pushing and shoving other contestants while the production staff was unable to calm the crowd. One contestant described hyperventilating amid the scene; another said she had been "almost horizontal" and had feared being trampled.
Some male contestants refused to pass pinnies to female contestants, with the result that one of the teams was predominantly women, contestants said. Several people interviewed for this article felt they had not had a fair chance at winning the prize money, given the way the teams were formed.
One contestant said she had left the stadium bruised and bleeding after being injured and eliminated in the first challenge. She was handed $ 1,000 in a stack of dollar bills as a consolation prize but said she had to hand the money back to producers after the cameras were off. Competitors were told they would receive their real payments later, she said, but as of publication time, she had not yet been paid.
Several contestants told The Times they had since been contacted by the production team and offered an additional $ 1,000.
While contestants were free to leave the competition at any time, many stayed despite the conditions, hoping to win the grand prize. Those who made it past the first challenge were given toiletry kits and sleeping bags and slept on the stadium's turf floor.
Contestants said it was difficult to get much sleep during the games, noting they had often been expected to sleep during daylight hours in the sunny stadium and film challenge takes at night. One contestant said she had expected that difficulty, given that there had often been elements of sleep deprivation in Mr. Donaldson's previous competitions.
The 1,000 participants who made it through all four challenges in the stadium without being eliminated are now preparing for the next stage of the competition, which is set to be filmed in Canada in early August. One contestant, a self-professed longtime fan of Mr. Donaldson's who is still in the game, said she was nervous about her safety but planned to continue.
"We are grateful that virtually all of those invited to Toronto for our next production have enthusiastically accepted our invitation," the MrBeast spokesperson wrote.
In screenshots from a group chat provided to The Times, some of the remaining contestants appeared unbothered by the experience.
They had signed a contract that they were willing to die for this.

Medals or Memes: Who's Gold on the Internet?: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As the world watches the Paris Olympic Games, figures like Pommel Horse Guy, a muffin-obsessed swimmer and a few charismatic shooters have become unexpected stars online.
At the Olympic Games, there are the athletes who are rewarded with medals. And then there are the athletes who, for whatever reasons, find themselves rewarded with online love.
Here's a roundup of the stars of the Games, at least according to the internet.
Ilona Maher: The Women's Rugby Player Who Recruited an N.F.L. Star
Before the Games began, the American women's rugby sevens team already had a social media sensation: Ilona Maher, who has two million followers on TikTok and 2.3 million on Instagram
After she jokingly asked the retired N.F.L. star Jason Kelce to be the team's celebrity super fan, à la Flavor Flav's sponsorship of the U.S. women's water polo team, Kelce attended the team's match against Australia wearing a Hawaiian shirt patterned with Maher's face. The team secured a bronze medal, America's first in the sport.
Much of Maher's content promotes body positivity, as when she responded to a commenter who guessed her body mass index was 30, which would fall under the clinical definition of obese. Maher responded with a pointed burn.
"Yeah, I do have a BMI of 30," she said in a TikTok video. "I am considered overweight. But, alas, I'm going to the Olympics and you're not."
Kim Yeji and Yusuf Dikec: Sport Shooters-Turned-Action-Movie Stars
While the South Korean sport shooter Kim Yeji didn't win the gold for the women's 10-meter air pistol shooting event, she did win admiration for looking cool.
A clip of Kim stoically shooting at a competition in May spread exponentially online after her Olympic appearance, with posts citing her "aura," current slang for an aspirational level of cool. One TikTok of the clip has 1.6 million likes.
Kim's hand-in-pocket pose, the cyberpunk-looking lenses many shooters wear and her steely focus inspired fan art across social platforms.
During the men's air pistol team event, the Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec stepped up with no specialized equipment and the same hand-in-pocket stance. He won silver, his country's first medal in shooting.
Dikec, 51, has been photoshopped into scenes from "Pulp Fiction" as a hit man and pitted against Kim in an anime showdown.
He trended on X in Japan as "Free to Play Uncle," a reference to the many "free" video games that promote micro-transactions. Meme-makers imagined Dikec as a player who refused to pay for flashy add-ons but won those games anyway.
Stephen Nedoroscik: His Job Is Pommel Horse
The American gymnast Stephen Nedoroscik has one job at the Games: pommel horse.
On Monday, Nedoroscik, 25, helped the U.S. team win the bronze, the men's first gymnastics medal in 16 years, and became an online darling. Not just for his routine, though.
Memes pointed out his long wait on the sidelines, more than two hours as the rest of the competition unfolded. The image of Nedoroscik, leaning back with his eyes closed, waiting his turn, made the rounds and is likely to have viewers tuning in as he competes in the individual pommel horse event on Saturday.
He became a nerd hero to many, the bespectacled "Clark Kent" of the pommel horse. Fans were also delighted to find out that Nedoroscik graduated from Penn State with a degree in electrical engineering and that he times his attempts at solving a Rubik's Cube.
The Proud (and Terrified) Families of U.S. Gymnasts Jordan Chiles and Hezly Rivera
Though they're not athletes, the parents of American gymnasts Jordan Chiles and Hezly Rivera have gained online love for supporting their daughters from the stands.
Gina and Timothy Chiles have been hanging on their daughter's every move during competitions, loudly cheering her on. During her uneven bars routine, Timothy yelled for Chiles to "stick like butter" on the landing.
Rivera, 16, has an anxious fan in her father, Henry Rivera. He was so overwhelmed with emotion as he watched her compete in trials and later as he witnessed the announcement that she had qualified for the Games, that he kept burying his face in his arms, peeking out on occasion.
Henry wore a heart rate monitor that NBC broadcast as he watched Rivera's final routine in the qualification round. A typical resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. At one point, his hit 180.
Henrik Christiansen: The Norwegian Muffin Man
The 27-year-old Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen is at the Paris Games to compete in two freestyle races. But based on his TikTok account, Christiansen is mostly there for the chocolate muffins.
He has posted 13 videos and counting about the baked goods, including a couples trend of him gazing at the muffin while unable to focus on what "she" is saying and a reference to the Netflix sketch comedy "I Think You Should Leave," in which a reality dating show contestant is only there for the zip line.
"Looking for the chocolate muffins at the Olympics but I'm pretty sure that Norwegian swimmer stole them all," an aide at the Paris Games wrote over a video of the dining hall selections.
In a comment on that post, Christiansen wrote, "You'll never find them."
This article will be updated with more Olympians as later memes arise.

What to See at This Year's Edinburgh Fringe: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Author: Lewis, Isobel

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Previous editions of the performing arts event launched shows like "Baby Reindeer" and "Fleabag." Maybe there's another breakout hit among this year's more than 3,300 shows.
Each summer, artists and audience members from across the globe decamp to Scotland for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the world's largest performing arts event. This year, from Aug. 2 through 26, the city will be repurposed into a labyrinth of makeshift theaters, in dingy rooms above pubs, hotel conference rooms and university lecture theaters.
Throughout the Fringe's 77-year history, its eclectic approach to performance has been integral to its appeal. Unlike the more highbrow Edinburgh International Festival, which runs concurrently. the Fringe is open to all comers -- and a buzzy Fringe show can give an artist a very big break.
"Fleabag" and "Six," the musical, were originally Fringe success stories. So too was Richard Gadd's 2019 one-man show "Baby Reindeer," which this year became a Netflix series and an unexpected global hit.
Very few artists make money at the Fringe, but at this year's festival, many will be trying to emulate Gadd's trajectory. And festival goers will equally be looking for the next big thing.
With more than 3,300 shows on offer, finding the next "Fleabag" requires some careful studying of the weighty Fringe program. Here is a guide to some of the key themes and the buzziest shows from this year's lineup.
Award-winning comics return
At the end of each year's Fringe, a panel of judges hands out the Edinburgh Comedy Awards for best show and best newcomer, two prestigious prizes that have launched many international careers. This year's Fringe lineup includes two of the most successful recent winners.
First up, the Australian comic Hannah Gadsby -- whose confessional 2017 show "Nanette" stirred debates about what counts as comedy and was adapted into an Emmy-winning Netflix special -- returns with a mysterious new special, "Woof!" (Underbelly, Bristo Square; Aug. 18 through 25.)
Rose Matafeo, the creator of the charming sitcom "Starstruck," won a best show award for "Horndog" in 2018. With her new special, "On and On and On" (Pleasance Courtyard; Aug. 9 through 25), she returns to the confessional brand of live comedy that won her an army of fans, and dives deep into the contents of her Notes app. Judging by the work-in-progress show I saw last month, Fringe audiences are in for a treat.
A less starry name, but one absolutely worth your time, is Lara Ricote, who snagged the best newcomer award in 2022. Ricote, who is Mexican American and describes herself as hard of hearing, returns with her sophomore hour "Little Tiny Wet Show (Baptism)" (Monkey Barrel Comedy; July 30 through Aug. 25). It's a surreal, sweet and interactive reflection on love, death and growing up.
Shows about disability
Edinburgh's busy cobbled streets can be hard to navigate for those with special requirements. But a number of shows this year are putting disability-led stories onstage.
One of those is "Blue Badge Bunch" (Pleasance Courtyard; July 31 through Aug. 25), a family show fronted by the comedian Benny Shakes that aims to teach children and adults about the everyday experience of conditions including autism and cerebral palsy. Two teams of competitors, including a rotating cast of guest comedians, compete in a series of physical challenges mimicking different disabled experiences.
I generally have a "no Shakespeare" rule during the festival (you can see his plays anywhere!), but would make an exception for the Peruvian company Teatro La Plaza's take on "Hamlet," which is playing in Edinburgh as part of the International Festival, rather than the Fringe (The Lyceum; Aug. 15 through 17). This staging of the Bard's most popular tragedy features rap and improvisation, and is performed in Spanish with English supertitles by an eight-person cast, all of whom have Down syndrome.
Finding light in trauma
There are shades of "Baby Reindeer" in "It Gets Darker" (Pleasance Courtyard; July 31 through Aug. 24), the debut hour from the American comic and former YouTuber Anna Akana. In it, she delves into her own experience with a stalker, as well as her teenage sister's suicide. It's undeniably heavy stuff, but Akana uses deft storytelling to bring plenty of laughter and pathos to even the most traumatic of tales.
For darker programming more on the theatrical side, look to shows programmed by the new-writing theater company Paines Plough. Gadd performed his show in 2019 at the Roundabout, a Plaines Plough-managed venue, and of this year's offerings at the same location, I'm most excited by Somebody Jones's debut play "How I Learned To Swim" (Roundabout @ Summerhall; Aug. 1 through 26), which explores Black people's relationship with the water, and the grief and fear that may underscore it.
Sure to be equally captivating is Kelly Jones's "My Mother's Funeral: The Show" (Roundabout @ Summerhall; Aug. 1 through 26), a meta meditation on the financial cost of death and the emotional cost of putting your deepest traumas onstage.
The best of Scottish comedy
To leave the Fringe without experiencing any of the Scottish talent on display would be a woeful misstep, particularly when it comes to comedy.
With her sharp punchlines and ease onstage, the Glasgow comic Susie McCabe is one to watch. Following her popular podcast "Here Comes The Guillotine," her latest hour "Merchant of Menace" (Assembly George Square Studios; July 31 through Aug. 25) was nearly scuppered after she had emergency heart surgery last week. But she is carrying on, and knowing McCabe, audiences will be able to feel her fighting spirit onstage. (Her podcast co-host Christopher Macarthur-Boyd is also returning for a few performances of "Scary Times," a highlight of last year's Fringe.)
Liam Farrelly, another emerging star of Scottish comedy, started doing stand-up at 17. In a 2022 show, he discussed the religious divide in his family (his sister is a nun) and becoming a dad at age 21. This year, at 24, he's bringing "Flipbook" to the Fringe (The Stand Comedy Club 2; Aug. 1 through 25), which promises to be more personal and emotional than ever.
Gwyneth Paltrow goes skiing
If you've ever had a hankering to see a show about Gwyneth Paltrow's 2016 skiing accident and subsequent 2023 televised court case, this year's Fringe has you covered with not one, but two musicals.
First up, we have "Gwyneth Goes Skiing," (Pleasance Courtyard; July 31 through Aug. 26), from the team behind the 2023 drag hit "Diana: The Untold and Untrue Story." Of the two offerings, this is the more star-studded: the Troye Sivan collaborator Leland wrote the music, and Darren Criss and Catherine Cohen (who is also returning to the Fringe this year with her show "Come For Me") provide the recorded vocals that the cast lip-syncs to.
And then we have "I Wish You Well: The Gwyneth Paltrow Ski-Trial Musical" (Underbelly George Square; July 31 through Aug. 26), another comedy musical, this time starring Diana Vickers, who appeared on British "X Factor." Why not make a day of it? Watch "Gwyneth Goes Skiing," then use the 55-minute break between shows to amble across to Underbelly George Square, for "I Wish You Well." Sounds like a hoot.

Full text: Johnson told a stand-up audience she was leaving "Saturday Night Live" before confirming her departure in an Instagram video the next day.
Punkie Johnson, a performer on the NBC sketch comedy series "Saturday Night Live" since 2020, announced on Thursday that she will not return this fall for the show's 50th season.
Johnson, who played characters on "S.N.L." including Vice President Kamala Harris and the women's basketball star Angel Reese, first said she was leaving during a stand-up comedy set on Wednesday at Union Hall in Brooklyn.
She posted a video on her Instagram account the next day, confirming her decision to leave the show. She said that she was not leaving on bad terms, however, as some audience members had understood some of her onstage comments to imply.
Johnson had told the Union Hall audience that "S.N.L." staff wanted her to change her hair and to stop working out so much and looking "buff." She had also mentioned a heated argument with a talent producer, adding that being on the show had been stressing her out and that she was happier since having decided to leave.
An NBC employee confirmed that Johnson was leaving the show but did not respond to questions about Johnson's onstage comments about the circumstances of her departure.
In her Instagram video, Johnson said she had woken up to text messages and phone calls about the comments.
"I'm like, it was a comedy show!" she said. "I was just having fun! It's no bad blood; it's no bridges burnt; it's no hard feelings."
Born and raised in New Orleans, Johnson, 39, moved to Los Angeles to start her comedy career and worked as a server at the Comedy Store before she was made a paid regular onstage. Johnson joined "S.N.L." for the show's 46th season as a featured player and was promoted to the regular cast in 2022.
Johnson was also the first openly lesbian Black cast member of "S.N.L." (An earlier Black lesbian cast member, Danitra Vance, was not publicly out while on the show in the 1980s.)
Johnson's other screen roles have included the HBO series "Love Life" and "A Black Lady Sketch Show," the Netflix series "Space Force" and the fight-club buddy comedy movie "Bottoms."
She is so far the only "S.N.L" cast member who has announced a departure ahead of the new season, which begins on Sept. 28.

The Point: This Arrest Won't Solve the Opioid Crisis: [Live Blog Post]

Full text: It was a plot twist made for Netflix. Ismael Zambada García, a founder of the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel, was tricked (or forced -- the details are still muddy) onto a plane in Mexico and brought to the United States to face drug conspiracy charges -- and hopefully justice. He had evaded capture for decades and had a $ 15 million U.S. bounty on his head.
Zambada García was brought in not by U.S. or Mexican authorities but by his own godson and fellow drug trafficker, Joaquín Guzmán López (son of the infamous El Chapo), who surrendered himself to authorities upon landing.
In the short term, the arrests could produce more violence and instability in Mexican communities that have already seen far too much of both, as rivals of every sort jockey to fill the void left by the newly captured.
They could also shake up already strained relations between the United States and Mexico, especially if Zambada García decides to offer up whatever dirty laundry he has on leaders there in exchange for some kind of leniency here.
What the arrests will not do, if history is any lesson, is stem the flow of illicit drugs out of Mexico or into the United States.
The United States invested billions of dollars in a sustained effort to stop the flow of cocaine out of Colombia in the 1980s and 1990s. Among other things, that effort helped bring about the death of Pablo Escobar in 1993 and led eventually to the waning of the notorious Colombia cartel, which was responsible for a vast majority of the global cocaine trade. Today, cocaine production is soaring, not only in Mexico (where experts say U.S. efforts in Colombia led directly to the rise of the Sinaloa kingpins) but in Colombia, too, in some of the same regions that the United States targeted so diligently for so long.
Pursuing and punishing drug traffickers is both necessary and worthwhile. These are bad people who have done terrible things. They have destroyed countless lives, both through the trafficking of fentanyl (now a leading cause of overdose deaths among American adults) and through the extreme violence that they have all made such common use of.
But arrests of drug kingpins are not the key to solving the nation's addiction and overdose crisis. For that, we need to look within our own borders -- at things like treatment, prevention and harm reduction.

Solving Puzzles and Building Communities: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure is full of solutions that slide and stump. Play follow the leader in Flock, and take on bulbous hordes in Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess.
The typically slow summer release schedule for video games has been enlivened by Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure, Flock and Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, which offer intriguing mechanics while showcasing the need for a healthy community.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure
Arranger is helmed by a veteran team, including the artist David Hellman, who worked on the important time-manipulation offering Braid. They've formed the studio Furniture & Mattress, seemingly to fricassee the brain.
With smatterings of humor, the writer Nick Suttner has created a powerful narrative around young Jemma, a brown-haired protagonist with an oversize green coat that covers her hands. She feels like an outcast in her hometown and wants to move beyond its imposing gates.
Each level is represented by a grid, and setting Jemma on her adventurous path requires sliding panels in every direction -- left, right, up, down and around. Dealing with the puzzles alone would confound players, so the strong writing provides needed rest from the difficult solutions.
The dialogue is tight and even the insults are clean. One character's way of using foul language is to call Jemma "a rotten turnip." There's a tendency to use groan-worthy puns, but the characters she meets range from the playful to the acerbic. Similar to the recent Hauntii, nearly all of them tell Jemma not to leave, because they feel safe exactly where they are -- but she's born to run. Is simply feeling safe really living?
Initially, Arranger is admirably subversive in its pursuit of individuality over a community's ingrained paranoia. Yet soon Jemma realizes she can't move forward against pesky robotic birds without the help of quirky townspeople. She's single-minded but open-minded, not an obstinate hermit.
Jemma's wanderlust won't quit, and solving the puzzles ultimately leads her to new locales. It's hard to adapt to the reasoning of these sliding puzzles because sometimes moving Jemma away from an entrance eventually leads the way there. There is consternation, the pain of failure and then the confidence gained from a correct deduction.
In places, the puzzles in this eight-hour game can be even more compelling than the narrative. Sheep can be shorn by moving a panel displaying scissors onto them. You can drag a sword into an area blocked by a dragon and bump the sharp object against the beast so that, poof, it disappears in purple smoke. One monster can be felled by moving its body so the thing attacks itself in ouroboros fashion.
To think that all of this is accomplished by moving squares around proves there's an ingenuity present in Arranger that may ultimately make it one of the year's standout indie games.

Flock
Flock begins with so much positivity and good cheer that I felt I was visiting a fantasy world whose golden rule is "Welcome with kindness." I boarded the back of a long-beaked bird as if it were a dragon and flapped to the Uplands to find Aunt Jane, a zoology professor. She asked me to find scores of avian wonders, none of which attack one another.
There's a Pokémon-style "catch 'em all" aspect to such searching that on first blush might seem like an overdone trope. But you're a bird watcher, too, as you discover bewls, baffins and burbots (which look like giant, flat polliwogs and are so thin they "could give you a nasty paper cut").
The 60 fanciful animals in this six-hour game are made in an appealingly bright child-art style. A bioluminescent thrip is only a head with helicopter-like wings atop. You can also add up to 30 soaring creatures to your flock. In the artist Richard Hogg's vivid world, sheep can travel with your flock sans wings. Shear them and trade the wool for a tam or balaclava at the Wandering Wardrober's shop.
Yes, there could be more game here. I imagined quests in underground caves for batlike entities, or ascending high into the heavens to catch a fluttering creature near deep space. Yet it almost doesn't matter.
I took time to watch the sun rise, which turned the landscape into shades of breathtaking violet, and later gazed at a crescent moon rising in the star-filled sky. The chill music, sometimes enhanced by a delicate marimba, the drone of cicadas and the chirping flock, took me away from the honking rush-hour traffic below my window.
Flock, by Hollow Ponds, the studio behind Wilmot's Warehouse, has a vibe of relaxation achieved through observation, perhaps because you're not really imprisoning creatures. You've charmed them with a combination of bird whistles and careful movement, approaching silently enough so as not to frighten them. As dozens trail behind your flock, colorful as Jelly Bellys with wings, you are them and they are you and you are all together in this alluring ecosystem.

Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess
After playing a demo, I was told that if Monster Hunter Wilds is Capcom's upcoming blockbuster, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is its art house offering.
The introduction certainly wasn't as violently epic as, say, Halo Infinite. Instead, it showed the flowing, dancing goddess Yoshiro, perhaps creating a spell based on ancient Japanese myth. "The rage and torrent of this world is unending," says a doom-filled narrator. The villagers covet peace after their Mount Kafuku is overrun by grotesque, damaging beings.
Soh, Yoshiro's armor-clad guardian, does much of the fighting. After battles, Yoshiro opens a gate, which magically restores normalcy to the village. So goes each chapter.
The battle style is somewhat akin to Capcom's long-running Devil May Cry series, in which hordes are slain. Attacking the Seethe -- bulbous, slurping crawlers with their long tongues hanging out in exaggerated pug-style -- is satisfying. But there's a strategy element here, too: Asking villagers you've freed to help in grim battle is just a fair trade.
While Path of the Goddess is both beautiful and steeped in Japanese legend, there is too much to manage over its 20 hours. I needed to level up the villagers, choose their powers and place them in strategic locations to attack. These tower defense mechanics added complexity I didn't expect. I also had to put villagers to work to fix town infrastructure, like a water source the Seethe had damaged. This felt like labor for me, not just for the villagers.
Brilliant, lurid little things kept me going to the end. Swords slashed in a psychedelic crescent animation of red, orange and blue as weaker Seethe perished with sounds that evoked moaning frogs. When Yoshiro purified a gate, fireworks rained down like a supernatural storm. Near the end, inspired by Florian Walter's experimental sax solo that's reminiscent of Anthony Braxton's work, I battled Yatsukahagi, an arachnid-like boss with legs ending in sharpened, yellowed fingernails.
Eventually, calm comes over the mountain and the townspeople gather to commiserate. As in Arranger and Flock, harmony is restored not just because of the courage of Yoshiro and Soh courage, but because a community banded together. In other words, it (still) takes a village.
Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure was reviewed on the Switch and is also available on the PC, PlayStation 5 and smartphones through a Netflix subscription. Flock and Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess were reviewed on the PlayStation 5 and are also available on the PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S.

Election-Year Fights Divide Billionaires in Silicon Valley: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman and other tech billionaires, many of whom are part of the "PayPal Mafia," are openly brawling with one another over politics as tensions rise.
Less than an hour after a gunman in Butler, Pa., tried to assassinate Donald J. Trump this month, David Sacks, a venture capitalist based in San Francisco, directed his anger about the incident toward a former colleague.
"The Left normalized this," Mr. Sacks wrote on X, linking to a post about Reid Hoffman, a technology investor and major Democratic donor. Mr. Sacks implied that Mr. Hoffman, a critic of Mr. Trump who had funded a lawsuit accusing the former president of rape and defamation, had helped cause the shooting.
Elon Musk, who leads SpaceX and Tesla and previously worked with Mr. Sacks and Mr. Hoffman, then weighed in on X, name-checking Mr. Hoffman and saying people like him "got their dearest wish."
In Silicon Valley, the spectacle of tech billionaire attacking tech billionaire has suddenly exploded, as pro-Trump executives and their Democratic counterparts have openly turned on each other. The brawling has spilled into public view online, at conferences and on podcasts, as debates about the country's future have turned into personal broadsides.
The animus has pit those who once worked side by side and attended each other's weddings against one another, fraying friendships and alliances that could shift Silicon Valley's power centers. The fighting has been particularly acute among the "PayPal Mafia," a wealthy group of tech executives -- including Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Musk, Mr. Sacks and the investor Peter Thiel -- who worked together at the online payments company in the 1990s and later founded their own companies or turned into high-profile investors.
Other tech leaders have also been pulled into the political spats, including Vinod Khosla, a prominent investor, and Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz of the Silicon Valley venture firm Andreessen Horowitz.
Their unabashed vitriol is stark. While tech leaders often criticize one another in private, they rarely do so publicly for fear of upsetting a potential deal partner or future job prospect.
"Until a year or two ago, there was something like an omertà in Silicon Valley," said Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, using a word popularized by the Italian mafia for a code of silence. "People had fights all the time and leaders would disagree, but you wouldn't disagree in public."
Mr. McNamee jumped into the rumpus on Wednesday by calling out Mr. Andreessen and Mr. Horowitz, who both recently endorsed Mr. Trump, for their "antidemocratic" values on X. Mr. McNamee had previously invested in a company that Mr. Horowitz led.
Mr. Horowitz shot back on Thursday, invoking his 25-year business relationship with Mr. McNamee. "Really Roger?" Mr. Horowitz wrote. "Your very first idea when we disagree is to attack me in a tweet?"
The altercations show how Silicon Valley's identity is fragmenting. For years, the nation's tech capital was seen as a liberal bastion. But Mr. Sacks, Mr. Musk, Mr. Andreessen and Mr. Horowitz all broke from that view by endorsing Mr. Trump in recent weeks.
Many of them were unhappy with President Biden's tech policies and regulatory appointees, who have pursued more rules and lawsuits against tech companies. They prefer Mr. Trump for his push to lower taxes and his support for the cryptocurrency industry, which some of the tech billionaires have invested in.
"There's been shaming and canceling on the left for some time," said Trevor Traina, a Republican in San Francisco who served as ambassador to Austria during Mr. Trump's presidency and is close to Mr. Sacks and Mr. Hoffman. "And now you're starting to hear strong voices on the right in Silicon Valley."
Democratic tech executives and investors have countered that Mr. Trump is not good for tech. They say Mr. Trump and his allies have talked about throwing Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, in prison; suggested breaking up big tech companies; and proposed strict immigration policies, which could hinder the industry's hiring of skilled workers.
Mr. Hoffman, Mr. Thiel and an Andreessen Horowitz representative declined to comment. Mr. Sacks and Mr. Musk did not respond to requests for comment.
Political tensions began escalating into personal attacks last month after Mr. Sacks held an ornate fund-raiser for Mr. Trump in San Francisco. Days later, Mr. Hoffman, who gave at least $ 10 million to bolster President Biden's campaign, chided Mr. Sacks in a blog post for following "pro-Trump groupthink" and backing "a convicted felon."
At a conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, this month, Mr. Hoffman got into a heated exchange with Mr. Thiel, who has funded Republicans, according to a person briefed on the conversation. The longtime friends bickered over Mr. Hoffman's stance against Mr. Trump, leading Mr. Hoffman to sarcastically say that he wished he had made the former president "an actual martyr," the person said. The exchange was reported earlier by Puck.
After the assassination attempt on Mr. Trump, Mr. Sacks and Mr. Musk used Mr. Hoffman's words to criticize their former colleague. Mr. Hoffman responded last week by pointing out that some current supporters of Mr. Trump, including Mr. Sacks, had disavowed Mr. Trump in 2021 after the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.
"If you have integrity and you're supporting Trump in this election, you should address that," Mr. Hoffman said in a podcast appearance on Wednesday.
This month, Mr. Sacks shared a list of pro-Trump techies on X and spoke at the Republican National Convention, which grated on Democratic tech investors and entrepreneurs, said Siri Srinivas, an investor at Gradient Ventures. After President Biden withdrew from the race and Vice President Kamala Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee, many of those investors and entrepreneurs were energized and felt more emboldened to speak out, she said.
"Weeks of private hand-wringing likely helped many to urgently and emphatically show their support for Harris and opposition to Trump," Ms. Srinivas said. On Tuesday, she mimicked Mr. Sacks's list by posting a roster of the industry's Harris supporters on X.
Mr. Sacks has since continued his verbal attacks, taking aim last week at Reed Hastings, a Netflix founder who is a major Democratic donor. On X, Mr. Sacks called Mr. Hastings a "useful idiot" for supporting the Democratic Party.
Mr. Hastings did not respond to a request for comment.
Some tech luminaries have stayed out of the fray, including Mr. Zuckerberg. In 2016 when Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Zuckerberg posted on his Facebook page that "progress does not move in a straight line," alluding to Mr. Trump without naming him. But this time, the Meta chief has not talked about politics.
The exception was an interview with Bloomberg this month, in which Mr. Zuckerberg complimented Mr. Trump's "fist-pump" moment after the assassination attempt. Mr. Zuckerberg's decision to take a less vocal approach to politics could improve strained relationships in Washington and potentially with Mr. Trump if he is elected, two people familiar with the discussions said.
A Meta spokesman declined to comment.
Some tech entrepreneurs are reacting to the politicking. Merci Grace, a start-up founder in San Francisco, said she felt "betrayed" by Mr. Andreessen's and Mr. Horowitz's endorsements of Mr. Trump and would not work with their venture firm. Ms. Grace, who supports abortion rights and once had surgery after a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy, said she opposed the stance against abortion from JD Vance, Mr. Trump's running mate.
"The way in which Ben and Marc are claiming they're single-issue voters for Trump is so galling to me, because men have been throwing that line in my face for years as a way to dismiss the life-or-death stakes of abortion access," Ms. Grace said, referring to the investors' support of Mr. Trump because of what they said were his pro-tech policies. "Yes, I'm a single issue voter, too. Being alive is my issue."
But Mr. Khosla, who supports Ms. Harris, said the fights over politics would not leave lasting fractures in the tech industry, where innovation ultimately reigns supreme.
"I'll work with almost anyone if what I'm working on can change the world," he said.

Cutting Politics To Sell Movies To the Masses: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After a period of openly using movies to display progressive values, studios seem to be heeding a message from many ticket buyers: Just entertain us.
For nearly two decades, Hollywood has seemingly missed no opportunity to sound the alarm about climate change.
There have been cri de coeur documentaries, most notably "An Inconvenient Truth." Superheroes have been concerned, with Batman bemoaning mankind's treatment of the planet in "Justice League." Nary an award show goes by without a star or several begging viewers to take environment-saving action.
So it was startling when the weather-focused "Twisters" arrived from Universal Pictures this month with no mention of climate change at all. If ever there was a perfect vehicle to carry Hollywood's progressive climate change messaging -- a big-budget movie about people caught in worsening storm patterns -- wasn't this it?
Apparently not. Movies should not be about "preaching a message," Lee Isaac Chung, who directed "Twisters," said in a prerelease interview that served as a dog whistle to conservative ticket buyers.
Trend spotting in cinema is a hazardous pursuit. Sometimes a movie is just a movie. "Twisters," however, is emblematic of a clear shift in Hollywood: After a period of openly using movies to display progressive values, sometimes with success at the box office ("Barbie") and often not ("Strange World," "The Marvels," "The Color Purple," "Dark Waters"), studios seem to be heeding a message that many ticket buyers -- especially in the center of the country -- have been sending for a long time: We just want to be entertained, no homework attached.
Put bluntly, it amounts to an attempt by Hollywood to bend to red state audiences.
"It's a reflection of economics and the desperation of the film industry," said Corby Pons, a movie marketer who focuses on the faith community and is based in Nashville. "We want you to attend our movies. We need you to attend our movies."
Disney, which owns seven studios, including Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 20th Century, has put its creative ranks on notice. "We have to entertain first -- it's not about messages," Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, said at a conference late last year. "I don't really want to tolerate the opposite."
His comments were a sharp reversal from Disney's shareholder meeting in 2017, when he spoke with pride about more openly weaving sociopolitical messages into the company's movies. "We can take those values, which we deem important societally, and actually change people's behavior," Mr. Iger said then. (The shift seems to be going well, with escapist Disney movies like "Inside Out 2" and this weekend's "Deadpool & Wolverine" arriving as instant smash hits.)
For 20 years, Participant Media was Hollywood's pre-eminent maker of films with a conscience. "An Inconvenient Truth" was one of its early successes. But the company shut down in April. Participant relied on studios and streaming services to distribute its eat-your-broccoli documentaries and dramas about underrepresented communities, and those partners have cut back on such "niche" content in favor of more populist offerings. Streaming services like Netflix have also started to sell ads, and advertisers prefer all-audience, apolitical content.
Paramount describes its current focus as "all-audience, flat-out entertaining films." Those include "Gladiator II," one of the most-anticipated movies of the fall. "Many moviegoers don't want agendas or Hollywood telling them what they should be thinking," said Chris Aronson, Paramount's president of domestic distribution. He cited "IF," a feel-good PG movie that came out in May about a girl with imaginary friends, as one that "resonated strongly" with ticket buyers in the heartland.
Some stars are steering more directly to the right. Although it didn't result in the hit he envisioned, Kevin Costner squarely pitched his "Horizon: An American Saga -- Chapter 1" to red state moviegoers last month. (One "Horizon" ad prominently quoted the conservative commentator Glenn Beck saying, "Kevin Costner may be the only one capable of telling the true American story.") Dwayne Johnson, ever attuned to the marketplace, went on Fox News in the spring to decry "woke culture" and say that he regretted endorsing President Biden in the 2020 election.
Universal's approach to "Twisters" involved positioning the movie as escapist fun and studiously avoiding sociopolitical issues. The last thing Universal wanted was a film that doubled as a climate-change scolding, which would likely repel conservative ticket buyers. "We couldn't afford to overlook any audience," said Michael Moses, chief marketing officer at Universal. "With every decision, it was about how can we include and not exclude."
"Twisters," which cost $ 155 million to make, not including tens of millions in marketing costs, collected $ 82 million in ticket sales over its first three days in theaters in North America, roughly 65 percent more than box office analysts had expected, with red states providing most of the upside. To play up the movie's countrified bona fides, Universal arranged for marketing tie-ins with RAM trucks and Wrangler jeans; Mr. Moses dispatched the film's stars to a Luke Combs concert, where they shotgunned Miller beer.
"This movie is killing it for us," said Mike Barstow, executive vice president of Main Street Theaters, which operates 50 screens across Nebraska, Ohio, Wisconsin, Illinois and Iowa. "It's a relatable story -- our communities deal with tornadoes all the time -- but it's also just fun and doesn't feel condescending to rural values." (Instead, city dwellers are mocked. "Kate's from New York," one guy sneers in the film, which was written by Mark L. Smith. "You can't trust a thing she says.")
A lot of people in Hollywood only seem able to discuss the middle of the country while holding their nose. But entertainment is a reactive business: chase what worked over the weekend, drop what didn't. And some moviegoers and theater owners in the vast center of the country have recoiled from films they see as too progressive.
"WARNING," read a sign taped to the glass door of an Oklahoma movie theater in 2022. "The management of this theater discovered after booking 'Lightyear' that there is a same-sex kissing scene within the first 30 minutes of the Pixar movie. We will do all we can to fast-forward through that scene, but it might not be exact."
There was a line outside that same theater over the weekend to see "Twisters," which played on two of its three screens.
"Go woke, go broke" jokes, in some ways, have calcified into conventional film industry wisdom. Disney's storytelling shift came after an extended period in which the company was attacked by conservative pundits and politicians. Rival studios watched in terror, afraid they might be next.
More than ever, studios need every dollar they can find. Most are part of larger entertainment conglomerates that are under severe pressure to boost revenue, not to mention profit, as traditional cable channels wither and streaming services struggle with high programming costs. Last summer, ticket buyers in red states caught Hollywood's attention when they turned "Sound of Freedom," a thriller with QAnon overtones, into a runaway hit. "Sound of Freedom," made independently for $ 15 million, collected $ 184 million in the United States, beating big-budget "Indiana Jones" and "Mission: Impossible" sequels.
Hollywood has not recovered from the pandemic (in part because pandemic closures were followed by two lengthy union strikes against studios). Ticket sales so far this year in North America total $ 4.3 billion, down roughly 35 percent from the same period in 2019, according to Comscore, which tracks box office data.
As studios try to climb back, the heartland represents a specific opportunity. Ticket buyers in red states were the fastest to return to theaters after the pandemic, while those in coastal cities were the slowest. Some large markets, including San Francisco, have not fully recovered, according to studio distribution executives.
As Sarah Unger, the co-founder of Cultique, a firm in Los Angeles that advises companies on changing cultural norms, wrote in an entertainment industry newsletter on Wednesday, "Hollywood is missing a massive audience in plain sight."

Full text: Megan Stalter has lost almost every piece of jewelry she's ever owned.
But she's determined to flip the script on the Scorpio signet ring that she wore for a recent interview with The New York Times. Ms. Stalter's girlfriend wears another ring just like it.
Ms. Stalter found the matching rings at a store in Hollywood that sells jewelry, greeting cards and crystals. She was looking for a piece she could wear to pay homage to her girlfriend while filming "Too Much," a forthcoming Netflix series by Lena Dunham, in which Ms. Stalter has a starring role.
Ms. Stalter also stars as the titular, leopard-coat-wearing character in the recently released film "Cora Bora." And she has stolen many scenes in her supporting role on "Hacks," the comedy series, over its three seasons on Max.
The 33-year-old actress, in an interview that has been edited and condensed, talked about the ring that she has refused to lose, and why it is worth holding onto.
Tell me about the jewelry you're wearing.
It's a Scorpio ring that matches a ring I gave to my girlfriend, who is a Scorpio. It was a secret sign to show her that I was thinking of her in all of the scenes in the last show I did.
Did you wear it while you were filming?
I made it a really big deal on set for me to be able to wear the ring. I said, "I really need my character to wear this ring; it's really important to me that the character has this ring because someone in the character's life must have given it to her."
Everyone was kind of like, Why does she care about that ring so much? It wasn't something the character naturally would wear. So I had to have a whole story about it, and I was like, "Yeah, I feel like someone gave it to her."
They didn't mind if I wore it, but they wanted to find a replica ring because they want to have backup stuff in case you lose the original. But they couldn't find one -- I even told them what store I bought it at. They couldn't get another one. And I'm like, "OK, I guess we have the only two."
Your girlfriend is a Scorpio. What's your sign?
I'm a Virgo, but they didn't have that option.
Had you been searching for a ring for the two of you, specifically? Or did you come across the Scorpio ring and get that idea?
I wanted to get something for us that's matching because I was going away for a big job. I wanted us to have the same thing to look at. It reminded me of her, so I wanted to be wearing it.
I'm not a ring person. It's nice to have one that means a lot. I'm really proud of myself that I haven't lost the ring because it's important to me.
Did wearing the ring while filming "Too Much" ever take you out of character? Did it help you get into character?
I'm wearing it during earlier parts of my character's life in the show, not in the whole show. So wearing the ring actually did make me think, this is her younger. But the ring's real meaning is for me.
The costume is such a big part of the character. When you put on the stuff, it feels different than your own clothes. My dresser in the show actually told me that people are warmer in their own clothes. Costumes are not yours, so you don't feel as warm.

Dressing Rooms Get Into Character: [Style Desk]

Full text: As a child, the actor Krysta Rodriguez would mentally rearrange unfamiliar rooms as a way of soothing herself. The fixation followed her everywhere, from friends' houses to historical sites. She remembers visiting a clothing store in Paris with her family when she was 11 and obsessing over where she would put a bed if she lived there. "As I'm thinking about it, it was probably a control issue," she says. "I immediately try to figure out what a space wants to be. Is it a midcentury house that got renovated in the '90s with all this incorrect architecture? I clear it away."
Over the past two decades or so, Rodriguez, 39, has mostly channeled this aesthetic intensity into her character work, for roles on both the stage and screen (including a memorable turn as Liza Minnelli in the 2021 Netflix series "Halston"). In 2022, while appearing as Jean-Michel Basquiat's fictional girlfriend in the Broadway play "The Collaboration," she arranged her dressing room to look like a messy artist's loft, filled with the kind of ratty '70s furniture that her character would have grabbed from the streets of the East Village in the '80s. She says the actor Nathan Lane, with whom she co-starred in "The Addams Family" musical in 2010, helped her realize dressing rooms could be taken seriously when he turned his into an extravagant lounge, complete with a full bar. She also credits the actor Michael Cerveris, who painted his walls blood red and brought in a vintage barber's chair while starring in a 2006 revival of "Sweeney Todd." "I try to use these spaces as a gateway," Rodriguez says of her own dressing rooms. "I want to have some sense of the character, even if it's not my personal style."
In 2020, when acting work slowed during the pandemic, she turned her interest in interior design into a full-fledged business, renovating the homes of clients in her native Orange County, Calif., and beyond. But it wasn't until this spring that Rodriguez decorated a dressing room for another actor. When her friend Jeremy Jordan was preparing for his leading role in the Broadway musical adaptation of "The Great Gatsby," he asked Rodriguez to lend her design expertise. She took inspiration from the subtle details of the character's Jazz Age world rather than creating what she calls a "Party City Art Deco theme." Jordan's only request was that she make the windowless room, deep within the Broadway Theater, feel cozy. Rodriguez decided to reimagine the space as a sunroom in Jay Gatsby's Long Island mansion, with a soothing watercolor wallpaper of a Japanese maple tree, to reflect the era's affinity for Japonisme, and a marine blue love seat whose tropical plant print pillows match a nearby bird of paradise.
"We had differing priorities sometimes," she says. "He wanted a comfortable space where he could play video games. I wanted something totally beautiful where you drink champagne and invite guests over. I've known him for so long, and he has a wife, so he knows how to defer." Rodriguez added towels monogrammed with the initials J.G. and Prohibition-era photos; more personal touches include a vanity surrounded by mementos from Jordan's previous roles, such as a "Newsies" cap and a miniature Venus flytrap toy commemorating his stints in the current Off Broadway revival of "Little Shop of Horrors." Jordan had never seen any of Rodriguez's dressing rooms or done much decorating of his own, but he felt that playing Gatsby called for some flair. "Peacock lamp? Why not? This crazy wallpaper with sconces? I would've never thought to do that, but great," he says.
"My design and renovation work relates so much to my acting," Rodriguez says. In both cases, "you want to figure out who this person is and what experiences have made them who they are." Unlike a primary home, she adds, dressing rooms don't have to be functional; they just need to provide respite. "They can be purely fun," she says. "And even if no one sees the room" -- as was the case during "Into the Woods" in 2022, when guests were not allowed backstage, and her enchanted forest-inspired space went largely unseen -- "I still spend weeks putting wallpaper up, because it's important to me."

Harris's Views on Economics Are Seen as Being Mostly in Line With Current Policy: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: President Biden has not given his vice president an expansive economic portfolio. But she has engaged on issues of small-business lending, help for parents and more.
Shortly after the Biden administration took office in 2021, Vice President Kamala Harris started calling the chief executives of large banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.
The federal government was making hundreds of billions of dollars available for banks to lend to small businesses to keep them afloat during the pandemic recession. Ms. Harris told the executives they needed to be lending more, faster, particularly to minority-owned businesses that data suggested were struggling to gain access to the money.
The calls represented one of the earliest and most visible forays Ms. Harris made in devising and carrying out the Biden administration's economic agenda, and illustrated the sort of economic policy niche that she has filled as vice president.
Current and former administration officials, progressive leaders outside the White House and allies of Ms. Harris roundly agree that the vice president, who is now the leading candidate to secure the Democratic presidential nomination, did not play a major role in the creation of the sweeping economic legislation that has defined President Biden's time in office.
Ms. Harris was rarely a loud voice in major economic debates, like the ones over how to counter soaring inflation in 2021 and 2022. She did sometimes attend economic briefings, but was not always a big contributor in them. One attendee recalled her coming to an economic briefing, but simply listening to the presentation while Mr. Biden asked questions.
Other officials say Ms. Harris largely focuses her questions for economists on how certain policies affect workers and families at a personal level -- a trait she shares with the president.
Mr. Biden has asked Ms. Harris to take on other issues central to his agenda, like protecting reproductive rights as well as tackling the root causes of a surge of migrants from Central America at the border. But unlike the role that Mr. Biden carved out for himself during his vice presidency, Ms. Harris has not been a key player in the administration's expansive economic portfolio.
Instead, the officials say, Ms. Harris has gravitated toward a few select economic issues, which have evolved over the last several years. She was an early champion of an expanded tax credit for parents, along with a suite of proposals for child care, paid leave and other so-called care economy policies that did not make it into the economic bills Mr. Biden signed into law because they could not attract enough Democratic support in the Senate.
Ms. Harris's areas of focus also included access to capital for small businesses and place-based policies to help revitalize rural and urban communities that have fared poorly in recent decades, even in times when the economy grew.
She has led the creation of a public-private group called the Economic Opportunity Coalition, which seeks to drive tens of billions of dollars in investment capital to communities of color across the nation. Businesses participating in the effort include large financial firms like Capital One and Goldman Sachs, along with companies like Netflix and PayPal.
"She feels very strongly about entrepreneurship, small-business access to capital and particularly that businesses that may not have straightforward access to capital have methods to do that," said Bharat Ramamurti, a former deputy director of Mr. Biden's National Economic Council who worked with Ms. Harris on those issues.
People who have worked with Ms. Harris in the administration describe her as having been largely shoulder to shoulder with Mr. Biden on economic policy questions, with few notable dissents from his choices. Her record from the Senate and her short-lived presidential campaign in the 2020 cycle suggest a few areas where she is more liberal than Mr. Biden or otherwise differs from him on economic issues.
Ms. Harris earned an economics degree from Howard University, and her father is an emeritus economics professor at Stanford University. She has not clearly defined an economic policy philosophy as vice president -- but her economic policy views will be critical in an election where economic issues, including inflation, rank as the top concern for voters.
Felicia Wong, the president of Roosevelt Forward, an advocacy affiliate group to a progressive think tank, said Ms. Harris was focused on economic opportunity and was "close to labor."
Some of Ms. Harris's core allies in the labor movement are concentrated among service workers, rather than the blue-collar unions that have formed the basis of Mr. Biden's support.
The vice president spoke at a convention held by the Service Employees International Union in May, highlighting the price cap on insulin and a higher minimum wage for federal contractors as Biden administration victories. Ms. Harris said the administration wanted to make sure that medical debt "cannot impact a person's ability to get a car loan, an apartment lease or a home loan," and explained its efforts to cancel student loan debt.
April Verrett, the union's president, said Ms. Harris's record as a champion for labor extended back to her time in California as attorney general. She has "shown up as a true ally and champion," Ms. Verrett said.
The S.E.I.U. endorsed Ms. Harris shortly after Mr. Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday, and it is among a group of labor unions sponsoring an ad highlighting Ms. Harris's record on paid family leave.
While Ms. Harris has less of a track record on more macroeconomic issues -- she is rarely asked about topics like inflation or the overall state of the job market -- in 2022 she pointed to corporate profit-taking among oil companies as a driver of price increases.
While many more progressive Democrats say corporate profits are a big reason for rapid inflation, more moderate economists argue that companies always want to raise prices and maximize profits. What has enabled companies to lift prices so rapidly since 2021 is a combination of strong consumer demand and limited supply.
The White House has begun to use the talking point, but at times reluctantly. Progressive groups pushed the Harris campaign this week to lean into the idea that corporate greed has pushed prices up.
"I do think she will be able to make a more nuanced argument about the drivers of inflation," Ms. Wong said.
Where Ms. Harris would land on some pressing issues is still not totally clear -- for instance trade, where her record suggests even more skepticism toward new free-trade deals than Mr. Biden has shown.
The Biden administration has been using tariffs to protect industries important to national security and other targeted priorities, and Ms. Harris herself worked on securing supply chains and on immigration-related issues as vice president.
She traveled to Central America to promote manufacturing businesses there that would provide employment and try to stem the flow of migrants to the United States. Ms. Harris also traveled to Asia several times. There, she discussed supply chain issues, like the global shortage of semiconductors that occurred after the pandemic, and took a more critical stance toward China.
In the Senate and on the campaign trail, Ms. Harris positioned herself as slightly more progressive than Mr. Biden on trade-related issues. She said in 2019 that she would not have voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement, for instance.
She was one of only 10 senators to oppose a renegotiated NAFTA, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, under President Donald J. Trump. Ms. Harris concluded that the deal fell short because it did not contain any measures to address climate change.
In general, people close to the White House said they did not expect Ms. Harris to break dramatically with the administration's approach to economic policy, though they thought she might shift the emphasis.
"I think she is personally much more passionate about the care side of the agenda," said Ernie Tedeschi, who is now the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab and who was until this year the chief economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
At least during her time in the Senate, Ms. Harris did not appear to subscribe to any particular economic philosophy, said Yasmin Nelson, who was Ms. Harris's policy adviser there.
"I don't think you'll see her referencing some bookish theory," said Ms. Nelson, who now works at Holland & Knight, a law and lobbying firm. "But at heart she's a capitalist with liberal views."

A Small Man in a Big Time, or Not: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When I think about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address on Wednesday to a joint meeting of Congress, the first thing that comes to mind is the famous dictum "There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen." This is one of those weeks for Israel, America and the Middle East. A decade is teed up to happen -- or not.
By pure accident, a set of profound war-or-peace tipping points have intersected this week that Tolstoy could not have made up. In the wake of President Biden's decision on Sunday to put his country ahead of his personal interests and cede power, Netanyahu -- who has consistently put his personal interests ahead of his country's to hold power -- comes to Washington. And he comes facing two intertwined decisions that could provide Biden a huge foreign policy legacy and transform Netanyahu's own legacy at the same time -- or not.
It's as if the writers of "The West Wing" on NBC decided to collaborate on a script with the writers of "Fauda" on Netflix -- and they're now wrestling over whether to make a series about a new dawn or a new tragedy for America, Israel and the Arab world.
Thanks to the frequent-flier travels since the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7 of Biden, Secretary of State Tony Blinken, C.I.A. Director Bill Burns and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Netanyahu has two huge decisions sitting on his desk that could both pause the fighting in Gaza -- and Lebanon -- and lay the groundwork for a new U.S.-Arab-Israeli alliance against Iran.
We are talking about the most consequential opportunity to reshape the Middle East since the Camp David agreements in the 1970s.
The first decision, though, requires Netanyahu to agree -- right now -- on a phased-cease-fire deal tentatively reached by U.S., Israeli, Qatari, Egyptian and Hamas negotiators that would trigger, in Phase 1, a six-week pause in the fighting in Gaza and the return of 33 Israeli hostages (some dead, some alive), including 11 women, in return for several hundred Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
In June, Netanyahu signaled his support for the basic parameters of this deal but since then has been toying around with certain aspects of it -- dialing up and down their security importance to an Israeli public that does not always know the details -- to buy himself time before signing off and possibly alienating the far-right extremists in his cabinet, to whom he has promised a "total victory" over Hamas in Gaza.
Netanyahu has focused on three security issues. One is the movement of Gazan civilians from southern Gaza, where they have taken refuge, to northern Gaza City, where many had their homes. Netanyahu had been seeking some kind of inspection system to prevent armed Hamas members from flowing back to the north, but with tens of thousands of people who will be moving, the Israeli army knows that it will be impossible to prevent a few hundred Hamas fighters from coming back (plenty are there already) and believes it can deal with them later.
The second issue is the control of the border between Gaza and Egypt, where Hamas built tunnels and smuggling routes from which it brought in many weapons. The Israeli army, according to a source, believes it has identified or destroyed most of the tunnels and that Israel and Egypt can ensure no one is passing above ground for now -- and they can build a more permanent barrier over time. The last issue is the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza, which Israel says Hamas must never again control and where it insists on some inspection oversight -- in partnership with non-Hamas Palestinians and some international party.
As Israeli and U.S. security officials explained to me, none of these issues should be deal breakers -- unless Netanyahu wants to inflame one of them to get out of the deal -- even though Israel's top military and intelligence officials all reportedly support it now.
On Monday Haaretz quoted retired Col. Lior Lotan, a hostage expert and a close adviser to Defense Minister Yoav Gallant (who is the only serious adult in Netanyahu's cabinet), as telling Israel's Channel 12 News on Friday: "Now is the money time. There's a unique opportunity in the negotiations, but such opportunities pass if they aren't utilized. The terms of the deal include risks that the defense establishment can tolerate. All the heads of the security services say this. To counter them with a hypothetical, as if it were possible to get more through more military pressure, would be wrong."
At the same time, Israel's Mossad chief David Barnea, the country's top hostage negotiator, reportedly told Netanyahu and his far-right cabinet "that the female hostages don't have any time left to wait for a new hostage deal framework."
Hamas, whatever its lingering reservations, also seems to want a deal now too. It has grown steadily more unpopular in Gaza (the most underreported aspect of this conflict) for having started a war with no plan for the morning after and no protection for Palestinian civilians. It is not clear to me who will try to kill the Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar first, if and when he emerges from his hiding place -- the Israeli army or Gazan civilians.
Another huge benefit of a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel is that it would be likely to pave the way for a Hezbollah-Israel cease-fire, so tens of thousands of civilians on both sides of the Lebanon-Israel border could return home. Given the increased use of precision rockets by both Israel and Hezbollah, U.S. defense officials now believe that the biggest danger to the Middle East is a widening Israel-Hezbollah war.
And now for Netanyahu's second big decision. On a parallel track, the Biden team has worked out virtually all the details for a U.S.-Saudi defense alliance that would also include normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia -- provided that Netanyahu would agree to embark on negotiations for a two-state solution. The Saudis are not asking for a hard deadline for a Palestinian state. But they are demanding that Israel agree to start credible, good-faith negotiations with the explicit goal of a two-state solution, with mutual security guarantees.
Such a negotiation, in tandem with a cease-fire on the Gaza and Lebanon fronts, would be a diplomatic coup. It would isolate Iran and Hamas. It would normalize relations between the Jewish state and the birthplace of Islam. It would give Israel the cover to enlist Palestinian and Arab support for peacekeeping troops in Gaza. And it would give Israel the cement for a more formal regional defense alliance with Arab partners against Iran.
Finally, and most important, it could create a long-term pathway for a Palestinian state once the fighting in Gaza is over and everyone on all sides grasps what I believe is the most important lesson of this war: none of the parties can afford another one -- not when everyone is getting precision weapons.
As David Makovsky, director of the Washington Institute's Project on Arab-Israel Relations, put it to me: "With two decisions -- yes on a hostages-for-cease-fire deal now and yes on the Saudi normalization terms that would end the Sunni Arab states' war with Israel and consolidate a regional alliance to isolate Iran -- Netanyahu would create a win for Israel and for his partner President Biden.
"The Abraham Accords would be succeeded by the 'Joseph Accords.' Two legacies for two leaders: Biden and Bibi. It would be a bitter and tragic irony if Netanyahu -- whose self-image is one of a strategic thinker -- would miss this moment due to Israeli domestic politics and fear of his far-right coalition partners."
Indeed, we are going to find out very soon whether Netanyahu can live up to his grand Churchillian self-image or is, as the writer Leon Wieseltier once observed, just "a small man in a big time."
Up to now Netanyahu has been clinging to power to avoid being thrown in jail should he be found guilty in any of his ongoing trials -- for breach of trust, accepting bribes and fraud. As such, he has been unwilling to do anything daring on peace with the Palestinians without permission from the crazy far-right members of his cabinet, who are demanding the "total victory" over Hamas that Netanyahu himself promised. But with the Israeli Knesset about to adjourn from July 28 until Oct. 27, Netanyahu could agree to both the Gaza and Saudi deals without fear of his government being toppled, because that is virtually impossible to do when the Knesset is out of session.
So, the world waits, the hostages wait, Biden waits, the Palestinians wait, the Saudis wait, the Israelis wait. Will Bibi, once again, be just a small man in a big time or surprise everyone and be a big man in a big time?

Uncomfortably Plausible, by Way of Norway: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Both sociopolitical thriller and parable, this Viaplay series presents a future that can feel uncomfortably plausible.
In "The Fortress," a new series about pandemic, isolationism and government corruption, something is rotten in the state of Norway. The year is 2037, and the country has spent the last decade cut off from the rest of the world, behind a wall of its own making. When a deadly virus sweeps through the land, the prime minister blames refugees for bringing the illness to an insulated paradise.
But in this case, the menace is a domestic breed. And the government will do anything to cover up its origins.
A sociopolitical thriller and a parable, "The Fortress," a seven-part Norwegian series, made its American debut on Tuesday, the latest in a wave of Scandinavian dramas cresting on American shores in recent years that tend to be brainy, rooted in reality and, yes, chilly. (This one is available on Viaplay.)
It is also timely -- dystopian and futuristic but only just, playing off the rising tide of isolationism in Europe and around the world in these post-pandemic, post-Brexit, "build the wall" times.
"Our main theme is that to solve the world's problems, everybody needs everybody," said John Kare Raake, a co-creator of the show and its lead writer, in a video interview from his home in Oslo. "We can't just say, 'That's not our problem.' We have to work together and decide that we can relate to problems in other countries that are not at our doorstep."
With a star-filled cast and an award-winning script (it won best screenplay last year at the Series Mania festival in Europe), "The Fortress" is a high-profile venture for Viaplay, a Swedish-based streamer that made its North American debut only last year. The show's assortment of characters representing the different strata of Norwegian society are played by some heavy hitters of international drama.
Tobias Santelmann ("Exit") plays the prime minister; Rebekka Nystabakk ("Twin") plays his icy deputy, who helps try to spin the news cycle with an ambitious new speechwriter ( Eili Harboe, who portrayed the shifty GoJo communications head in the final season of "Succession"). A food safety researcher (Selome Emnetu) scrambles to create a vaccine, even as she is imprisoned for blowing the whistle on the inconvenient truth of the pandemic's origins.
Russell Tovey (a British actor who played Truman Capote's abusive lover in the most recent season of "Feud") appears as a refugee from England who is hunted by the military; he knows too much, and he might unknowingly hold the key to a vaccine breakthrough.
The series often plays like a Scandinavian take on the great paranoid thrillers of 1970s Hollywood, including "Three Days of the Condor," "The Parallax View" and "All the President's Men"; like that last film, it even features tense, clandestine meetings in a parking garage. Raake and the show's other creator, Linn-Jeanethe Kyed, craft a quietly vertiginous feeling of dread, fueled by the sense that almost nobody here can be trusted.
Technology rings familiar but ups the ante on invasiveness: Drones are ubiquitous, scanning faces for identification; a government-run A.I. network provides information on private citizens in a flash. "The Fortress" is more realpolitik than science fiction.
For all its resonance with the events and fears spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic, the seed of the idea came to Raake years before, he said -- back in 2014, during the early days of the refugee crisis in Europe.
According to Pew Research Center, 1.3 million refugees and migrants came to Europe seeking asylum in 2015. Responses varied within each country, ranging from acceptance and tolerance to xenophobia and a renewed isolationist fervor. Norway's neighbor Sweden initially announced an open-door policy; it shut that door in late 2015 with new measures to make asylum more difficult. Countries including Hungary and Poland have built border fences to prevent illegal immigration.
This period also brought Brexit, England's departure from the European Union, and bellicose calls from Donald J. Trump, then a presidential candidate, to build a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico.
"This kind of isolationism is not unique to Norway in any way," Raake said. "It's all over the world."
But "The Fortress" is also very much a thriller for the Covid age. Viaplay picked up the series in 2018, and as the idea evolved, the real-life pandemic commenced, and Raake and Kyed found themselves adjusting the premise to current events. The masks -- sleek plastic contraptions that cover most of the face -- play a starring role in the finished series. The politicization of the scramble to create a vaccine should ring eerily familiar.
As the series moved toward production, Raake was concerned that Covid would make "The Fortress" a harder sell for audiences.
"In the middle of the pandemic, the thought was, 'Who wants to have this thriller about something happening right outside your house?"' Raake said.
Then he noticed that "Contagion," Steven Soderbergh's detailed, deeply cynical 2011 movie about a deadly outbreak, was climbing the most-watched list on his Netflix home screen. Perhaps there was still a public appetite for material like his. Shooting began in 2021.
By then, social distancing and regular testing were facts of life. An actor would test positive and production would shut down, as the pandemic put a temporary halt to this pandemic story. Story lines were rewritten on the fly to account for who might be available on a given day.
"We were isolated while shooting and everyone had masks on, and then you are performing these scenes where everybody's got masks on," Tovey said in a video interview from his home in London. "So the method actor in me was satisfied because I had material around me consistently."
On a more fundamental level, "The Fortress" is about the politics of imports and exports. Norway, a country of fewer than 6 million people that borders Finland, Sweden and Russia, is Europe's largest gas producer and exporter. It has huge reserves of seafood and fresh water, an important factor in the series. (Its central crisis begins with the creation of a vaccine to prevent salmon from getting sick.) But the country also imports much of its produce and animal feed.
"We were an old farming country and pretty self-sufficient," said Harboe, who plays the enigmatic speechwriter, from her home in Oslo. "But now we also rely on imported goods. Our consumed food is 60 percent imported, even though we have a lot of beautiful, farmed land that we could use more of."
In the Norway of "The Fortress" the government has grown tired of sharing its plentiful energy reserves and is wary of an outside world marred by crime, climate change and refugee crises. Self-sufficiency is the national mantra. The country has rejected international cooperation at every level, and at a terrible price.
Back in the real world, one Norwegian export doing quite well is television. The country is part of the continuing craze for "Nordic noir," with Norwegian thrillers including "Occupied" and "Wisting" providing cerebral chills.
More stories of Norway are reaching the rest of the world in the streaming age -- including one that imagines a dystopian world of nationalist retrenchment.
"When I started in the business, there was a limit to how many things we could produce," Raake said, adding: "Now we have a lot more people to pitch shows to. The world is getting smaller, and we're getting bigger."

The Irreconcilable Versions of JD Vance in ‘Hillbilly Elegy’

Much has been made of the political pirouette JD Vance executed to secure the embrace of Donald Trump, a man he once called “cultural heroin” before seeking his endorsement for the Senate and, last week, accepting the Republican nomination to be his vice president.
Old friends and former classmates have expressed bewilderment at the seemingly irreconcilable versions of Vance. But contradiction has been central to Vance’s biography, nowhere more so than in his popular 2016 book, “Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis.”
The memoir, whose political dividends have far exceeded the millions of dollars it has paid in royalties and movie rights, emerged at a pivotal point in national politics, quickly becoming a go-to guide to the white underclass discontent that propelled Trump’s surprise presidential victory.
Vance used his personal account of overcoming dysfunctional family values to tell a larger story about forgotten Americans. In his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, he leaned again into those themes, at one point drawing attention to his mother, “who struggled with money and addiction but never gave up.” She stood in the audience when he continued, “And I’m proud to say that tonight my mom is here, 10 years clean and sober.”
But during Trump’s presidency, reaction to the book, like so much else in culture and politics, became increasingly polarized. While he expected pushback, Vance was confused by the attacks from opposite ends of the ideological spectrum, he professed in an afterword appended to the book in 2018.
“I’ve heard, for instance, from someone on the Left that my book is a victim-blaming piece of anti-government libertarianism,” he wrote, adding that “someone on the Right” had complained that the book’s premise “would justify a massive expansion of government welfare programs.”
“Both of these things can’t possibly be true.”
Yet the book clearly allowed people to believe each of those things could be true. And Vance himself straddled those contradictions in his acceptance speech Wednesday night, delivering a CliffsNotes version of the book interwoven with a critique of President Joe Biden’s policies that ran counter to some of the book’s messaging.
When talking about how the people in his book had been “cast aside and forgotten by America’s ruling class in Washington,” Vance cited as examples trade deals with Mexico and China that he said had destroyed jobs back home.
But in “Hillbilly Elegy” he suggested quite the opposite.
“We talk about the value of hard work, but tell ourselves that the reason we’re not working is some perceived unfairness,” he wrote. “‘Obama shut down the coal mines’ or ‘All the jobs went to the Chinese.’ These are the lies we tell ourselves to solve the cognitive dissonance — the broken connection between the world we see and the values we preach.”
Even within the book, Vance’s biography contains a yin-and-yang quality. He described being raised in a family with Appalachian roots fractured by drugs, violence and poverty that had relocated to “an Ohio steel town that has been hemorrhaging jobs and hope for as long as I can remember.” Yet he somehow managed to escape the gravitational pull of his chaotic clan to join the Marines, get a college degree and attend Yale Law School.
He cast a wry eye on Ivy League elites, noting how a trip to Cracker Barrel, the “height of fine dining” back home, became a “greasy public health crisis” for his Yale classmates: “I realized that in this new world I was the cultural alien.” At the same time, his struggling friends and relatives in Ohio, with whom he expressed solidarity and a degree of sympathy, were not spared his often acerbic observations about laziness, bigotry and domestic abuse.
Vance packaged it all with a disarming humility. “To understand me,” he wrote, “you must understand that I am a Scots-Irish hillbilly at heart.”
When “Hillbilly Elegy” was published during Trump’s first presidential campaign, it was heralded as refreshingly original social commentary. People all along the political gamut tended to find in its pages evidence that supported their views, whether it be a need for greater personal responsibility or a more effective social safety net.
There were also objections, particularly among some others familiar with Appalachia. Silas House, an author and scholar of Appalachian studies at Berea College in Kentucky, later told Politico that “as soon as I read it, my antenna’s going up all over the place.”
“There’s a scene where he talks about his uncles, who are these drunks who fight everybody and they beat their wives, and then he calls them the embodiment of the Appalachian man,” House said. “Well, as an Appalachian man, that’s deeply troubling to me, because that doesn’t embody Appalachian masculinity as I know it.”
Rather quickly, however, the book was being held up as an interpretive guide to the evolving politics of the moment. Liberals appreciated that Vance, though open about his conservative views, did not shy away from criticizing Republicans. In a July 2016 essay titled “Opioid of the Masses,” he said Trump was fooling the people described in his book with false promises of help and redemption.
But conservatives saw larger themes at work. The same month Vance’s essay was published in The Atlantic, the American Conservative ran a column by Rod Dreher proclaiming “Hillbilly Elegy” perhaps the most important book of 2016 for “Americans who care about politics and the future of our country.”
“You cannot understand what’s happening now without first reading J.D. Vance,” he wrote, suggesting the book “does for poor white people” what the work of Ta-Nehisi Coates did for poor Black people: “give them voice and presence in the public square.”
Vance’s own path, meanwhile, was taking him further away from his roots. After briefly practicing law and starting a nonprofit focused on combating opioid addiction, he moved into private equity, eventually working with venture capitalist and Republican megadonor Peter Thiel.
He flirted with running for the Senate in Ohio in 2018, but decided against it. Two years later, Netflix released a movie version of his book that earned poor reviews but introduced Vance’s story to a wider audience. When Ohio’s other Senate seat became available in 2022, Vance jumped in, with help from Thiel, who gave $10 million to support his campaign.
By then, Vance’s public persona was undergoing a profound makeover. He made a pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago in February 2021 to bend the knee before Trump, apologize for his past criticisms and seek the former president’s support. He grew a beard, which some saw as performative masculinity associated with the MAGA movement, and moved steadily rightward in his partisan assessment of the country’s problems.
As he changed, so did popular views of his memoir.
Liberals and “Never Trumpers” who might have once given Vance credit for speaking hard truths, now wondered aloud if he really believed what he had written or if the book had always been a launchpad for a political career.
In The Atlantic — the same magazine where Vance had called Trump “cultural heroin” — Tom Nichols, a Republican-turned-independent, said he had once been “intrigued by his writing,” but now lamented Vance’s “silly and yet detestable moral collapse.”
“Instead of a truth-teller in his own community,” Nichols wrote, “Vance as a candidate has become a contemptible and cringe-inducing clown.”
Others came to Vance’s defense. Abigail Shrier, a former Wall Street Journal opinion writer, said his book “compassionately describes the vast numbers of poor whites who feel left behind” and offered “a conservatism that refrains from denigrating and dividing the American people.”
Vance won his Senate campaign. And with Trump’s reemergence at the top of the Republican ticket for 2024, he positioned himself as a potential running mate, further solidifying his place as a lightning rod in the culture wars.
He has made occasional attempts to explain himself. In an interview last month with New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, Vance attributed the hardening of his views mostly to a growing irritation with progressives and elites. He cited, for example, the backlash to the rise of Black Lives Matter in 2020.
“There was nothing you were allowed to say. Offending someone was an act of violence,” he said. “I think a lot of us just said: ‘We’re done with this. We’re not playing this game, and we refuse to be policed in what we think and what we say.’”
He also said he had come to believe that liberals and elites viewed his book as “an interpretive lens for Trump’s voters” without challenging their own preconceptions about the people he wrote about.
“I realized,” he said, “that I was being used as this whisperer of a phenomenon that some people really did want to understand but some people didn’t.”
Now vaulted back onto the national stage, Vance is bound to get a surge in new readers for the book, which spent 74 weeks on the New York Times hardcover nonfiction bestseller list and 66 weeks for paperback nonfiction. This week, the paperback and Kindle versions are trending at No. 1 on Amazon.
“We’ve gone to press several times and will continue as the demand grows,” the book’s publisher, HarperCollins, said in a statement.

Taking Control Of True Crime Through TikTok: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The genre is wildly popular across media, but often produced without input from those most affected. Viral videos are helping survivors own their stories.
On Feb. 9, 2004, Maura Murray went missing on Route 112 in Haverhill, N.H., after a string of puzzling events. A neighbor who witnessed a single-car crash reported it to the police. When officers showed up, Murray's car was locked and she was nowhere to be found. She hasn't been seen since.
Her sister Julie Murray thought there were more strange elements that didn't add up. Maura's computer revealed a confusing internet search history, and she had made seemingly random A.T.M. withdrawals. Different people Maura had spoken with before her disappearance reported that she had lied to them about various things.
Julie spent years trying to find out what happened to her sister, creating a website and trying to get coverage in traditional media. But it wasn't until 2022, when a video she uploaded to @mauramurraymissing on TikTok amassed more than three million views, that she drew wider attention.
"I was able to sort of take agency over my sister's story for the first time," she said. "I can just go on and on and on about the wonders that TikTok has done for me."
True crime podcasts, movies and investigative TV series are wildly popular, often raking in profits for their producers and platforms. Many, though, are made without the consent or involvement of those most closely affected. A growing number of survivors of crimes, and family members of the victims of unresolved attacks and disappearances, say that TikTok has given them more control over their stories.
"TikTok is the only equal playing field out there where a random person can create an account today and go just as viral as Kim Kardashian," said Sarah Turney, whose stepsister, Alissa, went missing in 2001.
Alissa Turney's remains were never found. It took calls from her friends, who reported to police allegations that her stepfather, Michael Turney, had been abusive, to spur an investigation seven years later. Home videos, including footage that Michael Turney shot from a parking lot of Alissa at work, helped convince Sarah that Michael (her biological father) was responsible for the murder. Police said the evidence wasn't sufficient to make an arrest.
Sarah posted her first TikTok in April 2020, after not getting as much traction as she wanted on many other social media platforms.
"I actually typed in 'true crime' into the search bar, and almost nothing came up and I realized that this was an open market for true crime," she said. She now has more than a million followers on the app, where some of her videos have been viewed more than 20 million times. Turney has founded a true crime media company that hosts her podcast, "Voices for Justice," and "Media Pressure," led by Julie Murray.
Murray said being able to communicate directly with followers brought them more deeply into her story. In most of her posts, she speaks directly to camera, often using the green screen feature behind or above her to share photos of her sister, maps, and examples of physical evidence in the case.
The best thing about TikTok, she said, was that it provided "the humanity behind the tragedies," which is missing in a lot of true crime content.
People could see her and see the pain in her voice and hear her voice shake, she said, and that "established some level of empathy."
She credited TikTok's algorithm with serving her posts to viewers who like to engage with true crime narratives. Turney said the platform also gives her a forum to describe her sister's case accurately.
The police opened Alissa's case as a murder investigation in 2006, after her boyfriend told them that Michael Turney had checked her out of school the day she went missing. Michael was charged with second degree murder in 2020, but a judge granted an acquittal in 2023 because of insufficient evidence. Sarah still posts to TikTok what she says is evidence of his guilt. He has continued to deny involvement.
TikTok has also given survivors a way to own their stories, and point out ethical concerns over their consumption.
Kara Robinson Chamberlain was 15 when she was kidnapped in South Carolina, outside a friend's home in 2002. Richard Evonitz held her captive in his apartment for 18 hours and assaulted her before she escaped. She identified him to police, and evidence from her abduction helped connect him to the murders of three teenage girls.
Chamberlain posts on TikTok about her experience, recounting details of her kidnapping. She said that it was "kind of cool" to be able to challenge viewers to consider the ethics of engaging with true crime content. She wants consumers to pay attention to whether survivors have had a hand in the narrative, "because whenever you are monetizing content and telling someone else's trauma, that's exploitation."
That criticism was levied in 2022 at Ryan Murphy, the showrunner of "Dahmer -- Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story," which was a critical and commercial hit when it released on Netflix that year. Friends and family of some of the 17 men Dahmer killed said that they were re-victimized by the portrayal, and were not asked for their consent or involvement. Murphy later said producers reached out to nearly 20 friends and family members of victims "and not a single person responded to us."
Rita Isbell, whose brother Errol Lindsey was murdered by Dahmer, wrote in Business Insider about the experience: "It's sad that they're just making money off of this tragedy. That's just greed."
According to Chamberlain, the kidnapping survivor, TikTok offers a fair monetization of content. By enrolling in the TikTok Creator Fund, she said she made about 2 to 4 cents for every 1,000 views, meaning that Chamberlain's most popular videos could earn her hundreds or thousands of dollars.
The TikTok fame can also help creators earn additional income from paid appearances and advertising. Chamberlain gives speeches, hosts the podcast "Survivor's Guide to True Crime" and was the executive producer of a Lifetime movie that fictionalized her experience.
"I have literally watched people learn what it means to be a conscious consumer of true crime. And it's kind of cool to be on the front lines of that," she said.

Donors, With Renewed Vigor, Flock to Support a Harris Bid: [National Desk]

Full text: Advisers and major givers said they were being inundated with enthusiasm and plans for donations to support Ms. Harris if she won the nomination.
Democratic donors are immediately mobilizing around Kamala Harris as their party's next presidential nominee, offering Democratic elites something they have not felt in weeks.
Optimism.
Advisers and major givers said on Sunday that they were being inundated with enthusiasm and word of planned donations to support Ms. Harris if she became the official Democratic candidate -- even as questions remained about how to best support her. Shortly before 5 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday afternoon, the Biden campaign filed paperwork formally renaming its campaign committee "Harris for President."
In the immediate aftermath of President Biden's decision to exit the race, Ms. Harris was enjoying some broad, swift consolidation among major givers. Multiple Biden donors and their advisers said that they were hearing from previously despondent donors who were ready to give to support a Harris-led ticket. One Silicon Valley bundler raised over $ 1 million in a 30-minute period, the person shared.
Alexandra Acker-Lyons, a Democratic donor-adviser who has spent the last few days behind the scenes trying to raise pledges for Ms. Harris, said that she had "gotten a barrage of emails, texts and calls" with promises to give. "People who hadn't given at all asking where to give," she said.
Gretchen Sisson, a top Democratic bundler in California and a supporter of Ms. Harris, said the announcement was met with enthusiasm in her circles, and that she was collecting pledges that she could collect on later in the week. "My phone is exploding," she said. "Lots of folks are asking where to contribute, what they can do to support the campaign, and wanting to write more. People who were committed but worried are now excited and energized."
The endorsements came in hard and fast on Sunday afternoon from the Democratic Party's billionaire class, the type of people who can write a seven- or eight-figure check to an outside pro-Harris group. Reid Hoffman, the Democratic mega-donor who was among Mr. Biden's strongest supporters over the last few weeks amid the chaos, endorsed Ms. Harris for the presidency. Another major billionaire backer of Mr. Biden, Alex Soros, the heir to the famous Democratic philanthropist family, said he was backing her as well.
The nods also came from Democratic groups that steer big donors in their giving. Emily's List, a big-money Democratic group that boosts women who support abortion rights and backed Ms. Harris during her vice presidency, offered an immediate endorsement. Way to Win, a major Democratic donor group with many members who are partial to Ms. Harris, also said that they were backing her.
"Way to Win is going all-in behind Harris, President Biden's chosen successor," Jen Fernandez Ancona, one of the group's co-founders, told The New York Times. "She embodies the passing of a torch to a new generation at a time when that is desperately needed to shore up our diverse, winning coalition."
Raj Goyle, an influential Indian American Democrat, said there would "be an unprecedented level of South Asian support" for her among major contributors.
Steve Phillips, a Democratic donor and longtime supporter of Ms. Harris, said that he was encouraging donors and groups with whom he worked to publicly back Ms. Harris "and to demand that Whitmer, Newsom and anybody else fully endorse Harris immediately."
Not everyone agreed and was ready to immediately crown Ms. Harris as that standard-bearer. Still, there were no donors immediately consolidating around a specific candidate other than Ms. Harris.
Vinod Khosla, a billionaire venture capitalist and a major Democratic donor in his own right, said that he wanted to see an open convention and mentioned a few candidates that he liked -- including Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. "Time to have an open convention and get a more moderate candidate who can easily beat @realDonaldTrump," he wrote on X. But none of them have said they are running for the presidency.
Mr. Khosla wrote that he wanted to see "a proper process at the convention, hopefully with ranked-choice voting there." He added: "A lot of the 'left' crowd endorsing Kamala because of religion. If other candidates step up things will change quickly."
Reed Hastings, the Netflix chief executive who was one of the earliest megadonors to call for Mr. Biden to step aside, did not back Ms. Harris explicitly as the nominee but was suddenly sanguine: "We have hope now. Dem delegates need to pick a swing state winner. Thank you, Joe Biden," he told The Times in an email.
Others on Sunday were in a more nostalgic mood, ruminating on Mr. Biden's decision.
Gideon Stein, who had become a leading figure in the donor community pushing for a new nominee, called Mr. Biden "a true American hero," and predicted that the decision would pave the way for a Democratic victory in the presidential race.
Daniella Ballou-Aares, the chief executive of a group called Leadership Now Project that had spearheaded calls from business executives for Mr. Biden to drop his campaign, compared his decision to George Washington's decision to not seek a third term as the nation's first president. In a text message, she called Mr. Biden's decision "a historic precedent for selfless leadership" and "a sign of the strength of American democracy."

At 5, She Picked Up Chess. At 9, She's a U.K. Prodigy.: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Bodhana Sivanandan, a fourth-grader, has become one of England's best players just a few years after discovering chess during pandemic lockdown.
Since learning chess during a pandemic lockdown, Bodhana Sivanandan has won a European title in the game, qualified for this year's prestigious Chess Olympiad tournament, and established herself as one of England's best players.
She also turned 9 in March. That makes Bodhana, a prodigy from the London borough of Harrow, the youngest player to represent England at such an elite level in chess, and quite possibly the youngest in any international sporting competition.
"I was happy and I was ready to play," Bodhana said in a phone interview, two days after she learned that she had been selected for this year's Olympiad, an international competition considered to be the game's version of the Olympics.
The fourth-grader, who learned chess four years ago when she stumbled across a board her father was planning to discard, knows exactly what she wants to accomplish next. "I'm trying to become the youngest grandmaster in the world," she said, "and also one of the greatest players of all time."
She has some three years to achieve her first goal. The youngest person to become grandmaster, the highest distinction other than world champion, is Abhimanyu Mishra, an American player who was 12 years, 4 months and 25 days when he became grandmaster in 2021.
International masters have called Bodhana a phenomenon since she burst onto the competitive chess scene that same year. She beat adults for the first women's prize in the European Blitz Chess Championship last December, and is currently ranked as a woman FIDE master, a title given by the International Chess Federation.
That helped her land one of five spots on the English Olympiad team "purely on merit," said Malcolm Pein, the director of international chess at the English Chess Federation. She is by far the youngest player on the squad; Lan Yao, the second youngest player on the team, is 23.
It was pure chance that led Bodhana to discover her talent. When she was 5, she found a board with a missing pawn that her father, Sivanandan Velayutham, had been planning to give away.
"I was interested in the pieces, and I wanted to use them as toys," she said. "I was mainly interested in the knight and the queen."
Mr. Velayutham explained that it was a game. "I said, it's not easy, but if you learn, you can play," he recalled. It was the first year of the coronavirus pandemic, and Bodhana spent her time watching YouTube videos and playing chess online. Soon, she was beating her father and entering online tournaments.
While Bodhana's talent may be extraordinary, her recent discovery of the game isn't, Mr. Pein said. Chess in recent years has seen a boom, in particular among young people and women, driven by pandemic boredom and the Netflix hit "The Queen's Gambit," which follows a troubled prodigy navigating the male-dominated chess world.
After that, "a whole new generation of incredibly talented children appeared," said Mr. Pein. The game offers extra appeal for younger children: "It's very empowering to be able to beat an adult at something," he said.
And Bodhana started doing exactly that, after Mr. Velayutham brought her to a London chess festival and her local chess club.
"It was supposed to end up in a charity shop," said Mr. Velayutham in an interview, speaking of the chess board. "But it ended up in a good cause for our country!"
These days, Bodhana trains about an hour each day after school, with the help of international-master level mentors and coaches from the England Chess Federation. (She particularly enjoys studying the games of the late Cuban chess player José Raúl Capablanca, she said: "I like the endgame.")
Mr. Pein called her a "positional player," with a keen awareness of the pieces' position relative to each other on the board. "She doesn't rush headlong into sacrificial attacks," he said, praising her "very cool, focused demeanor at the board and an incredible determination to win."
One international master chess player, Lawrence Trent of England, expects the 9-year-old to be the country's greatest player. "The maturity of her play, her sublime touch, it's truly breathtaking," he said on social media last year.
Bodhana likes how chess "activates your brain," she said. Her advice on playing well? "You should just keep going, and you should stay calm."
The excitement around Bodhana drew players to ChessFest in Trafalgar Square on a recent Sunday, where she played exhibition games, some simultaneously. She was one of several English chess prodigies present, among them Supratit Banerjee, 10; Shreyas Royal, 15; and Ethan Pang, 9.
It is not unusual to see children competing at high levels of chess. The youngest player to compete in the 2022 Chess Olympiad, according to the International Chess Federation, was Randa Seder of Hebron in the West Bank, who was 8 at the time. That year, Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa, a 16-year-old prodigy from India, defeated Magnus Carlsen, the world champion, in an online tournament.
For now, Bodhana's father wants her to enjoy the game without imposing expectations.
"At end of the day, she is a kid, right?" Mr. Velayutham said. "I don't want to set the milestones. Let her set her own milestones."

For Trendy Alternative to Veils, Try a Bridal Hat: [Society Desk]

Full text: Fashion experts cite the influence of the British royals, along with high-profile events like the Kentucky Derby for the resurgence of this vintage wedding trend.
When Rose Minutaglio and Chris Marazzo stepped into Tiro a Segno, an Italian social club in New York, for their rehearsal dinner last winter, family and friends who were waiting there erupted in cheers. The enthusiastic response seemed to be not just for the couple, but also the customized, ivory-colored felt top hat worn by the bride-to-be.
"Everyone said the hat is stunning, the hat is everything," said Ms. Minutaglio, 30, a senior editor of features and special projects at Elle magazine.
"Because I wore my mother's wedding dress on my wedding day, I wanted to play with bridal fashion the day before," said Ms. Minutaglio, who intentionally channeled Bianca Jagger and Marlene Dietrich, both of whom are known for their confident style and "who weren't afraid to say no to the ball gown or a blusher veil."
After more than a year of wearing face masks during the pandemic, bolder fashion statements like hats have been making a comeback, appearing in an array of styles, shapes and colors on designer runways and city streets, as well as in weddings and related events.
"Now that people are going out again, they want to dress up more," said Jennifer Hoertz, a milliner who has a studio at her home in Brewster, N.Y. "They're looking for events to wear a hat to. A wedding is that event. Brides are calling because they want something other than a tiara."
Some milliners and other industry professionals cite the influence of the British royals for giving hats more exposure, especially Kate Middleton, along with high-profile events like the Kentucky Derby. Beyoncé and her most recent album, "Cowboy Carter," have helped make cowboy hats, in particular, trendy again.
Multiday weddings have played a role as well. "With every event, brides need a different look," Ms. Minutaglio said. "A hat makes you stand out in a good way." As a fashion editor, she said, "I'm seeing more hats on the runway, especially this past April in Barcelona Bridal Fashion Week, which is generally a good predictor of new trends."
Gigi Burris, who runs a millinery shop in Manhattan's Chinatown, customized the hat that Ms. Minutaglio wore to the rehearsal, fastening a piece of the veil that Ms. Minutaglio's mother-in-law wore at her own wedding to the side of her hat.
The design process took around six months and included in-person visits, during which Ms. Minutaglio helped to choose "fabrics and color, hat height, even how flippy the sides should be," she said.
"This hat was mine," she added. "It was something I got to pick and design."
Ms. Burris has noticed an increase in demand for wedding hats. She usually makes and sells about 20 hats each year, she said, but "suddenly brides were calling last year asking for hats and I sold 60." Her prices range from $ 400 to $ 600; customized ones can cost $ 900 to $ 2,000.
Ms. Hoertz, whose hats cost around $ 350 to $ 500, has also been busier. Before the pandemic, she sold about 10 to 15 bridal hats each year. That number has doubled.
Recent client requests have included the "reworking of a mother's headpiece into the hat I was creating for a bride's wedding," she said. "Hats can become heirloom pieces that are saved or worn again."
Another bride wanted a button hat with specific flowers. "Others want fabric with feathers and beading that work in conjunction with their dress," she said.
Francesca DiSpirito, the owner of Francesca DiSpirito Styling in Kew Gardens, N.Y, noted the rise in interest in bridal accessories over all. "The veil and headpieces have been done," she said. "Capes, jackets and layering pieces have been explored. The hat is an untapped, intentional accessory we haven't explored in one's wardrobe and another element for detail. Social media and the runway have also brought hats into the forefront."
A hat can complement the setting and backdrop of a wedding, as well as the vibe a couple is looking to create for their event, Ms. DiSpirito said.
"For a seaside wedding, you want something soft, flowy and airy, like a floppy beach comber, boater or cartwheel hat," she said. "These are wider-brimmed, more dramatic and bigger hats as opposed to a pillbox, cloche or fedora."
While some hats cover most of the head and might be simple in style, others like the bibi or a fascinator -- purposely placed on one side of the head -- are typically more ornate.
Brides aren't the only ones opting for hats. Mothers of brides and grooms, guests and some grooms are choosing to adorn their heads.
The actor Mahershala Ali "wore one of our hats, the Sharina, to the Oscars," Ms. Burris said of her men's line, which she created in 2018. "That became an immediate best seller for us. The hat and suit were so striking and strong that it inspired many grooms to choose that hat to be part of their wedding experience."
Rhianna Simard, 39, a tattoo artist and a project manager at Restaurant365, a software company in Irvine, Calf., was inspired by Tan France, who wore the Sharina on the Netflix series "Queer Eye."
"I planned my whole wedding attire around it," said Mx. Simard, who uses they/them pronouns and married Alexx Alcorn, 34, on Oct. 6, 2022, in a bamboo forest in Camelot Meadows, in Belmont, N.C. "The hat was a gorgeous statement piece," they said, as well as comfortable and low maintenance.
"I had to take multiple pictures and wanted something easy to put on and take off," Mx. Simard said. "The hat made me feel unstoppable. I was empowered, elegant, edgy, classy and my authentic self in it."
If hats are becoming the new tiara or veil, more bridal designers may decide to incorporate them into their collections and collaborate with milliners.
"Bridal designers are not proficient milliners, which is a unique and specific craft," Ms. DiSpirito said. "Instead, they're going to partner with milliners who specialize in what they can't."
Kyha Scott, the founder and creative director of Kyha, a bridal ready-to-wear label in Melbourne, Australia, has worked with Hurricane Lab, a Portuguese artisan hat company, on five bridal hats, priced at around $ 340 to $ 400.
But, Ms. DiSpirito noted, "you don't need wedding sites or wedding designers to find a hat." Stores like Anthropologie, she said, have "a beautiful assortment of hats."
Not everyone sees the head-covering needle moving forward -- at least not now.
"A hat can be a big wow statement, and brides want to capture that image," said Marissa Rubinetti, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of Kleinfeld Bridal in Manhattan, which offers a few hats for sale.
"But we haven't had any hat requests," she continued. "People still believe in the veil. When the bride finds her dress, the moment we put the veil on them, tears flow and the look is completed. The whole vision comes to life. I don't think that's going away."
Still, others believe that wedding styles will continue to evolve and include hats.
"For the bride or groom, the hat is a crowning moment and a finishing piece that extends your personality," Ms. Hoertz said. "The hat is the new tiara or veil, which often covers your face. And because a hat is near your face, it's where people are focusing their attention."

Lord Almighty, Joe, Let It Go!: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Everyone wants Joe Biden gone.
Even the people who don't want him gone really want him gone.
"Everyone's waiting for Joe," said one top Democrat. "And he's sitting at home, stewing and saying, 'What if? What if? What if?' We're doing things the Democratic way. We're botching it."
I have many happy memories of Rehoboth Beach. I went there growing up and have Proustian recollections of crispy French fries with vinegar sold on the Boardwalk. But now my gladdening images have been replaced by a maddening one: President Biden hunkered down in his house there, recovering from Covid, resisting talking to anyone who will tell him the truth, hoarsely yelling, "Get off my beach!" at the growing list of Democratic lawmakers and donors trying to warn him that he is pulling down his party and the country.
It makes me sad that Biden doesn't see what's inescapable: If he doesn't walk away gracefully right now, he will likely go down as a pariah and ruin his legacy.
The race for the Oval today is between two delusional, selfish, stubborn old guys, and that's a depressing state of affairs.
As for those D.C. careerists surrounding Biden who a) hid his true condition; b) gaslighted the press for focusing on what they called a nonexistent age issue; c) shielded the president from the truth about his cratering chances of winning; and d) seem to have put their self-interest first?
One way or the other, they'll probably be out of their jobs soon.
Shockingly, even as the Republicans roar out of Milwaukee, vibrating with joy, Biden's brain trust continues to run a lousy campaign, as though nothing has changed. Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, Biden's campaign chair, went on "Morning Joe" Friday to say that the polls aren't as bad as they are, that Biden is "more committed than ever" to running and that, when 100,000 homes got a knock on the door this past week, 76 percent of the respondents "are with Joe Biden." Then, as Alex Thompson reported for Axios, Dillon went from cable news to a rah-rah call telling staffers not to pay attention to cable news because "the people in our country are not watching cable news."
On the same day, Kamala Harris suddenly joined a call to reassure donors, but donors are in full flight.
At the convention, I went to a "Policy Fest" held by the Heritage Foundation -- the folks devising the extreme Project 2025 -- and their vision for America is very creepy and retrogressive.
Democrats should be alarmed thinking about Donald Trump with a Republican Senate promoting Judge Aileen Cannon to the Supreme Court.
This is already over. Democrats and journalists have moved on to other questions: Will Biden throw his support to Kamala or ask for an open convention? Would Kamala agree to be on an all-femme ticket with Gretchen Whitmer? Can a candidate other than Kamala play with the pot of gold now designated for Biden? Would the amazing ratings of a gladiatorial Democratic contest and an open convention drive Trump out of his mind? (Yes!!)
Tony Fabrizio, a Trump pollster, told reporters this week that not only does the campaign have an ad blitz about Biden's debate brain freeze ready to go, but it also has primo oppo on Kamala. "Rest assured," he said, "we are 100 percent ready."
But Republicans are nervous about a Dem ticket swap. Tom Cotton posted that it would be a "coup."
Biden has a right to be sniffy about some of the elite Democrats who want him out. Even if Barack Obama stopped messing with his Netflix money and came to Delaware to tell Biden to go, Biden wouldn't listen. He's still bitter that Obama pushed him aside for Hillary in 2015, so he doesn't want to hear from either of them. Obama always seems to be leading Joe off the stage -- even at that glossy Hollywood fund-raiser -- and Joe resents it. He doesn't want to have that awful feeling like he had in 2016 when he watched Trump beat Hillary, after he had stepped aside.
Now CNN reports that Biden is "seething" at his old friend Nancy Pelosi, the most respected person in the party, because he thinks she's coordinating a campaign to force him out. Pelosi's longtime pal in the California delegation, Zoe Lofgren, put out a letter Friday urging Biden to step aside, and New Mexico Senator Martin Heinrich and Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, who is sure to bring others with him, also joined the chorus.
It's true that Pelosi has played Madame Web in this crisis, initially trying to create a silky web that would caress Biden out of the race, and only getting tougher once he resisted. She has been sitting with her maps of the political world, working the phones and doing her head counts.
She loves Biden -- he was more grateful for her help than Obama was and more effusive in his praise -- but she loves the House more. She refuses to let the president burn it down for the sake of his ego and make it easy for Trump to slouch back to Washington with messianic, vengeful dreams.
Given that Biden said it would take the Lord Almighty to make him drop out, I have no doubt that Pelosi has been using their shared Catholic faith to guilt-trip the president into understanding the stakes, and what she thinks the Lord Almighty would want. Certainly, she might have said, she doesn't like Trump claiming, as he did this week, that the Lord Almighty is on his side.
Really, what the Democrats need is a thrilling open convention, rather than a coronation. Trump just had one of those, after all.

This Teen Needed Help. Instead She Got 'Chaos.': [Op-Ed]

Full text: Sadie Sutton was first hospitalized for depression when she was 13. She grew up in the Bay Area and had access to all the medical professionals she might need but began to feel worthless and suicidal as she moved through adolescence. (Sutton is her middle name. She requested that I not disclose her last name to protect her family's privacy.)
At 15, after four hospitalizations and outpatient therapy at Stanford University, she was sent to an inpatient program at McLean Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School. There, she completed 14 weeks of dialectical behavior therapy (also known as D.B.T.), a science-backed approach that teaches people to regulate overwhelming emotions.
But afterward, her parents were afraid that living at home would threaten her recovery. They sent her to Chrysalis, a so-called therapeutic boarding school in Montana, part of what is known as the "troubled teen" industry, which also includes wilderness programs and other residential facilities that claim to treat everything from youthful misbehavior and drug problems to severe depression. They were told she'd receive more D.B.T. and other evidence-based care. Unfortunately, that wasn't what she got. She said her stay there was "the worst year of my life."
When even well-informed parents can't distinguish between excellent and inappropriate care, our system is broken. As the United States faces a post-pandemic mental health emergency, we need immediate reform. As with medications, behavioral health treatments for teenagers must be required to be proved safe and effective before they can be sold.
At McLean, Ms. Sutton's therapy was rigorous and emphasized autonomy: She worked collaboratively with the therapists, rather than simply being told what to do. She could call her parents anytime.
Ms. Sutton described the setting at Chrysalis -- which was recently sued after a staff member was alleged to have sexually abused students -- as "chaos." "You had to 'earn' the privilege of talking to your parents" outside of therapy sessions, she said, which took months and even then was only a monitored, five-minute weekly call. At first, she just sobbed.
As for the therapy, because she'd already had D.B.T., she didn't think she was being treated with it. "There was really no structure," she said. Groups involved giving "feedback" to other girls about their behavior, which often turned into bullying. Because Ms. Sutton was determined to get better, she complied. Only later did she recognize that her experience had been traumatic. (Chrysalis didn't respond to a request for comment.)
Troubled-teen programs are receiving new scrutiny thanks to activism by Paris Hilton, who was sent to several facilities, and the Netflix documentary series "The Program," which exposed abuse in a network of sites that claims to have treated 40,000 children. (I appear in the series as an expert.)
One key issue is that with few exceptions, it's nearly impossible for parents to know for certain what treatment their children will receive. Perhaps the most offensive fact is that even though annual fees per child can range from $ 110,000 to more than $ 400,000 per year, in some facilities, kids get just a few hours a week of professional therapy, and others provide none at all. When such care can be a matter of life and death, this is outrageous.
Residential centers should not be allowed to promote themselves as treatments for adolescent mental illnesses or addictions unless they can show that the child has a diagnosis that requires such intensive therapy and that their methods meet the standard of care for it. The only way to stop widespread harm is to ensure that abusive practices cannot be disguised as therapy or hidden from oversight.
Pharmaceutical companies need to prove to the Food and Drug Administration that risky psychiatric medications are safe and effective before marketing them. The same should be true for residential therapy regimens for kids. We need an agency, or at least a set of federal rules, that acts as an F.D.A. for the treatment of troubled children.
Congress is paying attention. On June 12, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat who chairs the finance committee, held a hearing and released a report from a two-year investigation of existing residential programs. At any given time, an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 teenagers are in the facilities operated by the companies examined in the investigation, though because of lack of regulation, the exact numbers are unknown. In just the past year, two of the chains that were investigated were ordered to pay over $ 1 billion in damages related to the rape of minors.
The report looked at programs that receive government funds via Medicaid or the child welfare system -- although the same programs often serve privately insured or self-pay customers as well. It documents widespread taxpayer-funded "sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, unsafe and unsanitary conditions, and inadequate provision of behavioral health treatment." It describes systemic, "routine" harms that "are the direct causal result of a business model that has incentive to treat children as payouts and provide less than adequate safety and behavioral health treatment in order to maximize operating and profit margin." Basically, these centers can either maximize profits or provide appropriate care -- not both.
Finding alternatives, however, is difficult. Many parents have genuine concerns that their children will hurt themselves or others if not confined to a controlled setting. They also tend to assume that since residential treatment is expensive, it must be better.
Experts, however, say that home- or community-based care is almost always more effective, and inpatient care should be used only for the most extreme cases (active psychosis, suicidal or homicidal behavior) and for the shortest time possible.
New Jersey's system of care approach offers a way forward. At any time, 24/7, parents with a child in crisis from drugs, mental illness or other behavioral problems can call a hotline. Within an hour, if needed, a trained team will arrive and develop a plan at no cost that provides ongoing treatment, regardless of ability to pay.
This rapid response is essential to mitigating fear and shows parents that emergencies can typically be managed at home via continuing support. New Jersey's approach cut the use of residential care nearly in half between 2016 and 2023, while closing 10 juvenile detention centers and improving stability in foster care. The state has long had one of the lowest youth suicide rates in the country.
One key to its success is that New Jersey has been able to direct Medicaid funding toward home- and community-based services, while many other states prioritize residential care. When residential care can't be avoided, New Jersey uses tightly regulated programs that are close enough for frequent parental visits. This not only helps children but also provides oversight of conditions. Most for-profit youth residential programs no longer operate in New Jersey, while nonprofits have expanded.
Reflecting increasing bipartisan consensus, Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, said during the hearing that "children are best served when they can receive care within their own homes and communities." Other states should take their cues from New Jersey and create similar systems of care. Federal legislation should be passed to bolster these systems, ban harmful tactics, create and enforce standards and end perverse incentives that favor Medicaid funding of residential programs. The cheaper approach will also be safer, kinder and more effective.

In Tech Chaos, Some Get a Free Day Off: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: "Happy international blue screen day."
It's a sensation familiar to anyone who has seen the 1986 movie "Ferris Bueller's Day Off": You wake up and find yourself with an unexpected day of freedom. And today, people didn't even have to fake a fever or dodge a tempestuous school principal.
For millions of people, the global technology outage on Friday was a source of distress. Airports were filled with disgruntled would-be travelers. Hospitals canceled noncritical procedures, and 911 lines went down in several states.
But for a small group of corporate workers, the global outage brought a welcome kind of chaos: a snow day in the middle of July. Some workers affected by the outage shared images of their computers on social media captioned "happy international blue screen day," referencing the error messages that overtook screens during the outage. On TikTok, users posted about clocking in only to find "the blue screen of death" (or hoping they would, for an extra day off).
CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity firm whose software update led to the outage, counts some 70 percent of Fortune 100 firms as customers. That means workers in cubicles all over the world felt the effects right away. JPMorgan, Bank of America and BlackRock were among the large financial firms affected.
"The reason why this particular outage was so visible is that the largest companies were hit," said Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer at WithSecure, a cybersecurity company. "They don't control the whole cybersecurity market, but they do have a very large percentage of the largest companies in the world."
Yeves Perez, a founder of the start-up Workbnb, who lives in Las Vegas, woke up at 6 a.m. on Friday and was feeding his two children when he saw that he had a pileup of emails canceling his meetings for the day. He turned on CNN and saw news of the outage. Then he scrolled through social media and saw memes -- which turned out to be misinformation -- showing error messages on the face of the Sphere, an event venue in Las Vegas with 700,000 square feet of programmable screens.
"It felt like that movie on Netflix -- that chaos situation of nobody knows what's going on," Mr. Perez said. "I'm like, 'OK, everybody's just taking the day off."'
Mr. Perez figured that many of his friends and business associates who were visiting Las Vegas for work would be hitting the pools. "Here in Vegas, there's no shortage of summer fun," he said. "I'm planning to barbecue. I'll have people over, chill in the backyard, crack some beers."
Amid the tumult, a handful of freed-up workers were openly celebrating, or as one user posted on X, "I sent 'hope everyone's having a nice International Bluescreen Day' to the group chat."
Rohan Brown, an entrepreneur, had spent the last few days hosting an event called Pitch Mayhem, in which start-up founders gathered in Las Vegas to share pitches in a "March Madness meets Shark Tank"-style competition.
The event ended on Thursday, which is when Mr. Brown's week turned into actual mayhem. His flight out of Las Vegas was canceled and he missed four meetings as he scrambled to rebook. But the people on the other end of his emails were just as flustered.
"For one of my meetings, they just responded and said, 'Hey we're taking the whole day off,"' Mr. Brown said.

Wind Sprints: Stalking Wild Monsters in Tornado Alley: [Review]

Full text: Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones lead a stand-alone sequel to the 1996 hit -- and times sure have changed.
The 1996 mega-blockbuster "Twister" is pleasing in its almost childlike simplicity. It's a monster movie where the monster is a tornado, which neither knows nor cares about the people chasing it down. A tornado does not have a vendetta. It's not even hungry, like a zombie is. Its path is erratic but its behavior is predictable: It forms, it destroys and then it simply collapses.
That means the real intrigue comes from the human side of things, and on that point "Twister," with a healthy dose of mid-90s style tropes and an absurdly stacked secondary cast (including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Alan Ruck, Jami Gertz and Todd Field, the future director of "Tár"), delivers mightily. The movie's enduring status as a classic is due in no small part to its continual appearance on cable TV -- and it works so well in that medium because you can flick it on at virtually any moment and know basically what's going on. The estranged lovers Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton chase a tornado, hoping to deploy a device cheekily named "Dorothy" that will help them understand it better and save lives. No complicated back stories, no lore necessary.
Nearly thirty years later, "Twisters," billed as a stand-alone sequel to "Twister," has a bit of a tougher hill to climb. For one, the era of straightforward original blockbusters ended a long time ago, swallowed up by superheroes and franchises. "Twister" has its fans, but the only character "Twisters" shares with its predecessor is the tornado.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
And tornadoes aren't what they used to be either. When I left my screening of "Twisters" and turned on my phone, I saw a text from my mother, who lives in a region known more for its blizzards than tornadoes. The National Weather Service, as it turned out, was warning residents to look out for thunderstorms, flash flooding and ... tornadoes.
The words "climate change" are never uttered in "Twisters," but as anyone in the path of extreme weather knows, things have been getting worse. This hurricane season is predicted to be an unusually bad one. If you tried to travel over Memorial Day weekend, you felt the real effects. And tornadoes now tend to rove in packs. There's a reason the title of this movie is plural.
Weather-driven inconvenience is one thing. But tornadoes and other extreme weather events can devastate the lives of survivors -- something that "Twisters" is far more interested in than its predecessor is. This is a movie about whole towns losing their homes, lives and livelihoods thanks to highly unpredictable and relentless weather. It's also about the people who profit off that increased liability, from speculators to social media stars. In trying to appeal to a broad audience, "Twisters" takes on a tough challenge. It mostly pulls it off.
At the center of "Twisters" is Kate Carter (Daisy Edgar-Jones), a meteorologist who, like Helen Hunt's character in the previous film, is living with the lingering trauma of a tornado run-in years earlier. Now she works for the National Weather Service in New York City as a kind of storm whisperer. Kate grew up in Tornado Alley and seems to have a preternatural sense for how tornadoes will behave: where they're going, when they'll intensify and, most important, whether it might be possible to fight back.
When her old friend Javi (Anthony Ramos) shows up, begging her to come track tornadoes with him for a new, potentially lifesaving project, she reluctantly decides to go west. (Javi is from Florida, but went to college with Kate; he has obvious reasons for caring about the human effects of extreme weather.) Having arrived in Oklahoma, Kate discovers that the crowd gathered for the new and particularly active tornado season resembles a circus. There are tornado chasers everywhere. The cockiest and worst of them is Tyler Owens (Glen Powell). He travels with a ragtag band of chasers who fly drones and shoot fireworks into the tornadoes, the better to get the shot for YouTube. Tyler calls himself the "tornado wrangler," sells branded T-shirts and styles himself as a cowboy. Kate hates him on sight.
You can roughly guess where this is going -- "Twisters," with a screenplay by Mark L. Smith, is based on a story by the "Top Gun: Maverick" director Joseph Kosinski and feels modeled on a 1990s blockbuster. (Kosinski was originally slated to direct the film as a reboot of "Twister.") The old-school formula feels refreshing: This is an action-adventure-disaster film filled with ordinary people trying to accomplish extraordinary things.
But it's also distinctly contemporary. This is in part because of the direction of Lee Isaac Chung, whose previous film "Minari" was a quiet tale of a Korean immigrant family that garnered six Oscar nominations. "Minari" and "Twisters" are in very different genres, but they share in common a knowledge of the American Midwest -- and in particular, the experience of living through its terrible storms -- that's rooted in Chung's own upbringing in rural Arkansas. It's hard to imagine a director more suited to this material, and more capable of training our attention on the survivors without losing the fun of the adventure.
That fun comes from the other most 2024 part of "Twisters." I speak, of course, of Glen Powell, the actor whom everyone seems to be talking about this year. No wonder: This is his third big movie of the year (after the megahit rom-com "Anyone but You," which picked up box office steam just after the new year, and the Netflix winner "Hit Man"). Powell often looks like he's having a blast, but in "Twisters" it sometimes feels as though he's in an entirely different movie than everyone else. His tornado wrangler is a modern-day cowboy crossed with a romance hero: He starts off as a jerk and then you slowly learn he's got a heart of gold.
Next to Powell, Edgar-Jones seems profoundly lackluster, all eyes and no personality. The pair's chemistry is hard to get excited about, which seems even more obvious once Maura Tierney shows up as Kate's mother. (It's worth noting that Ramos, in his limited screen time, exudes plenty of his own charisma.) Edgar-Jones's performance seems more withholding than necessary, and we're left mostly wondering when Powell will return.
That mismatch hampers "Twisters," and the movie lags as a result. You can imagine a very different sort of actress in the role of Kate -- one with some spark and comedic chops who might bounce against Powell more fruitfully. But that doesn't mean "Twisters" fails. It's loaded with fun and sometimes funny set pieces and enough danger to keep you on your toes.
There's a deeper significance, too. A late scene makes it clear that this is meant to be a monster movie, the story of a menace whose creation is both predictable and mysterious and whom we need a hero to fight. In "Twister," the storm's existence was taken for granted, something to chase around and, the heroes hoped, be able to predict with science. In "Twisters," however, the goal isn't just to predict the path the monster will take -- science has mostly figured that one out. Instead, the aim is to fight it, deflate it, defang it. The futility of such a quest is what's in question.
And that is genuinely frightening, even if you're not getting tornado warning texts while you watch the movie. If we can't fix climate change, can we fight it? And if so, who benefits? Who will take advantage of our weather in the future, and who will suffer from it? The apocalyptic element of "Twisters" hits a little closer to home. The idea of a tornado as a monster is a metaphor. But the tornado itself, and the havoc it wreaks, is very, very literal.
Twisters
Rated PG-13 for a little bit of bad language, but mostly intense scenes of storms and destruction. Running time: 2 hours 2 minutes. In theaters.

Find Me Falling: [Review]

Full text: Harry Connick Jr. stars as a cranky rocker who returns to Cyprus, the home of the love who inspired a signature hit.
When John Allman retreats to a shack on the coast of Cyprus in "Find Me Falling," he's already glum. The aging rocker, portrayed by Harry Connick Jr., marches out of his new refuge with indignation and barks at a man standing on the cliff's edge looking out at the sea. Then the man steps into the air and is gone.
It's a surprisingly flip start to a romantic comedy that -- with its intergenerational interplay and sunbaked settings -- recalls "Mamma Mia!" Yet the writer-director Stelana Kliris is undaunted by, though not entirely in control of, balancing her material's at times somber, at other times blithe, notes.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The police captain (an amiable Tony Demetriou) tells him, unceremoniously, that the promontory has become a "suicide hot spot." More put out by this revelation than moved, John begins to build a fence. Naturally, the ramshackle barrier becomes a metaphor for his sealed-off soul.
Trying to maintain anonymity, John is dogged by mentions of his first hit: "Girl on the Beach." After all, the beach was in Cyprus -- but that girl, Sia (Agni Scott), is now a woman. Scott brings a measured mix of attraction and wariness to John's long-ago muse, who is now referred to as the "town's best doctor." And Sia has her reasons for their separation.
Can a film have its own spoiler alert? In an early, easily decoded bait-and-switch, Melina (Ali Fumiko Whitney) completes a triangle as an aspiring singer and one of the first people to befriend the prickly musician.
A South African Cypriot, Kliris exudes affection for the country's craggy terrain and its people. The film is a tourist office's, if not quite a rom-com lover's, dream.
Find Me Falling
Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 32 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

Full text: An article on claims of sexual misconduct against Louis C.K. led to backlash against the women who spoke out. "Sorry/Not Sorry," a New York Times documentary, examined the aftermath.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In November 2017, the #MeToo movement had gained traction. A month earlier, a New York Times investigation that outlined sexual harassment claims against Harvey Weinstein inspired more and more women to come forward with their own stories.
So when three reporters, Cara Buckley, Jodi Kantor and Melena Ryzik, covered sexual misconduct allegations against the comedian Louis C.K., the reactions came swiftly.
A day after the article was published, Louis C.K. released a statement saying the claims were true: He had masturbated in front of several women. He also said that he would "step back." He returned to stand-up less than a year later.
The women who had come forward about Louis C.K. were criticized and even mocked by his fans. And Dave Chappelle joked about one of the accusers in a 2017 Netflix special.
The fallout and Louis C.K.'s subsequent comeback are explored in a new documentary, "Sorry/Not Sorry." Directed by Cara Mones and Caroline Suh and produced by The Times, the documentary features interviews with three of the women who spoke about Louis C.K. and with comics, critics and others who discussed whether more should have been done to address the open secret about his behavior. (Louis C.K. declined requests to appear in the documentary.)
The film presents the audience with a difficult question: Why were the women made a punchline, whereas Louis C.K. was able to return to the stage?
To mark the film's release, Ms. Buckley, Ms. Kantor and Ms. Ryzik, all of whom were consulted on the film, looked back on their reporting. These are edited excerpts of their separate interviews in person and via phone and email.
The initial reporting
JODI KANTOR: In the wake of the Weinstein story, I got a tip about Louis C.K. Rumors about him had swirled around for years. It seemed like this was a window where we could tell the real story. What I remember about the Louis C.K. story was how fast it moved. The Weinstein investigation took about six months. This was really just a matter of a few weeks.
MELENA RYZIK: It was one of the first reporting projects we worked on in the immediate aftermath of the Weinstein investigation. Given the confidentiality and urgency, it was a very intense few weeks. When word got out that we were working on the story, and Louis canceled his appearances and a movie premiere of "I Love You, Daddy" without ever actually responding to our many requests for comment, that was a first for me. The story was trending on Twitter before ours was even published. I was still getting the final sources on the record and it was already a worldwide thing.
The backlash against the women
CARA BUCKLEY: Backlash against the women was definitely a concern. I didn't think it would blow up the way that it did. I was really surprised by the pushback against the women. They're talking about something that happened to them that was deeply upsetting, about an imbalance of power. So why are they getting roasted? It still makes no sense whatsoever.
KANTOR: They were really aware of the risks. But they were also trapped in a gray zone. Some of them had actually told the story for years and had never really been silent about it.
How this story was different
KANTOR: Usually the accused says, maybe under the advice of a lawyer, "Nothing like that happened" or "She totally misconstrued it." What was striking about this story was that Louis copped to it, publicly, almost immediately. That makes it really different from other #MeToo stories because it meant there was no factual dispute.
BUCKLEY: Very few people spoke out in the comedy world because they really liked Louis. There was a marked generational difference in how people responded. Younger people who were fans of Louis were heartbroken. People older than us were like, "What's the big deal?" It goes to show, historically, how much women put up with. There was a way lower tolerance for it among young people.
Why this topic remains relevant
RYZIK: The comic personas that Louis had pre- and post- these revelations are very different, as is some of his fan base. And we have still not sorted out, culturally, how to square all of that with what he did, and how he's using it now. As the film makes clear, he has continued to flourish, while some of the women have had a much harder time. I'm glad the filmmakers asked men in the industry about all this, too.
KANTOR: To me, this is a lasting story. All these years later, the controversy about Louis C.K. is how can he be so successful when we all knew he did those things. That's for other people to make up their minds about. But what matters to me is that these women came forward and told the truth. He acknowledged they were telling the truth. And because they had the bravery to do that, the comedy world is never going to be the same.
Before 2017, there was more of an attitude of, "This is accepted, this is inevitable, this is part of the culture. It may be unfortunate, but it's the way life works." That sense has changed. What Louis C.K. did and what the women did in response shouldn't be forgotten.

Victoria Beckham's Reasons to Smile: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On a balmy recent Sunday, Victoria Beckham sank into a banquette at the Fasano Fifth Avenue, a fancy hotel on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, her pout a little puffier than it used to be, her slight frame sheathed in an inky silk suit of her own design. Tucked into a corner just within view was a pair of black crutches so streamlined and glossy they might have passed for an outsize accessory.
In fact, they were a testament to Ms. Beckham's stubborn grit.
A fall at the gym this winter had hobbled her but not kept her from taking her bows on crutches at her namesake label's runway show at Paris Fashion Week in March. Or from celebrating a milestone birthday, her 50th, at a lavish bash in London. Nor did it prevent her from hopping a flight to New York, where she had come to oversee and star in an ad campaign promoting the line of fragrances Ms. Beckham introduced last fall.
The perfumes were an expansion of the Victoria Beckham Beauty brand she started in 2019, which was itself an expansion of the Victoria Beckham fashion line she started in 2008 -- when many still remembered her as Posh, the sophisticated Spice Girl who just happened to be married to the British soccer star David Beckham.
After her pivot from pop star to designer, some self-appointed critics were quick to dismiss Ms. Beckham, who grew up in Hertfordshire, England, as an unschooled Barbie from the hinterlands. Her career has given rise to plenty of speculation among fashion insiders: Is she for real? Is she selling a stake in the company to LVMH, the luxury giant? Will the business be profitable?
But Ms. Beckham is nothing if not tenacious. And 16 years after starting her brand with her husband and Simon Fuller, the creator of "American Idol," she is more inclined than ever to dig in her towering heels.
"If I'm still being judged I really don't care," Ms. Beckham said in an accent that seems to have grown plummier over the years. "It's been a real roller coaster of a ride for this brand. But I'm feeling grounded and proud of what I've achieved."
With that she flashed a rare grin. "For so many years in pictures I didn't smile," she said. "That was definitely a sign of insecurity."
Ms. Beckham has reason these days to be upbeat: At a time when some luxury fashion businesses are faltering, the Victoria Beckham brand appears to be finding its footing. The business, which had lost money nearly every year since its introduction, recently pulled out of the red after expanding into beauty and bags.
Marie Leblanc, who runs the brand's fashion arm, said that 2022 was a turning point for the company. That year, it reported revenues of about $ 75 million, a roughly 44 percent increase compared with 2021, when its revenues were about $ 52 million. Between the same period, the company's reported operating losses shrank to about $ 1.1 million, down from about $ 5 million.
"For the first time both fashion and beauty were profitable," said Ms. Leblanc, who joined Ms. Beckham's brand in 2019 after working at others including Isabel Marant and Celine.
David Belhassen, the founder of NEO Investment Partners, a private equity firm that invested about $ 40 million into Ms. Beckham's brand in 2017, told WWD in May that the company's operating cash flow, or EBITDA, grew in 2023.
Ms. Beckham has been chasing success since her earliest years. "At school I was never the brightest child," she said. "I had to work really hard." And, difficult as it is to conceive, the designer, whose recent birthday party drew A-listers including Salma Hayek and Tom Cruise, once thought of herself as a misfit. "I had terrible skin and was quite awkward."
She credited pop stardom with giving her more confidence -- and commercial savvy. "What better way to understand P.R. and marketing than to have been a Spice Girl in the '90s," she said.
Ed Burstell, a retail brand consultant in New York, described Ms. Beckham as "a shrewd businesswoman," one who recognized that expanding into beauty could broaden her audience.
Mr. Burstell first met her in the early 2000s, when she was an aspiring designer and he a senior vice president at Bergdorf Goodman. By the time Ms. Beckham started her fashion line, he had become the managing director at Liberty, the luxury department store in London. Mr. Burstell considered carrying the collection there, but concluded it would not resonate with customers.
"The style, the cut of the clothes, they were good," he recalled. "But the clothes were quiet at a time when fashion was less quiet. She didn't get the credit she deserved for being on the forefront of quiet luxury."
When she introduced her line, Ms. Beckham insisted on tackling the minutiae of her trade: pricing, turnover and how costs were managed. She learned the design process in part by draping dresses on herself. "I'm not claiming to be a master draper," she told The New York Times in 2010. "The bottom line is: Would I wear this?"
Indeed, she has operated largely from instinct. And, said Mr. Beckham, her husband of 25 years, she has never been afraid to hitch up her sleeves. "I've always been in awe of her drive and work ethic," he wrote in an email. "The business has faced many obstacles over the years but she stuck to her vision."
Even now, Ms. Beckham acknowledged, "I'm a control freak."
She had to tamp down her impulse to call the shots during the production of "Beckham," the four-part documentary series about her husband and their family released by Netflix last year. "I found that you can't control every picture, every scene," she said, "and that took me out of my comfort zone."
Ms. Beckham's candor in her scenes all but stole the show. But the experience was trying. Most challenging were the moments in which she was asked to address her husband's alleged affair with his personal assistant, Rebecca Loos, in 2003. While Mr. Beckham has consistently denied that it happened, there was friction in the marriage. "I was the most unhappy I have ever been in my entire life," Ms. Beckham said in the documentary.
She seems to have since made her peace -- and to have made some discoveries as well. During the filming, "I didn't ask questions, I didn't check the monitor, I didn't check the lighting," she said. "There is something quite liberating about that."
Growing comfortable with letting go has not dampened her drive. "I'm still incredibly ambitious," she said. "But I'm also more relaxed. And isn't that the great thing about getting older?"

'The Bear' Sets a Record. 'Shogun' Sets the Pace.: [Live Blog Post]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A pair of FX series, "Shogun" and "The Bear," dominated the Emmy nominations on Wednesday, leading all television series with more than 20 nominations each. "The Bear" broke a 15-year-old Emmy record, earning the most nominations ever recorded for a comedy in a single year.
Those two series propelled FX to its biggest nomination day, earning it 93 nods in all. Netflix, led by the final season of "The Crown," had 107 nominations, the most of any network. And for the first time since 1996, HBO, the usual Emmy heavyweight, fell to third place with 91 nominations.
Here's what you need to know:
"Shogun" dominates. "Shogun," the FX hit about 17th-century feudal Japan, dominated a drama category that is filled with newbies. "Shogun" landed 25 nominations, the most of any show, which represents something of a moment. Though it was made by an American network (FX) for a domestic streaming service (Hulu), the show's dialogue was mostly in Japanese. Americans have shown a much greater appetite for series with subtitles in recent years. Freshman shows -- "Fallout," "3 Body Problem" and "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" -- joined first-time best drama nominees, including "The Gilded Age," "Slow Horses" and "The Morning Show." The final season of "The Crown" is the only returning nominee in the category.
"The Bear" broke a record. "The Bear," the big winner in the comedy categories at the strike-delayed January Emmys ceremony, cleaned up in the nominations, and it made history too. "The Bear" earned 23 nominations, breaking a 15-year-old comedy record set by "30 Rock" in 2009, when it earned 22. The big day could unleash a new round of debates over whether the show is really a comedy. And keep in mind -- though it is confusing -- the voting is for the season that premiered last year, not last month.
A lighter lineup. There was a considerable cloud hanging over Emmy nomination day this year, which took place just six months after a ceremony delayed by last year's double strikes. The strikes, along with several years of cost cutting, have put the industry in the throes of a contraction. To wit, the number of shows submitted for Emmy consideration this year plummeted, and some categories are losing nominee slots because of a lack of submissions.
The winners will be unveiled in two months. The prime-time Emmy ceremony will be on Sunday, Sept. 15, airing on ABC. The delayed January ceremony, which aired on Fox, had an audience of only 4.4 million viewers, a record low. ABC has not yet announced a host.

Meet the Model 'Brat': [Style Desk]

Full text: Having spent her career on the cool-girl fringes, the model rocketed to mainstream fame with a high-profile engagement and a mention from Charli XCX.
"Call me Gabbriette, you're so inspired," sings Charli XCX on "360," the intro track to her new album "Brat," which has become such an instant hit that it has taken over an entire season. The line is a reference to Gabbriette Bechtel, a model and singer known as Gabbriette, whose goth-light aesthetic, defiant gaze and "brat" attitude have made her an "it" girl, particularly in the era of indie-sleaze revival.
Having spent much of her career in the cool-girl fringes, Gabbriette recently rocketed to mainstream popularity with an engagement, a booming modeling career and several famous friendships.
Here's more about Gabbriette.
What's her background?
Gabriella Leigh Bechtel, 26, was born in Orange County, Calif., to a Mexican mother and a German father. "The majority of students at my high school were beautiful, strictly white blond girls, and my sister and I were Hispanic," she told British Vogue in 2023. "I was called some pretty awful things. But then I just learned to laugh at it."
Initially intent on pursuing ballet, Gabbriette moved to Los Angeles after high school, where she started appearing in small modeling gigs and music videos. She is currently signed to IMG Models and has starred in campaigns for Marc Jacobs, Nike and Savage X Fenty.
But she also does music?
Yes. In 2018, Charli XCX tapped Gabbriette to be the lead singer in the all-female punk band Nasty Cherry. The band was the subject of a Netflix documentary, "I'm With the Band: Nasty Cherry," which followed its inception and subsequent success. Nasty Cherry hasn't released new music since its 2021 EP, "The Movie."
Gabbriette still remains close with Charli XCX, as per the "360" reference. She also appeared in the "360" music video, alongside Julia Fox, Chloë Sevigny, Rachel Sennott, Chloe Cherry and Richie Shazam.
Who is her fiancé?
In June, Gabbriette announced that she was engaged to Matty Healy, the lead singer of The 1975. (Charli XCX is also engaged to a member of The 1975: the drummer George Daniel.) Much to his chagrin, Mr. Healy is probably best known across the internet as Taylor Swift's ex. He and Gabbriette began dating publicly in September 2023, not long after the fervor over Mr. Healy and Ms. Swift's short-lived situationship began to die down, and before it spun back up in the spring with the release of Ms. Swift's album "The Tortured Poets Department." Gabbriette announced her engagement on Instagram in June 2024 with a photo of her showing off a custom black-diamond engagement ring. Very brat.
What's next?
In addition to singing, modeling and being an artistic muse, Gabbriette also creates recipes and cooking videos for her social media accounts.
"Growing up, my family was always cooking," she told British Vogue in 2023. "They were really experimental and would always have copies of Bon Appétit laid out." She said her mother "would always be putting a twist on a recipe and my dad would be grilling something or making sauerkraut. Family meals were a big part of our life, we'd sit down together after school without our phones and talk about our day, and the cooking process was always a big part of that."
Gabbriette hopes to parlay her talent in the kitchen into a future book deal. When Numéro Netherlands recently asked what was next for her, she replied enthusiastically, "A cookbook, 100 percent."
And of course, she has her wedding to Mr. Healy to look forward to.

Some Oohs and Huhs Amid the Emmy Nods: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Mulaney's late-night experiment and the eccentric Showtime satire were mostly ignored by the Emmys. But never bet against Stringer Bell.
Every year the Primetime Emmy nominations go a little more according to form, and Wednesday's list was perhaps the most predictable yet, with only one very slight curveball in the main drama and comedy series categories (see "The Curse," below). Here are some highlights from a very short list of notable snubs and surprises.
Snub: 'John Mulaney Presents Everybody's in L.A.'
The talk-series category went exactly as expected -- the series nominations went to "The Daily Show," "Late Night With Seth Meyers," "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" and "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" -- which is what the category is known for. But it was particularly galling that this year, when John Mulaney's inventive ode to Los Angeles, rendered in a classic late-night format live on Netflix, offered an attractive alternative, that the voters went with the same old Colbert-Kimmel-Meyers lineup. (The show did receive a nomination for picture editing.)
Snub: 'The Curse'
Nathan Fielder and Benny Safdie's dark satire on marriage, home renovation and reality TV for Paramount+ and Showtime was thought to be in the running, if only marginally, for drama series. Its stars, Fielder and Emma Stone, were also borderline favorites for acting nominations. None of them broke though, however, which is getting to be a habit for Fielder: His previous attention-grabbing, opinion-dividing series, "Nathan for You," received no nominations across its four seasons.
Surprise: 'Scavengers Reign'
Joseph Bennett and Charles Huettner's beautifully drawn, eerily calm science-fiction tale was dropped by its original streaming home, Max, and picked up by Netflix a few weeks before nominations voting ended. Did the move give it the boost it needed to grab an unexpected bid in the animated program category? While it is gratifying to see a show this unusual get a nomination, the bigger news here is a snub: no nomination for the seventh season of the two-time winner "Rick and Morty."
Surprise: Idris Elba
The lead acting categories were virtually surprise free, which makes sense when you consider that the comedy series and drama series categories were even more surprise free. The one really unexpected nomination was for Elba's performance as a professional negotiator trying to get a hijacked airliner safely to the ground in the surprisingly popular Apple TV+ potboiler "Hijack." Never bet against Stringer Bell. (Performers who were thought to have a better chance included Cosmo Jarvis for "Shogun" and Colin Farrell for "Sugar.")
Snub: Kelsey Grammer
If there were a category for Lead Actor in a Comedy Rebooted After 20 Years, Grammer would have been a shoo-in for "Frasier" on Paramount+. He was still considered a strong possibility in the regular comedy actor category, but nostalgia did not carry the day; the superannuated psychiatrist was crowded out by an Indigenous Oklahoma teenager (D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai in "Reservation Dogs") and a three-century-old British vampire (Matt Berry in "What We Do in the Shadows"), as well as by the more predictable picks: Larry David ("Curb Your Enthusiasm"), Jeremy Allen White ("The Bear") and Steve Martin and Martin Short ("Only Murders in the Building").
Snub: A few people in 'The Bear' and 'Shogun'
"The Bear" received the most comedy nominations ever in a single year and on the drama side, "Shogun" received the most of any series this year. As well as FX's presumptive winners in their series categories did, however, they did not sweep the nominations to quite the extent they could have: Oliver Platt and Matty Matheson of "The Bear" did not receive bids for comedy supporting actor and Moeka Hoshi and Fumi Nikaido of "Shogun" were shut out for drama supporting actress.

Full text: Thanks to a software program, the length, structure and contents of the movie are reconfigured each time it's shown. It's the only way the musician would agree to the project.
Gary Hustwit had a simple wish: to make a documentary about the visionary musician Brian Eno. When that wasn't possible, he devised a far less simple approach. He made 52 quintillion documentaries about Eno.
At a time when it seems like there's a movie about every band that's recorded even a 45, Hustwit's "Eno," opening Friday, is unlike any other portrait of a musician. It's not even a portrait, because it isn't fixed or static. Instead, Hustwit used a proprietary software program that reconfigures the length, structure and contents of the movie.
"Every time it plays, it's a different movie," Hustwit told an audience in May at the film's New York premiere. "I'm surprised every time I see it."
His collaborator, the digital artist and programmer Brendan Dawes, explained that because of the variables, including 30 hours of interviews with Eno and 500 hours of film from his personal archive, there are 52 quintillion possible versions of the movie. (A quintillion is a billion billion.) "That's going to be a really big box set," Dawes quipped at the premiere.
Movie theaters are still guided by "a 130-year-old technical constraint," Hustwit said over lunch the next day at a Chelsea restaurant. "We can use technology as a structural tool to do interesting things with the narrative. This idea that a film has to be set in stone and always linear is obsolete, I think. There's another possible path here for filmmaking going forward."
A generative approach to documentary is especially suitable for Eno, who has made generative music for years. (Despite the use of the word "generative," A.I. isn't involved in either the film or the music.)
In 1972, as an original member of the unsurpassed British art-rock band Roxy Music, Eno was an immediate media phenomenon. He was a dolled-up, androgynous dandy in rouge and eyeliner, with a wardrobe of kimonos, butt-hugging cigarette pants and padded jackets adorned with animal feathers.
He left Roxy after two albums and started a solo career that anticipated punk and new wave. And he has produced or collaborated with Talking Heads, Devo, U2 and David Bowie, bringing experimental élan to pop music.
His interest in generative music was inspired by Steve Reich's opus "It's Gonna Rain." Reich recorded a Pentecostal preacher on a San Francisco street corner, then duplicated a short passage and played it simultaneously on two tape recorders. Thanks to variations in motor speed, the twin loops gradually fall out of sync, building to a wild cacophony. The music "blew my socks off," Eno said in a 1996 lecture.
Generative music, he explained then, is based on "a system or a set of rules which, once set in motion, will create music for you." For his 1978 album "Music for Airports," a founding document of ambient music, he recorded three simple melodies, each of a slightly different length, then allowed them to play in what mathematicians call incommensurable cycles, which never repeat.
"If you work in electronic music, Eno's relevance is unavoidable," said Carsten Nicolai, a German musician who records under the pseudonym Alva Noto. "He was very much ahead of his time. His first records are more than a half-century old, but they don't feel old."
Eno had contributed the soundtrack for Hustwit's previous documentary, "Rams" (2018), a profile of the German industrial designer Dieter Rams. But when the director proposed a movie about Eno, the idea was immediately shot down. It wasn't a surprise, given Eno's longstanding antipathy to documentaries.
In the 1993 film "Words for the Dying," which chronicled an album he made with John Cale of the Velvet Underground, Eno growled, "Keep that bloody camera off me," and flipped off the cameraman.
Eventually, Eno agreed to allow the director, Rob Nilsson, to film only his hands and feet. "Great cat and mouse game," Nilsson said in an email. "I think Brian made the film more interesting."
Hustwit, a self-taught filmmaker who worked in music and publishing before turning to documentaries ("Helvetica," 2007), isn't the sort to surrender. He'd met Dawes in 2009, when they were on a South by Southwest panel, and over email, they discussed the possibility of making an Eno movie that was never the same twice. "I always want to do things I don't know how to do," Dawes said during a video interview from his home in Southport, England.
Hollywood has dallied with nonlinear stories before. When "Clue" played theaters in 1985, viewers randomly saw one of three different endings. Steven Soderbergh's HBO mini-series "Mosaic" (2017) was accompanied by a mobile app that allowed users to view the drama from the perspectives of different characters, and more recently, Netflix's "Choose Love" (2023) offered a choose-your-own-adventure component that branched into six possible endings. But Hustwit knew he couldn't hook Eno with half-measures.
Dawes, who taught himself computer programming in high school, said it took "two years of really intense work" to write the software, Brain One (an anagram for Brian Eno), for the film, he said. Hustwit first used it to create a generative remix of "Rams" and showed it to Eno.
When Eno saw it, he was excited, he said in an email interview. (He even used an exclamation mark!) "I didn't fancy the linearity of conventional biographies," he said. "Lives don't run in straight lines, and every time we think about them in retrospect (i.e., every time we start remembering) we actually rethink them. Our lives are stories we write and rewrite. There is no single reliable narrative of a life."
On the festival circuit, Hustwit and Dawes occasionally brought the Brain One machine onstage and tweaked "Eno" in real time, adjusting the audio for each theater's acoustics. When the movie plays Film Forum in New York, they'll create individual Digital Cinema Packages, which modern projection systems use in lieu of film reels, for each screening.
Ever since Bach wrote "The Art of Fugue" in the 1740s and didn't specify any tempo or instrumentation, composers have experimented with indeterminacy. In 1958, the composer Christian Wolff said that he, Morton Feldman and John Cage, as well as Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen and others, used chance procedures to achieve "a kind of objectivity, almost anonymity," resulting in music that was "free of artistry and taste."
Artist-free art remains a niche, though. Siddhant Adlakha reviewed the Sundance premiere of "Eno" for IndieWire and denounced the random elements as "tomfoolery," while criticizing its "haphazard placement of emotional denouements."
Nicolai, the German composer, hadn't seen "Eno," but shared Adlakha's aversion to randomness. "I like it when people make clear artistic decisions," he said. "In a time of so-called A.I., personality becomes even more important." Using technology to randomize content and narrative, he added with a laugh, "becomes a little bit garbage."
In his email, Eno pointed out that all music was generative before the invention of notation, around the year 1000. And a generative tradition endured until the middle of the 19th century, when the invention of recording allowed people to hear a piece of music over and over in the same static form. "Generative music is actually a return to an earlier way of listening, in which each experience was unique and transient," he wrote. "I prefer to think that nongenerative music is the niche."
Maybe the emotional payoff of a fixed narrative is too ingrained in audiences to be eliminated. It certainly hasn't been easy for Hustwit to adapt "Eno" to the commercial conventions of streaming and DVDs.
"The reaction from the film industry has been curiosity and excitement, but also confusion," he said. "Everyone wants me to make a director's cut. I could make a really good one, but that would be sort of antithetical to the whole exercise, for me to exert that level of control."
Streaming platforms don't have the ability to generate unique versions of a movie for every viewer, but neither Hustwit nor Dawes has ever been deterred by tradition. Their company, Anamorph, is developing new software that would allow streamers to create versions of "Eno" that change with each viewing. It's not possible to watch all 52 quintillion versions of the film, but some Eno fans will try.

His Strong Chin Is Taking the Lead: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As Aemond Targaryen, the young actor quickly became one of the "Game of Thrones" prequel's most intriguing and fearsome characters.
Like most people, Ewan Mitchell is accustomed to anonymity. So during a recent trip to Manhattan, he was surprised by what a hotel doorman asked when he arrived: "You haven't packed your eye patch?"
Mitchell does not normally wear an eye patch, but Aemond Targaryen, the one-eyed, dragon-riding warrior he plays in "House of the Dragon," does. The actor is still getting used to strangers making the connection in public.
"I wouldn't think people would recognize me, but they do," he said. "I think it's because of my strong chin."
This was on an afternoon in May, and Mitchell, 27, was sipping a Coke at the hotel bar. He wore a black Alexander McQueen suit and was preparing to attend the premiere of the second season of "House of the Dragon," HBO's "Game of Thrones" prequel that follows two factions vying for the Iron Throne.
When Mitchell made his debut in the latter half of Season 1, Aemond, the willful second son who grows to covet his brother's throne, quickly became one of the show's most intriguing and fearsome characters. Paired off with Vhagar, the realm's largest, meanest dragon, and possessing the most chiseled chin in Westeros, Aemond radiated the quiet ferocity of a predator preparing to pounce.
"When I'm dressed up as Aemond and catch myself in the mirror, he scares even me a little bit," Mitchell said.
The first season's shocking ending, in which Aemond's dragon killed Lucerys Velaryon, Aemond's rival and relative, signaled to viewers that the one-eyed prince would take on a central role in the looming civil war. In the most recent episode of Season 2, a fiery clash among three dragons established Aemond as the new standard-bearer for his coalition -- known as the Greens -- and potentially the realm's new king.
The upshot is that Mitchell, who had never watched or particularly cared about "Game of Thrones" before joining the prequel, now finds himself as one of the faces of the franchise. To help promote this new season, he has embarked on his first major press tour and has been adjusting to its demands.
When he's not in character, Mitchell is soft-spoken and occasionally flashes a boyish grin, though he retains much of Aemond's seriousness and quiet intensity. He is also very private: He stays off social media and in the past has shied away from sharing much with the public. "Once you lose the mystery, you can't really get it back," he said.
Still, he knows that Aemond's key role in Season 2 means he must also embrace the spotlight: "There is a point where you have to go, Now's the time to pull back the curtain."
Like Aemond, Mitchell is a second son. He grew up in Derby, an industrial town in the middle of England, and his parents expected him to follow his older brother's footsteps and work at Rolls-Royce (the aerospace and industrial technology company, not the carmaker).
Inspired by films like "Citizen Kane" and "Taxi Driver," Mitchell knew early on he wanted to become an actor. When he was 13, his teacher asked each student in his class what they wanted to do when they grew up. One wanted to be an engineer; another hoped to work as an electrician.
"Then it came to me, and I said, 'I'm going to be an actor,' and everyone laughed at me," Mitchell said.
His family could not afford tuition for drama school, so Mitchell attended a two-year vocational school, where he studied design and technology while working part-time at a restaurant and in customer service at a local soccer club. Midway through the program, at 17, he was accepted into the Nottingham Television Workshop, a drama group that trains young people in acting. (Alumni include Bella Ramsey, Felicity Jones and Samantha Morton.)
Through the Workshop, Mitchell landed a leading role in a 2015 short film called "Fire," about a young man who leaks fire from his hands. Once the short was released, Mitchell downloaded it onto a dozen CDs, took the train to London and stopped by the offices of every agent he could find, handing them each a copy. The one person who called back continues to represent Mitchell.
"By hook or by crook, I wanted to make sure that I was going to be in this business," Mitchell said.
He was later cast in the ITV period drama "The Halcyon" and in Netflix's "The Last Kingdom," and he appeared as one of the Oxford students in the hit film "Saltburn." But being cast as Aemond in "House of the Dragon" has been his biggest professional turning point by far.
"Since landing him, I feel like I'm able to now steer the course of my career," he said.
Mitchell had been rewatching the classic Hollywood adventure film "The Vikings" (1958) and musing about how he wanted to play a morally dark character similar to the one played by Kirk Douglas when he received an email inviting him to submit a taped audition for Aemond. When he eventually auditioned in person, he left a lasting impression on Ryan Condal, the showrunner for "House of the Dragon."
"When Ewan came into the room, he just had this presence to him that I can best describe as unsettling," Condal said. "It was kind of quietly terrifying the way he performed it, and it was totally different than everybody else. And then he thanked us very politely and left the room."
Condal recalls asking Kate Rhodes James, the casting director, "Is he always like that?" She replied, "Oh no, he's just a very intense northern boy."
To prepare for his role, Mitchell did not watch "Game of Thrones." Instead, he read portions of "Fire & Blood," the book by George R.R. Martin that inspired the show, and studied the performances of Michael Fassbender in "Prometheus" and Peter O'Toole in "Lawrence of Arabia," each playing a figure who wields power for his own ends.
On his first day on set, Mitchell consulted with Condal and decided that he would avoid interacting with Matt Smith, who plays Aemond's similarly menacing uncle and rival, Daemon, in order to heighten the tension between the two characters. Mitchell had grown up admiring Smith's performance in "Doctor Who." But on set Mitchell avoided any eye contact with him, keeping his distance until the climactic scene near the end of the first season when Aemond and Daemon finally face off.
"There's this addictive kind of quality when you're in the shoes of a character," Mitchell said. "When you lose yourself for a moment, it's almost like a dream."
When he isn't acting, Mitchell still lives at his family home in Derby and spends time with his dogs, three whippets named Eva, Bella and Bonnie.
Though taking on a leading role in an international hit and participating in an extensive press tour are new responsibilities for Mitchell, they are challenges he is confident he can master. Learning how to manage and sustain this success is a bit like taming and riding Vhagar, he said.
"Now that I'm on it," he said, "I've just got to stay on the dragon."

Wrapped in Contradictions, and Very Little Else: [Style Desk]

Full text: A new documentary about the young women who dance for the Dallas Cowboys illuminates the deep contradictions at the heart of the profitable franchise.
When the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders sashay onto the field, hair flying and pompoms fluttering, the stands erupt in thunderous roars. Fans know they're about to witness a spectacle every bit as thrilling and athletic as the football game they've been watching.
Like the pro team they represent, the cheerleaders are elite athletes at the top of their profession, enduring grueling hours of training and pushing through pain and injuries. Like the players, they make promotional appearances, sign autographs, participate in photo shoots and do community outreach.
The D.C.C. have been bringing the sizzle to Cowboys games for over 50 years. "America's Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders," a new Netflix series, follows a recent class of dancers, as well as their director, Kelli Finglass, and head choreographer, Judy Trammell, (both D.C.C. alumnae) through one complete season, from the arduous auditions -- in which 500 women vie for 36 spots -- to the final game.
Charismatic cheerleaders make for bingeable entertainment. In fact, the D.C.C. have already starred in an earlier series, CMT's "Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders: Making the Team," which ran from 2006 to 2022. While that show focused mostly on performance and auditions, this new one, directed by Greg Whiteley, looks a little deeper, hinting at some of the illogic and injustice lurking beneath the glossy surface.
As both shows make clear, the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders maintain near military-levels of discipline, in part because their rigorous, acrobatic, and precisely choreographed routines require it. But beyond all the physical discipline, the D.C.C. must also practice a kind of aesthetic discipline. D.C.C. membership requires meticulous grooming. We watch dancers curling their hair and putting on makeup. We follow new recruits as they undergo (sometimes dramatic) salon makeovers. And we watch them being watched, especially by Ms. Finglass, who scrutinizes the women's images -- in photos, videos and blown up to massive proportion on the stadium's Jumbotron -- critiquing everything from muscle tone to mascara placement.
D.C.C. rules dictate that dancers show up in full hair and makeup at all times, even when rehearsing outdoors in 100-degree Texas heat. They must also scrupulously maintain their slim figures, and may never change uniform size, even over multiple years. (Dancers can remain on the squad for five years, but must re-audition every year.) "It's hard for girls not to want to starve themselves," says one dancer.
It's easy to understand the pressure. Their trademark sexy-cowgirl uniform is unforgiving: white hot pants; cleavage-exposing bra-tops; and white cowboy boots, topped off with beauty-pageant-style hair (long curls worn loose, to permit much provocative flipping). The choreography is a hybrid of jazz, ballet and Rockette-style precision dance, punctuated with seriously raunchy moves. Hips swivel, shoulders shimmy, bosoms bounce and legs kick. Sky high.
The kick line is among the D.C.C.'s crowd-pleasing signature moves, along with the "jump splits," in which dancers link straight arms, leap in unison, and land in perfect splits, smiling brightly as their bodies hit the ground. The move is a literal "leap of faith," since a single misstep by one dancer could injure many.
"I don't know who came up with that," says Caroline Sundvold, a former D.C.C., in the series. "That's what kind of rips up people's hips." She should know. Ms. Sundvold, still in her 20s, has undergone hip and knee surgery, and in some scenes, relies on a walker as she recovers.
Yet she misses the team sorely, and seems a bit lost in her post-cheering life. "It's like D.C.C. land is this mythical, magical world," she says. "And once you start sipping that Gatorade, you do not want to come out." Ms. Sundvold even offers D.C.C. audition coaching to her younger sister, Anna Kate, who is overjoyed when she, too, makes the team.
Beyond all the other attributes, the D.C.C. -- and this series -- promotes the dancers' traditionally feminine sweetness, helpfulness and family values. Cheerleading is, by definition, devoted to celebrating the success of others.
"Thinking of others, it's what cheerleaders do," Ms. Finglass reminds her dancers.
It can also be a family tradition, and we meet several women whose mothers also cheered for the D.C.C. decades ago and remain deeply invested in the organization. The emphasis on altruism and tradition recurs often, as do references to Christian faith. Dancers are filmed chatting warmly with residents at a senior citizen home, praying before meals and attending an evangelical church service (where the pastor cries out, "God loves the Dallas Cowboys!"). The show devotes considerable airtime to rookie dancer, Reece Weaver, a soft-spoken former Miss Florida's Outstanding Teen who says she dances only to "give glory to God." Ms. Weaver was engaged during the series, and her fiancé (now husband), she says, was the only young man she ever permitted to put his arm around her shoulders.
This insistence on old-fashioned, girlish innocence appears even in the series' title. The D.C.C. calls its members "America's sweethearts"-- an antiquated term that speaks volumes. "Sweetheart" conjures an ingénue in a 1950s movie -- something like a girlfriend, but minus any adult sexuality. With this retro title, the D.C.C. declare themselves the chaste helpmates of not only the Dallas Cowboys (whose players they are contractually forbidden to date), but of all America.
Can we reconcile the "sweetheart" vibe with the D.C.C.'s bombshell look and come-hither moves? Not really. The inherent contradiction of women trying to uphold apple-pie wholesomeness while wearing so little and dancing so provocatively lies at the heart of this series, a reminder that the Madonna-whore dichotomy is still alive and um, kicking, in popular culture.
And what do these young women receive in exchange for trying to uphold such contradictory ideals? For their artistry, discipline and pain? For risking serious injury and subjecting themselves to being stalked, groped and harassed by fans, as several women recount in the show? Shockingly little.
The Dallas Cowboys are the most valuable team in the N.F.L., with player contracts reaching into the tens of millions. D.C.C. salaries, however, hover around that of the average "Chick-fil-A worker," as one former dancer, Kat Puryear, remarks on the show.
While some senior dancers may earn up to $ 75,000 per year, most earn about $ 14 per hour, and $ 500 on game days (which can stretch to 11 hours), according to Sports Illustrated. Many of the women hold second jobs, and we see them rushing to evening rehearsals after spending entire days working -- in medical sales, nursing, at a florist shop. One finalist for the team is an orthodontist.
When asked about this pay scale, Charlotte Jones, the Cowboys' brand officer and daughter of team's owner, Jerry Jones, responds: "They actually don't come here for the money. They come here for something that's actually bigger than that to them. They have a passion for dance."
"It is about a sisterhood," Ms. Jones adds, "about relationships that they have for the rest of their life. They have a chance to feel like they are valued, they are special, and they are making a difference."
Indeed, the series offers a convincing, even moving portrait of the sisterhood the D.C.C. women enjoy: a sense of camaraderie, identity and belonging that lasts for decades. What is staggering, though, is the assumption that these benefits should replace financial compensation.
But this inequity is of a piece with all the other contradictions embodied by the D.C.C. It's still enticing to many young women to be prized as objects of desire, even while knowing the attendant pitfalls, and even when being denied reasonable compensation. It's still true that women are encouraged to be sexy but somehow also "pure."
And as Netflix knows well, it's still enticing to watch a television show, or a halftime show, that puts all this unfairness on full display, wrapped up prettily with music, dance and glittering, star-spangled costumes.

How Hollywood's Big Donors Broke With Biden: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The president's stable of big donors, corralled in part by the movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, has been devastated since his debate, with many closing their wallets.
Follow the latest Biden news and election updates .
When aides to President Biden heard in recent days that George Clooney, as close a figure as there is in Hollywood to royalty, planned to publicly break with Mr. Biden in an essay that cast doubt on his re-election chances, panic set in from Wilmington to Beverly Hills.
Could Mr. Clooney be persuaded not to publish it?
The movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg sought to intervene. Mr. Katzenberg, who moonlights as a top Biden official and has worked with Mr. Clooney on philanthropy for decades, reached out to him to see if there was an off-ramp, according to three people familiar with the matter. There was not -- Mr. Clooney published his essay in The New York Times, and the president's relationship with Hollywood was torn asunder.
The fallout from the Clooney essay has ricocheted across the worlds of politics and entertainment -- and onto Mr. Katzenberg himself. It has turned Hollywood, America's drama capital, into ground zero for the impasse between the Biden campaign and the major donors who increasingly do not want it to proceed.
"This is a town that pays attention to box office, and the numbers do not look encouraging right now," said Billy Ray, the screenwriter behind "The Hunger Games" and other films who has worked with Democratic candidates on messaging. "I do think they're going to have a challenge raising more money."
The Biden large-donor scene, where Mr. Katzenberg is treated as royalty himself, has been devastated since Mr. Biden's debate performance two weeks ago. Several fund-raising events are in jeopardy and scores of donors have informed the campaign they will not continue to give if Mr. Biden remains in the race. The campaign has pointed to its recent low-dollar fund-raising success.
Still, top Biden campaign officials are already bracing themselves for a July fund-raising report -- which will not become public until mid-August -- that is expected to show the campaign's finances falling off a cliff. Mr. Biden is coincidentally scheduled to travel to Southern California for a fund-raiser this month that is likely to be attended by some top Hollywood players.
And Hollywood has disproportionately voiced some of the earliest and most aggressive calls for Mr. Biden to drop out. Ari Emanuel, the power agent who is the brother of Rahm Emanuel, the former chief of staff to President Barack Obama, said days after the debate that Mr. Biden's insistence in staying in the race was a "self-aggrandizing delusion on a Trumpian scale."
Reed Hastings, the co-founder of Netflix, was one of the first Democratic megadonors to explicitly call for a new nominee, a case he is continuing to make privately to other media and technology executives.
But the most politically damaging blow came from a late-breaking apostate: Mr. Clooney, who just weeks earlier had spent time with Mr. Biden and helped deliver $ 28 million to his campaign at a Los Angeles fund-raiser.
"Clooney is more than just a celebrity," said Brian Goldsmith, a Democratic fund-raiser and media consultant in Los Angeles. "He's in the Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg category of a huge cultural figure and serious political powerhouse. His op-ed broke through to pop culture -- to influencers and People magazine -- and therefore to a much wider audience than folks following news on Capitol Hill."
The fund-raiser last month -- which included top entertainment executives, donors and Julia Roberts -- was meant as a show of force, but has now taken on a darker, historical significance as the night when Mr. Biden lost Mr. Clooney.
The actor wrote in his Times essay that he learned that evening that Mr. Biden was no longer the candidate he saw up close in 2016 or even in 2020. Like many Biden supporters, he hoped the president, his "hero," would conclude on his own that it was time to step aside, according to a person who has spoken with Mr. Clooney in recent weeks.
Onstage at the fund-raiser beside Mr. Obama and Jimmy Kimmel, Mr. Biden laughed along, cracked a joke or two, and slammed the Supreme Court. The audience ate it up.
At the end, Mr. Biden soaked up the applause -- perhaps a beat too long. Mr. Obama gently took his hand and led him away. A video of the moment went viral. Was the 44th president being impatient, or was the 46th freezing up?
"There were a lot of fans in the crowd, like me," said Roger Wolfson, a Hollywood writer. "But there was also nervousness. A lot of dry grass -- and while the debate could have watered the grass, it seems to have served more like a match."
One Democrat who worked with Mr. Biden in a previous stage of his career and sat near the front during the fund-raiser described being "shocked" at the president's condition.
Damon Lindelof, a Hollywood producer, said the fund-raiser had been an "awakening" for him, giving him the "ability to hear all the contrarian voices I had been shouting down for the past year." After the debate, Mr. Lindelof called on donors to close their wallets to all Democratic campaigns until Mr. Biden stepped down.
Mr. Biden had flown to Los Angeles directly from Italy, which his aides said spoke to his stamina. But in videos of the public portion of the event, he appeared tired at times, sometimes stumbling over his words.
Some attendees who spent time with Mr. Biden that night privately defended him.
Carol L. Hamilton, a Los Angeles lawyer who serves on Mr. Biden's National Finance Committee, sat in the third row at the Hollywood event. She said, "I was a little surprised by Clooney's opinion piece, because he clearly had a different experience than I did."
She and her husband spent time with Mr. Biden at a more exclusive reception before the onstage presentation, she said, and had a conversation with Mr. Biden about a missile testing moratorium she worked on at the United Nations in 2022 -- "a pretty sophisticated area that he gets," she said.
Mr. Biden's allies have also responded by going after Mr. Clooney, arguing that he did not spend enough time with Mr. Biden at the event to assess his strength -- just about 10 minutes, according to a campaign staff member who was present.
Mr. Clooney and Ms. Roberts had arrived at the event together around 4:30 p.m., according to two people who spent time with them that day and insisted on anonymity because of the sensitive situation. Over the next two hours, they spent time greeting donors, the two people said. They also posed for pictures with Mr. Biden before introducing him onstage around 7 p.m., another attendee said.
At the center of the Hollywood drama is not only Mr. Clooney but also Mr. Katzenberg, a ringmaster of both Mr. Biden's fund-raiser at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan and the Los Angeles event.
Last year, the wiry and relentless Mr. Katzenberg was chosen as the co-chair of Mr. Biden's entire campaign and quickly took a public role. He led a news conference before the Republican caucuses in Iowa. Paparazzi took photos of him dining with Jill and Hunter Biden at Giorgio Baldi, the Santa Monica celebrity cantina.
Mr. Katzenberg is now taking his commensurate lumps, particularly because contributors feel he helped disabuse donors' concerns about Mr. Biden's physical state.
Over the past year and a half, Mr. Katzenberg choreographed a series of lunches at the White House where skeptical donors could spend time with Mr. Biden and see that there was nothing to fear about his stamina or mental command. Several gave maximum contributions to Mr. Biden's victory fund afterward, including the tech founder Mark Pincus. Mr. Pincus attended alongside his political collaborator Reid Hoffman, now perhaps Mr. Biden's strongest donor ally.
But on Thursday, Mr. Pincus said a new nominee was needed because Mr. Biden would never "get around this age competency issue."
Despite many donors' unhappiness with Mr. Katzenberg, few would go on the record out of fear of his power.
In the view of Mr. Katzenberg's allies, however, these wealthy donors made their own decisions to contribute, and he should not be held responsible for Mr. Biden's own weaknesses. Mr. Katzenberg has been almost entirely publicly silent since the debate. A representative of his declined to comment.
At this critical time, Mr. Katzenberg has spent the week in Sun Valley, the Hollywood-heavy getaway in Idaho, where Mr. Biden's fate is the topic of feverish conversations.
Before arriving there, he told one associate that he planned to relay a message of calm to his fellow moguls, the person recalled -- and he was adamant that he was still with Mr. Biden and indicated he had no regrets about how things were going.

WASHINGTON — When aides to President Joe Biden heard in recent days that George Clooney, as close a figure as there is in Hollywood to royalty, planned to publicly break with Biden in an essay that cast doubt on his reelection chances, panic set in from Wilmington, Delaware, to Beverly Hills, California.
Could Clooney be persuaded not to publish it?
Movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg sought to intervene. Katzenberg, who moonlights as a top Biden official and has worked with Clooney on philanthropy for decades, reached out to him to see if there was an off-ramp, according to three people familiar with the matter. There was not. Clooney published his essay in The New York Times, and the president’s relationship with Hollywood was torn asunder.
The fallout from the Clooney essay has ricocheted across the worlds of politics and entertainment — and onto Katzenberg himself. It has turned Hollywood, America’s drama capital, into ground zero for the impasse between the Biden campaign and the major donors who increasingly do not want it to proceed.
“This is a town that pays attention to box office, and the numbers do not look encouraging right now,” said Billy Ray, the screenwriter behind “The Hunger Games” and other films who has worked with Democratic candidates on messaging. “I do think they’re going to have a challenge raising more money.”
The Biden large-donor scene, where Katzenberg is treated as royalty himself, has been devastated since Biden’s debate performance two weeks ago. Several fundraising events are in jeopardy, and scores of donors have informed the campaign they will not continue to give if Biden remains in the race.

Grown-Ups And Movies, A New Test: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Directed by Greg Berlanti, the film amounts to a Hollywood experiment: Is there still room at the multiplexes for original movies aimed at grown-ups.
"Fly Me to the Moon" is the kind of movie that isn't supposed to succeed in theaters anymore, at least if you listen to franchise-obsessed studio executives.
The story is a period piece and completely original: In 1968, a government operative (Woody Harrelson) hires a marketing virtuoso (Scarlett Johansson) to convince the public -- and Congress -- that a troubled NASA can pull off its scheduled Apollo 11 moon landing. Stylish and devious, she clashes with the rigid launch director (Channing Tatum) and secretly -- as a backup, to be used only in an emergency -- arranges for a fake landing to be filmed on a soundstage. What's the harm?
Hollywood marketers will tell you that ticket buyers eschew movies that mash together genres. And "Fly Me to the Moon" is part drama, part comedic caper, part romance, part fiction and part true story. Particularly in the summer, studios prefer to serve up mindless popcorn movies aimed at teenagers. "Fly Me to the Moon" is entertainment for thinking adults, the kind that Mike Nichols ("Working Girl") and James L. Brooks ("Broadcast News") made in the 1980s.
So the question must be asked: How on earth did "Fly Me to the Moon" manage to score a wide release in theaters at the height of blockbuster season? The film rolls into 3,300 theaters in the United States and Canada on Friday.
Shouldn't it be going straight to streaming?
In many ways, the film's unexpected journey to multiplexes reflects the degree to which Hollywood runs on the vagaries of chance. "Fly Me to the Moon" started out as a streaming movie -- full stop. Apple TV+ paid an estimated $ 100 million for the project in March 2022, and the contract called for no theatrical release of any kind.
But then Greg Berlanti got involved.
It was June 2022, and Mr. Berlanti, the wunderkind television producer, had just turned 50. That milestone prompted a degree of uncomfortable self-reflection, compounded by his mother's recent death. At the same time, the entertainment business was changing -- the streaming-driven "peak TV" era was winding down -- and Mr. Berlanti wasn't entirely sure where to focus his professional attention.
He knew he had grown weary of shows based on comic books, having spent a decade working on hits like "Riverdale," "Arrow," "The Flash" and "Supergirl." He had also done television thrillers ("You"), family dramas ("Brothers & Sisters") and torrents of teen angst ("Everwood," "Dawson's Creek").
"I started getting these lifetime achievement honors, which were very nice, but they also made me reflective about what I wanted the back half of my career to be," Mr. Berlanti said. "Am I done? I don't want to be done."
Then a movie script landed in his inbox. It was from Ms. Johansson, who suddenly needed a director for "Fly Me to the Moon," which she was also producing. The initial director, Jason Bateman, had abruptly left the project ("creative differences"), and filming was scheduled to begin in Atlanta in four short months. Ms. Johansson had gotten to know Mr. Berlanti a few years earlier while kicking around a new take on "Little Shop of Horrors," the classic musical. (She was going to star as Audrey, with Mr. Berlanti directing; the pandemic derailed the plan.)
"I needed someone who could deliver," Ms. Johansson said. "Greg has such empathy. He's so sensitive. He understands comedy. He's a mensch. He's efficient. He's a little naughty, but a little prude. He was perfect for the material -- and, as it turned out, the timing was perfect for him."
Still, there was risk. Mr. Berlanti had previously directed only two studio films, and both were smaller in scale. "Love, Simon," a celebrated 2018 rom-com centered on a gay teenager, cost $ 17 million to make and took in $ 66 million. "Life as We Know It," a poorly reviewed 2010 comedy, cost $ 38 million and took in $ 106 million.
"I don't direct that much," Mr. Berlanti said. "It's really not something I wake up thinking about -- directing. But I found myself at a moment in my career when I wanted to do something that would use up all the parts of me and challenge me in every way, not just one or two ways."
He continued: "I also missed movies that blended comedy and drama and were original and smart and vehicles for amazing actors. No one is doing them anymore. I knew why: box office prospects. But this movie was supposed to go straight to streaming. I thought, 'Oh, this is great. There are much lower stakes."'
He took the gig.
Mr. Berlanti delivered "Fly Me to the Moon" to executives at Apple in the spring of last year. Next came a test screening in Colorado. "It scored very well with male and female, young and old, which came as a bit of a surprise," Mr. Berlanti said. (Apple declined to comment for this article.)
Maybe the response was a fluke? Another audience test was conducted in California. "Same response, in fact even better," Mr. Berlanti said. Still another was ordered up in Texas. "Everywhere we went, people responded by saying it was the kind of movie they missed in theaters -- original with big movie stars," he said.
The film's producers, led by Ms. Johansson, pushed Apple to give "Fly Me to the Moon" a chance in theaters. Apple agreed. "It was both exciting and terrifying," Mr. Berlanti said, breaking into nervous laughter.
Warner Bros. declined to bid for theatrical distribution rights. Universal was interested but ultimately bowed out, citing a full release schedule, as did Paramount, according to three people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations. Disney was not a fit because it focuses almost exclusively on franchises.
In the end, it was one executive -- Sony's movie chairman, Tom Rothman -- who made the difference. "I wanted this movie for a simple reason: I enjoyed the hell out of it," Mr. Rothman said. "It's a real credit to Greg's direction. It was a very high degree of difficulty, balancing the tone, and he did it beautifully."
Mr. Rothman has been vocal in recent years about a need for traditional studios to embrace a mix of films, not just sequels and superheroes. Sony, for instance, released the romantic comedy "Anyone but You" in theaters in December. It arrived to $ 8 million in opening-weekend ticket sales and collected $ 220 million by the end of its run (after costing $ 25 million to make). No romantic comedy has been given a wide release in theaters since.
"It's not about opening weekend for these movies," Mr. Rothman said. "You have to nurture them and allow word-of-mouth to kick in."
July offered a counterprogramming opportunity for "Fly Me to the Moon," he added. Next weekend, Universal will release "Twisters," an action remake reliant on computer-generated visual effects. Then comes the Marvel superhero sequel "Deadpool & Wolverine."
"Older audiences don't evaporate in the summer," Mr. Rothman said. "It's just that the business doesn't give them much to watch." Box office analysts expect "Fly Me to the Moon" to arrive to roughly $ 12 million in weekend ticket sales, which would result in a second-place opening behind "Despicable Me 4."
Reviews for "Fly Me to the Moon" have been solid, if not exceptional. Will the people who say they want original movies come out to support "Fly Me to the Moon" over the longer haul?
Mr. Berlanti responded with an emphatic yes. "It's a feel-good movie, which is an antidote for how a lot of people are feeling right now," he said. (His career is fine either way; his production company has more than 20 projects in the works, including two new dramas headed to NBC in the fall and a live-action Scooby-Doo series for Netflix.)
Ms. Johansson was a bit more circumspect.
"I guess we'll see," she said. "You have to keep trying."

Full text: At the drive-in, under the stars or in your living room, there are plenty of frights to be had before fall arrives.
Horror movies can be great summertime escapes because, unlike soaring temperatures and global political upheaval, their terrors are temporary and, at least for fans of the genre, a ton of fun.
Here's a look at new movies and beloved classics that will (metaphorically) scare your pants off in theaters, at home and under the stars this summer.
Fresh Hells
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Whether it's date night or a solo Summer Friday afternoon, movie theaters are chockablock with new scares. They include "MaXXXine," the final entry in a slasher trilogy starring Mia Goth; "A Quiet Place: Day One," a prequel to the hit franchise about bloodthirsty creatures with really good hearing; and "The Exorcism," a supernatural drama starring Russell Crowe as an actor who unravels playing the role of an exorcist.
For fans of oddball indie horror, there's "In a Violent Nature," an extravagantly gory, genre-smashing slasher film; "I Saw the TV Glow," a darkly atmospheric meditation on youth and isolation; and "The Devil's Bath," a folk-horror psychodrama set in the 18th century.
Classic Frights

The stylishly lurid, 1970s Italian horror genre known as giallo -- Leather-gloved killers! Glistening blades! -- gets the spotlight this month at the Nighthawk Cinema in Williamsburg. The films are by giallo masters: Mario Bava's "Blood and Black Lace," set in the killer world of fashion (July 12-13); Lucio Fulci's "Murder Rock," a dance-inspired mystery (July 19-20); and Dario Argento's "Opera," in which an aria is truly torture (July 26-27).
On Aug. 6, the Nighthawk hosts a rare screening of "Aelita, Queen of Mars," a 1924 silent science-fiction film from Russia, to be accompanied live by the electronic duo the Flushing Remonstrance.
On July 12, take a time machine to '80s New York City when Anthology Film Archives hosts a double feature of the works of the maverick filmmaker Abel Ferrara and starring Zoë Lund: "Ms. 45," an ultraviolent rape revenge film, and "Bad Lieutenant," with Harvey Keitel as the faith-questioning title character. On July 24, Anthology shows "Landscape Suicide," a disturbing 16-millimeter film from 1986 in which actors re-create the court testimonies of killers.
The Metrograph Theater on the Lower East Side this month offers four screenings of "Cure," Kiyoshi Kurosawa's labyrinthine murder mystery from 1997, and a special screening of David Lynch's dystopian "Eraserhead." featuring a Q. and A. with the cinematographer Frederick Elmes (July 20).
"Instead of getting sticky in the grimy city heat, come get the juices flowing": That's how the Spectacle Theater, a microcinema in Brooklyn, describes "Bloodpumpers!," a three-film series of delightfully terrible workout-inspired scary movies. Choose from the new aerobicide comedy "Murdercise" (July 19 and 22) and two low-budget slasher oddities from the 1980s: "Killer Workout" (July 20 and 25) and "Death Spa" (July 19 -- at midnight! -- and 21).
Next month, the Museum of Modern Art celebrates the 50th anniversary of "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre," Tobe Hooper's brutal and influential horror film, with a weeklong revival (Aug. 8-14). A companion series (Aug. 12-20) highlights the director's darkly comic 1980s filmography, including the underseen "Funhouse" and the Oscar-nominated "Poltergeist."
From Aug. 16-22, Film Forum presents "Blaxploitation, Baby!," a 16-film series featuring beloved hardcore Black action films from the 1970s, including the Pam Grier, take-no-prisoners thriller "Coffy" and the bloodsucker-in-Los Angeles saga "Blacula." Film Forum follows that with a weeklong run (Aug. 23-29) of a new 4K restoration of "Frenzy," Hitchcock's 1972 thriller about a killer with a thing for neckties.
Outdoors and All Ages

The city Parks Department is offering a summer-long calendar of free screenings at dusk. For the littlest horror fans, there's "Mummies" (July 24, Naples Playground on Staten Island), an animated adventure film about three mummified friends and their baby crocodile. Teenagers will get a kick out of "Morbius" (July 19, James J. Walker Park in Manhattan), starring Jared Leto as a scientist who accidentally turns himself into a vampire; and "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire" (July 31, Westerleigh Park on Staten Island), the latest comedy in the long-running franchise.
For a premium outdoor experience, the Rooftop Cinema Club lets you watch movies under the stars nestled in a comfy chair with a bag of popcorn, all for just under $ 40. On tap at the club's Midtown location this month are "American Psycho" (July 22); "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" (July 26); and "Scream" (July 28).
Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservancy's Movies With a View series features free outdoor movies on Thursday evenings through Aug. 29 at Pier 1 Harbor View Lawn. Choose from two big-budget genre classics of the '90s: Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" (July 18) and Francis Ford Coppola's "Bram Stoker's Dracula" (Aug. 15).
Back-to-back genre madness hits Brooklyn next month. On Aug. 7, Rooftop Films heads to Brooklyn Commons Park to show "Dark Toons," an anthology of not-for-kids animated short films from Finland, Poland and other countries. The next night, "The Warriors," a bonkers 1979 action film about rival gangs at war on the streets of New York City, shows at Coney Island Beach as part of the Paramount+ Movie Nights program.
At the Drive-In

If there's a horror nerd's destination getaway, it's the Mahoning Drive-In Theater, located in Lehighton, Pa., a Poconos town about a two-and-a-half hour drive from Manhattan. Make a weekend of it at the Troma-Thon (July 19-20), a 50th anniversary celebration of the B-movie studio Troma, which includes a screening of the oddball "Toxic Avenger," or come for Back to the Woods (Aug. 16-17), with its 25th anniversary 35-millimeter screening of the indie trailblazer "The Blair Witch Project."
For families vacationing in the Catskills, the Greenville Drive-In in Greene County is a good place to introduce kids to Steven Spielberg's science fiction-adventure drama "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" (Jul 19-20).

Full text: Purslane Cafe, from the group behind Rucola and more, serves sandwiches and drinks; Parcelle adds a new location; and more restaurant news.
Opening
Purslane Cafe
The Oberon Group, a restaurant and catering company that is serious about sustainability and zero waste, is now in charge of the terrace cafe at the Boathouse in Prospect Park. Purslane, the group's catering division, which also produces special events in the park, is running the restaurant. The group owns Rucola, June Bar, Rhodora and Anaïs in Brooklyn, and also runs the restaurant Clara in the New-York Historical Society in Manhattan. Tapped by the Prospect Park Alliance for this seasonal oasis, it serves sandwiches, pastries and coffee and, on some evenings offers cocktail time with music.
Prospect Park Boathouse Terrace, prospectpark.org/purslane-cafe.
Nomé
This luxuriously appointed newcomer at the edge of Union Square, is owned by the New Jersey-based Mocha Hospitality which has other kosher restaurants, including steak houses. The menu from the chef Santiago Chiuz, who is from Honduras and has been a chef in Miami, includes a 50-ounce bone-in rib-eye steak, a Goliath they're calling Jurassic Hawk. A number of dishes incorporate Asian touches.
127 Fourth Avenue (13th Street), 212-419-8889, nomenewyork.com.
Parcelle Greenwich Village
Parcelle, a wine merchant with restaurants and wine bars, has added this new location. The compact yet airy space, with vintage décor, is the setting for a menu created and executed by Mark Ladner, the group's consulting executive chef; Kate Telfeyan, its culinary director; and Robert Kent, the executive sous chef. A 500-bottle wine list includes natural wines and Burgundian rarities. The wines are also available for purchase from the online retailer. (Opens July 16)

Din Tai Fung
Already established and known for xiao long bao (soup dumplings) in over 180 locations globally, the much-anticipated New York edition of the family-owned Taiwanese chain is poised to open in Paramount Plaza near Times Square. An underground space abut half the size of a football field seats 450 in several areas, one of which has a windowed kitchen where cooks fold and pleat dumplings with precision and speed. A dramatic glass-enclosed street entrance and a staircase with a shimmer of gold curtains leads down to the restaurant where various xiao long bao, wontons, steamed dumplings and buns, noodles and rice are served. (Thursday)

Union Square Night Market
A first for Union Square, the park that inaugurated the Greenmarket system, is a summer market to be open Thursdays through Aug. 1 from noon until 9 p.m. (Night market? In summer it's barely twilight by 9 p.m.) It's run by Urbanspace, and the vendors will include Belgian fries by Home Frite, jerk chicken from Treat Yourself Jerk, tamales by La Palapa, and, as the name implies, molten chocolate over strawberries at Chocolate on Tap. (Thursday)

N'Between
A compact, Japanese-style speakeasy is tucked behind Maki a Mano in Chelsea Market. Cocktails assembled with Japanese ingredients are served with small plates like karaage (fried chicken) and a dry-aged cheeseburger with yakiniku sauce in a milk bun.
443 West 15th Street, 347-542-8627, nbetween.bar.
Montauk Project
There was a Montauk Project, a sort of secret U.F.O. conspiracy involving Camp Hero, a former Cold War government base in Montauk and popularized in books by Preston Nichols and in "Stranger Things" on Netflix. But there's nothing covert about the so-named venture by the first time restaurateur Sam Berkson and his business partner, Bryan Seekamp, whose East Hampton family once owned Brent's General Store in Amagansett. They've taken over what had been Roberta's in Montauk. The indoor-outdoor space, done with casual polish, houses this restaurant with food by Jesse Freijo that will also deliver a nightlife vibe.
240 Fort Pond Road (Flamingo Ave.), Montauk, N.Y., 401-315-8056, mtk-project.com.
On the Move
Union Square Events
Add Danny Meyer to the list of marquee names that populate the Hamptons. In Hampton Bays, the least Hampton of the collection of villages, his flag is now planted at Canoe Place Inn, a centuries-old property. Union Square Events which he created but no longer owns, is now running food and beverages for the resort. For the main restaurant, Good Ground Tavern, the chef Jarrod Huth, who worked with Thomas Keller, is still in the kitchen and is the culinary director.
Looking Ahead
'Omnivore'
For this new eight-part series, streaming July 19, the renowned chef René Redzepi, an owner and founder of Noma in Copenhagen, tours the world ingredient by ingredient. "It's not a travel or cooking show," he said over Zoom. "It's about the evolution of ingredients and their connection to various cultures. What I learned about bananas is mind-blowing." Other topics include tuna, salt, coffee and corn. An executive producer, Matt Goulding, worked with Anthony Bourdain. On Monday a preview screening followed by a conversation between Mr. Redzepi and Phil Rosenthal, of "Somebody Feed Phil," will be held at 7:30 p.m. at 92NY, $ 35 from 92ny.org/events.
"Omnivore," Apple TV+ starting July 19.
Closing
M. Wells
Last Saturday, exactly 14 years after M. Wells opened, the owners, the chef Hugue Dufour and Sarah Obraitis, his wife and partner, have announced that they will close their Long Island City restaurant on Dec. 31. "We felt it was time," Ms. Obraitis said on Monday by phone. And with six months to go, regulars have time to return and others can experience the restaurant for the first time. Possible next steps include opening a plant for making tourtières, their popular Canadian meat pies, and selling them nationally. "It's a way to bring M. Wells into people's homes," she said. Another restaurant is not out of the question.

Closed
Jane Restaurant & Bar
The West Houston Street restaurant has closed. A replacement has been promised by the owners.
Sarabeth's Tribeca
This downtown location has closed, leaving the group with restaurants on the Upper West Side, on Central Park South and Park Avenue South. A new Manhattan location is in the works.

Paramount To Welcome A New Boss: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He left college to try out acting. Now, he's set to become one of the most powerful people in Hollywood.
David Ellison's Hollywood career has been defined by high-octane blockbusters filled with suspense, stunts and improbable plot twists.
But on Sunday he landed his biggest cliffhanger yet, striking a deal to merge with Paramount after months of negotiations with the company and its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone. If the deal closes, he will be in charge of a sprawling media empire that includes CBS, MTV and the Paramount movie studio.
Though Mr. Ellison, 41, joined the cast of Hollywood's power players more than a decade ago, he hasn't taken center stage until now. Here's a look at his career.
Who is David Ellison, and what is his company, Skydance?
A quick perusal of Mr. Ellison's page on the Internet Movie Database shows a relatively undistinguished acting career, with minor roles in films like the fighter drama "Flyboys" and teen comedy "The Chumscrubber" (in which he played "Student No. 1"). It wasn't until he became a producer that his star in Hollywood began to rise.
After he dropped out of the University of Southern California and gave up on acting, Mr. Ellison turned to producing. His family's considerable influence -- he is the son of the Oracle founder Larry Ellison -- helped him bankroll big-budget films like "Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol" and "Star Trek Into Darkness."
Along the way, the valuation of Mr. Ellison's company Skydance Media ballooned to more than $ 4 billion, after private-equity firms like RedBird Capital Partners and KKR invested in it. Mr. Ellison, the chief executive of Skydance, has co-produced hits like "Top Gun: Maverick" and "G.I. Joe: Retaliation" with Paramount, giving him an entree to the company's executives and its most valuable franchises.
Long before he produced "Top Gun: Maverick," Mr. Ellison was something of a daredevil himself. In 2022 he told The New York Times that he started flying planes in his adolescence and competed in acrobatic air shows into his 20s.
How is Mr. Ellison's family involved in Hollywood?
Larry Ellison -- who had a cameo in "Iron Man 2" -- is personally backing Skydance's bid for Paramount, throwing his wealth and tech expertise behind the deal.
David Ellison's sister, Megan Ellison, is also a Hollywood fixture: In 2011, she founded Annapurna, which produced "Her" and "American Hustle." Mr. Ellison's wife, Sandra Lynn, is also in showbusiness: She's the country singer-songwriter behind songs like "I Think of You" and "Somebody Kissed Me at a Bar." Neither Megan Ellison nor Sandra Lynn are on Skydance's executive team.
What are David Ellison's plans for Paramount?
Though Mr. Ellison hasn't laid out his plans for Paramount publicly, he discussed them with a special committee of the company's board months ago. He has discussed working with another major entertainment company on a streaming joint venture in the United States, keeping with the broader trend toward bundling, according to two people familiar with his pitch to Paramount's board.
Paramount's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, is enthusiastic about other aspects of the Skydance deal, two people familiar with her thinking said. She thinks Mr. Ellison's management team will add tech and animation know-how to the combined company.
Mr. Ellison also pitched Paramount on a plan to supercharge the company's streaming capabilities with improved recommendations and more efficient deals with data providers, a person familiar with his presentation said. Skydance has ownership stakes in Paramount's most financially successful shows and movies, including "Mission: Impossible" and "Top Gun," so uniting the two firms could give the combined company greater flexibility in managing its franchises.
A key executive in discussions with Skydance is Jeff Shell, the former chief executive of NBCUniversal. Mr. Shell, who joined the Skydance backer RedBird Capital last year, will become the president of Paramount.
Does Skydance have ties to other Hollywood companies?
Though Skydance has a deep relationship with Paramount, it has also produced movies for other Hollywood studios. Skydance has a multiyear deal to produce animated films for Netflix, and it has partnered with Amazon on films including "The Tomorrow War" and "Without Remorse."
Skydance has also lately gotten into the sports-media business. Skydance Sports, a division started in 2021, struck a deal in 2022 to partner with the National Football League to create a production company that would expand the reach of sports programming. And last year it produced "Air," a movie about the making of Nike's Air Jordan brand.

Streaming Gems Found Off the Beaten Path: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Speculative science fiction, period drama and sly thrillers are among this month's off-the-beaten-path recommendations from your subscription streamers.
'The Promised Land' (2023)
Stream it on Hulu.
Mads Mikkelsen stars in this epic period drama as Capt. Ludvig Kahlen, described as "a presumptuous soldier in a flea-ridden uniform" -- and that's what they say to his face. The sneers and humiliation he is subjected to by the ruling class of mid-18th-century Denmark give the picture its juice; the potent narrative is as much a pointed class commentary as a historical drama, as the poor but dedicated Kahlen tries to build a workable manor out of a barren slab of heath, and discovers that his idealistic notions of honor and hard work won't get him much of anywhere with these aristocrats. Chief among them is Simon Bennebjerg's De Schinkel, the most loathsome movie villain in many a moon. And the director Nikolaj Arcel builds up a furious head of steam on the way to an utterly satisfying conclusion.
'A Simple Favor' (2018)
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Paul Feig made his name directing such movies as "Bridesmaids" and "Spy," uproarious comic gems that provided career-best showcases for their female stars. He shines a similarly flattering spotlight on Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively here, though with a surprising genre shift, eschewing the broad comedy of his earlier work for this stylish, semi-Sapphic neo-noir thriller. Kendrick is a typical suburban mom who finds herself dazzled by (and quietly attracted to) Lively's sophisticated outlier; their children are schoolmates, but they may as well be from different planets. The twists and turns of Jessica Sharzer's screenplay (from the Darcey Bell novel) are compelling, but Kendrick and Lively's swoony relationship, and its spiky playfulness, are what make "A Simple Favor" sing.
'Dean' (2017)
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The absurdist stand-up comedian Demetri Martin tried his hand at feature filmmaking (and went all-in, writing, directing and starring) with this modest but amusing tale of grief, family and arrested development. As an actor, Martin is occasionally hampered by his deadpan delivery (one of his greatest weapons onstage); luckily, Martin the director is wise enough to fill out the cast with such heavy-hitters as Kevin Kline, Mary Steenburgen and Gillian Jacobs. Kline provides the best material in the picture as Martin's father, a recent widower whose attempt at new beginnings cause his son to re-evaluate his own life.
'Austenland' (2013)
Stream it on Max.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Jerusha Hess, who wrote the hits "Napoleon Dynamite" and "Nacho Libre" with her husband, Jared, made her directing debut with this charmingly eccentric adaptation of the novel by Shannon Hale. The always charismatic Keri Russell is delightful as a Jane Austen obsessive who heads to an Austen-themed English resort hotel, hoping to find a "Pride and Prejudice"-style romance, only to bump up against the limits of romantic fantasy. Bret McKenzie, Jane Seymour and an exuberantly unhinged Jennifer Coolidge are among the supporting cast.
'The Duke of Burgundy' (2015)
Stream it on Mubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The writer and director Peter Strickland constructs lavish, peculiar pictures that seem set less in our own world than that of 1960s and '70s exploitation movies. This tartly kinky effort is firmly in the subset of Eurosex cinema, a period in which foreign sensibilities allowed far greater liberties than the puritanical Hollywood of the day. In exploring the complex dynamics of a female B.D.S.M. dynamic, Strickland seeks out universal truths of need, envy and power -- while still reveling in the eroticism and intensity of the relationship.
'Biosphere' (2023)
Stream it on Hulu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mark Duplass and Sterling K. Brown star as the last two people on Earth, the former president and his scientist pal, weighing the particulars and logistics of sustaining the human race in this delicately crafted comedy-drama (with the barest necessary scaffolding of science fiction) from the director Mel Eslyn. The screenplay, which Eslyn wrote with Duplass, finds them living in the titular structure, and after the expected (and amusing) comic explorations of their shared space, the real subject of the picture comes into play. It's a beautifully unspooled surprise, which will remain so here; suffice it to say it's a film with much to say about boundaries, tolerance and masculinity, and it does so with wit and grace.
'For Love & Life: No Ordinary Campaign' (2024)
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Brian Wallach and Sandra Abrevaya are political organizers who met on the 2008 Obama campaign, fell in love, got married and started a family. Their storybook romance hit a speed bump in 2017, when Brian -- all of 36 years old -- was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (a.k.a. Lou Gherig's Disease), a terminal neurodegenerative disorder. Unwilling to accept his near certain death sentence, Wallach and Abrevaya started a nonprofit advocacy organization, I Am ALS, using their experience in political advocacy to raise awareness and funds. It's an inspiring, heartbreaking and occasionally infuriating story, brought to vivid and moving life by the director Christopher Burke, who uses his extensive access to the couple to paint a portrait of uncommon dedication with real intimacy.
'All That Breathes' (2022)
Stream it on Max.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The brothers Nadeem Shehzad and Mohammad Saud have dedicated their lives to caring for the wounded black kite birds of New Delhi, a species regarded with such sneering dislike by the citizens of their city that it would be something like taking up the cause of pigeon care in New York City. But Shaunak Sen's quietly moving documentary (an Academy Award nominee in the documentary category) honors the nobility of that work -- all animals are living creatures, deserving of respect and health -- and prevents it from becoming too niche by highlighting the universal aspect of the brothers' lives. They work too much, at the expense of time spent with friends and family, and while work/life balance is far too bland a subject for such an expressive film, it conveys the surprising relatability of these men and their mission.

Full text: In this month's sci-fi picks, life on Mars, a social dystopia set in near-future London and a meet-cute after a spaceship accident.
'Mars Express'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Rent or buy it on most major platforms.
The French director Jérémie Périn's impressive debut feature is set on Mars, which is now habitable under extensive domes, but this animated movie isn't about terraforming or life on the red planet. Rather, Périn explores the tensions among humans, robots, androids and newcomers called "organics." And he does it with an action-packed, often violent noir thriller (this is not a film for young children).
The central character is the private detective Aline Ruby (voiced by Morla Gorrondona in the English dub), who is hired to locate a missing cybernetics student. In the process, she and her robot sidekick, Carlos (Josh Keaton), uncover a far-reaching conspiracy that involves some powerful people.
Pretty standard stuff in terms of plot mechanics, but "Mars Express" undergirds its suspenseful, skilfully directed set pieces with weighty philosophical concerns, like the meaning of personhood and the quest for increased autonomy. The world building is superb, with such thoughtful details as a minibar that automatically shuts off when it senses the presence of someone in recovery, a patch that allows for telepathic communication, and students making extra money in "brain farms."
Note that except on Amazon, which lists French and English audio, "Mars Express" only seems to be available dubbed; it'd be great to have wider access to the subtitled original cast, led by Léa Drucker as Aline.
'The Kitchen'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Stream it on Netflix.
Speaking of world-building: The term is often used in relation to settings that are distant in space or time, and quite remote from our present circumstances. "The Kitchen" is a social dystopia set in near-future London so the differences with our reality are relatively minor, but they are very effectively deployed. The directors Daniel Kaluuya and Kibwe Tavares ground their story in two issues of great interest to millions, if not billions of people: the scarcity of housing and the difficulty of maintaining familial bonds in a fraught environment.
Izi (the rapper and actor Kane Robinson, from the series "Top Boy") has just learned that he's finally landed a new apartment. This means that he can finally leave the dilapidated, overcrowded housing complex known as the Kitchen, where even taking a shower becomes an endurance test. His neighborhood is packed with narrow alleys and small stalls, police drones fly overhead and violence is a constant presence. The prospect of moving out is a godsend for Izi, but his meeting the newly orphaned Benji (Jedaiah Bannerman) upends his plans -- it's harder to leave when someone anchors you.
"The Kitchen" joins the growing ranks of futuristic movies pointedly dealing with class warfare, and its description of a world in which the gap between haves and have-nots has deepened to a trench is all too familiar.
'Animalia'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Rent or buy it on most major platforms.
If your definition of an alien invasion involves ships hovering above Earth and major destruction, just know that Sofia Alaoui's beautifully shot take on the genre is definitely ... not that. Still, the mysterious, elliptical Moroccan movie "Animalia" exerts a pull of its own as its central character, a pregnant young woman named Itto (Oumaima Barid), faces a series of unexplained events.
When the wealthy family she has married into leaves for an outing, Itto enjoys some quality alone time at home. Soon, however, things start to go off the rails. Animals behave strangely, army vehicles barrel down the streets, roadblocks are hastily erected. The movie holds back on the explanations, and as her husband, Amine (Mehdi Dehbi), tries to arrange for a reunion, Itto's journey acquires a mystical tinge.
Yet Alaoui does not stray into woo-woo New Age-isms and offers pointed views on the emancipation of women in Morocco, and their role in both the family and society. It takes confidence and skill to keep an audience invested in a movie while withholding information, and Alaoui clearly has both.
'Molli and Max in the Future'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Stream it on Amazon.
"So we have to go in a circle to go forward?" This question, asked in the writer-director Michael Lukk Litwak's debut feature, neatly encapsulates the romantic-comedy genre. After all, in rom-coms two people spend way too much time avoiding an attraction that's obvious to everybody else. Such is the case with Molli (Zosia Mamet) and Max (Aristotle Athari), who meet cute in a spaceship accident. His jalopy gets totaled, so she must give him a ride back to his Oceanus home -- Max is part fish, though he passes as human. Their banter is finger-snapping fast, so obviously they're meant to be together.
Alas, it'll take them a dozen years and various tribulations to figure it out. Molli joins a cult and becomes a space witch, for example; at one point they even help one another cyber-date. Made with essentially a green screen, a few props and a lot of imagination, and carried with terrific zest by Athari and Mamet, this sci-fi comedy delivers more laughs per minute than most efforts with a higher budget and higher profile. I can't wait to see what Litwak comes up with next.
'Invaders From Proxima B'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Rent or buy it on Fandango at Home.
With the kids out of school, Ward Roberts's goofy hybrid of body switcheroo à la "Freaky Friday" and alien invasion is a good pick for family viewing. A gigging musician and absentee dad, Howie (Roberts) happens to be home on the night a small spaceship crashes into the family backyard. From it emerges Chuck (voiced by Roberts), a diminutive Oscar the Grouch-type puppet that looks as if made from an old parka's faux-fur trim.
Chuck is a grumpy rapscallion who's been dispatched from a trillion miles away to save Earth from way worse aliens, the Draconians. For some highly debatable reason, Chuck must take human form, and Howie just happens to be available. The movie further expands on the body-swapping mayhem when Howie's wife (Samantha Sloyan) and daughter (Bo Roberts) enter the fray. As if this weren't enough, a pair of "Men in Black" types (Mike C. Nelson and Richard Riehle) try to get their hands on Chuck for their own nefarious reasons.
An unabashedly D.I.Y. lark, "Invaders From Proxima B" fully commits to its silliness and lowbrow humor -- the early fart joke is a warning flare -- and does the furry-creature feature proud.
Photograph Top, Aristotle Athari and Zosia Mamet in "Molli and Max in the Future." They take years to figure out they belong together. Right, "Mars Express," a violent animated thriller that's not for young children. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY ZACH STOLTZFUS/LEVEL33 ENTERTAINMENT; GKIDS) This article appeared in print on page C3.

Paramount's Board Signs Off on Agreement to Merge With Skydance: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The deal, approved by Paramount's board, would usher in a new chapter for the company, which owns CBS and the movie studio behind "Top Gun."
Paramount and Skydance said on Sunday they had reached an agreement to merge, a deal that would usher in a new era for CBS, Nickelodeon and the film studio behind the "Top Gun" and "Mission: Impossible" franchises.
The deal is a turning point for the Redstone family, whose fortunes have been intertwined with the rise and fall of the traditional entertainment industry during the decades of its tumultuous ownership of Paramount and its predecessors. Shari Redstone, Paramount's board chair, is cashing in much of her ownership in the company she fought to preserve and control.
The merger has a "go shop" period that will give Paramount's board a 45-day window to see if it can find a superior deal.
But if the Skydance deal closes, it will anoint a new mogul in Hollywood. David Ellison, the tech scion behind Skydance, will become the top power broker at Paramount. The deal is in some ways the story of media writ large, with a family that made its fortune in traditional entertainment largely replaced by one enriched by technology -- Mr. Ellison is the son of the Oracle founder Larry Ellison. The Ellisons' considerable resources were a major selling point for the Redstones, who were seeking to shore up Paramount for the long-term.
"Given the changes in the industry, we want to fortify Paramount for the future while ensuring that content remains king," Ms. Redstone said in a statement.
The merger closes a chapter for Ms. Redstone, 70, who took over from her father, Sumner, and fought to keep the family media empire intact.
Mr. Ellison, who will become the chairman and chief executive of Paramount, thanked Ms. Redstone in a statement, saying he was "incredibly grateful" that she had "agreed to entrust us with the opportunity to lead Paramount."
In recent years, Paramount has become the poster child of a traditional media industry that has been limping along in the shadows of the streaming giant Netflix and tech companies like Amazon, which have plenty of cash to spend on their media bets. Paramount has tried to replace its fading cable TV enterprise with streaming businesses like Paramount+, but those efforts are still nowhere near as profitable as traditional TV operations.
The full value of the merger was not immediately clear because the deal is complex. Skydance and its financial backers will acquire National Amusements, the company that holds the Redstone family's voting stock in Paramount, for roughly $ 1.75 billion. Paramount is also merging with Skydance, leaving the studio and its backers in charge of a media empire that includes film, TV and news properties.
Paramount's market capitalization -- the value the stock market places on the company -- is around $ 8.2 billion. The deal values Skydance at $ 4.75 billion.
The offer from Skydance will allow many holders of Paramount's nonvoting stock to cash out at roughly $ 15 per share. Investors who own voting stock will be able to sell at $ 23 per share. This will allow investors who feel shortchanged by the Skydance deal -- there are many -- to get rid of the company's stock at a premium to its current price of $ 11.81.
Skydance's takeover of Paramount has been a drama worthy of a summer blockbuster. Since the beginning of the year, Ms. Redstone, Paramount and Mr. Ellison have been in engaged in semipublic negotiations that frequently leaked to the press and curdled the good will on both sides.
Executives appeared to be close to a deal last month. But the renegotiated terms reduced the value of Ms. Redstone's controlling stake. Just as a special committee of Paramount's board was preparing to make it official, Ms. Redstone's lawyers emailed them to kill the deal, saying they couldn't agree on "noneconomic terms."
With the deal on ice, other suitors emerged to court Ms. Redstone, including the billionaire Barry Diller and Steven Paul, the producer best known for the "Baby Geniuses" movie franchise. But the Skydance deal came back last week, with Skydance improving its offer for Ms. Redstone's stake and offering firmer protections against litigation.
Those provisions may help reduce the challenge posed by investors who have opposed the deals with Skydance, saying they would enrich Ms. Redstone at the expense of other shareholders. All the Skydance merger deals that have been considered have guaranteed her an extra payout in exchange for her voting clout -- typically called a control premium -- which some shareholders have argued is unfair. A small number have threatened to sue.
The merger agreement comes at a precarious time for Paramount. Its flagship streaming service, Paramount+, is hemorrhaging hundreds of millions of dollars in cash annually. After clashing with Ms. Redstone, its chief executive, Bob Bakish, was replaced by three executives, who run an "office of the C.E.O." -- an awkward, temporary fix. And its cable business is in long-term decline, causing its stock to slide more than 70 percent over the last five years.
In the last month, Paramount's three chief executives have proposed a plan they say will help get Paramount back on track that includes cutting $ 500 million in costs and selling off parts of the company that aren't central to its strategy. Losses are beginning to slow at Paramount+, and the company is exploring a potential joint venture with other firms that could reduce costs further.
Now taking control of the flagging company will be Mr. Ellison, a Hollywood producer and executive who has helped fund some of Paramount's biggest franchises. After dropping out of the University of Southern California to try his hand at acting, he began to finance films, founding Skydance in 2010. The company has produced some of its most successful movies with Paramount, including "Top Gun: Maverick" and "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One."
Mr. Ellison, 41, is planning to bring his own cast into Paramount. Jeff Shell, a former chief executive of NBCUniversal, will be president of the new company. He was fired from NBCUniversal last year after an anchor at CNBC lodged a sexual harassment complaint against him. Late last year, he joined RedBird Capital Partners, a Skydance backer, as its chairman of sports and media.
Mr. Bakish, 60, remains an adviser to Paramount. His exit agreement, which was filed in May, says he will continue to work for the company through October with a monthly salary of $ 258,333 and benefits. His exit package also includes a two-year nondisparagement agreement.
Byron Trott, whose firm BDT & MSD Partners advised Ms. Redstone, will see a return on its $ 125 million investment in National Amusements last year. Other advisers include Centerview Partners, which guided Paramount's special committee, and Skydance advisers Moelis and The Raine Group.
Though Mr. Ellison hasn't spoken publicly about his plans for Paramount, he has briefed its board on his intentions, two people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Ellison has discussed the possibility of teaming up with one or more of Paramount's rivals on a combined streaming service. He also plans to turbocharge the company's technology, adding better personalization features to its streaming service.
Another pillar of Skydance's plans for Paramount is cost cutting. The company plans to consolidate some international operations, boosting profits partly by laying off employees. That won't earn Mr. Ellison many fans among the company's rank-and-file, though it could help him please shareholders.

A special committee of Paramount’s board on Sunday signed off on a deal to merge with Skydance, according to two people familiar with the negotiations, setting the stage for a new era for CBS, Nickelodeon and the film studio behind the “Top Gun” and “Mission: Impossible” franchises.
Shari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, is expected to follow suit as early as Sunday evening, and the companies are planning to announce the deal as early as Monday, the people said. Redstone could still change her mind, but this is the closest the two companies have come to announcing a deal after months of fraught negotiations.
The deal would be a turning point for the Redstone family, whose fortunes have been intertwined with the rise and fall of the traditional entertainment industry during the decades of its tumultuous ownership of Paramount and its predecessors. Redstone, Paramount’s board chair, would cash in much of her ownership in the company she fought to preserve and control.
The merger would anoint a new mogul in Hollywood. David Ellison, the tech scion behind Skydance, will become the top power broker at Paramount.

The Ellisons’ considerable resources have been a major selling point for the Redstones, who were seeking to fortify Paramount for the long-term.
In recent years, Paramount has become the poster child of a traditional media industry that has been limping along in the shadows of streaming giant Netflix and tech companies such as Amazon, which have plenty of cash to spend on their media bets. Paramount has tried to replace its fading cable TV enterprise with streaming businesses such as Paramount+, but those efforts are still nowhere near as profitable as traditional TV operations.

Paramount would also merge with Skydance, leaving the studio and its backers in charge of a media empire that includes film, TV and news properties.
Paramount’s market capitalization — the value the stock market places on the company — is about $8.2 billion. Skydance’s last disclosed valuation was more than $4 billion.
A tender offer from Skydance would allow many holders of Paramount’s nonvoting stock to cash out at roughly $15 per share. Investors who own voting stock will be able to sell at $23 per share. This would allow investors who feel shortchanged by the Skydance deal — there are many — to get rid of the company’s stock at a premium to its current price of $11.81.

In the past month, Paramount’s three CEOs have proposed a plan they say will help get Paramount back on track that includes cutting $500 million in costs and selling off parts of the company that aren’t central to its strategy. Losses are beginning to slow at Paramount+, and the company is exploring a potential joint venture with other firms that could reduce costs further.
The man who would take control of the flagging company is a Hollywood producer who has helped fund some of Paramount’s biggest franchises. After dropping out of the University of Southern California to try his hand at acting, Ellison began to finance films, founding Skydance in 2010. The company has produced some of its most successful movies with Paramount, including “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One.”
Ellison, 41, is planning to bring his own cast into Paramount. Jeff Shell, a former CEO of NBCUniversal, has been in discussions to take a major role, two people familiar with the matter said. He was fired from NBCUniversal last year after an anchor at CNBC lodged a sexual harassment complaint against him. Late last year, he joined Redbird Capital Partners, a Skydance backer, as its chair of sports and media.
Bakish, 60, remains an adviser to Paramount. His exit agreement, filed in May, says he will continue to work for the company through October with a monthly salary of $258,333 and benefits. His exit package also includes a two-year nondisparagement agreement.
Although Ellison hasn’t spoken publicly about his plans for Paramount, he has briefed its board on his intentions, two people familiar with the matter said. Ellison has discussed the possibility of teaming up with one or more of Paramount’s rivals on a combined streaming service. He also plans to turbocharge the company’s technology, adding better personalization features to its streaming service.
Another pillar of Skydance’s plans for Paramount is cost cutting. The company plans to consolidate some international operations, boosting profits partly by laying off employees. That won’t earn Ellison many fans among the company’s rank-and-file, although it could help him please shareholders.

Full text: I'm a national political reporter covering the presidential election, based in Los Angeles and traveling throughout the country. Politics does not feel all that "fun" at the moment, so I'm usually looking for ways to laugh loudly -- though sometimes I am happy to sob. I'm drawn to anything that unpacks human psychology and foibles. Here are five things I've recently delighted in seeing, hearing and watching.
Nina Conti
When we told friends we were seeing a ventriloquist, they thought we were nuts. They were nuts for missing it. Conti uses a stuffed monkey to hilarious effect, but the most fun comes when she treats volunteers from the audience as puppets. At one point she was manipulating three people at once, laughing as she bounced between them.
Top Chef
This show, which just finished its 21st season, still holds its simple charm. The new host, Kristen Kish, the Season 10 winner, has a way of encouraging competition to bring out both skills and joy from the chefs. Sometimes I think: Maybe I should try this at home.
Väsen
I know approximately nothing about Swedish folk music but happened to see this band perform live earlier this year. I was utterly entranced by the nyckelharpa, or key harp, that features prominently in their songs. The sound feels soothing and uplifting and has become frequent background music when I write.
Kantika
Reading this novel by Elizabeth Graver felt like a portal into many different worlds: the Ottoman Empire, Barcelona, Havana and early 20th-century New York. Graver uses her grandmother's Sephardic Jewish history to weave a story about religion, identity, motherhood and disability over nearly 50 years.
One Day
Emma and Dexter meet on their last night of college and have a fling before going on with their postgraduate lives. This Netflix mini-series, adapted from a novel, follows them on the same day of the year for more than two decades as they grapple with the meaning of it all. Nostalgic tear-jerkers always get me.

The Reason It's So Hard for Powerful People to Walk Away: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After his shockingly poor performance in last week's debate, President Biden is facing mounting pressure to drop out of the 2024 election. Influential voices in his own party have called for him to step aside. Polls indicate that many voters hope he will. Yet so far, he is staying the course.
There's a formal name for this trap: escalation of commitment to a losing course of action. In the face of impending failure, extensive evidence shows, instead of rethinking our plans, we often double down on our decisions. It feels better to be a fighter than a quitter.
One of the tragedies of the human condition is that we use our big brains not to make rational decisions but rather to rationalize the decisions we've already made. We stick around too long in dead-end jobs. We stay in unhappy marriages even after friends have counseled us to leave. We stand by candidates even after they violate our principles.
Some of the worst leadership decisions of our time can be traced to escalation of commitment. Many people lost their lives because American presidents pursued a futile war in Vietnam and continued searching for weapons of mass destruction that weren't in Iraq. As George Ball warned in a 1965 letter to President Lyndon Johnson: "Once we suffer large casualties, we will have started a well-nigh irreversible process. Our involvement will be so great that we cannot -- without national humiliation -- stop short of achieving our complete objectives. Of the two possibilities I think humiliation will be more likely."
It happens in business, too: Blockbuster went bust because instead of buying Netflix, leaders escalated their commitment to renting physical videos. Kodak made the same mistake by doubling down on selling film instead of pivoting to digital cameras.
Escalation of commitment helps to explain why leaders are often so reluctant to loosen their grip on power. Losing a high-status position can make them feel they're losing their place in the world. It leaves them with bruised egos and wounded pride.
Of course, we can't know for sure which decisions will turn out to be good. But decades of research led by the organizational psychologist Barry Staw have identified a few conditions that make people especially likely to persist on ill-fated paths. Escalation is likely when people are directly responsible for and publicly attached to a decision, when it has been a long journey and the end is in sight, and when they have reasons to be confident that they can succeed.
It's striking that Mr. Biden's current situation checks all those boxes. He announced his re-election bid to the world in April 2023. He has poured 14 months of energy into his campaign and has only four more to go. And he's beaten the odds before: Many voters told pollsters he was too old before the 2020 election, and in hindsight it's unlikely that any other Democratic candidate would have won.
So what should the president be doing to navigate this enormously consequential decision? So far, we know that he gathered his family and top aides. (According to reports, they all encouraged him to stay in the race.) That's a natural enough impulse, but it doesn't necessarily help, since the people closest to a leader are precisely the ones who are most susceptible to confirmation bias. They're too personally invested in his success and too likely to dismiss warning signs.
What Mr. Biden needs is not a support network but a challenge network -- people who have the will to put the country's interests ahead of his and the skill to coldly assess his chances. That's a task for people who are not affiliated with the campaign in any way; people whose judgment has proved to be impeccable and, most of all, impartial; and people who are not worried about the possible cost to their careers. (Ideal candidates for this role might be professional forecaster, since forecasters -- unlike pollsters, who tell us what voters think today -- excel at anticipating how views are likely to change.)
According to news reports, insiders worry that pressuring Mr. Biden to back out will backfire. That's a valid concern. Pressure can make people defensive. A more promising approach might start with praising his flexibility, which research shows can make people more willing to rethink bad decisions. Second, ask what he sees as the pros and cons of staying in the race. The best way to open a stubborn mind isn't to argue; it's to listen. When people feel heard, they become less defensive and more reflective. Third, ask him what would shift his thinking.
"President Biden, I admire your ability to build bridges across the aisle. That shows a willingness to have tough conversations, and you certainly have a tough choice in front of you. What advice would you give to others facing this dilemma? You obviously have a long list of reasons to stay in the race. What would be your top three reasons to walk away? What information would convince you that it would be best not to run?"
When I've had discussions like this with leaders in government and business, my biggest struggle has been getting them to acknowledge that failure is a real possibility. They've asked me: What if I let go and wish I hadn't? Along with the regret of dropping out, we also need to weigh the regret of staying in.
For Mr. Biden, that might mean asking him to imagine that it's January 2025 and he lost the election in a landslide: President Trump is announcing mass deportations, expanding executive power and working to repeal the 22nd Amendment so he can serve a third term.
This exercise could help Mr. Biden see for himself how losing could rewrite his legacy. He would go down in history as a man who couldn't see his own decline until it was too late.
I hope some dedicated group -- people who deserve Mr. Biden's trust but aren't members of his team or his family -- can help him think these questions through. And I hope he has the humility and integrity to take them seriously, no matter how uncomfortable it might be. In a rally last week, he told the crowd, "I know how to tell the truth!" The more vital question is whether he knows how to hear the truth.
Refusing to quit is not always a heroic act of resilience. It's often stubborn rigidity. President Biden, service is not only about stepping up to lead. It's also about having the courage to step aside.

Andrew Scott, Scene Stealer: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The star of "Ripley" and "All of Us Strangers" has become one of our most reliably excellent actors.
There are some actors who always, no matter the size of their role or the context of their performance, draw the eye. Andrew Scott, who has most recently appeared as the slippery, scheming protagonist in the Netflix series "Ripley," is one of them. He is enthralling to watch, his emotional notes meticulously constructed, with playful touches of chaos that always leave space for moments of discovery and surprise.
Here are a few of Scott's favorite modes of performance, and how his popular roles reflect an actor excelling at his craft.
The Madman
In Scott's breakout role, in "Sherlock," he plays Moriarty, the criminal mastermind opposite Benedict Cumberbatch's contemporary Sherlock Holmes. From Scott's first appearance, in the Season 1 finale, he electrifies an already energetic show.
Cumberbatch set the tone for "Sherlock" with his brutal, fast-paced wit; deductions tumble out of his mouth with strict precision, and in an impersonal monotone. Scott's arrival, and his erratic singsong speaking, break this rhythm. There's a menacing playfulness to not only his rhetorical delivery but also to his facial expressions. It adds a new dimension to the show.
In their initial confrontation scene, Sherlock aims a gun at Moriarty, asking, "What if I was to shoot you now?" Moriarty responds with a cartoonish look of shock that starts at the top of his head and ripples down: his eyebrows popping up, his eyes widening, jaw dropping and neck drawing back.
The rapidity with which his expressions unfold emphasize Moriarty's dangerously fickle temperament; when he threatens Sherlock back, he speaks softly at first but then erupts midsentence, his face contorting horrendously as the timbre of his voice lowers to a grisly rasp. But just as quickly the moment is over: Moriarty returns to his lighthearted tone of villainy and excuses himself.
For as stylized a performance as Scott gives, it's always believable for the character, particularly in this world of grand crimes, intricate designs and eccentric genius. Sherlock is the perpetual steady force, playing his violin and wandering through his mind palace, while Moriarty is the agent of chaos who serves as his match.
The Charmer
The most prominent element of Scott's performance as the so-called hot priest in "Fleabag" is his coy smile. When he is introduced in Phoebe Waller-Bridge's delightful comedy-drama, at a family dinner, his smile is polite and disarming.
It's when he and Fleabag are out for a cigarette break, and he casually flings an expletive at her as she walks away, that a boyish grin spreads across his face. His eyebrows lift slightly in an expression suggesting that he is challenging her.
Part of his charm is a matter of contrast: He is a holy minister meant to provide spiritual guidance, but also a foul-mouthed heavy drinker who can barely hide his sexual desires. As he's finally about to give in and sleep with Fleabag, his mirthful smile fades, one corner of his mouth angled up in a look of satisfaction, but there's no joy behind the expression. His look is hard and resigned to the transgression, and there's just a shadow of his coy smile beneath.
At the end of the series, the priest says that he is unsure whether the euphoria he is feeling is because of God or because of Fleabag, and Scott's performance clues us in to the answer. Scott's ebullient energy -- that almost manic, kinetic charge he often imbues in his characters -- comes through most vividly in the scenes when the priest is talking about God. Scott's priest, despite his love for Fleabag, realizes that she hasn't altered his faith. She has reinforced it.
Scott's charm is on display in a different way in the new Audible podcast adaptation of George Orwell's "1984." His audio performance tricks the senses: You can, somehow, actually hear the smirk on his face as he plays O'Brien, an undercover cop posing as a revolutionary in a dystopian society. Scott leans into the lilt of his natural Irish accent, and his exaggerated shifts in pitch, along with the meticulous way he hangs each syllable on the air and marks the time with cryptic murmurs and pauses, creates a seductive mystery.
The Wounded Man
Scott's most recent big-screen role was in the 2023 film "All of Us Strangers," where he shows how much melancholy he can instill in a performance through nuanced silences and stillness. He stars as Adam, a lonely gay screenwriter who encounters a stranger named Harry and then returns to his childhood home to find his deceased parents there, just as they were decades before.
Scott's performance is muted, his eyes constantly contemplative, his expression that of sadness that has hardened into a stony exterior. Even his sadness is restrained; in a scene in which he discusses his sexuality and childhood bullying with his father, he is composed and dismissive of the difficulties he has faced until his father begins to sob. Adam's face and upper body then likewise crumble.
Scott's most devastating performance may have been captured in a 2012 short film in which he performs the monologue "Sea Wall," by Simon Stephens.
Scott plays a man recounting a personal story of love, faith and devastating loss, and realistically captures the ramblings, interruptions and deflections that people often employ in conversation. He uses the entire studio space behind him, wandering around, pacing, glancing out the windows, thus creating a full sense of setting around him. His mannerisms are precise and seem to intentionally create parallels in his storytelling; a large, grasping gesture can demonstrate both his young daughter reaching innocently upward and his attempt to summon a word from thin air.
The Rogue
In the hands of the wrong director and the wrong lead actor, Tom Ripley, the sociopathic con man turned killer from Patricia Highsmith's popular book series, could easily be flattened to a common criminal. What makes Ripley more than just another bad guy in the latest mystery-thriller is his elusiveness; his Ripley is often psychologically opaque and unpredictable.
Scott's performance in "Ripley" is reserved but not at all withholding. He leaves just wide enough of a window through which the audience can see Ripley's thoughts and emotional reactions while leaving the rest open to interpretation.
Scott's charisma usually bleeds through his characters, who even at their most villainous are effortlessly alluring. But Scott corks his charm as Ripley, who isn't suave in either his social interactions or his crimes. The stillness that this Ripley exudes barely disguises the frenetic energy beneath the surface. In the scenes in which Ripley suspects he is about to be caught, he smiles and makes small talk, tries to relax his posture into a faux act of confidence. But his eyes are tense and focused, like that of an animal spotting a predator.
Ripley is stiff; his conversations are often practiced, from his answers to the way he sits. Perhaps the most prevalent emotion that Scott reveals in this character is shame. When Ripley's unrefined taste comes under attack -- "Who in the world would wear a purple paisley robe," Ripley's will-be victim says with a derisive chuckle -- embarrassment flits across his face just briefly, in the hardened creases around his mouth and a quick downward glance. Then it's gone as quickly as it appeared.

Brand New Top Dog Sporting Mustard Belt At Coney Island Match: [Correction]

Full text: Mr. Bertoletti won the title, succeeding the 16-time champion Joey Chestnut, who was barred from the July 4 spectacle. In the women's contest, Miki Sudo ate 51 hot dogs, a record.
It was the Fourth of July in New York City, and for some, that meant only one thing. No, not fireworks, sweaty subway rides and family cookouts. It was time for the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest in Coney Island.
The contest has long been a holiday mainstay in New York, and its worldwide television exposure has made celebrities of its most famous champions. But this year's event, which tests "competitive eaters" on how many hot dogs they can frantically scarf down in 10 minutes, crowned a new men's champion for the first time in almost a generation and witnessed a new women's record.
Patrick Bertoletti, 39, from Chicago, snagged the men's title -- or, in the parlance of Coney Island, the Mustard Belt -- by eating 58 hot dogs in 10 minutes, while Miki Sudo, 38, ate 51 hot dogs, setting a new women's record.
The former men's champion, Joey Chestnut, 40, won the competition 16 times but was barred from entering after a falling out with the organizers. Mr. Bertoletti was the world's ninth-ranked eater before the competition, according to Major League Eating, and he bested several competitors promoted by event organizers as Mr. Chestnut's potential successors.
"Always a bridesmaid and never a bride," Mr. Bertoletti said afterward. "But today I am getting married."
He described winning as a life-changing event.
"With Joey not here I knew I had a shot," he said, referring to Mr. Chestnut. "I was able to unlock something and I don't know where it came from."
Mr. Chestnut parted ways with the contest last month after he signed an endorsement deal with Impossible Foods, a rival to Nathan's that makes vegan hot dogs.
But he loomed large over Thursday's proceedings, in one case literally: A huge Pepsi ad bearing his image hung just one block from the contest location.
Many of the spectators also wore Chestnut memorabilia and chanted or held up signs pleading for his return. Mark Sterling, 35, did brisk business selling Chestnut bobblehead dolls to the crowd for $ 35.
"Why would you not want a bobblehead of a legend?" said Mr. Sterling, from the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. "Joey Chestnut not being here is like people saying Derek Jeter's not at Yankee Stadium anymore -- people still love him."
Many viewers tuned in year after year just to watch Mr. Chestnut go through a pile of hot dogs like a wood chipper. News of his departure from the contest was met with the sort of public anguish one might expect for a major-league baseball player, not a man who ate 62 hot dogs in 10 minutes last July 4.
At the women's contest on Thursday, Ms. Sudo easily won the title for the 10th time, besting a group of competitors, some of whom traveled to Coney Island from as far as Japan and South Korea.
She ate 51 hot dogs in 10 minutes, setting a new women's record and exceeding her 2023 total of 39.5 hot dogs. The runner-up, Mayoi Ebihara of Japan, ate 37 hot dogs.
As Ms. Sudo ate hot dogs two at a time, an ESPN announcer was inspired to opine, "Her style is like the prose of Eudora Welty," a Pulitzer Prize-winning 20th-century novelist not known to have enjoyed 51 hot dogs in one sitting.
After winning, Ms. Sudo thanked her family and the dental school in Tampa where she is studying to be a dental hygienist, and reflected on the pressures of being a mother, a student and a world-famous hot dog eater.
"You feel like you're juggling," she said, "You try your best to balance everything."
George Shea, the event's larger-than-life M.C., described Ms. Sudo as a woman whose "soul shines like magnesium set afire against the dark mountain of night."
Nonna Titulauri, 31, a banking intern who lives in the East Village, said she was thrilled to witness a new women's world record. But her friend Christina DeCarlo was less amused.
"It's kinda gross," said Ms. DeCarlo, 33, a project manager who lives in Midtown. "I just want to understand, who decided it's a thing?"
In an interview last month, Mr. Shea, a charismatic showman who helped elevate this whole spectacle into the sort of event that is covered by The New York Times, said he was "devastated" by the Chestnut situation. Even Senator Chuck Schumer, a Brooklyn native, mourned what he called "'impossibly' hard-to-swallow news."
Mr. Shea said Mr. Chestnut's endorsement deal had left Major League Eating, which bills itself as "the governing body of all stomach-centric sport," with no choice but to bar him.
"It would be like back in the day Michael Jordan coming to Nike, who made his Air Jordans, and saying, 'I am just going to rep Adidas too,"' Mr. Shea said. "It just can't happen."
The hot dog eating contest is the sort of absurd public event for which New York City has long been known. Over the years, it has developed its own lore, canon and epic heroes, of whom Mr. Chestnut was long the king.
According to local legend, the contest has been held each year since 1916, when Nathan Handwerker opened a hot dog joint on the corner of Surf and Stillwell Avenues in Coney Island.
But like many legends, this one is mostly myth. The contest actually began in the early 1970s, and in 2010, one of its original promoters, Mortimer Matz, admitted that he had cooked up the origin story in "Coney Island pitchman style."
In recent years, the event has been powered largely by the wiener puns and theatrical patriotism of Mr. Shea, who calls it "a celebration of freedom," and by the star power of Mr. Chestnut.
The contest made him famous, and he in turn became synonymous with the event. As the weigh-in ceremony began on Wednesday, Mr. Shea repeated the tale of Mr. Chestnut's departure for the crowd, before reassuring them that he would be welcome to return to the Coney Island event at any time.
Representatives for Mr. Chestnut did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
For those who still wished to watch Mr. Chestnut eat an unsettling number of hot dogs on July 4, he traveled to Fort Bliss, in El Paso, to compete against soldiers in a five-minute hot dog eating contest.
The event was streamed live on Mr. Chestnut's YouTube channel, where 22,000 viewers watched him eat 57 hot dogs in front of a crowd that looked more like a town fair gathering than the flashy Coney Island event.
Mr. Chestnut will also headline a hot dog eating contest on Labor Day that will stream live on Netflix, along with Takeru Kobayashi, another former July 4 hot dog champion who was ejected from the Coney Island contest in 2010 after a falling out with Major League Eating.
Mr. Chestnut's trajectory may have taken him out of the Nathan's competition -- for now, at least -- but James Webb, a former professional soccer player from Australia who began competitive eating "as a joke," said in an interview on Wednesday that some version of his celebrity status is what everyone in the contest hoped to achieve. Mr. Webb placed third Thursday by eating 51.75 hot dogs.
"We are all weird," said Mr. Webb, as a person in a giant hot dog costume danced nearby for TV cameras lined up beneath the Vessel in Hudson Yards. "We are all weird in our way. But we are hella competitive and pretty disciplined. And that's kind of the part people don't see."

For Some Folks, Eating Is Competing: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Day to day, Julie Goldberg eats in a manner that could be described as "exceedingly normal." She finishes her salad. She does not eat her pizza crust. You'd have no idea that Ms. Goldberg, 38, is a competitive eater in training to eat, if not the most hot dogs in history, then the most hot dogs that she has eaten in her life.
They walk among us, these titans of caloric consumption: construction workers and school superintendents, farmers and accountants. The difference is that every July 4, the best of them flock to Coney Island for the Nathan's Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest.
This year, the field is unexpectedly open. Last month, Joey Chestnut, the contest's 16-time champion, was barred from competition after signing an endorsement deal with Impossible Foods. Immediately after the news broke, it was announced that he would go head-to-head with his longtime rival, Takeru Kobayashi, in a Netflix special -- "Chestnut vs. Kobayashi: Unfinished Beef" -- to air live on Sept. 2. (Mr. Kobayashi, who holds the world record for downing bunless hot dogs, has not been allowed to compete in the contest since 2010, owing to a contract dispute with Major League Eating, the governing body of the Nathan's event.)
The vast majority of elite eaters are not signing endorsement deals or getting Netflix specials. But they form the backbone of what is not just a sport but an American tradition.
Even at the pinnacle of competitive eating, the range of ability is huge: Mr. Chestnut holds the record with 76 hot dogs (and buns) in 10 minutes, seven dogs short of what scientists have determined to be the theoretical maximum capacity for a human. Geoffrey Esper, who has finished second at the Nathan's competition for three years running, managed 49.5 hot dogs at his qualifying round this year. Miki Sudo, the nine-time women's winner, holds the division record of 48.5. Other front-runners, like James Webb, Nick Wehry and Patrick Bertoletti, are also hovering in the high 40s.
But most competitors are not hitting these kinds of numbers.
Cherish Brown, 35, a stay-at-home mother who works two part-time jobs remotely in Edon, Ohio, describes herself as "amateur level," although she technically went pro last year. Her personal in-competition best is 10 hot dogs.
In a world of Joey Chestnuts, it may be easy to lose sight of just how many dogs that is. Lest you be confused: 10 hot dogs in 10 minutes is so many hot dogs. Even 6.75 hot dogs -- Ms. Goldberg's recent qualifying total -- requires dedicated training.
"The thing about competitive eating is that it's very difficult," Ms. Goldberg said over wood-fired pizza near her home in Astoria, Queens. It is not the same as gluttony. Overeating is easy, but competitive eating takes skill.
Ms. Goldberg started competing the same way a lot of people do: You meet someone who does it, you get to talking, and they suggest you try it, too.
Shortly after moving to New York City for graduate school -- she is working on a doctorate in political science -- she met Crazy Legs Conti, one of the "O.G.s of competitive eating," by chance at an East Village bar. They began practicing together.
He taught her to dip the bun in Tang, allowing the artificial citrus sweetness to counteract the oppressive salt. He introduced her to the Solomon Method. (Named for King Solomon, who legendarily threatened to cut a baby in two, it is the process of snapping the dog in half and eating both pieces at once.)
George Chiger, 45, met Larell Marie Mele, 60, in line at a cable-company office in Pocono Summit, Pa.
"There's this small, petite woman in front of me in yoga pants and purple hair, and she's all excited that she's going back to Coney Island, and she ate 15 hot dogs and buns," he says. "I kind of chuckled, and she's like, 'Big boy, I can eat more food than you."'
The two became sparring partners. They would meet at her gym -- she was a personal trainer at the time -- and set up George Foreman grills on the basketball court to practice; if her goal was 15 dogs, he'd tell her he was going to do 16, as motivation.
"We did that for years," he says, until, in 2015, Ms. Mele finally persuaded him to compete in a Nathan's qualifier at the Pocono Raceway. "The adrenaline pump was insane," he said. "It's changed my life."
When he met Ms. Mele, Mr. Chiger, who is 6-foot-6, was "400-plus" pounds and had just been told by a life insurance company that he was uninsurable. Today, he is just under 300 pounds, a change he proudly credits to competitive eating.
"It showed me simultaneously, OK, I can eat large amounts of food and really be health-conscious the other six days out of the week," he said. "The doctors are happy. I call it the hot dog diet." (This is not strictly true. He has also recently competed in doughnuts -- 37 in eight minutes, strawberry shortcake -- 14 pounds, and sweet corn -- 30 ears.)
One thing competitive eating teaches you is that the body works in mysterious ways. And, like all sports, this one is a matter of training both the body and the mind.
First, the body. Every one of these eaters is trying to do two things: expand stomach capacity and improve technique. Gideon Oji, 32, a former college basketball player from Nigeria who by day is a management trainee at Enterprise Rent-a-Car in Atlanta, runs "six or seven" miles a day in training -- for "endurance," he said, adding that he performs best when he's leanest.
"It's a lot of sacrifice for what we love," said Mr. Oji, who devoured 35 hot dogs at this year's Nathan's qualifier in Times Square, and holds the world record in kale (22½ 16-ounce kale salads at Kale Yeah! -- The World's Healthiest Eating Championship, in 2017).
To increase the flexibility of their stomachs, some athletes focus on what amounts to an internal stretching program, using vast quantities of watermelon or vegetables or water or Diet Coke, while others do no stretching at all.
"I don't have the opportunity as much, with the business," said Ms. Mele, who owns an electrical contracting company with her husband. "My training is just the practices."
This is where all the regimens align: You have to practice eating hot dogs. "You have to do that," Ms. Mele said, gravely.
This process is refreshingly straightforward: You put 10 minutes on the clock and eat as many hot dogs as you can.
A couple of times a week, Darrien Thomas, 25, of Bowmanville, Ontario, a dietary manager at a retirement home and the No. 1 competitive eater in Canada, turns on music: Rage Against the Machine, and only Rage Against the Machine. ("Every time I hear Rage Against the Machine, I literally taste hot dogs," he said.) And then, as his family watches -- for safety reasons, he never practices alone -- he eats.
It is an analytical type of eating. "That's where you really improve is in those training runs," he said. Competitive eaters deconstruct the process, tweaking variables, looking for inefficiencies.
Ms. Goldberg had been experimenting with a method new to her -- two dogs at a time -- but decided against it. Lately, she's been focusing on shorter practices, so she could really home in on mechanics. She'd heard it was better to keep the food in the center of your mouth, rather than at the edges.
"Some people have a command over not chewing too much," she said. This is her current struggle, fighting the natural urge to chew.
Then there is the mind. The body does not want to consume six or 20 or 72 hot dogs. "At some point, you're fighting your body to keep that food down," Mr. Oji said. The drive to overcome that natural instinct must come from somewhere deep within.
"There's just a lot in my life that's happened that makes me better at pushing past mental barriers," said Ms. Brown, the relative newcomer from Ohio.
Ms. Brown's 9-year-old daughter died in 2020 from a rare form of brain cancer. Six months later, her son, then 8, was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. He is doing well, though he may eventually need a transplant.
For her, the reward is more than the possibility of glory.
"I've made so many friends competitively eating," she said, adding, "Nobody else that I know is doing anything this cool."
For Mr. Thomas, the Canadian champion, it's about the thrill of "that raw competition," as he describes it -- "that feeling of just being able to push past yourself."
On a Monday in early June, he spent the day fasting in preparation for the next day's practice. "Obviously, I would rather be able to eat with my family," but greatness requires sacrifice.
This year is particularly tricky: He is getting married exactly one week before Coney.
"I'm trying to balance, you know, life and hot dogs," Mr. Thomas said. "You're definitely not living a necessarily normal life."

For a Star, A New Job: Labor Boss: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The model-turned-actress-turned-businesswoman is the new president of Actors' Equity. In an interview, she explained what she's doing there.
Brooke Shields has a new office. It's empty, and she hasn't figured out how she wants to furnish it, or even how often she'll be there, but it's a sign of her new and unexpected status, as president of Actors' Equity Association, the labor union representing theater actors and stage managers in the United States.
Shields's candidacy was a surprise, even to herself. But when Kate Shindle, who had led the union for nine years, announced in April that she was stepping down, Shields's music director suggested she consider the opening, and soon enough, she had tossed her hat in the ring, and in May she won the vote by members, defeating two more-seasoned labor activists. She's already led her first meeting of the union's council, and came away realizing she has a lot to learn, starting with parliamentary procedure.
Shields, of course, is one of those people who has been famous for so long, and in so many ways, that even she can't remember a different time. She was a childhood model, a preteen movie star, a sex object and an icon of beauty, all before she went off to college (Princeton, thank you very much). In the years since, she has acted onscreen and onstage, has written books, has spoken widely, particularly about depression, and has become a symbol and a subject for an evolving discussion about how women and girls have been sexualized by the entertainment and fashion industries.
She has had five roles on Broadway, each time replacing a principal in an already-running show ("Grease," "Chicago," "Cabaret," "Wonderful Town" and "The Addams Family"). She has also performed occasionally at regional theaters ("The Exorcist" at the Geffen in Los Angeles, for example) and Off Broadway (in the star vehicles "Love Letters," "The Vagina Monologues," and "Love, Loss, and What I Wore," among others).
Now, at 59, she is thinking a lot about middle age. She is recovering from a foot surgery that attracted attention when she wore Crocs (yellow, matching her dress) to the Tony Awards. She has just started a new beauty business, Commence, with hair-care products developed for women over 40; she is writing another book, also aging-focused; and she is seeking new ways to harness the celebrity she can never shed. That's where Equity comes in -- she says actors and stage managers were extraordinarily supportive of her when she needed to jump quickly into an unfamiliar show. Now she wants to give back.
Over lunch at B'artusi, an Italian restaurant in the West Village, she talked about her time in theater, and her crash course as a labor leader. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
How's the foot?
It's both feet. It's going to be OK. This is my sixth surgery. I really blew my feet out on Broadway, from dancing in shows -- being thrown in, with no training and raked stages and jamming my feet into the shoes and abusing them. I'm sure it's hereditary too -- it's probably one more thing I can blame my mother for.
You just started a company, you're acting, and the Equity presidency doesn't pay. Why add this position to the mix?
There's something that I grapple with and have struggled with my entire life: being a public persona. You have this thing you have to live with, and it's constant. So how do I turn it into something I don't resent? How do I use Brooke Shields -- that thing that is separate from me, that's a job, and is a commodity of some sort -- to make a difference for a community that's given nothing but love and acceptance to me when it was not cool to cast somebody who had zero Broadway training? My experience with Broadway, and regional theater, and Off Broadway, is this welcoming community. Those are the people that had my back.
Union activism is new for you.
This is going to be a huge learning curve for me. My first time chairing a meeting was something out of Monty Python. I hadn't learned the vernacular. Robert's Rules? I'll get to know them! But if that's my weakest place, then I'm OK, 'cause I can learn it, or someone who can do it better can do it and I can sit right by them.
You don't like conflict?
That's going to be hard for me. In this stage of my life, I'm letting go of the tug of war rope. I don't like to fight; I like to discuss.
But you've taken a job where you're going to have to ask producers for things they don't want to give. It's adversarial.
I'm ready. I've had to do it in my company -- letting people go, saying no. That's a skill to practice and learn.
The union just announced a strike against developmental work, saying negotiations were not making progress. What's the issue?
People aren't being compensated fairly.
Also, Disney's theme park performers just voted to unionize with Equity.
We have to figure out what they want in their contracts, and then we have to put forward people who can be good in that negotiation.
What's your sense of how theater is doing?
It's not fully recovered, obviously, from the pandemic. But it's really great to see how many new shows there were. There's something for everybody. You can have a "Merrily" and a "Stereophonic" and an "Illinoise" and "Appropriate" and "Mother Play." It's refreshing that it's not one note.
Something I often hear from readers is that they wonder why there can't be more streaming of staged shows.
That's a tricky one. The part of theater that's theater is being in person. There's a different performance every night.
What's the first show you remember seeing?
My mom took me to "The Fantasticks" and then Mummenschanz. Those were the big ones. And then it was "Jesus Christ Superstar." I was 9 when I saw "Grease" on Broadway and during the preshow there was a hula hoop contest and the winner of the hula hoop contest would get to meet the cast. By the grace of something, I ended up winning it. And my mom, from that day on, whenever I had a moment of doubt, she would say, "Remember the hula hoop."
And when was the first time you performed onstage?
I was in one scene in "After the Fall" [a 1974 teleplay]. I walk on, I go sit on Christopher Plummer's lap, and then I walk off. I was like 8.
You were always doing film and commercial work. Did you do theater at college?
I did every Triangle Show [The Princeton Triangle Club is a musical comedy troupe] in college. I tried out for the dance company, and I didn't get in my freshman year. That summer I took four or five dance classes a day. I went back and got into the dance company.
Are you going to continue to act while leading the union?
As long as I'm wanted. I've got a couple of things right now that I'm working on. Netflix did really well with the last movie that I did. I have a show in development. What would be ideal is to be on a show here in New York because then I could do it all. And never sleep.
What do you want your legacy to be?
I hope I'm able to carry through many of the little changes that can make a bigger difference, and that I leave the association feeling kinder and more inclusive and not angry or fractured.

Kafka Pals, Monsters, Hockey Humor and More: [Review]

Full text: The return of "Babylon Berlin" was the international TV news of the week, but here are five other recent series to check out.
The long-awaited American premiere of a new season of the German hit "Babylon Berlin" was the big news this week in the realm of international television series. But interesting shows from other countries arrive on an almost daily basis. Here are five recent series to check out.
'All This I Will Give to You'
This six-episode mini-series on MHz Choice is a lot like a British country-house mystery, except that it's French. So the matriarch of the aristocratic family visited by murder is even colder and more controlling, her out-of-control second son is an even more dire cokehead, and the food looks edible. Also, everyone is better looking than they would be in a British series, particularly the artisanally scruffy husband (David Kammenos) of the suspiciously dead eldest son, who kept the husband a secret from his family and the family a secret from his husband. (To stir the cultural pot further, the series is based on a novel set in Galicia by Dolores Redondo, the popular Spanish mystery writer.)
Viewers weary of the variously arch or dreary contrivances of most modern American thriller mini-series may appreciate the straightforward traditionalism of "All This I Will Give to You," which has enough narrative pull to overcome the usual fits of melodrama that break out as the mystery nears solving. Kammenos's Manuel, shocked by the discovery of his husband's hidden life and disgusted by his new in-laws, is a testy, twitchy, holier-than-thou pain in the derrière for more than half the show, which is a nice change of pace. And the camaraderie that slowly develops between him and a retired cop with a personal interest in the husband's death is nicely drawn.
'Kafka'
This German mini-series demonstrates that, even in an era of consolidation, distinctive shows still sneak in through the side door of the streaming business, in this case via ChaiFlicks, which specializes in Jewish-themed content. (The fourth of six episodes premiered this week.) The series takes a meta-fictional, Wes Anderson-ish approach to the life of the writer Franz Kafka (Joel Basman) -- it moves back and forth in time and among Kafka's acquaintances, looking for crucial moments, and characters break the fourth wall to reinforce or angrily disagree with the narrator's observations.
Each of the six episodes focuses on a different character from Kafka's life, showing us what it was like to be the best friend, the lover or the much-maligned father. Stars of central European culture show up, some played by actors familiar to American audiences from "Babylon Berlin" (Lars Eidinger as Rilke, Christian Friedel as Franz Werfel, Liv Lisa Fries as Milena Jesenská). Some viewers may feel that the dryly humorous peak-TV approach undersells the seriousness of Kafka's work and the momentousness of the times he lived in, but "Kafka" is never less than entertaining.
'Kaiju No. 8'
If the modern Godzilla and King Kong franchise films just wear you out, this sprightly anime series about a not-so-giant monster makes for a good palate cleanser. The hero, Hibino, is a worker on a kaiju cleanup crew -- he and his co-workers do the seriously gross work of disassembling and disposing of vanquished beasts -- who dreams of battling kaiju himself as a member of Japan's defense force. When he mysteriously gains the ability to turn into a human-scaled but still powerful monster, the transformation is life-changing in the best and worst ways.
The show, based on a manga and made by the animation studio Production I.G ("Ghost in the Shell"), is a coming-of-age story -- the split between Hibino's competing identities could not be more stark. It is also a comrades-in-arms drama: An incoming class of defense force recruits, including Hibino, go through training and their first battles together, developing the loyalties and jealousies that will come into play as his secrets are gradually revealed. It is lighthearted and paper-thin, in the manner of most products of the anime industry, but it's at the smarter and funnier end of the spectrum. The finale of the 12-episode season will arrive Saturday on Crunchyroll.
'Shoresy'
A spinoff of the Canadian series "Letterkenny," which ran for 12 seasons, "Shoresy" takes a similar sitcom-as-eccentric-art-object approach. Its premise resembles that of the raucous hockey comedy "Slap Shot," but in form it is an absurdist collage of non sequiturs, impenetrable inside jokes, ritualized repetition, hilariously specific trash talk and bespoke profanity. It celebrates sports clichés in ways that render them ridiculous; where "Slap Shot" was a cautionary tale about the American celebration of violence, "Shoresy" is a fond sendup of a Canadian insistence on indomitability that is both admirable and absurd.
In Season 3, which premiered last week on Hulu, Shoresy (played by the show's creator, Jared Keeso) battles injuries, depression and a suspension (which inspires a laser-sharp "Slap Shot" reference) as he tries to lead the semipro Sudbury Bulldogs to victory in the national tournament. In its satirical portrait of the provincial hockey scene -- including blanket news coverage, vicious YouTube commentary and the abundance of conspicuously attractive women surrounding the team in every capacity, including management -- the show takes the game very seriously and not seriously at all.
'Teasing Master Takagi-san'
The "Teasing Master" franchise encompasses the original manga (more than 12 million copies in circulation), three seasons of anime, an animated film, a video game and this live-action series, which premiered in March on Netflix. (A live-action film came out last month in Japan.) That's a lot of product for a story about a middle-school boy and the classmate who inventively, ceaselessly and mercilessly makes fun of him. He has a huge crush on her, of course, but his obsession with getting back at her -- a project that only leads to repeated humiliation -- allows him to ignore those inconvenient emotions. For a few episodes, anyway.
"Teasing Master Takagi-san" is, by American standards, slow and simple, even for a show aimed at least in part at younger viewers. But it is cute -- kawaii, in the Japanese idiom -- to an almost medicinal degree. You can feel your muscles unclenching and your arteries unclogging as you watch. The young stars, Yuki Kaji as the boy, Nishikata, and especially Rie Takahashi as Takagi, enact bashfulness, mischief and awkward attraction without self-consciousness. Their performances, and the show's placid affect, do not vary much across eight episodes, and that (despite some obligatory cliffhanger plotting) is the point -- it's not about the build, it's about the wallow.

Her Gothic Garden Is Something to Die For: [Style Desk]

Full text: Black flowers, spiky branches, poisonous plants -- gorgeous, ghastly gardens are sprouting up across the country.
Chloe Hurst dons a black veil to keep the bugs out of her eyes while planting flowers that would be at home in a Tim Burton film: black hero tulips, New York Night hellebores and black mamba petunias.
She sees her garden as a reflection of herself. "I'm a Scorpio, so I've always been spooky," said Ms. Hurst, a 29-year-old graphic designer. She said she began reconnecting with her earlier emo days through landscaping after purchasing her home in Ottawa, Canada, six years ago.
Many of her plants are dark red or purple. Ms. Hurst also has a potted vegetable garden with the darkest varieties of eggplants, bell peppers and not-so-green beans.
Between Billie Eilish's jet-black locks to the success of "Wednesday" on Netflix and the forthcoming "Beetlejuice" sequel in September, all things gothic are in the air -- and in the ground. Searches for "goth garden" nearly doubled on Google this month from last, and the marketing firm Garden Media Group clocked "goth gardening" as a trend in its 2024 trends report. On TikTok, gardeners like Ms. Hurst rack up hundreds of thousands of likes when sharing their goth gardens and offering tips on how to grow one.
Over the last few years, so-called gothic seeds have appeared to become more popular, too. In 2018, Ed Hume Seeds introduced a gothic vegetable packet with spiky artichokes and bull's blood beet that remains a top seller, according to the company. Hudson Valley Seed Company, which began selling a goth flower mix with Dracula celosia and black knight scabiosa in 2020, said they had noticed an increase in sales of the product this year.
"There's a renewed interest in making one's garden fit one's personality and vibe," said Kelsea Hume, who manages Hume Seeds' social media accounts. "It's wonderful to watch new generations of gardeners express themselves."
Just as there may be no one type of "goth" person, there is more than one interpretation of what a gothic garden entails.
In Wichita Falls, Texas, Felicia Garza says her garden is an extension of her "darker soul." Ms. Garza, a 39-year-old social media manager, weaves eerie plants into her otherwise colorful garden. "I wasn't feeling it at first," said Ms. Garza of her foray into gardening. "Then I came across all these other darker plants and I just fell in love with them."
Ms. Garza added other goth elements to her garden's décor: Black vintage lamps hang from wrought iron-adorned trellises, which are also black and surround raised beds in the center of the garden. But she said she also had "girlie" elements, like sun catchers and a pink flamingo lawn ornament.
When Shannon Crosby, 39, began planting her backyard garden six years ago, she had to work with the humid, hot climate of Plant City, Fla. She couldn't rely on black plants alone in the subtropical climate, so instead she incorporated a variety of macabre elements. One section of her yard is dedicated to poisonous plants like angel trumpets, cassava and foxgloves. (That section is fenced in to prevent wildlife from eating the plants; she also noted that she did not have children or pets.)
Then there are spiky plants, such as the silk floss tree, which Ms. Crosby, who owns a plant nursery, described as "super punk rock."
An angel statue, which she purchased broken from a secondhand shop, adds to the overall effect. "It's like an old, decrepit Victorian garden that's in ruin," Ms. Crosby said. "I call it beautiful decay." Other items include skulls, a flying witch spinner and solar-powered spider lights.
These types of gardens can set the stage for moody gatherings. In Ms. Hurst's Ottawa garden, she occasionally wheels out a cart with teapots for an evening tea party with friends. "You never think to see those colors in nature, so having that element makes it more mysterious," she said.
When it comes to planting a gothic garden, Daryl Lindsey, a landscape designer in Salt Lake City, urged gardeners to use as many native plants as possible: "The ecological benefits of native plants are massive for the health of the soil, for water conservation and for the benefit of wildlife."
Something like black mondo grass -- a purple-black grass with thin blades that sprout out like a spider -- might be aesthetically pleasing, but it can take over a garden, she said. "I would recommend, in those cases, that somebody puts them in some cool Victorian topiary pot," Ms. Lindsey added.
She also suggested planting white flowers beside a dark shrub like black lace elderberry for contrast: "Then you actually can appreciate how moody and goth-y those dark plants even are."
In gardens, as in life, there's a natural push and pull between life and death.
"I love day and night, life and death," Ms. Crosby said. "I feel like it's all kind of a metaphor -- everything that once was returned to the ground creates new life."

Best Sellers Without The Hassle: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Emily Henry has never been on a book tour or done a traditional bookstore reading. She's not on TikTok. Her Instagram features book covers and an occasional giveaway; there are no closet tours, rescue cats or elegantly plated snacks.
Henry doesn't want to be, as she puts it, a "writer slash mini-celebrity." She's a romance novelist, full stop. It's an uncommon, maybe even gutsy, approach in the era of the all-access pass, when readers of popular fiction expect a level of quasi intimacy with favorite writers.
Nevertheless, Henry -- "EmHen" to fans -- has launched five No. 1 best-sellers in four years. Her latest blockbuster, "Funny Story," has been on the best-seller list for nine weeks. In its first two months, the book racked up almost 60,000 customer reviews on Goodreads and sparked a cottage industry of T-shirts, sweatshirts, candles, bookmarks and stickers.
All told, Henry has sold seven million copies of her books in the United States since 2020. Three of her novels are in development to become films. On Tuesday, Henry announced that another, "Happy Place," is going to be a series on Netflix.
"It's been kind of a whirlwind," Henry said. "The last four years have felt like they were 35 seconds long."
Chatting with Henry outside Coffee Emporium in leafiest Cincinnati, it was hard to imagine her retreating into quietude. She presented as an instant connector, parrying substantive conversation while perusing a menu that included a Brew Hoo, a Flying Piggie and an Orange Jillius. And while we're in the vicinity of old school mall food courts: Imagine Elisabeth Shue in "Adventures in Babysitting" crossed with Carly Simon circa "You're So Vain" and you have Henry's blond, brown-eyed warmth.
"I really like people," Henry said, over the roar of neighborhood lawn mowers. "When I'm with a big group, my tendency is to get louder. But afterward I'll drive home in utter silence. Like, I'm not talking to anyone for several days."
Henry got her start as an author of novels for young adults, pounding out her debut, "The Love That Split the World," in the mornings before reporting to work as a technical writer for a phone, internet and television provider. She was responsible for the inscrutable language atop cable boxes; it wasn't fun. Henry quit as soon as she collected her inaugural book advance -- a modest one, she noted -- then wrote or coauthored three more books for younger audiences.
Eventually, Henry said, "I got to a point in Y.A. where I felt used up. I didn't have anything left to say."
Her first book for adults, "Beach Read," was a reset -- a chance to write without the stress of a ready-made audience. Many writers would see this as the best kind of problem to have, but Henry now advises aspiring writers to enjoy the privacy of working on a project without built-in readers attached: "You never really get back to that exact joy."
"Beach Read" came out on May 19, 2020, a week or so before the Covid death toll in the U.S. surpassed 100,000. In-person author events seemed as foolhardy as eating a hamburger in a restaurant. This was not a fortuitous time for humanity, let alone a debut-ish novel meant to be enjoyed on the sand.
But, while many public beaches remained closed, "Beach Read" blew up on TikTok. Cooped-up daughters pressed it on distracted mothers (present company included). The book sailed onto the best-seller list, where it remained for more than a year.
"A lot of people were looking for something that was going to bring brightness, comfort and warmth and also not shy away from grief," Amanda Bergeron said. She's Henry's editor at Berkley. "'Beach Read' was doing all those things."
It set a precedent that held through the publications of Henry's next three novels -- "People We Meet on Vacation" (2021), "Book Lovers" (2022) and "Happy Place" (2023). Sales grew, book after book, while Henry stayed at home in Cincinnati.
"I think if I had toured, if 'Beach Read' had not come out during the pandemic, the team would have thought, 'Oh, sales are happening because you're touring, so now you have to keep touring,"' Henry said. "Because everything was working without me touring, they've been flexible with me wanting to be a homebody."
Early on, there was a push to get Henry on TikTok. "I was like, 'No,"' she said. "When Instagram dies, I die with it. That's my last social media."
Henry added, "I started dreaming of writing before social media existed. I didn't know what any of my favorite writers looked like. I never would have cared or even thought about going to an event for them. It's strange to dream of writing when it's one thing, then come of age when it's something totally different."
Henry, Bergeron and Danielle Keir, an assistant director of publicity at Berkley, credit Sanny Chiu's modern, bright, upmarket cover designs as drivers of the books' successes. Chiu takes particular care with colors, spines and body language of characters.
With "Funny Story," Chiu struggled to find the perfect pose for Henry's main character. Daphne, a jilted children's librarian, looked "a little bit arrogant at first," Chiu said. In her ultimate incarnation, she strikes the right balance of intelligence, wariness and "I'll drink to that." At Henry's request, Chiu outfitted Daphne's free-spirited L.I. (that's romance lingo for love interest) in a pair of yellow Crocs.
Was there an expectation that Henry would tour on behalf of these opposites turned kindred spirits? Other authors are on the road; signing lines are back.
"We're always exploring it," Keir said. "But ultimately we're focusing on interesting and creative ways to promote Emily and her novels and to engage fans and reach new readers."
In other words, there might have been a conversation, but no tour was scheduled.
Henry appeared on three national television shows -- "Good Morning America," "Today" and "Tamron Hall." Taking a page from fantasy authors, who often host late night release parties, Berkley helped facilitate more than 200 "Funny Story" launch celebrations at bookstores across the country. Over 50 of them happened at midnight, and more than 20 venues sold out.
"Fantasy readers are a class of their own, in terms of devotion, but we sold out in three days," Leah Koch said. She's co-owner of The Ripped Bodice, which specializes in romance.
On April 22, more than 100 enthusiasts flocked to the store's Brooklyn outpost. There were custom chocolates and themed cocktails. There were page annotation tabs in the "Funny Story" color palette and art prints inspired by Henry's Michigan lakeside setting.
And suddenly, strolling into the crowd like yet another beaming guest, there was Henry herself. She wore beach waves, white Mary Janes and a pale pink dress printed with martini glasses.
In a video of the surprise appearance, readers are ecstatic, ebullient and hellbent on capturing the moment on their own phones. One fan shrieked "Oh my god, oh my god" in disbelief, scanning the crowd as if to confirm that her eyes aren't playing tricks.
"Hi, I'm Emily," Henry said, to the tune of reverent mayhem. She looked triumphant, if not completely at ease.
"There were people I recognized through years of seeing them promote my books on social media," Henry said. "That was really special and sweet. But the really nice thing about my readership is, it's a thing outside of me. It's this community where people make friendships."
The hardcover of "Funny Story" sold 850 percent more copies in its first four weeks than the paperback original of "Beach Read" did in the same amount of time, despite costing nearly twice as much. In late May, the book was still front and center at several Cincinnati bookstores.
But if anyone at Coffee Emporium recognized Henry, they didn't break out their cameras. When she left to catch a ride home with her husband, Henry didn't strut like a V.I.P. or a local bigwig or even someone whose books draw readers to bookstores at midnight. Instead, Henry had the purposeful stride of a writer, ready to get back to work.

Trump Film Is Closer To a Release: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "The Apprentice," a dramatized origin story about Donald J. Trump, has faced fierce criticism from the former president and his allies.
Hollywood executives love to characterize themselves as fearless. The truth is that they spend most of their time trying to minimize risk.
It's why theaters are clogged with vacuous sequels. It's why so many Hollywood power players hide behind P.R. people. And it's why all of the big movie studios and streaming services -- and, in fact, most indie film companies -- declined to distribute "The Apprentice," a dramatized origin story about Donald J. Trump that the former president has called "malicious defamation" and showered with cease-and-desist letters.
But the movie business still has at least one wildcatter: Tom Ortenberg.
Mr. Ortenberg, 63, and his Briarcliff Entertainment are pushing to complete a deal to acquire "The Apprentice" for wide release in theaters in the United States in September or early October -- close enough to the presidential election to bask in its heat, but far enough away to avoid final-stretch media overload. Briarcliff's pursuit of the $ 16 million film was confirmed by five people involved with the sale process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private negotiation.
"Tom's got more courage than most people in Hollywood combined," said Stephen Galloway, the dean of Chapman University's film school. "His interest in this kind of movie involves business, of course. He sees money to be made by leveraging millions of dollars in free publicity. But part of it is wanting to do his bit. He's liberal and cares about social issues."
Hurdles remain, the people cautioned. "Apprentice" producers cobbled together the money to make the movie from various sources. One was Kinematics, an upstart film company backed by Dan Snyder, the former Washington Commanders owner -- and a Trump supporter. Kinematics, which invested about $ 5 million, would need to sign off on the Briarcliff deal and has balked, calling the offer subpar, according to the five people involved in the sale process. The Kinematics snag was reported earlier by a Puck newsletter.
So producers have put together a package to buy out Kinematics at a premium. The sides are now haggling over terms, including the timing of payment.
Briarcliff will need to move quickly to engineer a fall release: Marketing materials must be prepared; theaters must be booked (and some might refuse). "The Apprentice" has reached distribution deals for Canada, Europe and parts of Asia. Once theaters overseas begin playing the film (sometime this fall), it will become available on global pirating sites, reducing its value to a U.S. distributor.
Mr. Ortenberg declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the film and its lead producers also declined to comment, as did Kinematics.
Over his four-decade movie career, Mr. Ortenberg has repeatedly championed movies deemed too hot to handle by the Hollywood establishment. Not all of his bets have paid off. But some have -- spectacularly.
In 2004, after Disney refused to release "Fahrenheit 9/11," Michael Moore's flame-throwing documentary about the George W. Bush administration and the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, it was Mr. Ortenberg, then president of a fledgling Lionsgate, who picked up the film. When theaters in conservative pockets of the country refused to play it, Mr. Ortenberg went on the attack.
"What these chains are doing is a horrible precedent for the movie business, and it shows exactly how fragile the First Amendment is," Mr. Ortenberg told The New York Times at the time. "Fahrenheit 9/11," which counted Harvey Weinstein as a producer, collected $ 222 million in global ticket sales, or about $ 368 million in today's dollars, the most ever for a documentary. The documentary cost less than $ 10 million to make.
Mr. Ortenberg's résumé also includes Kevin Smith's "Dogma," a profane 1999 religious satire that was greeted by protests, boycotts and death threats, and Oliver Stone's "W," a comedic 2008 skewering of Mr. Bush. Mr. Ortenberg was also behind "Spotlight," the Oscar-winning newspaper drama from 2015 about the Roman Catholic Church's cover-up of sexual abuse by priests.
In 2020, Briarcliff distributed "The Dissident," about the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and attempted cover-up by the Saudi government. In that case, too, Mr. Ortenberg stepped in after Hollywood companies balked at distributing it. "The Dissident" was a flop in limited theatrical release, but found a modest audience on home video.
"The Apprentice" debuted to mostly favorable reviews at the Cannes Film Festival last month and dramatizes Mr. Trump's origin story, focusing on his rise in New York real estate in the 1970s and '80s and mentorship by Roy Cohn, the unscrupulous power broker. Sebastian Stan, known for his role as Bucky Barnes in Marvel superhero movies, plays Mr. Trump. Jeremy Strong portrays the pugnacious Cohn, complete with burnt-bacon tan. Mr. Strong, an Emmy winner for HBO's "Succession," recently won a Tony Award for his performance in "An Enemy of the People" on Broadway.
Briarcliff plans to position both actors as Oscar contenders, according to the people involved with the sale.
"The Apprentice" also stars Maria Bakalova ("Borat Subsequent Moviefilm") as Ivana Trump. One incendiary scene shows Mr. Trump throwing her to the ground and assaulting her. In real life, she accused him of rape in a deposition related to their 1991 divorce. She later disavowed the claim, saying she did not mean rape in the "criminal sense." She died in 2022.
Kinematics, citing potential legal liability, pushed the film's director, Ali Abbasi, to remove or trim down the already brief scene before the Cannes premiere; Mr. Abbasi refused. Other scenes in the film depict Mr. Trump as hooked on speedlike diet pills and having fat surgically suctioned.
Last month, Mr. Trump threatened to sue to block the film's release. "This garbage is pure fiction which sensationalizes lies that have long been debunked," Steven Cheung, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, told reporters at the time.
A lawsuit from Mr. Trump would cause headaches for Briarcliff and the producers, but courts -- citing First Amendment protections -- have consistently sided with filmmakers in similar cases over the years.
The lead producers of "The Apprentice" are Amy Baer, the founding chief executive of CBS Films and a former Sony Pictures executive, and Daniel Bekerman, a scrappy indie producer with credits like "The Witch" (2015). "The Apprentice" was written by Gabriel Sherman, who is known for "The Loudest Voice in the Room," a best-selling 2014 biography of Roger Ailes, the disgraced political operative and Fox News leader.
Companies that passed on "The Apprentice" declined to comment or did not respond to queries. They included Focus Features, Sony, Searchlight, Netflix, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Amazon's Prime Video and A24.
In conversations with sales agents for the film, the uninterested companies justified their stance with various explanations, according to the people involved with distribution negotiations for the movie. A couple of potential distributors thought the film was good but not good enough to risk the almost guaranteed blowback -- not just from Mr. Trump's lawyers but from the broader MAGA world.
Other potential distributors worried about regulatory retribution from Mr. Trump should he be re-elected. During his first term, Mr. Trump's Justice Department tried to block AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner, which owned CNN. The move was widely seen as retaliation for CNN coverage that angered Mr. Trump.
The box office prospects for "The Apprentice" are unclear. Sequels have been succeeding, but original movies -- dramas especially -- have been struggling to break through. Politically minded films have largely moved to streaming. "The Apprentice" could also fall in a chasm, with Trump supporters boycotting and liberal audiences repulsed.
"I have a hard time seeing any red-collared American going to see it," said Mr. Galloway of Chapman University. "Will others want to pay 20 bucks to consume even more Trump? Maybe. Maybe not."

Familiar Olympics Voice Will Be A.I. Generated: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: NBC will offer a customized, daily highlight reel with A.I.-generated narration that sounds like the longtime broadcaster.
The Olympics have ancient beginnings. Now, they will also have a dose of the latest technology.
This year, highlights from the Summer Olympics will be brought to you by artificial intelligence -- and more specifically, the A.I.-generated narration of Al Michaels.
Executives at NBCUniversal and the streaming service Peacock said on Wednesday that a customized, daily highlight reel for the Olympics would be available to streaming subscribers. The reel will feature the voice of Mr. Michaels, the 79-year-old American broadcaster, who first covered the Olympics decades ago.
Mr. Michaels, however, will not be holing up in a broadcast booth each night to briefly summarize the dozens of Olympic events that took place. Instead, Peacock's program has been trained from Mr. Michaels's NBC clips -- he joined the network in 2006 and was its longtime "Sunday Night Football" announcer -- to formulate coherent, realistic-sounding sentences, which "will provide his signature expertise and elocution," the company said.
Mr. Michaels granted approval for the use of his voice.
"When I was approached about this, I was skeptical but obviously curious," Mr. Michaels said in a statement issued by the company. "Then I saw a demonstration detailing what they had in mind. I said, 'I'm in."'
It does raise a key question, one that recalls Mr. Michaels's most famous Olympic call: Do NBCUniversal executives believe in miracles?
NBC has been exclusively broadcasting the Olympics in the United States since 1996, and the network frequently finds itself subject to intense public scrutiny for its coverage of the Games.
Handing the keys to A.I. adds a new risk to the mix: A.I.-generated Al Michaels is almost sure to draw interest given its novelty. And there has been no shortage of tales of embarrassing errors, face-plants and slightly alarming hallucinations as A.I. has burst into widespread use over the past 18 months.
Subscribers who want the daily Peacock highlight reel will be able choose the Olympic events that interest them most, and the types of highlights they want to see, such as viral clips, gold medalists or elimination events.
From there, Peacock's A.I. machines will get to work each evening cranking out the most notable moments and putting them together in a tidy customized package. Mr. Michaels's recreated voice will be piped over the reels. (Humans will make quality control checks on the A.I. highlight reels.)
NBCUniversal officials said they were anticipating seven million different variations of customized highlights throughout the games. The highlights will show up in the Peacock app for users who sign up for it.
Brian Roberts, the chairman of Comcast, NBCUniversal's parent, presented the new Al Michaels clip at an event to introduce A.I.-Al (officially called "Your Daily Olympic Recap on Peacock").
The germ of the idea, Mr. Roberts said, was born from a meeting months ago when Comcast and NBCUniversal executives said: "What could we do with A.I.? How can we leverage A.I. purely for fun and for good?"
After Mr. Roberts showed a demonstration, he added, "we pushed ourselves to invent and innovate and to develop something better again and again."
The Olympics come at a crucial time for NBCUniversal. Peacock lost nearly $ 3 billion last year and lags far behind rivals like Netflix or Disney+ in terms of total subscribers. But the streaming service has had strong subscriber growth over the last year, and has been leaning on sports to help get it there. In January, Peacock showed the first streaming-only National Football League playoff game.
The Olympics, which begin on July 26, provide it an entirely different test. In addition to daytime and prime-time broadcasts on NBC and a series of cable networks, Peacock will play a prominent role in the company's Olympic coverage, and will stream every Olympic event.
Kelly Campbell, the president of Peacock, called the new A.I. tool a "breakthrough" in an interview, and said that if it worked, it could soon populate the streaming platform in other ways -- perhaps Andy Cohen A.I. recaps for Bravo shows, she said.
"This version, to me, I want to do this for every sporting event and show we have on Peacock," she said. "This is something that truly differentiates. We are in a sea of sameness, and to have something that actually sets you apart is really cool."

Full text: After two strokes, the stand-up has recovered enough to make a new special. If anything, his health crises have sharpened his humor.
When the stand-up comic Keith Robinson was 10 years old growing up in Philadelphia, his father was stabbed to death in a bar. Sitting in the restaurant above the Comedy Cellar in New York on a recent weekday afternoon, Robinson explained what happened dispassionately, adding that the killer died soon after.
"He got shot accidentally on purpose," he told me, flashing a mischievous grin and saying nothing more.
This is the kind of story that Robinson, 60, likes to tell, one with prickly uncomfortable humor and some tough-guy swagger. But Robinson is currently at the center of a different kind of dramatic narrative, less HBO, more Lifetime channel: He had two strokes in four years, robbing him temporarily of speech and mobility; then, against the odds, he recovered enough to return to the stage.
Robinson has been a fixture at the Cellar for three decades, as much a part of the fabled club as the microphone and the hummus. A comedy Zelig, he did stand-up on "Star Search" in the 1980s; was a regular on the Comedy Central show "Tough Crowd," inspired by the table at the Cellar where Robinson, Colin Quinn and others hung out and bickered; and even wrote on the aborted third season of "Chappelle's Show." He has been a mentor to many comics, especially stand-ups from Philadelphia, most famously Kevin Hart who produced Robinson's last special a decade ago.
When Amy Schumer heard Robinson's difficulty speaking after his second stroke, in 2020, "I thought he was completely done," she told me by phone. Now she is the executive producer of his new special, "Different Strokes" (Netflix), a jarringly unsentimental take on his health crisis that tells what could be a feel-good story with cranky irreverence.
Onstage, Robinson says that facing death taught him this lesson: "If there's someone you wanted to punch, punch them now."
He walks slowly but speaks rapidly, sometimes slurring his words. His right arm is bent at an angle, but when I ask if it's immobile, he slowly adjusts it, motioning, with limited range, like a boxer getting ready to shadowbox. Ever cheerful, he told me that he was thinking of a specific person in that joke about punching someone -- adding that his lack of action still bothers him. "When you think too much," he said, "you can't be a gangster."
It's become common for comedians to turn tragedy into jokes. But Robinson isn't looking for tears or applause. And nothing annoys him more than pity. When he dropped his cane during the taping (Schumer walked onstage to retrieve it for him), he poked fun at the crowd for making sounds of sympathy.
"I don't like 'aww,"' he told me, referring to the audience's expression of concern. "I just want laughs. 'Aww' irks me. 'Aww' irks my spirit."
Robinson isn't just blustering. He is concerned enough about getting cheap approval that he makes jokes intended to alienate, he said. If an audience member doesn't laugh, he points his cane at them and says: "You don't like Black handicapped people?" One time a woman responded by bursting into tears. The club comped her ticket.
With the changes to his movement and speech, Robinson's stand-up has a new gravity and pace. After considerable speech therapy, he can tell jokes but must work harder to be understood. "Everything has to be more precise now," he said, comparing his shift to that of an athletic quarterback who can get out of trouble by becoming a pocket passer. "Everything counts. I can't depend on movement."
Wanda Sykes, an old friend from before they moved to New York at the same time, took him on tour with her when he was first returning to the stage in 2022. She said by email that his material had become more personal: "He's opened up."
Some of his funniest jokes are short, like when he asks God why he let these strokes happen to him. He pauses, flashes a glance that suggested a lifetime of occasional sin and says, "Oh yeah."
After his second stroke, which was far more debilitating than the first, Robinson briefly thought he would have to quit performing and become a comedy writer. Chris Rock hired him to help with his recent special. But Robinson missed being onstage, hanging out with comics and, most of all, "busting chops," which, it's fair to say, is his love language.
Sykes recalled how early in her career she would wear a sweater that Robinson mocked, referring to it as "a comedy cape" that held all her comic powers. "He talked about me so bad that I never wore it again," Sykes said.
To hear Robinson tell it, losing the social aspect of the life of a comedian hurt as much as the physical damage from the strokes. He was put in a Covid ward in the hospital. In the kind of contrarian stance he relishes, he trash-talked nurses during our interview. "Before I got the second stroke, I would applaud for the nurses," he told me. "After the second, I wanted to throw something at them."
The most striking thing about Robinson now might be how much two strokes didn't change him. "Keith is Keith: Hasn't changed," said Noam Dworman, owner of the Cellar. "Most people would have been psychologically crushed by what he faced. He's a performer who has trouble speaking and walking. You see people get depressed when they lose their hair. And he had this grit. Nothing stopped him."
And yet, there are new worries. A fear of falling, for instance, is persistent, he said. He also displays a new attitude toward mortality. Robinson said that for awhile he just wanted to live longer than his father, who died at 35. Now, post-stroke, he puts it this way. "I used to say I want to live for three more 'Avengers' movies," he said. "Now I'm like, one and a half."

N.F.L. Fights to Protect TV Deal Power: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A class-action lawsuit over the cost of Sunday Ticket subscriptions underscored how valuable broadcast deals have been for the league's success.
A pillar of the N.F.L.'s meteoric rise over the past six decades has been its strategy of making nearly all games available mostly free to fans on national networks. The league has stuck to this approach even as Major League Baseball, the N.B.A. and other leagues moved more of their games onto cable and satellite broadcasters and subscription streaming services.
The strategy has paid off: Ninety-three of the 100 most-watched programs on television last year were N.F.L. games, according to Nielsen.
Yet N.F.L. games are not cheap and ubiquitous enough for all fans. This month, the league has been in federal court in Los Angeles fending off a class-action suit brought by millions of customers who paid for Sunday Ticket, the subscription service on DirecTV that showed all out-of-market games on Sundays.
The plaintiffs claim that the N.F.L. colluded with CBS and Fox to artificially inflate the price of the service, which cost roughly $ 300 a season, because the networks viewed Sunday Ticket as competition. The plaintiffs argue that the N.F.L. dismissed offers to create cheaper services that would have let fans buy games based on teams. They are seeking damages of $ 7 billion, which could be tripled under antitrust statutes. That could take a significant bite out the league's annual media rights, which are now worth more than $ 10 billion a year.
Some businesses might have settled for far less to avoid the risk of going to trial and facing an unpredictable jury. But the N.F.L. has taken its chances in court because it wants -- indeed needs -- to preserve the right to cut exclusive media deals on behalf of all 32 of its teams. Congress granted the N.F.L. an exemption to do so in 1961, and it has fueled the league's growth ever since.
The N.F.L. is now a $ 20 billion business, and its success is due in part to the sharing of its rights deals, which are split evenly among all 32 teams. This formula helps teams in small media markets, like the Kansas City Chiefs, compete for players with New York teams.
"This case cuts to the center of sports," said Robert Boland, who teaches sports law at Seton Hall University. "The N.F.L. did so well under its antitrust protection that the case is a testament to how powerful the N.F.L. has become."
The case, which has featured testimony by Commissioner Roger Goodell and the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, is likely to be handed over to the jury this week. Repeatedly, the case has not gone well for the plaintiffs. Last week, Judge Philip Gutierrez, in a rare display, admonished them for wasting time and complicating what he said should have been a straightforward case.
"The way you have tried this is far from simple," Gutierrez said last Tuesday. "This case has turned into 25 hours of depositions and gobbledygook."
The jury, of course, may see it differently. If the N.F.L. loses the case, it is likely to appeal, which would only prolong a case that began nearly a decade ago. At the time, Sunday Ticket aired on DirecTV, which broadcast the service for nearly 30 years. It moved to YouTube TV last year.
However the case goes, its existence says a lot about not just the dominance of the N.F.L. -- by far the biggest sports league in annual revenue -- but also how fans' expectations have changed. We live in a world of instant gratification, where viewers seek to watch whatever they want, whenever they want it, and often for little or nothing.
As millions of viewers have ditched cable and satellite TV, and subscribed to Netflix and Hulu ad hoc, the league has tried to meet fans where they are, something the streaming services also crave. A handful of games now appear exclusively on Peacock, Amazon Prime and other platforms each season. The response has been largely negative, partly because fans don't want to have to subscribe to so many streaming services just to get games.
"This is a day and age when everyone says, 'I want my things on my time, whenever I want it,"' said Phil de Picciotto, the president and founder of Octagon, a sports marketing firm. "But that's impossible for businesses to deliver," he said. "Low cost comes with mass products."
The N.F.L. was not shy in court about defending Sunday Ticket's premium pricing. The league, Goodell said, did not want to hurt CBS and Fox, which were each paying billions of dollars for their rights to show the Sunday games that were also fed to DirecTV.
"Well, it's a premium product, I think, primarily because you have access to additional games," Goodell said on the stand last week. "And that access -- you know, it can impact negatively on our broadcast networks, so broadcast networks are very concerned about the impact on them in reaching the broader audience. But I think it's a premium product because I think it's incredible content."
The plaintiffs produced evidence that ESPN had proposed cutting the price of Sunday Ticket to $ 70 and selling single-team packages. Goodell said on the stand that the league had passed on the offer because ESPN would have combined its own content with the N.F.L. games, not simply shown the games as DirecTV did.
In some ways, the business of broadcasting games has moved on from the details at question in this case. YouTube TV is entirely online, and the networks are still able to broadcast their games over the air.
Then again, YouTube has to recoup its investment, too, so consumers aren't necessarily going to get supercheap subscriptions. The plan now costs $ 350 a year, on top of the subscription to YouTube TV.

Dancing on the Eve Of Catastrophe: [Review]

Full text: The long-awaited fourth season of the cult-favorite German thriller takes place in 1931, with the Nazis not quite in power.
Far from the eyes of Emmy voters or the digital gremlins compiling streaming Top 10 lists, there is a series -- a German period drama, of all things -- that a small core of aficionados would argue is the world's best television show.
Some of their fondness may have to do with absence. It has been more than four years since a new season of "Babylon Berlin" became available in the United States. And the first three seasons, which resided formerly on Netflix, moved this year to MHz Choice, a boutique streamer of international series and films whose (unreported) subscription figures would probably constitute a good morning's uptick for Netflix.
So if you are part of the cult -- tracking the right subreddit, commiserating with a Facebook friend group of the requisite sophistication -- it is a very big deal that the 12-episode fourth season of "Babylon Berlin," shown in Germany in 2022, is finally premiering on MHz Choice in the United States on Tuesday. (To answer the immediate questions: $ 7.99 a month, seven-day free trial, and the full season will be up by July 30.)
Based on historical mystery novels by the German writer Volker Kutscher, the show is a sleek, louchely sexy blend of police procedural, love story, Freudian melodrama and expensively rendered costume epic. All of the elements (with the occasional exception of the heavy psychological symbolism) are juggled with finesse by the show's creator-writer-directors, Achim von Borries, Henk Handloegten and Tom Tykwer. (Bettine von Borries and Khyana el Bitar are also credited as writers in Season 4.)
The balls stay in the air with the mesmerizing rhythm of one of the cabaret acts at the show's fictional nightclub, Moka Efti; the effect can be, to use the favorite descriptor among "Babylon Berlin" fans, addictive. The series -- and the fourth season in particular, which has a story line involving the gathering of Berlin's criminal gangs -- has been compared to "M," the great 1931 thriller by the German director Fritz Lang. But a better comparison would be to Lang silents like "Dr. Mabuse, the Gambler" and "Spies," intricately assembled thrillers that are some of the most deluxe entertainments ever put on film.
It helps, of course, that the place and time the show inhabits are Berlin in the Weimar era of the 1920s and early '30s, a ready-made backdrop of artistic, cultural and sexual ferment in a city headed toward political and social catastrophe. The action hopscotches from police labs to the soundstages of expressionist films, from munitions factories to beer halls, from baronial manors to squalid tenements, with a studious devotion to the quality and evocativeness of costumes, sets and locations.
Season 4 jumps ahead to New Year's Eve in 1930, a little over a year after Season 3 ended amid the chaos of the stock market crash. Newsreel footage of bread lines and of angry crowds of the unemployed is used as a counterpoint to scenes of the show's characters joining in the celebrations as 1931 begins.
In a season-long motif, Charlotte Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries), the former prostitute who has worked her way onto the police homicide squad, happily dances down the street to a peppy new tune, "A Day Like Gold" (actually sung by the contemporary German jazz singer Max Raabe). Later she will compete in a dance marathon, and she will end the season hoofing to "A Day Like Gold" once again, proclaiming, "Tomorrow is tomorrow, and now is now, and now I want to dance." The obviousness of the metaphor is mitigated by our knowledge of how completely the world is about to burn.
The new season is typically replete with story lines. On the crime drama side, the murder of a civil servant spurs an investigation of the city's ringvereine, criminal gangs with connections to boxing clubs. On the social history side, Gereon Rath (Volker Bruch), the police detective and former heroin addict who is Ritter's on-and-off-again love interest, is enmeshed with the SA, the brown-shirted Nazi paramilitary.
Around those central threads, there are also plots involving a secret society carrying out extrajudicial trials and executions; Ritter's hard-boiled sister, Toni (Irene Bohm), becoming a murder suspect and going on the run; the continued tribulations of the liberal journalist Katelbach (Karl Markovics), which constitute a self-contained spy thriller; and the arrival in Berlin of an American Jewish gangster, Abraham Goldstein (Mark Ivanir), in search of a diamond stolen from his father. (The season is based on the third novel in Kutscher's series, "Goldstein.")
There is even more going on than in previous seasons (the first two were eight episodes each), and while the show is as watchable as ever, the action does not stay as sharply in focus as before -- the strands still weave together in credible and entertaining fashion, but the individual story lines do not carry the same dramatic and emotional weight. They do not demand your attention quite as insistently.
There is also an implicit question that begins to weigh on the series in the new season: What happens when the Nazis take over? As long as they remain on the outside, in conflict with the police, army and government, the universe of the show can be one in which most of the characters, most of the time, will act based on rational, relatable motives. Once the historical calculus changes, however, the dramatic calculus of the show will have to change as well, and it seems likely that the tone and structure will need to shift significantly for the show to remain believable. (A fifth season has been ordered; Kutscher's most recent novel, the ninth in the series, is set in 1937.)
The show's source material is usually referred to as the Gereon Rath series; Rath is central to the action as the lead detective in the most significant cases, and his mental trauma from his service in World War I -- he's the shattered man of the modern age -- is the running theme. But what ties the TV series together, supplying the melancholy yet irrepressible melody at its center, is Fries's performance as the indomitable Ritter, and that is especially true in Season 4. With her pixieish expressiveness, Fries is equally adept at playing a comic-book action heroine and a situationally ethical justice warrior -- a character whose fluidity suits her for the perils of her era.

'Cult of Love' to Open on Broadway This Fall: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The play will be produced by Second Stage, which is also planning an Off Broadway production of a two-character drama by Donald Margulies.
"Cult of Love," a play about a fractious holiday gathering of a Christian family, will come to Broadway this fall via Second Stage Theater, one of the four nonprofits with Broadway houses.
The announcement on Tuesday is a further sign that the current season is shaping up to be a robust one for plays, which had been considered an endangered species on Broadway, but which seem to be proliferating as the economic climate for musicals worsens.
"Cult of Love" is written by Leslye Headland, a creator of the Netflix series "Russian Doll" and the Disney+ series "The Acolyte." She has also written and directed films including "Sleeping With Other People."
The play is scheduled to begin previews Nov. 20 and to open Dec. 12 at the Hayes Theater.
"Cult of Love" is Headland's final work in a series, called "Seven Deadly Plays," that is inspired by the seven deadly sins; this one is about pride. The play was staged in 2018 at IAMA Theater Company in Los Angeles and there was a run early this year at Berkeley Repertory Theater in California. (A planned 2020 production at Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts was canceled because of the pandemic.)
The Broadway production, like the Berkeley production, will be directed by Trip Cullman. The play has 10 characters and casting has not been announced.
Second Stage also said on Tuesday that it would stage an Off Broadway production of "Lunar Eclipse," a two-character play by Donald Margulies (a Pulitzer winner for "Dinner With Friends") that had a run last year at Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, Mass.
The new production, directed by Kate Whoriskey, is to star Reed Birney (a Tony winner for "The Humans") and Lisa Emery as a long-married couple. It is to begin previews Oct. 9 and to open Oct. 30 at the Tony Kiser Theater.
"Lunar Eclipse" is expected to be Second Stage's final production in that space, which the company is exiting at the end of the year, citing financial considerations. Second Stage expects to present its spring season at the Pershing Square Signature Center while it explores options for an Off Broadway home.

Full text: President Joe Biden and former President Donald J. Trump debate for the first time this campaign cycle. Country artists perform their hit songs.
For those who still enjoy a cable subscription, here is a selection of cable and network TV shows, movies and specials that broadcast this week, June 24-30. Details and times are subject to change.
Monday
BEAT BOBBY FLAY starting at 9 p.m. on Food. There is truly every type of cooking show you could imagine on television these days. But in rarely any of them does a world famous chef flex his cooking muscle alongside contestants. That is exactly what Bobby Flay does here. Each episode features two chefs going head-to-head cooking something of Flay's choosing. Whichever chef wins that round then gets to compete against Flay himself, this time with the competitor's signature dish.
Tuesday
CMA FEST 8 p.m. on ABC. This year's country music extravaganza took place in early June, and now it is coming to the small screen. Jelly Roll and Ashley McBryde are set to host the special, showcasing performances from Kelsea Ballerini, Big & Rich, Clint Black, Brothers Osborne, Luke Bryan, Post Malone and others.
ONE SOUTH: PORTRAIT OF PSYCH UNIT 9 p.m. on HBO. The 2020 Netflix documentary series "Lenox Hill" brought viewers into the neurosurgery unit of that hospital. This HBO series might be even more intimate, this time bringing viewers into a hospital where college students are receiving treatment for serious mental health issues. This series spotlights the experience, from intake to discharge, in one of these hospitals and frustrating limitations of the U.S. health care system.
Wednesday
REAL CSI: MIAMI 10 p.m. on CBS. If you ever dreamed that any of the "CSI" franchise shows were more realistic, you're in luck. This new series is a reality show, inspired by the Crime Scene Investigation unit featured on countless dramas. The cameras follow investigators at true crime scenes and then outline the forensic process of finding suspects.
Thursday
NHL AWARDS 7 p.m. on ESPN. The hockey season is over, and now it is time for players to get their flowers. Taking place at the Fontainebleau in Las Vegas, and being broadcast live, players will accept awards for most valuable player, outstanding goaltender, outstanding defenseman, outstanding rookie and more. Time to crack open a cold brewski and celly!
PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE 9 p.m. on various channels. Campaign season is underway with this first presidential debate broadcast. Jake Tapper and Dana Bash from CNN will moderate, and there will be no live studio audience. Decided by a coin toss: President Biden is set to appear at the podium on the right side of the stage and former President Donald J. Trump will get the last word of the debate. Also, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. failed to qualify for the debate, so it will just be Trump and Biden on the stage.
Friday
HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS (2003) on Bravo. "All the other girls dreamed they'd be Ben's partner, they'd be Ben's partner, ooooohhh." Anytime I watch this 2000s rom-com, this personalized rendition of Carly Simon's "You're So Vain" gets stuck in my head. It's annoying, but that's kind of the point. Andi (Kate Hudson) has a magazine assignment to make a guy dump her in 10 days. Ben (Matthew McConaughey) makes a bet with his colleagues that he can make any woman fall in love with him in 10 days. After lots of cringe-y and highly awkward moments, the film, of course, ends in romance.
Saturday
SOUL (2020) 8:10 p.m. on Freeform. If you had a good cry while seeing "Inside Out 2," and need another one, check out this Pixar movie about Joe, a middle school jazz teacher who ends up in a different realm and explores his passions. "In about 100 jaunty, poignant minutes," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times, the film "tackles some of the questions that many of us have been losing sleep over since childhood. Why do I exist? What's the point of being alive? What comes after?"
Sunday
THE BET AWARDS 8 p.m. on BET. This is the year of a Usher resurgence (though he never really went away): He performed the Super Bowl Halftime Show, has a residency in Las Vegas and now is being honored with BET's Lifetime Achievement award. Ice Spice, Lauryn Hill, Tyla and Shaboozey are set to perform at the award show, with Taraji P. Henson returning as host.
WATCH WHAT HAPPENS LIVE 15TH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL 9 p.m. on Bravo. It's hard to believe that what started as a web show has become a tent pole for Bravo programming, with the host Andy Cohen leading guests through games like "Plead the Fifth" and "Shag, Marry, Kill." The show is celebrating 15 years with lots of familiar faces and trips down memory lane.

Full text: "She seems to approach the world with kindness and understanding," said the actor, who has joined the Netflix series for its latest season.
James Phoon couldn't quite imagine himself cavorting among the 19th-century bon tons of "Bridgerton." Then he read that the first Chinese person gained British citizenship in 1805.
"As someone who's mixed East Asian -- I'm part Chinese, part English -- up until very recently I never thought that I would be working on a period piece," he said.
Phoon joined the hit series in Season 3, whose second half began streaming on Netflix on Thursday, playing Harry Dankworth, the new husband of Prudence Featherington.
"To be able to take up that space and represent people who are watching at home, it really means a lot," he said.
In a video call from London, where he was finishing the run of "Underdog: The Other Brontë" at the National Theater before moving with the show to Newcastle, Phoon, 30, discussed why his iPad and Apple Pencil, X-Men comics and Ariana Grande are among his cultural must-haves. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
My Journal
Every year I buy a blank scrapbook and turn it into this wellness journal. I decorate it with watercolors, and each month has a different aesthetic theme. At the beginning of the month, I write my goals, and at the end of the month I write a list of happy moments. And then I have This Month's Win, which is one thing -- work-related or personal, or just something that made you smile -- that you want to hold onto.
X-Men Comics
On the very forefront, they're superheroes. But at the heart of it, it's a story about minority groups and a marginalized community dealing with prejudice and trying to figure out how they navigate the things they come up against. There are so many moments in it that are really beautiful parallels to sexuality or race or gender identity.
'Avatar: The Last Airbender'
It's set as a kids show. But there is one clear story arc, and it's all about character growth and finding acceptance and trying to spread a bit of harmony in this chaotic world that they're living in. It's deeper than it seems.
Board Games
My family are super, super competitive. Our time together is often spent playing games of some kind, especially cooperative games. There's one called Pandemic, and you work as a team to try and eradicate all these diseases. I did play it a lot during Covid. It was board games imitating life at that point for me.
Kiss the Hippo Coffee
They roast their own beans, and they're a carbon-negative company, which is amazing. But more than that, their coffee is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
An iPad and Apple Pencil
When I was younger, normally while I was watching movies and TV shows, I would sit there with a sketchbook and just be drawing something. Then a few years ago, I got an iPad and Apple Pencil and started digital drawing for the first time. And that's expanded into so many different things. I make invitations and cards on it. I've even made personalized expansion packs for board games. It's sort of warm escapism for me.
'The News Agents' Podcast
Emily Maitlis, Jon Sopel and Lewis Goodall, who are very well-known British journalists, talk about politics or the hot topics of the day. It's intelligent and articulate but very accessible.
Cinema
You are in this big dark room with a bunch of strangers, and your whole focus is on this immersive experience. You get to appreciate the work that all of these hundreds, potentially thousands of people have put into this piece of entertainment. My favorite cinemas in Britain are Everyman. They have these really nice sofas and they bring you food and drink. It's a very cozy experience.
Clothing Steamers
I hate ironing, and so for years everything would just be creased. Then my partner introduced me to clothing steamers, and they're honestly a godsend. Courtney Act, who is a famous drag queen, once said, "If you're gay enough to hang it, you're gay enough to steam it." And I think those are words to live by.
Ariana Grande
When we were filming Season 3 of "Bridgerton," Jonathan Bailey was also filming "Wicked" with Ariana, and he was talking about her and something that had happened on set. And I had to leave. I was like, I can't join in this conversation because I can't play this cool in any way. I just think she's incredible. Her music is exciting and empowering, and she seems to approach the world with kindness and understanding. I think we should all try and do that as much as possible.

Something Is Wrong in This Marriage. It's Us.: [Style Desk]

Full text: Can exploring polyamory both break you and make you?
When my wife proposed that we stop being monogamous, she said it would make us stronger. I said it would make us divorce. We were both right.
She had planted the seed seven years into our marriage as I was finishing seminary. At the time, I was exiting a phase of my life perhaps best described as "worship pastor bro." My Christian faith was undergoing a meticulous and scholarly deconstruction. I could begin to imagine a life without God, but with my new, expensive master's degree in theology, I struggled to imagine a career without Him.
By contrast, Corrie's turn away from religion a year earlier had been quick, uncomplicated and annoyingly joyful.
One night, seven years into our marriage, she said, "Do you ever wish we had slept around a bunch in college before getting married?" Corrie was a fiery social worker whose face could never hide what she felt -- annoyance, attraction, embarrassment. Behind this question was an expression of excitement.
I stared at her in disbelief. By "college" she meant the Bible college where we met, both of us in student leadership. It was the kind of Christian university that prohibited dancing.
Like many of our peers, Corrie and I married the summer after graduation. We were in love, but we were also motivated by our desire to explore that part of the human experience marriage would finally sanction: sexuality.
"What? No!" I said, incredulous, but quiet enough not to wake our then-5-year-old daughter. Still, her newfound liberation was infectious. Soon we were naming all the classmates we might have hooked up with, given the chance. As it turned out, for Corrie, they were mostly women.
Thus began a game we would play, called, "Do you think they're hot?" One of us would pause the TV show we were watching or gesture slyly at a neighboring table, then look at the other with arched eyebrows. The Venn diagram of who we each found attractive were two separate circles, except for a sliver of overlap occupied by Jennifer Lawrence in "The Hunger Games."
Gradually, the game took on a more serious tone as Corrie's type came into clearer focus. "How about them?" I would ask, nodding toward a particularly androgynous woman. "Do you think they're hot?"
Corrie started identifying as bisexual, then pansexual, then queer. It was hard to know how to feel about her transformation. On the one hand, it became harder to place myself and our heterosexual marriage on the new map of her sexual interests. On the other hand, the more freedom she felt to explore her fantasies, the more erotic energy she brought into our relationship. After years of being fairly disinterested in sex, Corrie was finally turned on. Just not by me.
It was after an episode of "Orange is the New Black," the Netflix show featuring incarcerated women -- many of them lesbians -- that Corrie said, "I wish we hadn't gotten married so young. I don't regret marrying you, but I regret that I never got the chance to explore first. What if we had that chance now? Both of us."
It hurt. It was the first time we talked about divorce. Neither of us wanted to end our marriage. But the idea of opening it also felt wrong -- or it did to me.
Like Corrie's embrace of atheism, the prospect of having other partners seemed uncomplicated to her. Non-monogamy was a sign that our marriage was strong and could withstand threats. Plus, the idea of me with another woman somehow excited her.
By contrast, the thought of her with someone else sent my mind spinning. I imagined them being able to satisfy Corrie in a way that I couldn't. I wanted to be enough for her, but I also didn't want to be an object of regret or a gatekeeper to her happiness.
We started seeing a couple's therapist who specialized in non-monogamous relationships. And then we started seeing other people.
My reintroduction to dating was a disaster. I spent the moments before my first date dry heaving in an alley behind the restaurant. Months later, in another woman's bed for the first time, I was unable to become aroused.
And I felt even more uncomfortable watching Corrie date. I knew she wouldn't leave me for someone else, but I felt utterly debilitated, something bigger than jealousy.
Among the stack of books about non-monogamy and polyamory that now sat on my night stand, I learned the term "primal panic," a destabilizing jolt to one's nervous system coming from the potential abandonment of an attachment figure. I didn't like to think of myself having a childlike attachment to my wife, but I had spent too much time sobbing in the shower not to see that simple truth.
We were children when we first got together. It wasn't just that neither of us had dated or slept around before getting married. We also had never been dumped, been single in our 20s, or lived alone. Corrie was now finding an identity that transcended our relationship. I had no idea who I was outside of us.
I started seeing an individual therapist and attending a men's process therapy group. But perhaps most helpful was the exposure therapy of continuing our non-monogamy experiment. Jealousy was like a tight muscle that I learned to stretch and relax. As many times as I watched Corrie leave on a date, I watched her come home. I learned to comfort the panicked child inside me rather than outsource that job to Corrie.
One night, laughing with a date as we walked home from a performance of "The Producers," I realized I was having fun. Years later, when another woman I was seeing slapped my behind playfully at a restaurant, I realized I was having feelings.
Becoming emotionally attached to other partners had always seemed like the biggest threat to our relationship. Now, romantic feelings for others just felt like part of the territory. When I suggested that we remove our wedding bands, Corrie happily agreed. We started using the term polyamory, saying to other partners that we wanted long-term relationships, not just sexual connections.
"I accidentally said 'I love you' to Tamara," I told Corrie one day over lunch. With our children at school and our work calendars blocking off the hour, these midday check-ins had become a ritual for us, a time to process all the drama -- and increasingly, comedy -- that filled our lives as a polyamorous couple.
"What?" she yelled. "Jason. Seriously?"
"We were having sex and it just sort of slipped out," I said.
"On your second date?" We were both laughing now. "Dude, you are going to scare this girl away."
I had matched with Tamara on OkCupid, which includes options for seeking monogamy or non-monogamy. Her profile said she was open to either. I swiped right.
We quickly hit it off. Tamara was cheerful, a bit cautious and deeply curious. Given our shared love for the outdoors, we soon were planning canyon hikes in Utah and a backpacking trip near Aspen.
But what I found most endearing about Tamara was the way our physical connection fostered emotional connection. For the first time, I felt like my sexual desire for another person was reciprocated.
"Healing" was the word I found myself using as I described this to Corrie over lunch one day. The word caught in my throat as I said it. She had met Tamara a few weeks earlier and seemed uncharacteristically pensive as our relationship developed.
"I don't want to lose you," she said. "But I don't think I'll ever be able to give you what she can. The way Tamara feels about you is the way I feel about the women I'm dating."
It was the truth we both had pretended not to know: Corrie was gay. After years of confusion and dread, this clarity came as a relief, casting light onto years of tortured conversation about sexual desire and our fundamental compatibility.
She asked if we could stay married as platonic partners. I said no. We held hands across the dining room table and cried. We would divorce later that summer.
I had always been so focused on what Corrie wasn't getting from our marriage that I didn't realize what I wasn't getting. Our non-monogamy had given me the chance to explore what I wanted. And what I wanted was a monogamous relationship with Tamara.
We moved in together that fall. Next year, we'll be getting married, with Corrie attending as my "best person."
I maintain a beautiful relationship with Corrie. She and Tamara maintain a beautiful relationship with each other and our children. They've each given their blessing for this story to be published.
Our lives together require an expansive view of love. Although I have stopped being non-monogamous, I have also stopped depending on romantic love for a sense of identity. For that, I'm grateful for polyamory.

The Plan to Blend A.I. With Classic Literature: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Margaret Atwood and John Banville are among the authors who have sold their voices and commentary to an app that aims to bring canonical texts to life with the latest tech.
For the past year, two philosophy professors have been calling around to prominent authors and public intellectuals with an unusual, perhaps heretical, proposal. They have been asking these thinkers if, for a handsome fee, they wouldn't mind turning themselves into A.I. chatbots.
John Kaag, one of the academics, is a professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. He is known for writing books, such as "Hiking With Nietzsche" and "American Philosophy: A Love Story," that blend philosophy and memoir.
Clancy Martin, Mr. Kaag's partner in the endeavor, is a professor at the University of Missouri in Kansas City and the author of 10 books, including "How Not to Kill Yourself," an unflinching memoir about his mental health struggles and 10 suicide attempts.
The two became friends 14 years ago, when Mr. Kaag was struck by an essay Mr. Martin had written for Harper's and called him up. The two bonded over their disenchantment with the siloed world of academia and their belief that philosophy can be helpful to more people, if only they studied it.
Over time, Mr. Kaag, 44, and Mr. Martin, 57, also bonded over their personal struggles. Each has been married three times, and each has faced death. (In 2020, Mr. Kaag suffered full-blown cardiac arrest after a gym workout.)
How they wound up cold-calling renowned writers is another story.
In April 2023, Mr. Kaag received an email from John Dubuque, a businessman who had become a patron of sorts.
Before joining his family's plumbing-supply business in St. Louis, Mr. Dubuque had been a philosophy major at the University of Southern California. Feeling that he was stagnating intellectually, he began paying philosophy professors to take him through "Being and Time" by Martin Heidegger and other works.
Mr. Dubuque, 40, hired Mr. Kaag for a six-week tutorial on "The Varieties of Religious Experience" by William James. The professor was the right person for the job, having published "Sick Souls, Healthy Minds: How William James Can Save Your Life" in 2020.
At the time, Mr. Dubuque's family business had recently been sold, and he was looking for what to do next. During his talks with Mr. Kaag, he suggested that they team up to create a publishing company.
As Mr. Dubuque envisioned it, the imprint would pair a world-class expert with a classic work and use technology similar to ChatGPT to replicate the dialogue between a student and teacher. In theory, readers could ask, say, Doris Kearns Goodwin about presidential speeches or delve into Buddhist texts with Deepak Chopra.
Mr. Kaag jumped on board and brought his friend Mr. Martin to the project. The result is Rebind Publishing.
It will makes its debut June 17 as an interactive reading experience, available on mobile, desktop and tablet. Users will have free access during the rollout, with per-book pricing and a subscription model to follow later this year.
Mr. Kaag and Mr. Martin selected the authors who would offer commentary. They spent up to 20 hours interviewing each of these "Rebinders," as they call them, about their chosen texts, trying to cover every possible question a lay reader might have. The recorded interviews were then fed into A.I. software.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Kaag and Mr. Martin sat for an interview at the Boston Athenaeum, one of the nation's oldest libraries. Mr. Martin wore jeans and a rumpled sweater over a T-shirt; his gray-brown hair was mussed, giving him the appearance of an aging member of an indie rock band. In contrast, Mr. Kaag wore a crisp dress shirt, tan chinos and brown dress shoes with turquoise socks.
Both seemed not to believe their luck to have been given carte blanche to assemble an intellectual dream team.
"Man, this thing could be super cool," Mr. Martin said, recalling his reaction when Mr. Kaag approached him with the idea. "Then we started brainstorming." He said Mr. Kaag suggested, "Imagine if we could get Laura Kipnis on 'Romeo and Juliet."' (They ended up hiring Ms. Kipnis, a cultural critic and essayist, to do just that.)
Other writers participating in Rebind include Roxane Gay ("The Age of Innocence"), Marlon James ("Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"), Bill McKibben (selections from John Muir), Margaret Atwood ("A Tale of Two Cities") and the biblical scholar and Princeton University professor Elaine Pagels (selections from the New Testament and Secret Gospels).
For "Dubliners," the James Joyce classic, Mr. Kaag and Mr. Martin flew to Dublin to interview the Irish novelist John Banville, who delivered video and audio commentary.
"I first read 'Dubliners' when I was 12 or 13," Mr. Banville said by phone. "I was absolutely enthralled by it. It wasn't a Wild West story or an Agatha Christie story. It was the real thing, about life itself."
There is a sense in literary circles that artificial intelligence is in opposition to art and the humanities. This is, after all, technology that some believe might nudge out writers and teachers.
The authors who have worked with Rebind allowed their voices to be cloned and agreed to let their words be manipulated by A.I.
Asked if he had reservations about that, Mr. Banville said: "My initial reaction was deep suspicion, of course. You read a book in your hand and you read it line by line, page by page. But this is a wonderful way to get people to read classic books and not be afraid of them."
"I was paid well for it," he added, declining to disclose the amount. "But you know, it wasn't the money. I was interested in this project. At my age, I'm taking part in something new." (The Rebind commentators will also receive a royalty.)
Ms. Gay said she had little interest in the tech that made Rebind possible. "I have a weird sort of comprehension block with A.I.," she said. "The minute someone says 'A.I.,' I'm done."
Nevertheless, she said: "What I did think was interesting was revisiting classic texts. And anything that will get people reading is generally wonderful."
Mr. Martin and Mr. Kaag are bullish on the creative potential of A.I., viewing those who shun it as shortsighted. "It's one of the great artistic opportunities of our time, to collaborate with this tool," Mr. Martin said. They hope to give the Rebind treatment to 100 classics, all published before 1928 and therefore in the public domain.
Mr. Kaag and Mr. Martin took on canonical works themselves -- "Walden" by Henry David Thoreau in the case of Mr. Kaag, and "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" by Nietzsche for Mr. Martin.
Mr. Martin encountered the 19th-century German philosopher as a high-school student in Calgary, Canada, after being tipped off by his English teacher. "Changed my life," he said.
Growing up in central Pennsylvania, Mr. Kaag had a similar experience after his older brother left "Walden" on top of the toilet tank. He mentioned that he was reading the book to his Latin teacher, who later took him to Walden Pond, just outside Concord, Mass.
"I swam in the lake," Mr. Kaag recalled. "I said to myself, 'I'm going to become a philosophy professor, teach "Walden" and live in Concord.' Today, I live 10 minutes away."
Making that kind of experience with a book widely accessible is the driving idea behind Rebind, said Mr. Dubuque, who has put up his own money to fund the project, though he declined to say how much.
"I am attracted to the classics and to older books because they're a different kind of escape than the escape of watching Netflix," he said. "There's this refreshing experience of stepping out of your time. These books create a lot of meaning in your life, too."
Mr. Kaag likened the A.I.-powered author commentaries to the marginalia scribbled in a book by an expert reader, before citing a more pop-cultural reference.
"We also thought of it as those Hogwarts newspapers that speak back to you," he said.

Full text: Lynn Bodnar Kelly, executive director of Bette Midler's New York Restoration Project, e-bikes through Brooklyn and roller skates to the beat of Beyoncé.
For the past four years, Lynn Bodnar Kelly has been the executive director of the New York Restoration Project, a nonprofit that Bette Midler founded in 1995 to help make clean, open, green spaces more accessible. The organization, which owns and operates 52 community gardens, also plants trees, renovates gardens and restores parks in communities.
"Everyone asks if I'm friends with Bette," said Ms. Bodnar Kelly, 51, who lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Gowanus, Brooklyn, with her Parisian boyfriend, Laurent Fanichet, 53. "She's the heart of the organization and checks in, but she has a thriving career. I'm checking in and meeting with gardeners, the staff, our communities and donors."
As a child growing up in Old Town on Staten Island, Ms. Bodnar Kelly would be sent to her family's backyard to pull weeds when she misbehaved. She said she "loathed" the experience but gained an appreciation for the work it took to maintain a garden.
"Now I'm fascinated by gardens and helping them thrive, and paying it forward for others who don't have backyards or access to nature," she said. "I've become a fighter for these places."
EARLY RISE I'm up at 7 a.m. I'm like my father, an earlier riser. It's a habit I can't break. I lounge around for several hours because this is my one day not to rush. I buy Starbucks dark roast ice coffee in a big bottle, add two cocktail-size ice cubes and add a splash of half and half. I get back into bed and get on the laptop. I'm a nerd, so I do the boring life things. First, I order from Fresh Direct. They have a great seltzer brand, Adirondack; I love their mandarin flavor.
Then it's clothing. Right now, I'm ordering new dresses for summer from J. Crew, Diane von Furstenberg and Boden, a British company. Laurent lives and works in New York and Paris, so he sleeps like a rock, mostly because his body never adjusts to the time zone. He's in a constant state of jet lag. I'm a local news junkie and watch Eyewitness News or News 4 New York. Once he's up, around 10, he'll make a Nespresso, and then we watch CBS or CNN.
TRAINING There's a gym in my building. I've been doing weight training with kettlebells because I'm determined to age gracefully. Part of that is staying strong. My trainer, Whitney Biaggi, whom I've been working with for the past four years, recently added jump rope to my routine, which is like being back in the St. Joseph Hill schoolyard on Staten Island.
NO BRUNCH I'm in the apartment by noon; Laurent is showered and dressed. I hate brunch, so I make eggs and toast. Laurent loves the burritos from Reyes, a bodega up the block that makes authentic Mexican food. They also serve two tacos for $ 6. I'll get another iced coffee while he gets something to eat.
WHEELIES If the weather is nice, we get e-bikes because they're fun, and go to Red Hook. I'm a roller disco fanatic. I got my first pair when I was 8. They were blue suede with three yellow stripes. I grew up next to a roller rink called Skate Odyssey. The place was pure magic. About 15 years ago, my friend Lola Star ran a pop-up roller rink in Coney Island -- now she runs Dreamland, a roller disco party in Prospect Park -- and I fell in love all over again with the music, the lights, the disco ball, the feeling of community with others who enjoy skating. The minute I hear the first beat of "Another One Bites the Dust," or anything by Chaka Khan, I'm up.
There's a multiuse schoolyard on Van Brunt and Wolcott Streets that's free to use. I bring a speaker and I've got 10-to-15 playlists, each with 100 to 200 songs, which I'm obsessive about editing. The music I play is about the r.p.m. and my mood. I listen to everything from Beyoncé to David Bowie, especially rap and house. I'm into freestyling -- going forwards, backwards and spinning. I practice because roller disco requires a lot of balance and technique. I go to parties hosted by BKLYN Skates, Roller Wave and Skaterobics. The skate community in New York is welcoming to all kinds of people. I love to wear themed outfits, but not when I practice. Sometimes I'll wear a big sequined flower in my hair, because you have to have sparkle.
PUB CRAWLS Sundays are a freewheel day of no plans, drinks and friends. By 2, we usually hit Sunny's, an old, longshoreman-type bar in Red Hook that was an active shipping waterfront. It's part dive bar, part art bar, with a wonderful cast of characters. They have a garden in the back, but we sit outside in the front. I love to people-watch. In the warm weather, it's a margarita on the rocks; in the cold weather, it's a hot toddy.
Brittiny Sessions and Steve Jacobs, Brooklyn buddies I used to work with, usually come and meet us. Then we hit San Pedro, another fantastic dive bar institution which is only a few blocks away, and order tacos or nachos. Everything is on the main drag, and we spend time decompressing with people I love.
OUTDOOR OYSTERS Around 4, we get new Citi Bikes and ride on a path along the waterfront and end up in Brooklyn Bridge Park. I love Pilot; it's a huge, restored, antique sailboat that's docked and has a seasonal bar and the best oysters. I hate Sunday reservation culture, so I generally don't make one and there are never any spots. Laurent works the charming French thing and manages to get us a spot most times.
GARDEN CHECKING We are back on bikes -- riding slowly and carefully now, and go through Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens and to Gowanus, where I like to check in on a N.Y.R.P. community pocket garden, Gil Hodges, on Carroll Street. It's a sweet, charming space in the midst of a neighborhood that's changing rapidly.
TV TIME We're home for "60 Minutes," which is on at 7. Or it's Netflix. I shower and put on pajamas. Surprisingly, Target has the softest cotton ones called Stars Above. Then we find something in French because I have a French class on Monday nights and I like to say what I watched. We just watched "Fiasco," a French comedy that was hysterical. We also watch French reality shows, which are easier to understand.
PAUSE FOR COOKING Laurent loves to cook. We usually make some kind of vegetable chicken stir fry or braised chicken thighs in mushroom and cream sauce. He's always adding more butter or cream than I want because he's French, but his food is so good.
EXHAUSTION Regardless if Laurent's here or not, I'm in bed and knocked out by 10. On my phone, I look at something on TikTok that's about French language and traveling, or maybe I'll text with some girlfriends. Eventually I stop fighting sleep and zonk out.

Sculptures Break Free Of the Body: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "There's more to me than only couture," she said, previewing her first exhibition of sculpture. Catch it while you can: The show will last only 45 minutes.
The Dutch fashion designer Iris van Herpen, who counts Beyoncé, Björk and Tilda Swinton among her regular clients, is known for dazzling haute couture pieces that resemble sculpture.
Now she's aiming to show that the equation also works the other way around: She's not a fashion designer but an artist who happens to make pieces for the body.
Van Herpen is planning an art exhibition, called "Hybrid," that took a year to plan but will run for just 45 minutes on June 24, as part of Paris Haute Couture Week.
Why just 45 minutes? That's shorter than a yoga class, some Netflix episodes or a nap.
Compared to her usual presentation at Fashion Week, the designer said, it's actually a long time.
"Normally we do a runway show that takes only 15 minutes because the audience goes from one show to another. So this is very long for this setup," she said. "This show really is a hybrid performance," she added. "There are living performers doing the installation and it will be physically intense."
On a recent afternoon, van Herpen welcomed a reporter into her airy studio in the center of Westerpark, a complex of former electric-company buildings inside a lush green park in western Amsterdam.
It is one of her two studios in the Dutch capital; her couture atelier, a 12-minute walk from here, where she creates what she calls her "body works," didn't have enough elevation to hang her largest new artworks. Here, they dangle 16 feet from the rafters.
In front of the arched windows framing the constantly shifting clouds, is a curtain of tulle, decorated with swirling shapes made of dried splatters of oil paint and dyed silks. This is one of her latest pieces, "The Weightlessness of the Unknown," among the sculptures that will be shown in Paris.
Upstairs, three more swaths of tulle stretched along steel poles providing a "canvas" for designs made of silk organza plissés and 3-D printed objects. The decorative patterning could be prehistoric fossils, skeletons or fallen birds decomposing on a beach -- or rather an imaginary combination of all three.
"My work has always been interdisciplinary," she continued, "and I really feel such a strong connection between art, architecture, science and couture. That's what I'm doing with the exhibition," she added, trying "to let go of the boundaries that we set for ourselves, as the creators and for the audience."
Tulle, silk and 3-D printing have long been some of van Herpen's favored materials, which she has used to create gowns and outré headdresses that have both regal and aviary grace. Her fashion pieces are simultaneously futuristic and primordial, referencing her fascination with science and anthropology, as well as with contemporary art.
But after assembling 15 years' worth of "looks" for a major retrospective, "Sculpting the Senses," at the Museé des Arts Décoratifs in Paris (it closed in April) -- and designing bespoke gowns for Queen Máxima of the Netherlands and France's first lady, Brigitte Macron -- van Herpen realized she had another ambition.
Creating works that aren't linked to the human form is "exploring a new realm within my own creative process," she said. "The body is such a focus point that it was for me really about finding freedom. I wanted to see what I am making beyond the body, because there's more to me, I think, than only couture."
It was also, partly, to slow down. Until 2023, van Herpen had produced biannual runway shows of her collections for 17 years. In January, she decided to skip the 2024 Spring collection showcase in Paris to focus on her new artworks.
Van Herpen calls the resulting show a "hybrid art installation," which will include nine works in total: four large works in her Westerpark studio and five others that will incorporate people, whom she refers to as "performers."
They will not trot down a runway, as models do in a typical fashion show, but be suspended, "using an invisible construction," that will allow them to stand in place. During the single show, she explained, the performers will remain largely motionless and aloft.
She admitted that presenting the works this way "will be quite challenging. You shouldn't have any fear of heights," she added. "You need to be very grounded."
Because she expects the audience to include the fashion press, museum curators and other art-world people, she thinks the 45-minute run time will defy everyone's expectations. "For some people it will feel very long and for others very short," she said. Benches will be placed in the gallery space for spectators, as at a museum.
Van Herpen said she is currently in discussions with a museum to exhibit the works on a more permanent basis, starting in early 2025. But she couldn't yet disclose details.
Her "canvas" of tulle, both translucent and sturdy, is often used in ballet costumes -- a reminder that van Herpen was once a dancer. Onto that shimmering surface she added sculptural elements such as layers of oil paint, crusted into thick impasto, and designs made from both hand-pleated silk and 3-D printing.
For one of the new works, "Ancient Ancestors," she took inspiration from research conducted by Emmanuel Farge, a French biochemist at the French Institut Curie, a cancer research and treatment center. Farge discovered that primordial marine organisms' cell structure was determined, in part, by the movement of waves.
The 3-D sculptural elements embedded in the tulle resemble horseshoe crabs and seabird skeletons. "The structures refer to past but also to the future, because these organism are constantly changing," van Herpen said.
She described the two largest hanging sculptures, "Weightlessness of the Unknown" and "Embers of the Mind," as self-portraits, although they are wholly abstract -- more reflective of her emotional state.
In recent years, her inner life has focused on transformation, she explained. She moved from Amsterdam with her boyfriend and collaborator, Salvador Breed, to Het Twiske, a wetlands nature reserve about a half-hour's drive north of the city, known for its many bird species.
On long daily walks with her dog, she explained, she often reflects on nature's ability to decompose and regenerate. "My focus now is more on a transition, rather than a fixed state of being," she said.
Does van Herpen expect to continue moving further into the realm of art and, perhaps, away from the constraints of creating clothes for the human body?
"I can't ever see into the future, but I know this is permanent," she said, referring to her shift toward fine art. "I am a person who needs those different influences; if I focus on one thing only ... it just isn't giving me the right dynamic."
She added, "I'm not leaving couture, but I'm also not leaving this other" -- she paused, seeking the precise word -- "dimension. I really intend to take the freedom to work on the pieces that I feel need to come out, at that moment."
"Hybrid," Iris van Herpen's new exhibition, runs at 11:30 a.m. at 53 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris on June 24.

Funny, Gay and Not Exactly Out: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Paul Lynde, Charles Nelson Reilly and Rip Taylor get a cursory mention in a new documentary about queer stand-up, but they were groundbreaking.
In 1987, David Letterman was taping his late-night show in Las Vegas before rowdy audiences of mostly young men in preppy pullovers and muscle shirts -- prototypical bros raised on "Porky's."
On one episode, Letterman introduces a "very funny and strange, peculiar man who first played Las Vegas way back in 1963." The sea of seemingly straight guys parts, and to a cartoonishly accelerated rendition of "Happy Days Are Here Again," the comedian Rip Taylor speed-walks through, ferociously hurling heaps of confetti, his signature entrance shtick.
I've had this clip on repeat since watching "Outstanding: A Comedy Revolution," a new Netflix documentary about the history of queer stand-up comedy. Not because Taylor plays a big role in the film, but because he and two other groundbreaking gay comics -- Paul Lynde and Charles Nelson Reilly -- do not.
"Outstanding" does briefly single out the three men as renowned comedy elders, even though they weren't primarily known for stand-up. The documentary also does right by underappreciated comedians like Robin Tyler and Bob Smith and household names like Rosie O'Donnell and Margaret Cho.
But why just the cursory mention of Lynde, Reilly and Taylor? It's as if we couldn't possibly glean anything meaningful from old-school comedians who were apolitical and effeminate, steppingstones for contemporary comedians, like Hannah Gadsby and Jerrod Carmichael, who are willing to wait for a room to quiet down so they can talk about difficult childhoods.
Lynde, Reilly and Taylor didn't sit in their trauma. They kept it light and never talked about their biography in a serious way, because doing so would have led to questions they weren't prepared to engage with. Maybe that's why the documentary made me race to YouTube to see these Stonewall-generation funnymen with dippy but dark-edged sensibilities that were shaped by decades of self-hatred and fear the likes of which a 20-year-old today cannot fathom.
These three queens mesmerized me as a teenage closet case in the '80s. Lynde, who died in 1982 at 55, was my favorite naughty center square on the game show "Hollywood Squares." Reilly, who died in 2007 at 76, was the quippy diva from "Match Game," though both were initially famous for sitcoms and Broadway.
Peter Marshall, the host of NBC's original daytime "Hollywood Squares" from 1966 to 1980, remembers Reilly as a "brilliant" comedian and a close friend.
"To be around Charles was really special," Marshall, 98, said in a phone interview. "He became like my brother."
I remember Lynde, Reilly and Taylor mostly from game, variety and talk shows. They communicated in femme gay signifiers that we take for granted on television in the decades since Jack McFarland, Sean Hayes's "Will & Grace" character, skipped across the screen. We're talking sibilance, expressive hand gestures, bitchy asides, sexual innuendos, arch delivery. In the '80s, gay men and other in-the-know people recognized that these comics were gay even if, like my parents, they didn't acknowledge it out loud.
Marshall told me that Reilly -- a Tony Award-winning actor who studied under Uta Hagen -- never really hid his gayness publicly as he became more successful. By contrast, Marshall said, Lynde seemed "embarrassed" by his homosexuality even as post-Stonewall gay freedoms blossomed.
Still, Marshall said, they "were extremely talented and funny and very dear."
Growing up Gen X and naïve in Northeast Ohio, I didn't know that these men were gay or that their manner was camp. And I didn't know their winking humor was rooted in Hollywood's pansy craze of the 1920s and '30s, when actors like Franklin Pangborn played prissy hotel managers and other queer-coded characters at a time when being publicly gay carried the risk of arrest.
As a boy, I must have intuited that what was foppish about Lynde, Reilly and Taylor coursed through me, too, even without the words to explain why. It took me decades to understand that in being themselves on television, they subversively gave me an invaluable gay gift: visibility.
I primarily remember Taylor, who died in 2019 at 88, as the confetti-thrower who made my mother scream with laughter. It's only after being out for 34 years that I appreciate why I couldn't take my eyes off him. It's in his cocky but effete delivery, the same vocal quality I heard when theater queens debated who was the superior Mame at West Village gay bars. It's in his Mitzi Gaynor-giving wig and yellow marabou maxicoat that looks like what Big Bird would wear if he were Sesame Street's pimp.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Robbie Fortney, Taylor's companion of 44 years, said Taylor used to stop his schoolyard bullies with silly faces.
"That was his defense, and that's what he did for the rest of his life," Fortney, 77, told me.
The Diverting Tinkerbell: It's a time-tested survival strategy that gay men like Taylor learn quickly and use generously as needed. Butch he was not. Then again, nobody showed me you could be gay and masculine. On "Letterman," Taylor's flamboyance is a shocking contrast to all those hooting audience members in Ray-Bans, the same kind of man who laughed at his jokes when he was a boy -- his best and most immediate way of avoiding their blows.
Fortney said that when people assumed Taylor was gay, he bristled at the perception, even as he emceed AIDS benefits and, in 2005, served as the grand marshal of the Pride parade in Washington, D.C., Taylor's hometown.
Take what happened at a coffee shop when a young fan thanked Taylor for being out.
"He said, 'You've made things so much easier,"' Fortney recalled. "All Rip gave him was a smile and a nod like, fine, now you can leave. He would not accept what an influence he was."
Lynde's story is more tragic. Joe Florenski, who with Steve Wilson wrote the Lynde biography "Center Square," said the comic was an overweight boy who struggled with being made fun of until he found a solution.
"He could get laughs for being funny, not for being the chubby kid," Florenski told me.
Lynde never officially said he was gay, although he was out to close friends. His arrests for public intoxication made the news, as did a 1965 accident in which James Davidson, a 24-year-old actor friend, fell to his death from a ledge outside Lynde's San Francisco hotel room.
Erin Murphy, the actress who played Tabitha, the witch Samantha's daughter on "Bewitched," said she loved working with Lynde in his supporting role as her nutty Uncle Arthur. But, she said, he "was caustic in retrospect."
"He had a biting humor that I appreciated," she said. "But he wasn't warm and fuzzy, on and off camera."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Lynde's complicated legacy continues to resonate, and compilations of his best material are available on TikTok. In 2020, the actor-director Billy Eichner said he planned to play Lynde in a biopic. (A spokesperson for Eichner said the film was "in development, he's attached and working on it.") I could see Eichner and Hayes, two out actors who know from gay Hollywood history, starring in a "Feud" season about the bosom-buddies rivalry between Lynde and Reilly.
Fortney was discussing Taylor but could have been talking about Lynde and Reilly, too, when he described Taylor as "a reluctant hero" who "did something for gay comedy without trying to be the gay comedian."
You know who gets this? Carson Kressley, an original cast member of "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy." He carries the comedic gay-guest torch as a regular judge on "RuPaul's Drag Race" and a celebrity contestant on the game show "25 Words or Less."
Kressley considers Lynde, Reilly and Taylor to be reality television pioneers in that they were "the realest version of themselves" that networks would allow at the time.
"When I was starting out, in my subconscious I was thinking, I can be as camp and as me as I want to be because these people had done it before," he said. "They were trailblazers."
In that Letterman clip, Taylor's short set is a pile-on of juvenile prop gags. "The odd couple," he barks, lifting up a brassiere fashioned so that one cup is larger than the other.
The crowd eats it up.

AMSTERDAM — Dutch fashion designer Iris van Herpen, who counts Beyoncé, Björk and Tilda Swinton among her regular clients, is known for dazzling haute couture pieces that resemble sculpture.
Now she’s aiming to show that the equation also works the other way around: She’s not a fashion designer but an artist who happens to make pieces for the body.
Van Herpen is planning an art exhibition, called “Hybrid,” that took a year to plan but will run for just 45 minutes on Monday, as part of Paris Haute Couture Week.
Why just 45 minutes? That’s shorter than a yoga class, some Netflix episodes or a nap.
Compared with her usual presentation at Fashion Week, the designer said, it’s actually a long time.
“Normally we do a runway show that takes only 15 minutes because the audience goes from one show to another. So this is very long for this setup,” she said. “This show really is a hybrid performance,” she added. “There are living performers doing the installation and it will be physically intense.”
On a recent afternoon, van Herpen welcomed a reporter into her airy studio in the center of Westerpark, a complex of former electric company buildings inside a lush green park in western Amsterdam.
It is one of her two studios in the Dutch capital; her couture atelier, a 12-minute walk away, where she creates what she calls her “body works,” didn’t have enough elevation to hang her largest new artworks. Here, they dangle 16 feet from the rafters.
In front of the arched windows framing the constantly shifting clouds, is a curtain of tulle, decorated with swirling shapes made of dried splatters of oil paint and dyed silks. This is one of her latest pieces, “The Weightlessness of the Unknown,” among the sculptures that will be shown in Paris.
Upstairs, three more swaths of tulle stretched along steel poles providing a “canvas” for designs made of silk organza plissés and 3D-printed objects. The decorative patterning could be prehistoric fossils, skeletons or fallen birds decomposing on a beach — or rather an imaginary combination of all three.
“My work has always been interdisciplinary,” van Herpen said, “and I really feel such a strong connection between art, architecture, science and couture. That’s what I’m doing with the exhibition,” she added, trying “to let go of the boundaries that we set for ourselves, as the creators and for the audience.”
Tulle, silk and 3D printing have long been some of van Herpen’s favored materials, which she has used to create gowns and outré headdresses that have both regal and aviary grace. Her fashion pieces are simultaneously futuristic and primordial, referencing her fascination with science and anthropology, as well as with contemporary art.
But after assembling 15 years’ worth of “looks” for a major retrospective, “Sculpting the Senses,” at the Museé des Arts Décoratifs in Paris (it closed in April) — and designing bespoke gowns for Queen Máxima of the Netherlands and France’s first lady, Brigitte Macron — van Herpen realized she had another ambition.
Creating works that aren’t linked to the human form is “exploring a new realm within my own creative process,” she said. “The body is such a focus point that it was for me really about finding freedom. I wanted to see what I am making beyond the body, because there’s more to me, I think, than only couture.”
It was also, partly, to slow down. Until 2023, van Herpen had produced biannual runway shows of her collections for 17 years. In January, she decided to skip the 2024 spring collection showcase in Paris to focus on her new artworks.
Van Herpen calls the resulting show a “hybrid art installation,” which will include nine works in total: four large works in her Westerpark studio and five others that will incorporate people, whom she refers to as “performers.”
They will not trot down a runway, as models do in a typical fashion show, but be suspended, “using an invisible construction,” that will allow them to stand in place. During the single show, she explained, the performers will remain largely motionless and aloft.
She admitted that presenting the works this way “will be quite challenging. You shouldn’t have any fear of heights,” she added. “You need to be very grounded.”
Because she expects the audience to include the fashion press, museum curators and other art world people, she thinks the 45-minute run time will defy everyone’s expectations. “For some people it will feel very long and for others very short,” she said. Benches will be placed in the gallery space for spectators, as at a museum.
Van Herpen said she is currently in discussions with a museum to exhibit the works on a more permanent basis, starting in early 2025. But she couldn’t yet disclose details.
Her “canvas” of tulle, both translucent and sturdy, is often used in ballet costumes — a reminder that van Herpen was once a dancer. Onto that shimmering surface she added sculptural elements such as layers of oil paint, crusted into thick impasto, and designs made from both hand-pleated silk and 3D printing.
For one of the new works, “Ancient Ancestors,” she took inspiration from research conducted by Emmanuel Farge, a French biochemist at the French Institut Curie, a cancer research and treatment center. Farge discovered that primordial marine organisms’ cell structure was determined, in part, by the movement of waves.
The 3D sculptural elements embedded in the tulle resemble horseshoe crabs and seabird skeletons. “The structures refer to past but also to the future, because these organism are constantly changing,” van Herpen said.
She described the two largest hanging sculptures, “Weightlessness of the Unknown” and “Embers of the Mind,” as self-portraits, although they are wholly abstract — more reflective of her emotional state.
In recent years, her inner life has focused on transformation, she explained. She moved from Amsterdam with her boyfriend and collaborator, Salvador Breed, to Het Twiske, a wetlands nature reserve about a half-hour’s drive north of the city, known for its many bird species.
On long daily walks with her dog, she explained, she often reflects on nature’s ability to decompose and regenerate. “My focus now is more on a transition, rather than a fixed state of being,” she said.
Does van Herpen expect to continue moving further into the realm of art and, perhaps, away from the constraints of creating clothes for the human body?
“I can’t ever see into the future, but I know this is permanent,” she said, referring to her shift toward fine art. “I am a person who needs those different influences; if I focus on one thing only … it just isn’t giving me the right dynamic.”
She added, “I’m not leaving couture, but I’m also not leaving this other” — she paused, seeking the precise word — “dimension. I really intend to take the freedom to work on the pieces that I feel need to come out, at that moment.”

“Hybrid,” Iris van Herpen’s new exhibition, runs at 11:30 a.m. at 53 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris on Monday.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The almost famous drag king comedian Murray Hill struts through Melvyn's Restaurant & Lounge, an old school steakhouse in Palm Springs, Calif.
Melvyn's is Mr. Hill's kind of place. It has steak Diane on the menu, black-and-white head shots of celebrities on the walls and the aroma of crêpes suzette flambéing in the air. And Palm Springs is Mr. Hill's kind of town -- faded midcentury Hollywood glamour, with a modern dash of queer culture.
Moving past diners wearing pastel polo shirts and golf shorts, Mr. Hill cuts a distinctive figure in his three-piece baby blue seersucker suit and white loafers. His pencil-thin mustache, tinted glasses and shiny rings complete a look that brings to mind a 1970s Las Vegas lounge singer crossed with a 1950s Borscht Belt comedian.
He is a somebody, clearly. But who?
He sits down, studies the menu. His glance falls on the section for steak toppings, which are listed under the heading "Enhancements."
"'Enhancements'?" he cries, loudly enough for almost everyone in the place to hear. "I already got them. They're back at the house. They're on the drying rack!"
Mr. Hill, 52, speaks with the hint of a Brooklyn wiseguy accent and punctuates anything remotely to do with the entertainment industry -- the rungs of which he has been tirelessly climbing for some 30 years -- with a cry of "Showbiz!"
This is the Murray Hill that audiences that have come to know and love at small New York venues, from Cake to Joe's Pub -- a garrulous, semi-washed-up comedian who belongs to the bygone show-business age of zingers and rimshots.
The other Murray Hill is an ascendant character actor who has distinguished himself with heartfelt performances on the HBO series "Somebody Somewhere" and Amy Schumer's Hulu show, "Life & Beth."
He also has a key role in "Jackpot," an upcoming film by Paul Feig, the director of "Bridesmaids," "Spy" and other comedy hits. And he was among the comics selected to perform at the annual Netflix Is a Joke festival last month.
The waiter arrives. Mr. Hill orders filet mignon, a Caesar salad and a seltzer.
"Any sides?" the waiter asks.
"I got so many sides, I'm a circle!" Mr. Hill says.
He'll be here all night, folks!
Mr. Hill, who lives in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, explains that he's in Palm Springs to scout locations for "Shorty Big Time," a detective show he is developing and hoping to sell. He notes that it will be nothing like "Law & Order" or the other prime time staples of the genre.
"Nobody's getting killed," he says.
Sample plotline: "Someone took somebody's teeth at the nursing home, and they call me in," he says. "Or the gay rodeo's in town, and the chaps are missing. Just fun and campy. We need it. Things are rough out there."
Does it have interest from a studio or streaming platform?
"It's on a couple of desks," Mr. Hill replies. "Hey -- showbiz talk!"
"Now that I have some outside validation," he continues, "I feel like it's my duty and my obligation to do this show and get it made. You know, RuPaul is the mother, and I'm the father. People are starting to catch up. The only problem is, I'm getting older!"
Origin Story
One of the stock jokes in any Murray Hill show goes like this: "I'm reading your mind, sir," he will say to a man in the front row. "You're thinking, 'Is it a man or a woman? Is it a man or a woman?' Sir, the answer is -- no!"
Like a lot of jokes, this one may come from hard experience. Mr. Hill grew up in small New England towns, a child of conservative Catholic parents.
"The only thing I knew about gay and queer was that it was wrong and you're going to hell," he says. "And there was no language about trans. So I had to do a lot of unlearning. I didn't come out until way later. Now I say, 'I came out -- but I don't know as what!' Hey, where's my rimshot?"
After college at Boston University, he moved to New York to pursue a graduate degree in photography at the School of Visual Arts. Posing as a photojournalist on assignment for The Village Voice, Mr. Hill began to explore drag clubs in the East Village and the Meatpacking District.
"These clubs were so vibrant, full of life and accepting," he recalls. "And funny! The drag queens were crazy. The politics was hardcore. There was darkness, but the presentation was camp and fun. That's how we're going to handle all these bad feelings of being discriminated against."
He started to perform as different characters -- "Saturday Night Fever"-era John Travolta, 1970s Elvis Presley and the gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi -- while lip-syncing to prerecorded songs, a drag-club performance trope.
"What set him apart was his outlandish behavior," said Mo B. Dick, a fellow drag king. "He really couldn't stand lip-syncing. He didn't follow the standard procedures. He took it further in developing his own character."
In 1997 Mr. Hill ran, as a write-in candidate, for New York City mayor against the incumbent, Rudy Giuliani, on the platform "Let the Kids Dance." He says he received 341 votes. He wasn't exactly the Murray Hill of today, but in his white suit, large glasses and executive-contour hairstyle, he was gradually assembling his signature look.
"I'm kind of like a used-car salesman," he says, describing the persona. "Jackie Gleason. Archie Bunker. Your drunk uncle at Thanksgiving dinner. Which happens to be all my Italian relatives. But I switch gender. So I became the subject I wanted to see."
Another influence was his love of classic American comedy.
"I used to watch Johnny Carson," Mr. Hill says. "He would have these old-school comedians on -- Buddy Hackett, Dean Martin, Totie Fields, Phyllis Diller. It felt like I had some kinship with them. Funny. Kind. They rib each other, but they're still family."
He made a particular study of Don Rickles's live shows -- the pacing, the crowd work, the subtle shifts in tone to elicit laughs and tears.
"Those Catskills comedians all came from rough lives, and drag queens have the same thing," he said. "They're dealing with all this heavy stuff. Drag queens and Borscht Belt comedians have that in common. A sense of entertaining and really giving it to you, but you're in on it. Comedy. They say it's healing, and guess what -- it's true."
From these influences -- drag queens, drag kings, Borscht Belt tummlers and his Italian family members -- a character was born. All these years later, the line between the persona and the person behind it has gotten a bit fuzzy.
While waiting for the world to catch up with his act, he has done everything from hosting eating contests to headlining shows. He has opened for the bands Le Tigre and Gossip and toured with the burlesque performer Dita Von Teese. Along the way he amassed an ever widening circle of friends, admirers and colleagues, including Mr. Feig, the director.
"In today's world, where everyone tries to present themselves in three dimensions, there's something so lovely about someone who has become a persona and that's what they present to the world," Mr. Feig said. "Murray has dedicated his life to this character and I think that's so special."
While the traditional understanding of gender and sex has come under increased examination in recent years, it seems that Mr. Hill, for the most part, would prefer to express his views on those issues through his work. As he sees it, he feels comfortable as Murray Hill, and if anyone else has trouble categorizing him, well, that's their problem.
"What I love about Murray is he doesn't clap you over the head with feminism and a queer agenda," Mo B. Dick said. "He does it in this comedic way, and you clock the political aspects."
Jack Halberstam, a professor of gender studies at Columbia University, got to know Mr. Hill in New York in the 1990s, while researching his pioneering work of queer theory, "Female Masculinity." When informed of Mr. Hill's recent foray into TV and film, Mr. Halberstam seemed surprised. "Really?" he said.
"Well," he continued, "he deserves everything. He is an absolute treasure."
The professor then summed up the appeal of the Murray Hill character: "He's presenting the arrogance and narcissism of a world that continues to be male-dominated, by men who barely have to try. It's a sleazy version of masculinity that we all want to take down."
Mr. Hill's longtime friends include the comedian and cabaret chanteuse Bridget Everett, the star of "Somebody Somewhere," which recently completed the filming of its third season. On the show, which is set in Manhattan, Kansas, Mr. Hill plays the kindhearted soil scientist Fred Rococo. The character, a gentle optimist, requires Mr. Hill to display more tenderness than he does in his stage act.
"Murray and I have been moving through the ranks and kicking around downtown for years," said Ms. Everett, who has been a frequent guest performer at Mr. Hill's club shows. "We're kindred spirits. We look out for each other. It's just like the circle of life. Like 'The Lion King,' except totally different."
Applause
On the day after the dinner at Melvyn's, Mr. Hill is dressed in what you might call his "off-duty" look -- red track suit, red baseball cap, gold chain -- as he enters the West Hollywood showroom of the tailor Leon Elias Wu, who specializes in making gender-inclusive custom suits. It is a bright May afternoon, a little more than 24 hours before his Netflix Is a Joke performance.
As Mr. Wu prepares to unveil his latest suit (they start at $ 2,000), Mr. Hill pants in anticipation. It's a bit, clearly, but it contains a truth. In this case, the truth is that Mr. Hill can't seem to stop acquiring custom suits. Until a fire destroyed his apartment in Greenpoint last year, he owned 80 of them. Now, with the TV money rolling in, Mr. Hill is rebuilding the collection, with 25 and counting.
The suit presented by Mr. Wu, it must be said, is magnificent -- a three-piece plaid affair in blue and pink, with a rich paisley lining.
"Look at that lining," Mr. Hill says. "Sick!"
"There's a lot of smoke and mirrors in this business," he continues. "I can't go into a regular suit place. I've done that -- and you look like an idiot."
Mr. Wu makes slight alterations, a pinch here, a tuck there.
"As masc people, we have slim arms," Mr. Wu says. "That's why you want it tailored, because it's supposed to look filled-up in the sleeve. Usually, when you buy a men's suit and you're a masc person, your arms look like tubes. So having it slimmed down a little actually makes you look more masculine. Those are the tricks we learn. Learning drag performance is learning about style."
Before you know it, Mr. Hill is ordering another suit. "It's got to look either super sharp, or super 1970s 'Love Boat,' or Dean Martin," he says.
Mr. Wu opens a book of fabrics, saying, "We've got colors, plaids and patterns."
"That's what my shrink says -- I have too many patterns!" Mr. Hill says.
The next evening, Mr. Hill is making last-minute preparations for his Netflix Is a Joke show at the Kookaburra Lounge, a nightclub in a shopping mall behind the TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood.
It is his first show in Los Angeles, and he has put together a seven-piece band with a horn section for the occasion, as if he were about to play the Sands in Las Vegas. Shortly before the audience streams in, he tapes printouts of song lyrics and jokes to the floor monitors and music stands. Just like Joan Rivers!
Close to 8 p.m., Mr. Hill starts the show with a bit where he struggles to mount the stage, a slapstick display that he drags out for a few minutes. The crowd is loose by the time he throws himself into the opening number, "About to Break," an upbeat tune written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, the team behind the musical "Hairspray."
"I was afraid that my act had stalled," Mr. Hill sings. "Imagine my shock when my agent called." He starts tap dancing, terribly, just like Rickles, and the trombone player assists with a few fart jokes. The crowd is with him.
"The more you applaud, the less I think about my childhood," he says.
The band begins vamping on the "Family Feud" theme song.
"It's been a long journey, because there are not enough lights, and I can't see my cue cards," Mr. Hill says. "Kids, all kidding aside, I've been in showbiz over 30 years, and if you didn't keep coming to see me -- I'd still be in rehab!"
"We love you!" a woman screams from the audience.
"I can hear you -- we're two feet away from each other!" Mr. Hill says. "I love you, too."
The music changes color as Mr. Hill heads toward the big finish, the part when you go for the heart and hit them with a sentimental ballad. Don Rickles used to do "Laughter for Love." For Totie Fields, it was "I'm Always Chasing Rainbows."
"This is one that I wrote," Mr. Hill says.
Chuckles from the audience.
"That's not a joke, but thank you for laughing."
He launches into "Just Me," which he calls his theme song.
"Some people can't understand what's inside of this man," he sings. "And I'm not so sure I can explain it."
The horn section swells. You can almost feel the spirits of Fields and Rickles looking down approvingly on their unlikely acolyte. Murray Hill, of all people, is entering the stream.
He finishes "Just Me" with one final triumphant "me." The word lands horribly, hilariously flat, and it lingers for a few seconds. It is ridiculous. And beautiful. The crowd at the Kookaburra Lounge erupts.
Are they laughing or choking up? Folks, the answer is -- yes.

Full text: What's a five-letter word for an activity that media and technology companies are increasingly relying on to gain subscribers and keep them coming back?

Apple released a series of word-focused puzzles in its subscription news service last fall. LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, debuted a set of word games this spring. News sites including Morning Brew, The Washington Post, Vox Media and The Boston Globe have added new puzzles beyond the crossword and hired staff to work on games. The publication you are reading has also invested in a collection of brainteasers.
It isn't all fun and games, exactly. For media companies, games are a way to attract new customers as their sites face declining traffic from Google, X and Meta, which have backed away from emphasizing news. For tech companies with editorial offerings, the puzzles are a way to entice new subscribers while engaging existing users who may not return to the apps daily.
"A publication is more than the stories it produces. It's an experience to look forward to, a pleasure," said John Temple, a former journalist and co-founder of Amuse Labs, which sells a software platform that helps publishers create puzzles. "They want to recreate that same satisfying experience for people that they might have had over years of doing a crossword in the newspaper."
Adding games and puzzles has become central to many publishers' strategies over the past few years, with momentum spiking in recent months as Apple and LinkedIn jumped in. As these news and tech companies vie for consumer attention against competitors like Netflix, Spotify and other forms of digital entertainment, others are likely to follow.
Many of the games are not Call of Duty-like shooters or the next Angry Birds. They are often word or logic puzzles, which can help people feel a sense of accomplishment for exercising their intellectual muscles. For companies with editorial products, word games also aren't drastically different from their core businesses.
There are early signs that the games are working. At The New York Times, new subscriptions for non-news products -- which include subscriptions for Games, Cooking, Wirecutter and The Athletic -- surpassed new subscriptions for the core news offering in the first quarter. (The Times doesn't provide numbers for games subscriptions alone.) Apple and LinkedIn said, without giving specifics, that early results were promising.
Publishers have a long history of adding games to their news offerings. For more than a century, newspapers included word games and brain teasers. The New York World published the first crossword on its "Fun" page on Dec. 21, 1913.
An exception was The Times, which promoted itself as "strictly a newspaper for intelligent, thoughtful people." That shifted after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, dragging the United States into World War II. Times editors said that because of the heavy news environment, readers might want a diversion from relentlessly bleak headlines. In February 1942, The Times introduced its first crossword puzzle, which became a hallmark of the paper.
Publishers and tech platforms today have found the news cycle just as challenging, with wars in Israel-Gaza and Ukraine, as well as the looming U.S. presidential election and the culture wars that surround it. News and tech executives have sought to provide at least some refuge, however brief, from what can seem like an endless stream of bad news.
"News and current events are often characterized by things that are intractable," said Ross Trudeau, the puzzles editor at Apple News. "Puzzles are a way of saying some of these problems do have solutions -- even elegant ones."
(Mr. Trudeau comes from a lineage of media bona fides. His parents are Garry Trudeau, best known for creating the "Doonesbury" comic strip, and Jane Pauley, the television news anchor and journalist.)
The Times has had breakout games beyond its crossword puzzle. They include homespun creations like Spelling Bee, where users create as many words as possible with a handful of letters, and Connections, where people group a series of words that have a similar link. In 2022, The Times bought Wordle, a word guessing game that was a surprise hit, from its creator, who was a Reddit engineer. The game went viral when people shared their Wordle scores on social media.
Others have noticed. Last fall, Apple debuted a daily set of crossword puzzles for subscribers to Apple News+, its paid subscription service that curates articles from partner publishers. (The Times left the program in 2020.) Last month, Apple introduced a spelling game, Quartiles, where users spell words based on a jumbled series of fragmented word tiles.
"The more value we add to Apple News+, the more subscribers we bring in, which benefits our publishing partners," said Lauren Kern, the editor in chief of Apple News. Apple has also integrated Apple News+ puzzles into Games Center, its gaming social network, which lets users compete with friends for top scores.
LinkedIn followed with three puzzle games, which are featured prominently on its website and mobile apps. Dan Roth, editor in chief at LinkedIn, said the goal was to keep the content in line with the company's "professional network" brand, while also giving people a reason to regularly return and engage in conversations, both publicly and privately on the site.
"One of the main goals of LinkedIn is to bring people to the site, take the knowledge that's in their heads and share it with their network," Mr. Roth said in an interview. "You sometimes have to prime the pump to get people to start sharing, and adding games is a clear way to do that."
The companies said their approach to making games started with humans. Apple trumpeted its diverse team of puzzle makers and contributors to appeal to a broader audience, and said it tried to avoid crossword jargon in puzzle clues.
LinkedIn hired Paolo Pasco, a longtime crossword constructor and recent Harvard graduate, as its first games editor. The Times has highlighted its games team by showing the often low-tech process of handwriting and crafting the most popular puzzles on the site.
All of these companies are in the business of building new habits for consumers. That's especially true for new casual customers, whom they may bring into their apps with games but hope to keep around long enough to introduce them to other products, such as podcasts, sports -- and even hard news.
"When we see subscribers engage with both games and news in any given week, we're seeing some of the best long-term subscriber retention from that pattern," said Jonathan Knight, head of games at The Times. "So we're doing lots of things to encourage that behavior."
People need to feel good about visiting the apps, many of the companies said, even if it's in the fleeting but satisfying moment of completing a crossword puzzle at a personal best time.
"It's time well spent, and you're deciding how it fits into your life," Mr. Knight said. "You do one puzzle a day. Put it down and come down to the next one when you want. It's a real sense of achievement, and people can feel good about that."

Historians Are the Hidden Force Behind 'Bridgerton': [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Author: Soloski, Alexis

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Described by its showrunner as "definitely a fantasy," the hit series relies on a team of historical consultants. Does the show take their advice? Mostly.
When the first season of the Netflix series "Bridgerton" premiered on Christmas Day, Amanda Vickery sat at home with her three daughters and watched every episode. This was in 2020, in the midst of England's lockdown, and Vickery remembers thinking, "Thank goodness for this escape."
That Vickery could lose herself that way is a particular compliment to "Bridgerton," an enflowered fantasy adapted from the Regency-set romance novels of Julia Quinn. Vickery, a professor at Queen Mary, University of London, is a historian. And "Bridgerton," a show in which empowered women swoon to orchestral versions of Ariana Grande, takes a rather liberal approach to history.
Watching at home, Vickery did not imagine that she would ever work on "Bridgerton," but for this third season, the second installment of which arrives on Thursday, she served as its historical consultant, succeeding her friend and colleague, Hannah Greig, a professor emerita at Royal Holloway, University of London.
Does a show that repurposes Coldplay's "Yellow" as a wedding march really require historians? Yes. Several.
"We're aware that Bridgerton isn't aiming for documentary accuracy," Vickery said during a recent video call, with Greig in an adjoining window. "It is a fantasy, but it's a fantasy that's grounded in an understanding of period." Her role, as she sees it, is to point out potential anachronisms and then let the writers and directors decide from there.
Greig had a slightly different formulation. "You are the on-call geek, the walking encyclopedia," she said. But she and Vickery share a motto of sorts: The show makes choices, not mistakes.
"When they do depart from the absolute letter of history, it's done knowingly and for a reason," Vickery said. "It's intentional."
The Regency period is generally understood as spanning the years from the end of the 18th century to the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837, a period conterminous with Jane Austen's work and a popular setting for romance novels. While the "Bridgerton" writers are broadly aware of the manners and customs of the period, there is an assistant in the writers' room charged with Googling questions (Were there hot air balloons in this period? Yes.) and offering historical tidbits.
There is also a dialogue consultant, John Mullan, another University College London professor. Mullan reviews each script and makes suggestions, helping, as the Season 3 showrunner, Jess Brownell, put it, to "Regency-ify" the speech.
Brownell accepts nearly all of his notes, except when it would take 10 Regency words to replace one modern one. "In that case," she said, "it's just not worth it."
Greig and Vickery also review the scripts in advance. Sometimes they are asked to consult on larger questions, like: What was the social status of a widow in this period? The goal, Vickery said, is not to be "a schoolmistress, telling them off," but instead to give the creative team whatever information they require and offer suggestions that might free them from a plot hole.
Of course, some anachronisms are deliberate. In this Regency it is forever springtime and it very rarely rains. As "Bridgerton" is a progressive fantasy, it allows women significant autonomy and includes of people of color within the highest echelons of English society.
"It's a way of evening out the scales for how much erasure there has been of people of color in Regency times in television and in films," Brownell said.
Most notably, "Bridgerton" cast Golda Rosheuvel, a biracial actress, as Queen Charlotte. While at least one historian has posited the real Queen Charlotte as multiracial, that theory has found little acceptance. In the queen's own time, Vickery noted, Charlotte was perceived as very German and very dull.
"Thankfully, this Queen Charlotte is much more exciting," Vickery said. So exciting that she has inspired a spinoff series, "Queen Charlotte," which departs more enthusiastically from the historical record.
Otherwise, and excepting some pointed omissions, "Bridgerton" hews largely to history. The balls really were this extravagant, and the sex was potentially just as hot. (The sources for this: delightful 18th-century erotica.) Even Queen Charlotte's swan wig has a precedent.
Still, there are dozens of online threads devoted to the ways in which "Bridgerton" diverges from the real Regency -- the hairstyles, the fashions, the smoking. And there are more substantive online arguments, discussions about what it means to diversify the aristocracy retrospectively without a consideration of the real-world racism and colonialism of the time. The show also ignores the political changes taking place elsewhere (the Napoleonic Wars are barely mentioned) and the changes wrought by the Industrial Revolution at home.
"That would be a very, very different show," Vickery said. "That's just not what 'Bridgerton' is trying to do. It's really about female pleasure. Probably 'Bridgerton' thinks more about female pleasure than a lot of aristocratic men did."
Vickery and Greig say that, as viewers, they never experience the discomfort of an apparent anachronism. Mostly because they know to expect it. And they believe that deliberate anachronisms can spark productive conversations among historians and laypeople both. "We are asked many more questions now about what is the real history of race, what is the real history of a relationship between England and South Asia," Greig said. "It actually opens up the conversation in a way that other period dramas might not."
Vickery said that consulting on the show has enriched her work as a historian. The questions of fashion and etiquette that the writers ask often border issues of power, reputation and risk. And she described her visits to the set in vivid terms. "It's astounding," Vickery said. "It's like seeing an army in the field. But you're then asked if you've any notes."
Often they do and often those notes are then incorporated, a gift to any academic.
"Bridgerton is an absolute joy," Greig said. "It's a fiction. It's a fantasy. It's a way of asking ourselves to think differently about the past, and that's one of its great pleasures."

SAN FRANCISCO — What’s a five-letter word for an activity that media and technology companies are increasingly relying on to gain subscribers and keep them coming back?
GAMES
Apple released a series of word-focused puzzles in its subscription news service last fall. LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft, debuted a set of word games this spring. News sites including Morning Brew, The Washington Post, Vox Media and The Boston Globe have added new puzzles beyond the crossword and hired staff to work on games. The publication you are reading has also invested in a collection of brainteasers.
It isn’t all fun and games, exactly. For media companies, games are a way to attract new customers as their sites face declining traffic from Google, the social platform X and Meta, which have backed away from emphasizing news. For tech companies with editorial offerings, the puzzles are a way to entice new subscribers while engaging existing users who may not return to the apps daily.
“A publication is more than the stories it produces. It’s an experience to look forward to, a pleasure,” said John Temple, a former journalist and co-founder of Amuse Labs, which sells a software platform that helps publishers create puzzles. “They want to re-create that same satisfying experience for people that they might have had over years of doing a crossword in the newspaper.”
Adding games and puzzles has become central to many publishers’ strategies over the past few years, with momentum spiking in recent months as Apple and LinkedIn jumped in. As these news and tech companies vie for consumer attention against competitors like Netflix, Spotify and other forms of digital entertainment, others are likely to follow.
Many of the games are not Call of Duty-like shooters or the next Angry Birds. They are often word or logic puzzles, which can help people feel a sense of accomplishment for exercising their intellectual muscles. For companies with editorial products, word games also aren’t drastically different from their core businesses.
There are early signs that the games are working. At The New York Times, new subscriptions for non-news products — which include subscriptions for Games, Cooking, Wirecutter and The Athletic — surpassed new subscriptions for the core news offering in the first quarter. (The Times doesn’t provide numbers for games subscriptions alone.) Apple and LinkedIn said, without giving specifics, that early results were promising.
Publishers have a long history of adding games to their news offerings. For more than a century, newspapers included word games and brain teasers. The New York World published the first crossword on its “Fun” page on Dec. 21, 1913.
An exception was the Times, which promoted itself as “strictly a news paper for intelligent, thoughtful people.” That shifted after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, dragging the United States into World War II. Times editors said that because of the heavy news environment, readers might want a diversion from relentlessly bleak headlines. In February 1942, the Times introduced its first crossword puzzle, which became a hallmark of the paper.
Publishers and tech platforms today have found the news cycle just as challenging, with the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine wars, as well as the looming U.S. presidential election and the culture wars that surround it. News and tech executives have sought to provide at least some refuge, however brief, from what can seem like an endless stream of bad news.
“News and current events are often characterized by things that are intractable,” said Ross Trudeau, the puzzles editor at Apple News. “Puzzles are a way of saying some of these problems do have solutions — even elegant ones.”
(Trudeau comes from a lineage of media bona fides. His parents are Garry Trudeau, best known for creating the “Doonesbury” comic strip, and Jane Pauley, the television news anchor and journalist.)
The Times has had breakout games beyond its crossword puzzle. They include homespun creations such as Spelling Bee, where users create as many words as possible with a handful of letters, and Connections, where people group a series of words that have a similar link. In 2022, the Times bought Wordle, a word guessing game that was a surprise hit, from its creator, who was a Reddit engineer. The game went viral when people shared their Wordle scores on social media.
Others have noticed. Last fall, Apple debuted a daily set of crossword puzzles for subscribers to Apple News+, its paid subscription service that curates articles from partner publishers. (The Times left the program in 2020.) Last month, Apple introduced a spelling game, Quartiles, where users spell words based on a jumbled series of fragmented word tiles.
“The more value we add to Apple News+, the more subscribers we bring in, which benefits our publishing partners,” said Lauren Kern, the editor-in-chief of Apple News. Apple has also integrated Apple News+ puzzles into Games Center, its gaming social network, which lets users compete with friends for top scores.
LinkedIn followed with three puzzle games, which are featured prominently on its website and mobile apps. Dan Roth, editor-in-chief at LinkedIn, said the goal was to keep the content in line with the company’s “professional network” brand, while also giving people a reason to regularly return and engage in conversations, both publicly and privately on the site.
“One of the main goals of LinkedIn is to bring people to the site, take the knowledge that’s in their heads and share it with their network,” Roth said in an interview. “You sometimes have to prime the pump to get people to start sharing, and adding games is a clear way to do that.”
The companies said their approach to making games started with humans. Apple trumpeted its diverse team of puzzle makers and contributors to appeal to a broader audience, and said it tried to avoid crossword jargon in puzzle clues.
LinkedIn hired Paolo Pasco, a longtime crossword constructor and recent Harvard University graduate, as its first games editor. The Times has highlighted its games team by showing the often low-tech process of handwriting and crafting the most popular puzzles on the site.
All of these companies are in the business of building new habits for consumers. That’s especially true for new casual customers, whom they may bring into their apps with games but hope to keep around long enough to introduce them to other products, such as podcasts, sports — and even hard news.
“When we see subscribers engage with both games and news in any given week, we’re seeing some of the best long-term subscriber retention from that pattern,” said Jonathan Knight, head of games at the Times. “So we’re doing lots of things to encourage that behavior.”
People need to feel good about visiting the apps, many of the companies said, even if it’s in the fleeting but satisfying moment of completing a crossword puzzle at a personal best time.
“It’s time well spent, and you’re deciding how it fits into your life,” Knight said. “You do one puzzle a day. Put it down and come down to the next one when you want. It’s a real sense of achievement, and people can feel good about that.”

The Dark Cloud Behind Lighthearted Viral Hits: [Review]

Full text: This three-part Netflix documentary examines the supposed scheme to exploit TikTok dancers -- and proves why cult narratives shouldn't be rushed.
There's a train wreck quality to most documentaries about cults, an invitation to crane your neck at weird rituals, bizarre leaders and peculiar anecdotes. By nature, cults are insular, inscrutable and strange to outsiders. But for those on the inside, every teaching and action seems to follow a logic, to make sense. That's sort of the point.
I've watched a lot of cult documentaries in the past years, and so have a lot of Americans -- they're adjacent to true crime, which makes them perfect streaming fodder. Like many people, I settled in to watch Derek Doneen's three-part documentary series "Dancing for the Devil: The 7M TikTok Cult" (streaming on Netflix) because I realized I'd seen some of the dancers on my own social media feeds, and was baffled to discover that lighthearted dancing to popular oldies could be cultish behavior.
To my surprise, the series made its case by digging behind headlines, exposing how the supposedly controlling and manipulative pastor Robert Shinn found ways to dominate his church members for decades, long before the advent of TikTok. Parishioners tell stories that are disturbing, especially for anyone who's had sustained contact with high-control religious groups -- tales of abuse, extortion, grooming and worse. The series claims that Shinn most recently started a talent management company (called 7M) and attracted beautiful, aspirational young people, and then filched their earnings and kept them under his thumb. (Shinn did not participate in the documentary and denies wrongdoing.) Former 7M dancers as well as former church members describe the tactics they say he used to exploit them. They are chilling.
I happen to know a lot of people who've been in cults, some of whom managed to leave, so I'm extra sensitive to a common flaw of cult documentaries: Sometimes they focus more on the train wreck than on those the train wrecked. This is particularly an issue in feature-length documentaries -- it's tough, in two hours, to explain the entire story and center the survivors, rather than the perpetrator.
Watching "Dancing for the Devil," I realized that this is why a series can be a more effective way to tell a cult narrative. There's breathing room, space to explore the difficult journey away from the manipulation and toward a totally new life. That's not to say that all cult series are good; certainly some still choose the gawking approach. Even "Dancing for the Devil" can occasionally veer in that direction, especially since the dancer at its center, Miranda Derrick, didn't participate in the film, and has said publicly that she feels her life is in danger because of it; her parents and sister are instead the main tellers of her story.
But like HBO's "The Vow" -- a show with a second season that's among the best of the genre -- "Dancing for the Devil" moves away from Derrick's story, spending almost all of its three one-hour episodes exploring the long, complex process of others who left Shinn's church and have been on the bumpy road of healing. The series revisits several of its subjects over a year, so their feelings evolve; it's like watching them change in real time.
That's why "Dancing for the Devil" ends up feeling daring, instructive, thoughtful and moving -- even if it doesn't really solve the central question: What exactly is going on at Shinn's church? Instead, it illustrates the power of focusing on those who left, and how escaping a controlling cult or religious environment can still entail a lifetime of trying to unlearn that programming. To process and unpack the complexities of such an ordeal, cult survivors and their stories ultimately need the same thing: time.

The 'Benevolent Dictator' Who Keeps NBC's Weekly Comedy Circus Going: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: For 50 years, Michaels has managed both the weekly circus of producing "Saturday Night Live" and the broader task of keeping it relevant. How does he do it?
It's 1:01 a.m. on a Sunday morning in May, and Lorne Michaels, the creator and producer of "Saturday Night Live," has just finished the final episode of the 49th season. He spent those 90 minutes pacing backstage, hands in pockets, surveying the actors, allowing himself only an occasional chuckle of satisfaction.
As members of the cast flood onstage to celebrate another year in the books, they enthusiastically hug one another and the evening's host, the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, and musical guest, the pop phenom Sabrina Carpenter.
But on the floor, Michaels, 79, has just concluded his 20th show of the year with resignation: "I only see the mistakes," he says. Some jokes could have landed better, and he is second-guessing his choice to shorten certain skits. He is likely to spend the weekend perseverating about every detail, he says. By Monday, he'll find some degree of contentment -- until he has to do it all over again.
Michaels, through "S.N.L.," has built an entertainment empire that has survived for half a century despite the dismantling of traditional television.
He is loath to call himself a chief executive, but underneath his Canadian humility he has become something of a management guru: He spends his days recruiting supertalents, managing egos, meeting almost impossible weekly deadlines, wading into controversy -- in most cases deftly -- and navigating a media landscape that has put many of his peers out of business.
All the while, unlike most chief executives who have become the face of their brand, he has studiously avoided the spotlight.
"I've spent my life next to things in order to be more in the shadows," Michaels said, describing what management professors might call a servant leadership style. "You're supposed to be making other people look good."
Recruiting may be Michaels's superpower. He has found comedic talent across generations: Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Eddie Murphy, Will Ferrell and Tina Fey.
"Mostly, you're looking for whatever that spark is that says it's original," Michaels said. "It's just an instinct that the way their mind works, something more interesting is going to happen."
Part of his approach is to look beyond the usual suspects, hot comedians in Los Angeles and New York, and instead try to find new talent in the middle of America.
It has gotten harder since the pandemic ravaged many of the live venues that served as farm teams for "S.N.L." stars. The Second City, which sprouted Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Chris Farley and Fey, faced additional pressure over its handling of race and was sold to the private equity firm ZMC in 2021, reportedly for $ 50 million.
This past season, Michaels leaned more on famous hosts, like Kristen Wiig, a former "S.N.L." mainstay, to ease the pressure on its less seasoned cast, he said.
Michaels is well versed in the challenges that new stars face. "If you were the funniest kid in the class, or your school, and then you're working professionally and everyone else in the room is that," he said. "It can be upsetting or can be really stimulating."
Once those talents shoot to great heights, Michaels's job often gets harder, not easier. The hand-holding takes on a different shape.
"No one can handle the fame," Michaels said. "Generally, we're more tolerant of it, but you know people are going to turn into assholes. Because it's just part of that process, because no one grew up that way."
Some in his cast have handled the spotlight more easily than others. Both Belushi and Farley died from drugs at the age of 33 after their runs on the show. Pete Davidson, who left "S.N.L." in 2022, has openly discussed his anxiety and time in rehab.
It's partly Michaels's calm, suggested Paul McCartney, a longtime friend, that makes the weekly comedy circus that is "S.N.L." possible.
"He's a benevolent dictator," said McCartney, who first met Michaels at a party that McCartney hosted at Harold Lloyd's Greenacres estate in Beverly Hills, Calif. "He's got a lot of craziness he has to pull together and select from, and he's got to instill in everyone the feeling that this is going to work."
In a sea of chaos, Michaels reigns over "S.N.L." with practiced discipline. He has never missed a Saturday night, and made it to a table read just after one of his three children was born. There's a weekly routine, including a 6 p.m. Monday meeting at which Michaels introduces the host and Tuesday night at an Italian restaurant.
"The idea that Friday night we still don't have an opening is no longer terrifying," he said. "It's not common, but it's not unusual."
The show often courts controversy but can also run into it by accident, turning Michaels into a sometime crisis manager, like when the musical guest Sinead O'Connor tore up a picture of Pope John Paul II in 1992.
"S.N.L." dropped the comedian Shane Gillis in 2019 after racist slurs that he had made on a podcast came to light. Gillis is now selling out stadiums, and the show brought him back to host this year.
"I think ideas flourish in a moment," Michaels said of the swift backlash and seemingly just as swift forgiveness. "They used to be called manias."
Those who have hosted the show, and Michaels, say its intensity and longevity have created a culture uniquely suited to put it on: The makeup artists transformed an actor into Butt-Head (partner of Beavis) in three minutes; the costume designers created a swift replica of all the clothes from Prince Harry's wedding; the writers grew up watching and now serve as a sounding board for Michaels, who started as a writer himself.
"He's listening -- he's in dialogue with all of these people about what's funny, what's working," the actress Emma Stone, a five-time host, said. "There's like a brain trust over there that he cultivates."
Unlike at most businesses, when things go well at S.N.L., the best people leave. Wiig, Ferrell, Maya Rudolph and others have gone on to huge movie and television careers.
"I met Lorne in '91 or '90," said Chris Rock, whose career went on to include multiple movies with his "S.N.L." co-star Adam Sandler. "I've never been broke since."
Rather than be upset when talent departs, and the challenge the churn creates, Michaels appears to embrace it as part of the model. He says he offers the same advice to all of the biggest names who come to sit on his couch and tell him that they're planning to leave: "Build a bridge to the next thing, and when it's solid enough, walk across. But don't leave on the first thing, because you don't know what's really out there."
Sometimes, even as stars walk across the bridge, they stay within Michaels's orbit. His media company, Broadway Video, produced "30 Rock," "Mean Girls" and "Wayne's World." He plucked Jimmy Fallon from the "S.N.L." cast to host "The Tonight Show," which Broadway Video also produces, alongside the rest of the NBC late-night lineup.
Michaels's wider remit also requires dealing with the industry's harsh economics. NBCUniversal recently cut Seth Meyers's late-night band amid broader industry budget cuts.
"I think everybody had to go through belt tightening," Michaels said of the cuts. "I think the only person who really has faith in the network model right now is Ted Sarandos, who seems to be building one," he added, referring to Netflix's co-chief executive.
NBC has seemingly granted "S.N.L." unusual independence. (The 46th season cost about $ 138 million to produce, according to public filings.) That's likely because, beyond serving as an NBC talent factory, "S.N.L." helps the network remain in the cultural conversation.
The show's 50th season will look to celebrate its grip on media and pop culture. The music producer Mark Ronson and Michaels will produce, effectively, a homecoming at Radio City Music Hall on Feb. 14. There will also be a prime-time special with current and former stars that Sunday. Questlove, the musician and producer, is co-producing a documentary for the anniversary about the imprint of "S.N.L." on music and culture, and Morgan Neville is producing five documentaries on "S.N.L." and Michaels.
The celebration will also inevitably raise questions about Michaels's retirement. The show has mocked the age of both presidential candidates: Donald Trump, 78, and Joseph R. Biden Jr., 81. But as Michaels gears up to spearhead a milestone season, industry insiders have wondered whether he is also preparing for his own "S.N.L." send-off. And they've already begun to speculate who would take his place.
Michaels deflects the question, shifting the spotlight from him to the show: "I'm going to do it as long as I feel I can do it," he said. "But I rely on other people and always have."
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.

Full text: For Jennifer Lopez, Sterling K. Brown, Dakota Johnson and others, the standard publicity push isn't so standard anymore.
In the 1999 rom-com "Notting Hill," the sheepish bookseller played by Hugh Grant goes to a hotel expecting a date with the megawatt star played by Julia Roberts. He is surprised to find he has arrived at a press junket and looks adorably flustered as he's shuffled from room to room, pretending to be a reporter from Horse & Hound to interview the stars of her space movie.
The sequence is a handy introduction to this strange custom of film publicity: actors sitting in sterile suites for a parade of brief interviews. But these days that almost seems quaint. The press tour has taken on a life of its own, with stars like Dakota Johnson, Jennifer Lopez and Zendaya making news for the tour itself with quippy sound bites, inscrutable looks and fashion moments.
It can be grueling for celebrities. Lupita Nyong'o recently described junkets as a "torture technique" in an interview with Glamour. But these cycles can be more entertaining than the movies themselves. Grant's bookseller would be baffled to learn that you can categorize the tours as follows:
The Animosity Tour
The promotion stops for nothing, not even cast members who appear to hate being in one another's company. This seemed to be the case during the cycle for "Atlas," Netflix's new sci-fi flick starring Jennifer Lopez and Sterling K. Brown.
During joint interviews, Brown seemed unable to help himself from making fun of Lopez. In one viral moment, he feigned surprise when she said she was Puerto Rican, before repeating her comfort meal of "rice and beans and like, you know, chicken" in overemphasized Spanish.
In another moment, he jumped in and helped her out when her own Spanish failed her. After supplying the right word, he did a little dance. That clip prompted social-media users to wonder what J. Lo did to Brown. During these interactions Lopez looked perturbed, leaving plenty of room for observers to jump to conclusions.
But their joint appearances cannot hold a candle to the grandmother of animosity tours, the great "Don't Worry Darling" debacle of 2022. Olivia Wilde directed the retro drama, which featured Florence Pugh, and what went unsaid was almost more tantalizing than what was: After rumors of bad blood between the star and the director, Pugh didn't show up for the Venice Film Festival news conference but was spotted strolling around Venice in a purple get-up while Wilde fielded tough questions.
The Flirty Tour
Some actors consider publicity an annoying obligation; Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney embrace it. One way to sell a movie? Sex. Or at least the illusion thereof. So the two leaned into dating rumors when promoting their recent rom-com, "Anyone but You," with some hard-core flirting.
"The two things that you have to sell a rom-com are fun and chemistry. Sydney and I have a ton of fun together, and we have a ton of effortless chemistry," he told The New York Times. "That's people wanting what's on the screen off the screen, and sometimes you just have to lean into it a bit -- and it worked wonderfully. Sydney is very smart."
The flirting method works especially well when the film or show has a romantic element. Fans of the Netflix series "Bridgerton" have been going wild for the chemistry between Nicola Coughlan and Luke Newton as they promote the newest season. Coughlan has called Newton a "lovely friend," but the speculation can't hurt viewership.
Then again, actors can play mortal enemies and still put out exquisitely flirtatious vibes. Case in point: Olivia Cooke and Emma D'Arcy on HBO's "House of the Dragon." During one of their interactions, D'Arcy described their favorite drink as a "negroni, sbagliato, with prosecco in it" and Cooke responded, "Oo, stunnin"' -- a moment that went so viral in 2022 that now fans are eager for whatever publicity pushes the new season may bring.
The Fashion Tour
One group making the most out of lengthy press tours: stylists. Over the past year in particular, creative partnerships between stars and their fashion teams have yielded red carpet looks that are not only beautiful, but also on theme, sometimes even aggressively so.
Margot Robbie was especially committed to recreating the "Barbie" aesthetic offscreen. At every stop, she emerged in a designer look that made references to a classic Barbie outfit. She trotted out an Hervé Léger dress resembling the original doll's striped bathing suit and a Versace ensemble that echoed the kitschy 1985 Day to Night Barbie. The looks were such a hit that Robbie and her stylist Andrew Mukamal put out a Rizzoli book documenting them.
Still, perhaps no one does the fashion tour better than Zendaya and her stylist Law Roach. This year, they've already given us two very different approaches in quick succession for "Dune: Part Two," when she wore futuristic looks that echoed the vibes of that sci-fi hit, and "Challengers," when she remixed tennis wear in support of that romantic triangle.
In an interview with Vogue, Roach called their strategy "method dressing." The crowning achievement was an archival Thierry Mugler robot suit that had mouths agape at the London "Dune" premiere. And the Loewe gown with the silhouette of a tennis player mid-serve for "Challengers" was also pretty excellent.
The Apathy Tour
Sometimes a performer is aware that the movie is a stinker, and yet the press tour is required anyway. That seemed to be the case when Dakota Johnson hit the road for "Madame Web" this year. Did she really hate the movie? Was she just joking around? Or was it somewhere in between?
Whatever Johnson's true intentions were, audiences were glued to the ways in which she seemed to dispassionately discuss the film, telling Seth Meyers with a hint of sarcasm in her voice, "You don't have to know anything at all to watch this movie." She also called the experience of acting against a blue screen with fake explosions "absolutely psychotic." And it was hard not to read more into her declaration that Hollywood is "bleak" when it comes to her own projects given that she was supposed to be shilling for a studio blockbuster based on a third-rate Spider-Man villain.
The Repetitive Tour
When Lady Gaga was promoting "A Star Is Born" in 2018, she repeated one line over and over again. At various stops, Gaga would praise her director and co-star, Bradley Cooper, by saying: "There can be a hundred people in the room and 99 don't believe in you." When you're doing so many interviews, it is natural to repeat yourself, but Gaga was so intent on this refrain that it almost became endearing.
The same went for Josh O'Connor's insistence on bringing up his love for the 2007 Pixar film "Ratatouille" while on the road for "Challengers" and the Italian film "La Chimera." The film app Letterboxd has a series asking celebrities to name their four favorite movies and the last four they watched, on red carpets and at junkets. O'Connor listed "Ratatouille" in both categories. The movie he may have been primarily promoting was Luca Guadagnino's sexy tennis drama, but his adoration of the movie about the chef rat was positively wholesome.

Giving 'Doctor Who' a Dose of Emotion: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: "Give-ING! That dress is giving!" said Ncuti Gatwa with a burst of unbridled laughter. The newest Doctor Who had been shooting the same scene for several hours in Cardiff, Wales, where hangar-like spaces were teeming with crew and filled with sets and equipment for the show. (Yes, Whovians, the TARDIS was parked nearby.) Now, at the director's request, the new Doctor was improvising.
Gatwa (whose first name is pronounced "Shoo-ti") laughs a lot, often at himself. "Why do I keep moving this footstool?" he asked a few minutes later as he tried to get into position for yet another take. "Because the art department isn't here to do it for you," teased Varada Sethu, who joins the Doctor and his current companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson) for some adventures in Gatwa's second season. "I have to do everything myself!" cried Gatwa in a mock-tragic tone, before another eruption of mirth.
Born in Rwanda and raised in Scotland, Gatwa, 31, made his name playing the effervescent Eric in Netflix's "Sex Education." But the lead role in "Doctor Who," a British institution about a time-traveling alien and his human companion that has been a BBC stalwart for 60 years, has taken him to another level of fame.
(Conveniently, the doctor periodically dies and is regenerated in a different physical form; Gatwa is the 15th Doctor, following Matt Smith, David Tennant and Jodie Whittaker.)
The show -- which first ran between 1963 and 1989 -- was revived in 2005 and today has an exceptionally diverse, intergenerational fan base. But the current season, which ends on June 21, has ushered in a new era for the show, with Disney+ now a co-producer alongside the BBC and Gatwa the show's first Black lead actor, with a distinctly fabulous vibe.
The pressures and expectations surrounding these firsts aren't lost on Gatwa, who grew up in a working class home in Dunfermline, Scotland. "'Doctor Who,"' he said, "is something I remember as almost over our heads, something we knew was important culturally, like the royals." His audition "was lovely, but I didn't think I was going to get it," he said. "British casting has taken a long time to diversify -- why would it be now, and why me?"
The anxiety he felt about "getting it right, living up to the amazing people who have done this role," lasted through filming the first season, Gatwa said. "Gradually, it became clear to me that there isn't a mold you need to step into to portray the Doctor," he said. "It can come out of you naturally."
Russell T Davies, who is back as the "Doctor Who" showrunner after masterminding the 2005 reboot, said that although the increased production budget had allowed for more special effects, "it's still me sitting with a script, making good dialogue for actors," he said.
In the past, he added, the Doctor "has been marvelously inexpressive and enigmatic and alien, and great actors have done that very well." But in 2024, "I want a young audience watching, and they talk about their emotions, express their emotions in a healthy way." Then, "along came Ncuti, who is one of those actors who pour with feeling," Davies said. "When he is sad, tears pour from his eyes; when he is happy, that smile lights up the universe."
Viewers who have watched Gatwa's Doctor battle the Maestro (Jinkx Monsoon), perform a song and dance number, stand on a land mine for an entire episode and suit up in Regency attire for a "Bridgerton"-themed episode, are likely to agree. He "truly feels like a Doctor Who for the 21st century," wrote Maya Phillips in The New York Times. He is "stylish and liberated," she added, "with a vibe that is sensual and unbuttoned; he's a Doctor who seems much more at home than the others in his body."
The companion's role is usually "to have the human qualities the doctor lacks," Gibson said, but the relationship between this Doctor and the companion she plays feels different. "Ruby's youth allows him to let out his inner child," she said. "You see that Ruby and the Doctor really care for one another; the way they communicate and laugh is very loving." Gatwa "is a force of nature, just magic," she added. "He has this aura about him that everything can feed off."
On a busy day in April, Gatwa, dressed in a flower-embossed red shirt, was demonstrating Gibson's force-of-nature theory in an interview, gesticulating, laughing uproariously and attempting to eat avocado toast while talking about his past and his career. Even an interruption by an assistant bearing forgotten contact lenses was greeted with incommensurate joy: "Yay! Oh, my God, yessss! Hallelujah, aahhhh, great!"
"You need glasses," she told him. "I know, but I'm so vain," he said plaintively. More laughter.
Born in Kigali, Rwanda's capital, Gatwa was 2 when his parents -- a journalist and a bank manager -- moved to Scotland with their three children to escape the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Largely raised by his mother, he took drama in high school and had an aha moment playing Commander Khashoggi in his school production of "We Will Rock You."
He roared with laughter. "I must have been SOOOO bad! But at that point, I was like, thisssss is what I want to do."
Gatwa said that his family "were one of three Black families we knew in, like, all of Scotland, which I both noticed and didn't notice." But he didn't doubt, he said, that there would be a path for him in the theater: "I always saw a Black actor working."
He spent three years at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland ("I LOVED LOVED LOVED it"), and then a post-graduation year with the Dundee Repertory Theater ("Greek drama to Agatha Christie"). Jobs followed playing Mercutio in "Romeo and Juliet" at the Home theater in Manchester, England, ("where I saw a ghost -- I swear"), and then roles in "Shakespeare in Love" in the West End and in Emma Rice's "946: The Amazing Story of Adolphus Tips."
Gatwa "is obviously one of the most beautiful, charismatic people you will ever meet," Rice said in a video conversation. "But he also has phenomenal emotional depth he brought to every rehearsal and every performance, an incredible work ethic and an amazing ability to talk to the audience."
After "946," Gatwa was suddenly out of work and broke, temping at Harrods, a department store, to make ends meet. He was in his eighth month of sleeping at his best friend's apartment when he got the part of Captain Jack Absolute in a production of Richard B. Sheridan's "The Rivals." Then came the call to audition for "Sex Education."
When he got the job, he said, his primary thought was that he could pay his overdue bills. He had hardly done any screen work before, but discovered that the show, with its ensemble cast, didn't feel too different from a theater group.
"I had never really met someone like him before, so full of life and experience and so buoyant," said Emma Mackey, one of his co-stars. "He took up that space offered and grew into it; we were an alliance, but Ncuti really lead us in that frame of mind."
Ben Taylor, the lead director for Season 1, said that at the first table read, "there was a sigh of relief and also confidence around the table, because Ncuti knew the show possibly before the show knew itself."
Gatwa said that playing Eric, a lovable gay teenager from a religious British-Nigerian family, over four seasons taught him to be braver. "Eric was so dedicated to his authenticity, living his truth. That has permeated into my life," he said.
After "Sex Education" ended, Gatwa played supporting roles in "Masters of the Air" and "Barbie," and one day texted his agent, saying he would "love to play Willy Wonka or Doctor Who." She replied that the "Doctor Who" casting director, Andy Pryor, had just asked him to audition.
"It sounds like a showbiz story, but the last person we saw was Ncuti -- and bang!" Davies said. "I knew then and there that was the man."
Gatwa said that he and Davies didn't have many discussions about his portrayal of the Doctor. "This is a character that is constantly born again, with fresh eyes," he said. "There is an element of innocence within the Doctor. For me, that's where his curiosity comes from, the confidence to explore the unknown in the way kids do."
Asked whether he consciously incorporated more L.G.B.T.Q. elements into Gatwa's first season, Davies pointed out that he has been putting gay characters onscreen for around 30 years. "We never had a sexuality meeting," he said with a laugh. "And the Doctor is an alien, of course -- he's not Ncuti Gatwa, and I think human labels barely apply to him. He loves Ruby with all his heart. He doesn't care what gender people are."
Gatwa had another take. "I feel like 'Doctor Who' has always been a bit camp," he said. "I mean, it's a time-traveling alien in a British police box!"

"I didn't think I was going to get it," he said. "British casting has taken a long time to diversify. Why would it be now, and why me?" Gatwa made his name in "Sex Education," below with Asa Butterfield.

As the third season of Netflix's period drama "Bridgerton" resumes Thursday, we find Penelope Featherington dizzy from Colin Bridgerton's sudden marriage proposal. Will these old friends make it to the altar? Will Colin discover Penelope's earth-shattering secret? And most important of all: Who's their real estate agent?
While the show is set in London, astute fans may recognize the stately Featherington house as No. 1 Royal Crescent, an 18th-century rowhouse in Bath, England. And while the Bridgerton house is meant to be just across the street, in real life it's Ranger's House, a museum located in London's Greenwich neighborhood.
So, what do the Bridgerton and Featherington property portfolios look like? AgentAdvice, a service providing research and education to real estate professionals, calculated the values of the real-life buildings depicted as "Bridgerton" residences by using local median prices per square foot.
The market price of the 14,000-square-foot 1 Royal Crescent is $ 6.3 million, based on the current median of $ 448 per square foot in Bath. Ranger's House is a bit more valuable: $ 8 million, at $ 560 per square foot. Obviously, Queen Charlotte takes the crown for home value: The 16th-century Hampton Court Palace, in the London borough of Richmond, was home to King Henry VIII and all his six wives. Its estimated worth, at $ 790 a square foot, is over $ 560 million.
Like all the locations in this week's chart, Hampton Court Palace is a preserved national treasure, and not coming to market anytime soon. But you don't need to buy it -- all the properties here are open to the public for visits.

Full text: The deal is a rare example of a traditional Hollywood studio owning a movie theater chain.
Sony Pictures Entertainment is acquiring Alamo Drafthouse Cinema and will manage its 35 locations, a rare example of a traditional Hollywood studio's owning a theater chain.
The deal, announced Wednesday, followed the Justice Department's decision in 2020 to rescind the so-called Paramount consent decrees -- movie distribution rules dating to 1949 that forced the largest Hollywood studios to sell off their theater holdings. Those rules were intended to prevent studios from controlling the film business, from creation to exhibition.
In 2019, the Justice Department's antitrust chief at the time, Makan Delrahim, said changes in the entertainment industry "made it unlikely that the remaining defendants can reinstate their cartel." Sony's move could open the door to similar deals by other leading studios. In recent years, Netflix, the leading streaming company, has bought theaters to show films.
Alamo, the seventh-largest theater chain in North America, operates theaters in 25 metro areas across the United States and has invested in distinctive programming and food offerings in an attempt to lure in moviegoers away from major multiplexes.
The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Sony bought Alamo from Altamont Capital Partners and Fortress Investment Group, as well as the chain's founder, Tim League. Mr. League said the dine-in movie theater chain was "beyond thrilled" about the deal.
It comes at a time of financial trouble for Alamo and for the movie theater business as a whole. Several of Alamo's franchised locations filed for bankruptcy and closed this month, making Sony's move a potential lifeline for the struggling chain. Alamo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2021 before a private equity firm stepped in.
The cinemas will still operate under the Alamo Drafthouse brand, Sony said, though they will be managed by a newly formed division at Sony led by Michael Kustermann, Alamo's chief executive.
"Alamo Drafthouse has always held the craft of filmmaking and the theatrical experience in high esteem, which are fundamental shared values between our companies," said Tom Rothman, the chief executive of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group.
The industry has grappled with multiple headwinds in recent years, as the pandemic caused a slump in box office receipts -- and, more recently, a dismal start to the summer blockbuster season -- while Hollywood strikes chipped away at the number of movies that studios churned out.
Ticket sales in the United States and Canada for the year to date total just over $ 2.8 billion, a 26 percent decline from the same period last year, according to Comscore.

'Bridgeton' Picks Up After the Carriage Scene: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Colin Bridgerton and Penelope Featherington are on their way to a happy ending -- but Lady Whistledown is still a huge barrier in this "friends to lovers" story.
The first half of "Bridgerton" Season 3 left viewers on a cliffhanger -- and a little hot and bothered -- with Colin Bridgerton and Penelope Featherington finally giving in to their desires in the very climactic Carriage Scene.
With that will they/won't they out of the way, plenty of questions still remain. Will Penelope and Colin actually get married? Will Eloise spill Penelope's big secret? Can Lady Whistledown continue to hide her true identity? With the second half of Season 3 upon us, here's a quick refresher on where things stand in Netflix's version of Regency-era London.
Colin and Penelope's Flirtation
Because the series more or less follows the plot of the novels, many fans knew that a Colin-Penelope (Polin, if you're on BridgertonTok and have listened to "Espresso" by Sabrina Carpenter too many times) romance was in the works from the beginning. Throughout the first two seasons of the show, Colin and Penelope were relatively close friends connected by Eloise Bridgerton, Colin's sister and Penelope's bestie. In the "Bridgerton" universe, where the separation of unmarried men and women is mandated, the familial tie gave them occasion to interact.
At the end of Season 2, Penelope overheard Colin telling his friends he "would never dream of courting" her. When Season 3 picked up, we learned that Colin traveled around Europe by himself during the summer and that he wrote letters to Penelope -- a tradition they had maintained since Season 1 -- but that she didn't respond. When Colin confronted her about the letters, she told him she had overheard his insult.
Penelope's New Groove
Preparing for courting season, Penelope underwent a makeover moment, the so-called "Bridgerton glow-up," changing her hair and clothing in the hopes of landing a marriage proposal.
In an attempt to repair their friendship, Colin offered to teach Penelope how to flirt. To nobody's surprise, Colin become attracted to Penelope -- but he wasn't the only one.
When Colin found out that Penelope might get a marriage proposal from Lord Debling (Sam Phillips), he chased after her.
That Carriage Scene
The last scene of the fourth episode, the final one before the show's break, finally exploded the sexual tension between Colin and Penelope. Though it took place in a carriage, it didn't match the carriage scene from the book, so there is likely more steaminess ahead in the second half of the season.
After Colin and Penelope got into some shenanigans that helped earn the show its TV-MA rating, he finally proposed marriage. When the carriage abruptly stopped at Colin's house, he asked her to come in with him. She declined, because his family might see them, to which he responded, "for God's sake, Penelope Featherington, are you going to marry me or not?"
As we know from past seasons, marriage is often only the first step of a relationship in the Regency era, so the Polin love story is really only just beginning.
Lady Whistledown Fallout
Lady Whistledown, voiced by Julie Andrews, has been the show's constant, the all-knowing narrator tying together story lines. The character started off as a sort of Regency-era "Gossip Girl," a mysterious writer who pens a pamphlet detailing society happenings under a nom de plume. Her identity remained unknown until Eloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie) figured it out in Season 2.
That season began with Eloise, then Penelope's best friend, seeking out Lady Whistledown, based on their shared distaste of high society norms. Separately, Queen Charlotte also sought to uncover Whistledown's identity and, after spotting Eloise near the print shop, suspected she might have solved the mystery. Attempting to clear Eloise, Whistledown (a.k.a. Penelope) revealed that Eloise had been going to political rallies, a besmirching of the Bridgerton name that Eloise surely wouldn't have publicized if she were the real Whistledown.
But Penelope's disclosure backfired. In the last episode of Season 2, Eloise discovered that Penelope was Whistledown and ended their friendship. The shunning continued into the third season, even as Eloise's brother got very involved in Penelope's life.
What's Next?
Because it is a love story, we know that Colin and Penelope will end up together, so the real question is: how?
The other big question: How is Colin going to react when he finds out that Penelope is Lady Whistledown? We know that Colin does not like Whistledown and has made it his mission to figure out her true identity, so clearly there are some hurdles to Polin's happy ending. Also, now that Penelope is about to become a Bridgerton, will she mend her relationship with her soon-to-be sister-in-law Eloise?

This Prosecutor Wouldn't Kill a Colleague, Would He?: [Review]

Full text: Jake Gyllenhaal steps in for Harrison Ford in a new, highly strung adaptation of Scott Turow's legal thriller for Apple TV+.
Scott Turow's first novel, the 1987 best seller "Presumed Innocent," is a clever murder mystery and courtroom drama with an 11th-hour twist. Before that denouement, it throws out red herrings to distract us, paralleling the strategy of its protagonist, Rusty Sabich, a prosecutor accused of killing the female colleague with whom he was having an affair. The 1990 film adaptation starring Harrison Ford necessarily condensed Turow's plot but stayed true to its outlines and to the identity of the killer, a closely guarded secret through most of the story.
It's possible that the new "Presumed Innocent," premiering Wednesday on Apple TV+ and starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Sabich, ends up at the same place, with the same killer. But after watching seven of its eight episodes, I didn't really care. The claustrophobic atmosphere, the emphasis on psychology and trite family drama over well-made mystery and, especially, the crescendoing melodrama that makes a mockery of Turow's courtroom credibility (even though he is credited as a co-executive producer) had done me in.
The book is narrated in the first person by Sabich, and its most striking stylistic feature is his continual, detailed analyses of his professional and personal lives. Those passages are not there just for their own sake -- Turow uses them to ground us in the milieus and the motivations of the courtroom and the prosecutors' office. He cares about the inner life of Sabich, but he cares just as much about providing the framework for a page-turning mystery.
Onscreen, the emphases have been different. Alan J. Pakula's film was a chilly affair, elegantly assembled (with cinematography by the great Gordon Willis) but lacking the juice of a real thriller. It was more interested in the ethical and philosophical ramifications of Sabich's situation, favoring judgment over action. (It was fun to watch once the case got into the courtroom, though, thanks to the performances of Raul Julia and Paul Winfield as defense lawyer and judge.)
David E. Kelley, the veteran television writer who created the "Presumed Innocent" series, has the opposite temperament from Pakula -- he's all about the juice. He's a master of taking material with a lurid or sensational edge and slickly packaging it for a mainstream TV audience. When he's in his relaxed mode, on "The Lincoln Lawyer" for Netflix or the risibly pulpy "Big Sky" for ABC, the results can be entertaining, summoning distant memories of his days as chief writer on "L.A. Law."
When he takes things more seriously, though, he gets in trouble (though it doesn't necessarily affect his success, as "Big Little Lies" demonstrated). Like Pakula, he makes "Presumed Innocent" more about Sabich than about the presumably less interesting question of whether Sabich is guilty of murder. But all he has to offer are tortured psychology and transgression, presented slickly and repetitively, with head-scratching surprises in place of new ideas. Meant to be provocative, it's just wearying.
Given five and a half hours to play with, Kelley restores plot points that were cut from the movie and adds his own, some of which almost immediately change the basic terms of Turow's mystery plot. (A major turning point involving tubal ligation is now moot.) He ups the frequency and steaminess of the flashback sex scenes between Sabich and the victim, Carolyn Polhemus (Renate Reinsve), while nearly eliminating evidence of either her competence or her ambition, which are essential to the plot.
And when the case goes to court, Kelley's penchant for loony melodrama kicks in, as bodies drop and decisions are made that violate all the rules of sensible procedure that we've learned from more sober legal dramas. (We should stipulate that Kelley, a former lawyer, has sensationalized courtroom action for the last 40 years across multiple shows.)
While Polhemus doesn't come into focus as much more than a sex object, the real victims in this "Presumed Innocent" are the performers. In contrast to Ford's closed-in, monochromatic performance in the film, where Sabich seemed dumbfounded to be accused of murder, Gyllenhaal is sweaty, jumpy and over the top, playing a Sabich who seems alternately terrified and royally offended, swinging between anguished apologies and violent outbursts.
The wonderful actress Ruth Negga plays Sabich's nobly, glumly suffering wife, Barbara, about as well as anyone could (as the character is written, Negga can't match the delicacy of Bonnie Bedelia's performance in the film), while Peter Sarsgaard struggles to make something more than a cartoon out of Sabich's nemesis, the epically insecure prosecutor Tommy Molto. Bill Camp gives some life to the more straightforward role of Ray Horgan, Sabich's boss and mentor, and O-T Fagbenle has a shifty, oddly engaging quality as Ray's rival in the prosecutors' office.
Published and first adapted nearly four decades ago, "Presumed Innocent" has a problem it shares with other stories from the late 1980s: It is based on the notion of a predatory, promiscuous woman who threatens society by seducing a solid suburban man and thereby ends up dead.
This is another reason, beyond Kelley's dramatic instincts, that the new series doesn't focus in a satisfying way on the mystery at its heart. In 2024, a story like this has to be -- or at least is very likely to be -- an allegory for what's known as cancel culture. Gyllenhaal's Sabich, his life suddenly turned upside down by an accusation, is also suddenly denigrated for his hubris: "You're Rusty Sabich, and you can do whatever you want"; "Let's send you to a doctor and get a diagnosis, but my fear is that it will just come back pig." His desperation is less about proving his innocence than it is about proving his moral bona fides. The revelation of who killed Carolyn Polhemus, if and when it comes, feels as if it will be just a piece of accounting.

The Uncertain Future of the Vision Pro: [Correction]

Full text: The $ 3,500 "spatial computing" device has gathered dust on my shelf. Can tweaks and upgrades save it from obsolescence?
When I first got my hands on an Apple Vision Pro early this year, it felt like magic.
I loved the $ 3,500 "spatial computing" headset, even though I couldn't really figure out what it was for. For weeks, I took it everywhere, enduring judgmental glares (or were they jealous stares?) from colleagues at the office, strangers at coffee shops and fellow passengers on airplanes. I even used the Vision Pro in the back seat of a self-driving Waymo car, which I believe qualifies me for some kind of "Mr. San Francisco" award.
But novelty fades, and today I barely use the Vision Pro at all. Every few weeks, I strap it to my head to do some focused writing, or watch a movie in bed while my wife sleeps. Otherwise, it sits on a shelf collecting dust.
Apple hasn't released sales figures, but analysts' estimates suggest that the device has been a flop, selling fewer units than expected. Social media isn't buzzing with videos of enthusiastic "Vision Bros" wearing their headsets in public, as it was in the days after the device's release. Some early adopters returned their Vision Pros for refunds, and lightly used headsets are selling for as little as $ 2,500 on resale websites.
When I took a casual poll of other Vision Pro owners I know -- mostly journalists and tech workers -- I learned that few of them were using theirs, either.
"Haven't touched mine in a month," one friend texted. "It's a shame, I was so bullish."
At its annual developer conference on Monday, Apple announced a few new features for the Vision Pro, including a new version of its VisionOS operating system, new gesture controls and a way of turning old photos into 3-D "spatial photos" that can be viewed on the device. Apple also said it would soon begin selling the Vision Pro in countries including China, Japan and Britain.
But these were modest tweaks, not the sweeping overhaul that many Vision Pro fans were hoping for. And the Vision Pro got upstaged by Apple's newer, shinier project -- generative A.I., which the company is calling "Apple Intelligence" and is pushing into many of its products and services, including a souped-up version of Siri that will be available on iPhones this year.
It's enough to make me wonder: Is Apple giving up on the device that, just months ago, its executives were heralding as the future of computing?
You probably don't own a Vision Pro, so I won't bore you with a full list of my gripes about the product, or the reasons I suspect that Apple is losing interest in it. But here are a few of its most glaring shortcomings:
The first, and most obvious, is the cost. Apple may consider $ 3,500 a fair price for a first-generation device. (It may even be a fair price, considering all the pricey, cutting-edge components that are packed in.) But $ 3,500 is simply more than the vast majority of consumers will consider spending on an experimental device that doesn't replace their smartphone or laptop, and that doesn't fill an obvious need in their life.
I don't mind the headset itself, although, as many reviewers have pointed out, it's too heavy to be worn comfortably for long stretches. (My longest Vision Pro session was three hours, and I felt slightly hung over afterward.) But there are plenty of other annoying hardware issues. Carrying around an external battery pack is a bummer, it doesn't work well in dark or dimly lit rooms, and there's no good way to input text -- so if you want to use the Vision Pro for any kind of text-based work, you have to use a Bluetooth keyboard.
The Vision Pro also still lacks some basic features. You can't make or receive phone calls with it, the way iPhone users can with the Mac and the iPad. The Vision Pro is compatible only with Apple's Magic Trackpad, not with Bluetooth mice. And the guest mode -- the way you show the Vision Pro to your friends, when they ask to try it for themselves -- is a mess. (This week, Apple announced that the next version of the Vision Pro's operating system, which will arrive this year, will have improved mouse support and a better guest user experience.)
But the biggest disappointment with the Vision Pro is how few good apps there are. Several months after its debut, there's still no native YouTube or Netflix app. There's no Spotify, no Instagram, no DoorDash. (You can still use some of these services in a web browser, or use unofficial third-party apps, but it's a worse experience.)
Some of these apps are missing because of corporate infighting. (Google and Meta, for example, have their own virtual reality ambitions and presumably don't want to give Apple's product a boost by making apps for it.) But others amount to a lack of confidence. Developers don't want to make apps for platforms that nobody uses, and their reluctance so far -- only about 2,000 apps have been developed for the Vision Pro, Apple said on Monday -- says something about the device's tepid reception.
Apple has also been slow to update its own offerings for the Vision Pro, like a series of "immersive videos," filmed on special 3-D cameras and released through Apple TV. These videos -- which included a prehistoric nature film and a "rehearsal room" video of Alicia Keys and her band as they perform a song -- were designed to show off the Vision Pro's high-definition graphics and its "spatial audio" feature, and they are among the best things you can do with a Vision Pro.
But Apple hasn't released new immersive videos at a regular clip. And once you run out, what you end up watching on the Vision Pro is mostly the same two-dimensional stuff you'd watch on a TV or an iPad. It's fun to throw on the Vision Pro occasionally to watch "Dune: Part Two" on a screen the size of a basketball court, but most of the time, it's not worth the trouble.
I still think the Vision Pro is a remarkable piece of technology. Every friend who has tried mine on has oohed and aahed, and said how futuristic it felt. (Although tellingly, none have gone out and bought their own.) And if Apple is content to have the Vision Pro remain a niche entertainment device, that's its right.
But if Apple wants the Vision Pro to appeal to the masses, it needs to make some changes. It should lower the price. (Yes, even if it means selling headsets at a loss.) It should fix the bugs, polish the rough spots and release more immersive content. Most urgently, it should find and fund potential killer apps -- new games, productivity tools and entertainment experiences that take advantage of the Vision Pro's features, and that could be reason enough for a person to buy one.
In fairness, the Vision Pro is still new, and other Apple products have taken a generation or two to find their footing. (The Apple Watch famously fizzled when it was launched as a high-end fashion accessory, until Apple discovered that fitness tracking was the killer feature.) The company has said repeatedly that it considers the Vision Pro an early experiment -- "tomorrow's technology today," as Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, put it -- not a fully formed product.
But I worry that the Vision Pro has slipped into a dangerous purgatory. It's not Apple's flashiest new project -- that's all the A.I. stuff, which Wall Street is clamoring for and which many users are excited about. And it's not one of Apple's big, established cash cows, like the iPhone or the iPad, that people will buy even if each version is only slightly better than the last.
To live up to its potential, the Vision Pro needs a little more love and, well, a little more vision. Apple needs better answers to basic questions like: What is this for? How will it improve my life, or make me more productive than other things I could buy for $ 3,500? What can I do on it that I can't do on my laptop, or a big TV?
Otherwise, the Vision Pro may be destined for obsolescence. And I and my fellow Vision Bros may emerge as the Google Glassholes of 2024 -- a brave but ultimately foolish tribe of nerds who took a gamble on a futuristic new technology and lost.

Full text: Popular shows including "Love Is Blind," the "Real Housewives" universe and "Vanderpump Rules" are being challenged in court amid a changing legal landscape.
Tran Dang sued the makers of the Netflix dating series "Love Is Blind" over allegations of "false imprisonment," saying it confined her and the rest of the cast to hotel rooms without their phones. She also accused a fellow cast member of groping her and exposing himself.
Bravo's "Real Housewives" universe has inspired a string of lawsuits, as the drama and battles have moved from TV screens to social media to tabloids to court dockets. Caroline Manzo, who had signed on to appear in a spinoff, accused the companies behind the show of failing to intervene when a co-star forcibly groped and kissed her during filming, and charged that they "regularly ply the Real Housewives cast with alcohol, cause them to become severely intoxicated" and then encourage or allow them to "sexually harass other cast members because that is good for ratings."
And Faith Stowers, a former member of the cast of "Vanderpump Rules," a spinoff of "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills," sued the companies behind the show, claiming that after she had reported instances of racism, harassment and another cast member brandishing a knife at her, the show had retaliated against her by making her role unpaid.
Reality TV is fueled by on-camera insults, extreme drunkenness, aggressive sexual behavior and physical confrontations that would instantly spark human resources complaints or lawsuits in most workplaces. The industry has long shielded itself from litigation with tightly written contracts laden with nondisclosure agreements and provisions requiring closed-door arbitration proceedings to settle any disputes.
But that could be changing. The #MeToo-era has opened new legal avenues: A 2022 federal law gives an employee who makes allegations of sexual assault or harassment the right to resolve disputes through the courts even if their contract calls for arbitration. And last year's Hollywood strikes prompted new calls for reality stars to unionize, or at least be paid more. High-profile lawyers taking on the industry in court speak of a "reckoning."
"In some cases, the behavior that is being targeted seems like the bread and butter of reality TV," said Danielle Lindemann, a sociologist who wrote the book "True Story: What Reality TV Says About Us."
Much of the recent scrutiny has focused on Andy Cohen, an executive producer of "The Real Housewives" franchise since it started in the mid-2000s who has became famous in his own right for appearing in boisterous reunion shows with cast members, hosting the talk show "Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen" and appearing, sometimes tipsily, with Anderson Cooper on CNN's New Year's Eve broadcasts.
In February, a former cast member on "The Real Housewives of New York City," Leah McSweeney, filed a lawsuit against Bravo and Cohen, claiming that despite her well-known struggle with alcoholism, the show's producers had encouraged her to relapse in an effort to boost ratings, and then declined to cast her again after she complained that the production was working against her efforts to stay sober. She also claimed that Cohen had used cocaine with cast members. A lawyer for Cohen, Orin Snyder, said that her lawsuit was "littered with false, offensive and defamatory statements" and denied that Cohen had ever used cocaine with cast members.
Bravo said that an outside investigation had found that McSweeney's allegations against Cohen were "unsubstantiated." In court papers, it denied that producers had pushed McSweeney to drink and asserted its right to choose casts as it sees fit.
Cohen has gone on a publicity blitz, appearing on the covers of The Hollywood Reporter and New York Magazine, which proclaimed him "The Last Inappropriate Man on Television." (Denying the cocaine allegations, he told New York that "If you read my books, I tell you every drug I do.") But McSweeney's case against him, and others against Bravo, are still pending.
A lawyer for McSweeney, Gary Adelman, questioned Bravo's investigation, saying that his client had not been contacted for it. Her complaint, like several others, challenges the enforceability of the clause in her contract that pushes disputes into private arbitration.
"Arbitration clauses are used as a sword, not as a method of justice, in our opinion," Adelman said in an interview.
Even as it fights the recent round of lawsuits in court, the reality TV industry has made some conciliatory responses.
Netflix and the production companies behind "Love Is Blind" recently agreed to a $ 1.4 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by a former participant, Jeremy Hartwell, whose lawyers calculated that those featured on the show were paid about seven dollars an hour, less than half of minimum wage in California, and argued that contestants should be treated like employees. The settlement is subject to the court's approval.
And last fall, NBCUniversal, which owns Bravo, said that it had updated its policies, imposing stricter rules on alcohol consumption and more serious consequences for violence and offering more psychological support. Bravo defended confidentiality clauses as standard, saying that they are intended to prevent spoilers of shows before they air.
But networks and production companies are also fiercely defending themselves, characterizing the lawsuits in court documents as frivolous and aggressively fighting challenges to the contracts that have long made the industry tick.
"When you freely sign a contract not under duress, it's difficult to get out of that," said Angela Angotti, a lawyer who co-hosts a podcast about legal issues in reality television called "The Bravo Docket."
Reality TV stars are generally employed as independent contractors, and they tend to make much of their money through the sponsorships and publicity that result from their exposure. But last year's Hollywood strikes prompted current and former cast members to question that arrangement.
Bethenny Frankel, who has made a career out of her reality TV fame, including on "The Real Housewives of New York City," called for unionization of reality TV stars, accusing the industry of exploiting its talent for profit and encouraging destructive onscreen behavior.
"You do something bad, and you do something negative -- you are rewarded for that behavior," Frankel said last year in an episode of her podcast. "You fall off the wagon? The cameras fly in. You get a divorce? Yay! You go bankrupt? Wonderful!"
A team of high-profile Hollywood lawyers who started working with Frankel, led by Bryan Freedman, ratcheted up the temperature, sending -- and publicizing -- a legal letter to NBCUniversal. "Please be advised that the day of reckoning has arrived," the letter warned.
One of the clients they took on was Stowers, the former "Vanderpump Rules" cast member who accused the production of retaliation. Her lawsuit, filed in April, takes aim at clauses in her contract that her lawyers say "gag" cast members, preventing "them from speaking out about unlawful conduct they witness or experience, and threaten ruinous penalties for even minor breaches of confidentiality." Representatives for Bravo did not respond to requests for comment on the suit.
"Love Is Blind," the buzzy dating show in which singles date each other from separate "pods," meeting face to face after agreeing to get engaged, is also facing a number of lawsuits.
In his class-action case, Hartwell, who said he was involved with the show for about a week in 2021, not only called for participants to be treated like employees, but charged that the show plied cast members with alcohol and withheld food and sleep to try to encourage "manipulated decisions for the benefit of the show's entertainment value."
Such lawsuits could hurt ratings, if viewers decide that their guilty pleasures are in fact exploitative. An article about the woes of reality TV in The New Yorker was headlined: "Is 'Love Is Blind' a Toxic Workplace?" The show's creator, Chris Coelen, pushed back on some of the claims made by the participants-turned-plaintiffs in a recent interview with New York Magazine. "You are not a prisoner," he said. "We don't push alcohol."
In two other lawsuits filed against "Love Is Blind," lawyers for the show's producers have fought aggressively to uphold contracts that require arbitration, with some success.
In March, a judge in Los Angeles ordered a dispute involving a former contestant, Renee Poche, to be dealt with in private arbitration because of the contract she signed.
In court papers Poche accused the production of allowing her to get engaged, in front of TV cameras, to a man "who was unemployed with a negative balance in his bank account" and "actively addicted to drugs and alcohol." The man, Carter Wall, who was not named as a defendant, said in an interview that he felt Poche's depiction of his substance use was a "stretch."
Poche's complaint said that after she had made "limited public remarks about her distressing time on the program," Delirium, one of the companies behind the production, initiated arbitration proceedings against her, accusing her of violating her nondisclosure agreement and seeking $ 4 million. (Her suit said she had earned a total of $ 8,000 on the program.)
A lawyer for the show argued in court filings that the lawsuit was a "media stunt" and suggested that Poche, who is represented by Freedman and his team, had violated the nondisclosure agreement because she was disappointed at having been largely cut from the show. Her suit called her contract "illegal and unenforceable." But citing the contract, a judge said that the matter should go to arbitration.
Arbitration clauses like the one in the Poche case tend to be upheld by courts, legal experts said. But the new federal law allowing employees with accusations of sexual assault and harassment to settle their disputes in court could change the field.
In Dang's case against "Love Is Blind," a lawyer for the man she accused of groping her and exposing himself to her said that he denies the allegations. Lawyers for the production objected to the claim that the show's participants qualify as traditional employees, denied liability for the man's conduct and disputed Dang's allegations of "false imprisonment," saying in court papers that she "had the ability to come and go and visit family and quit when she wanted." They sought to take the dispute to arbitration despite the 2022 federal law.
But in April, an appellate court in Texas, where Dang's season was filmed, ruled in her favor, finding that the recent federal law meant that she could bring her claims of sexual assault to court instead of to the arbitration her contract called for.
The same law has been cited in the "Real Housewives" lawsuit filed by Manzo, which claims that a co-star, Brandi Glanville, forcibly kissed her, mounted her and groped her during filming in Morocco on a "Real Housewives" spinoff. "They saw that I was in distress," Manzo wrote of the production in court papers, "and yet, they continued to film."
Glanville, who was not named as a defendant, recently called the allegations "false and defamatory," and in an interview with Entertainment Tonight she objected to the long days that were "fueled with alcohol."
In a motion to dismiss Manzo's lawsuit, lawyers representing Bravo and the other companies behind the show said that after Manzo reported the encounter, Glanville was separated from the cast. They also pointed to part of her contract in which she "acknowledged that she may encounter speech or physical contact that she may consider offensive, including from other cast members, and 'assumed all risks' associated with the show."
The network cited a New York trial court decision from 2013 in which a judge dismissed a complaint from a plastic surgeon who had signed a contract to participate on the reality show "Mob Wives," writing that the surgeon had assumed a certain amount of risk when agreeing to participate in a kind of program in which it is "generally accepted that the behavior may be outlandish or provocative."
Lawyers representing reality TV stars say that their clients do not shy away from the outlandish and provocative, but draw the line at violations of the law.
"Have fun, say crazy things," said Derek Smith, a lawyer representing Manzo. "But outrageous, outlandish behavior should never ever include illegal behavior."
Determining the difference may ultimately be up to the courts.

Her Career Is Hot. She's Cool With That.: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The actress, who stars with Glen Powell, said that with the contract-killer movie, her ideas were finally valued in a writer's room.
Editor's note: Spoilers ahead.
Adria Arjona doesn't like doing what she's told.
The co-star of the new Netflix romantic action comedy "Hit Man," Arjona accompanied her father, the Guatemalan Mexican singer-songwriter Ricardo Arjona, on tour from the time she was young. It was a musical mentorship opportunity, so she ended up deciding early on: Music was out.
He also made her read the poems of Pablo Neruda and the work of Gabriel García Márquez, so naturally, she said, all she wanted to do was listen to 'N Sync.
"I do everything backwards," Arjona, 32, said on a recent weekday morning over sparkling water at the Whitby Bar in Midtown Manhattan. "That's just my personality -- I just listen to my intuition. It's not like I'm doing it on purpose or trying to be rebellious."
In "Hit Man," directed by Richard Linklater, Arjona is Madison Masters, a desperate housewife who tries to hire a hit man, played by Glen Powell, unaware he's a police operative. The rapturously reviewed movie is the latest entry in a 12-year-long acting career that has suddenly become white hot.
She broke out in 2022 as the mechanic Bix Caleen in the streaming "Star Wars" series "Andor," playing Cassian Andor's fearless friend. (Season 2 of the Disney+ series, which she's finished filming, is expected next year.) She also appeared as the betrothed daughter in the 2022 reboot of "Father of the Bride," after roles in "Pacific Rim: Uprising" and Season 2 of "True Detective."
But it was only with "Hit Man," she said, that a director truly seemed to value her input.
"As a Latin American actress, I feel like I've often made myself smaller. Like, 'I'm so lucky to be here; I don't want to ruffle things too much,"' said Arjona, who was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and lived in Mexico City until she was 12. "But Rick made me feel like, 'Don't make yourself smaller, you're so much bigger."'
During an hourlong conversation, in which Arjona, a former dancer, sat with her legs tucked beneath her on a sofa, watching passers-by outside the window, she was relaxed, casual and quick to laugh.
She discussed her differences with Linklater, where you might be able to catch her onstage and what her father thinks of her latest hobby. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
"Hit Man" looks like it was so much fun to make. Was it?
It was! I'd never worked with Rick, but I always loved how actors in his movies had all this beautiful, philosophical, intellectual banter that felt improvised. And then I met Rick, and he hates improv. Every decision is made in a rehearsal, so once you get to set it makes the process a lot more fun. He really made me believe my ideas were important -- that I had good ideas -- and a lot of them ended up in the movie.
What was an idea that you pitched for Madison?
There's a lot of dialogue that's very much mine -- ours; it was a collaboration between Rick and I. One day in rehearsal, I was like, "You know, Anohni and the Johnsons, they have this live concert, and in one of the songs she starts talking about how the moon can affect the oceans and not affect us." And Rick and I had this whole conversation about how there's no way that that could be it, and it ended up in the movie -- that's the conversation me and Glen have as we're going into the club.
Even the sex scenes -- you have no say as a female actor what those scenes are going to entail. But because I was in the writer's room, I had a lot of say in what we were going to do and how we were going to do it. I was impressed that a filmmaker of that caliber would be like, "What do you want to do?"
Glen Powell has told the story of your first meeting lasting five hours over shots of tequila during Dry January. How did it start off?
The way Rick tells the story, I was the only girl, but he didn't tell me this. This is Richard Linklater we're talking about. He was like, "I really want you to meet Glen," and -- I don't know this -- but it's really for Glen to be like, "This is or isn't the girl." So I get to the restaurant, we're both doing Dry January and we hit it off right away. He's a special human who comes from a really beautiful family. In his head he's like, "She's the girl, she's the girl, she's the girl," and he was like, "I have to tell you, I want to do this movie with you." Glen says, "I feel like I said I love you too early."
What appealed to you about Madison?
I fell in love with the idea of Madison that was in the script -- it was kind of her trajectory, but not her soul, and they were looking for someone to come in and bring something to it. I loved that I couldn't pinpoint what she was going to do next. She's not perfect, and she's constantly trying to play this fantasy -- a fantasy for herself, a fantasy for him, a fantasy of what a femme fatale is, because she's definitely not a femme fatale; she's her own idea of a femme fatale that she's creating for herself. I was fascinated by that. I cannot be more opposite to Madison.
How so?
I'm on the shyer and quirkier side. I'm also not a murderer! Madison is also a little more strategic than I am -- I don't make a lot of strategic decisions like "Ooh, this movie is going to make me into a star, and then I'm going to do that movie" -- my brain doesn't function like that. Sometimes I wish it did.
You have "Blink Twice," Zoë Kravitz's directorial debut, coming up in August. You're in the Amazon Prime series "Criminal." And you're starring in and executive produced "Los Frikis," inspired by true events about teenagers who inject themselves with H.I.V. to escape the oppression of 1990s Cuba. Is there more?
Season 2 of "Andor" is coming out hopefully next year. I think people are going to freak when they see it. It's so much bigger, smarter -- Tony [Gilroy, the showrunner] really outdid himself. And then I have "El Sombreron," which is the first time I'm going to be working with a Guatemalan director and filming in my home country -- I'm half Guatemalan, half Puerto Rican, and I feel very much half and half. There's a big debate on the internet over whether I'm Puerto Rican or Guatemalan, and I'm very much both. You live in a limbo when you're mixed. If I go home, they're like, "You're not 100 percent Guatemalan," and when I come here, they're like, "You're not American," even though I've lived here a big chunk of my life. And then I go to Puerto Rico, where I was born, and they're like, "But are you Puerto Rican?" I'm a little bit of everything. People need to leave me the [expletive] alone.
What has it been like to be involved in a "Star Wars" series, with a fan base that scrutinizes even the tiniest details?
It definitely affects you -- I'm not going to lie -- because you spend so much time creating something and then someone can bash it in three seconds. But I really try not to pay attention to it. I have no control over it.
You were a dancer in middle school and high school. Would you ever want to return to the stage?
I really want to go! There's a theater opportunity in Miami I might do this fall; it's a one-woman show called "The Second Woman." The idea of being in a theater is just so beautiful. When I was studying at the Lee Strasberg Theater & Film Institute in New York and auditioning for theater, there weren't that many opportunities for Latin American actresses -- Horton Foote or Tennessee Williams plays were all white women, and they weren't that open to hiring outside of that, at least when I was auditioning. Now, it's very different.
What are your hobbies when you aren't acting?
I love boxing. I feel like I could be a contractor in my next life; I love fixing stuff, roofing, plastering walls. I'm also picking up the guitar now that no one's telling me to! My dad is not happy -- he's like, "Are you kidding me, dude? I begged you to play when you were a kid, and now you want to play?"

Must Every True Story Be Made Into a Movie?: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The story of a Seattle-area bandit is rife with big questions, but the movie doesn't explore them. Not every podcast needs to be a film.
There is a platitude, beloved of the documentary community, that truth is stranger than fiction. It's often correct. But lately I've been worried that the glut of documentary content required to fill the yawning maw of streamers is putting this axiom to the test more frequently. Not all stories are worthy of the documentary treatment.
Such, unfortunately, is the issue with "How to Rob a Bank" (on Netflix), yet another true-crime documentary. Its directors, Seth Porges and Stephen Robert Morse, have turned out great work in the past -- Porges as co-director of the fascinating "Class Action Park"; Morse as producer of the influential "Amanda Knox." This film feels more perfunctory, a strong example of the kind of documentary that could have just been a podcast. (Of course, it has been.)
The film tells the true story of Scott Scurlock, a free-spirited fellow known to Washington State law enforcement agents as the Hollywood Bandit. (Sometimes they dropped the bandit part.) In the 1990s, he pulled off a whopping 19 confirmed bank robberies in the Seattle area, stealing more than $ 2.3 million, with the aid of a few friends and some elaborate disguises.
"How to Rob a Bank" is filled with re-enactments of the robberies and interviews with friends and associates, who explain that Scurlock was a gentle soul who lived in an enormous treehouse that was a hub for his friends. He also cooked meth for a while, was an adrenaline junkie and journaled a lot about trying to find his purpose in life.
Police officers and investigators are less sanguine about Scurlock, noting at one point that bank robbery is not a victimless crime, even if nobody gets hurt physically. It can be traumatic to anyone who was inside the bank, and to a teller facing a gun. Scurlock tried to paint his crimes as altruistic, and did give away some of his money to friends in need. But people were still hurt -- including, ultimately, Scurlock himself.
There's quite a bit to chew on in this story, matters the film points to but doesn't really examine. The influx of money into Seattle in the 1990s made it a great place for bank robberies, as several people note, and also made it fertile ground for punk and grunge movements.
Perhaps the more interesting element is that Scurlock watched movies like "Heat" and "Point Break" to figure out how to pull off the crimes. The nickname, "Hollywood," came from his costumes and makeup, but it might as well have been about his worldview. After all, Hollywood movies are most people's connection to bank robbers, with films like "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Dog Day Afternoon" among the greatest classics of American cinema. What do they teach us to think about those crimes? How did they shape Scurlock's blindness to his real victims?
"How to Rob a Bank" isn't really interested in those bigger questions, instead heading in a more desultory direction. What startled me was the realization that while Scurlock did manage an unusually long string of robberies, the rest of the tale wasn't nearly as wild as the documentary's framing might suggest. The story was of a man who felt lost, and kept trying to fill the void inside him with excitement and danger. In the end, that's not strange at all.

Full text: I'm the West Africa bureau chief, covering 25 countries from my base in Senegal. I try to read a lot, but even listening to audiobooks on 2x speed, I can't get through half my virtual book stack. In my downtime I often spy on my neighbors' dance moves in their living rooms -- via Senegalese TikTok.
Tems
"If Orange Was A Place," Tems's 2021 E.P., is one of three things I've downloaded on Spotify, so I tend to listen to it when I'm on a plane somewhere over the Sahel or Nigeria, her birthplace. It's somehow the perfect accompaniment, her rich voice cutting through the airplane noise.
King of Boys
What I love about "King of Boys," Netflix's first original Nigerian series, is that every so often the lead character Eniola Salami -- a mafia boss, corrupt political sponsor and formidable middle-aged woman -- will pause. The action will stop. And Salami, played by a withering Sola Sobowale, will come out with the perfect Yoruba proverb for the occasion.
The Frontlines of Peace
Séverine Autesserre argues that peace is primarily made by local insiders, not by political deals, or elections, or what she calls "Peace, Inc." -- the multibillion-dollar industry where outsiders try to end conflicts, like in Congo, home to the world's most expensive peacekeeping mission. As a perpetual outsider trying to understand and explain conflicts, I find this book useful.

On my daily walks around Dakar, Senegal's coastal capital, I try to spot locations from this 1973 masterpiece by Djibril Diop Mambéty. Dakar has changed so much in the past 50 years, and the purple flares and open spaces are mostly gone. But the atmosphere and style that "Touki Bouki" captured is still here.
Abdoulaye Konaté
If I were in Brussels, I'd go to Abdoulaye Konaté's exhibition at Galerie Templon. He is a Malian artist who creates huge, colorful, mesmerizing tapestries from bazin fabric and embroidery. I'll have to be content to look at photos of his exhibition at the last biennale in Dakar -- the region's hottest art event, this year slated for November.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a town littered with would-be superstars, he's trying to beat the odds by giving studios what they crave. It's no coincidence he's everywhere.
The cookies weren't selling.
It was a blustery day in suburban Austin, Texas, in 1996, and Lauren and Leslie Powell had a sales quota to meet for their Girl Scout troop. But it was that cookie time of year: Thin Mints and Caramel deLites were seemingly up for grabs everywhere.
Glen, their 8-year-old brother, suggested a marketing gambit. "He had us make signs that advertised 'free gift with every purchase,' and we put them up around the neighborhood," Leslie recalled.
Glen was the gift.
"He would hide in some honeysuckle bushes and pop out after a purchase to perform Elvis songs," she said, laughing. "That's my big brother. Ain't nothin' but a hound dog."
I confess: Until I heard stories like that one -- and spent time with the hound dog himself -- I didn't have high hopes for this profile. Glen Powell? I figured he was a dumb jock who coasted into a movie career on his all-American good looks. Boring.
Yes, fine, Powell has been having a bona fide Hollywood moment. He stood nude on a cliff top with Sydney Sweeney in "Anyone but You" at Christmas. He is currently starring on Netflix in "Hit Man," a comedy-drama-thriller-romance. And in July, Powell will be outrunning big-budget tornadoes in "Twisters."
But a superstar in the making?
C'mon.
I met Powell, 35, for breakfast in April at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood, Calif. He showed up in a tight blue polo accessorized with a chain necklace and chest hair. (Perhaps he was in character, I snarked to myself, as Good-Looking Frat Guy, a bit part he played in "Stuck in Love," a 2012 romance.) An omelet was ordered. Tabasco sauce was summoned and squirted.
He scratched his armpit.
Got it.
Over the next two and a half hours, however, a captivating person emerged. He dismantled my cynical assumptions one by one -- starting with the notion that he had coasted into a movie career. In fact, he struggled for years to gain a foothold in Hollywood. His first agency dropped him. "Lucky to be cast as a dead body in a crime show," Powell was told after the split.
It also became clear why studios finally started to see Powell as a ticket-selling successor to Tom Cruise, Matt Damon, Keanu Reeves, Will Smith and other aging (or problematic) action stars: Powell has a sharp mind for business, and, at least for now, box office dollars motivate him more than awards. He has also acquired a bit more ruggedness with age, making him a more credible leading man.
"To be a lasting success in Hollywood, you have to make people money," he said. "You have to go, 'Who is the audience for this? Are you giving people a reason to buy tickets?' And if you don't have a very clear answer, move on, no matter how much you may love the script or want to work with the director."
He crossed his arms and leaned across the table.
"I find the gamification of the business fun," he continued. "How do we make a movie that is rewatched and rewatched over decades?" He cited a half-dozen examples, including "Field of Dreams," "Training Day" and "Tootsie," and added, "When a movie is really watchable -- engaging enough to captivate generations of people -- that's true cultural power."
I stammered and tried to process the "Tootsie" shout-out.
Powell charged forward. "Small, intimate movies are also on my bingo board of things I want to do," he said. "But rewatchable is an important word. This is where I think actors who want to be serious get it wrong. Flogging yourself and showing how tortured and serious you can be -- people often don't rewatch, which takes all the power out of it."
You have to understand: Actors almost never talk this way. They usually insist their career plans involve "just letting things happen," perhaps sensing that having box office ambitions could expose them as uncool. Or set themselves up for failure.
Publicity can be another touchy matter. It's part of the job; studios pay stars to act in films -- and to promote them. But a lot of stars, including Emma Watson, Adam Driver, Joaquin Phoenix, Lupita Nyong'o, Jonah Hill and Bradley Cooper, do not like to serve themselves up endlessly for interviews. It's an anxiety-provoking drag: Can't we just let our work speak for itself?
Powell is the opposite.
"I always find it lame when actors are like, I just want to act in the movie. I don't want to promote the movie," he said. "If you want this career, part of your job -- a big part -- is doing everything you can to help sell your movies. Doing publicity matters. You've got to give people a reason to care."
Just like selling cookies.
"STOP TRYING TO MAKE Glen Powell happen," read one cardboard sign.
"It's never gonna happen," read another.
Powell's parents, Cyndy and Glen Powell Sr., were holding the makeshift placards above their heads at a promotional event for "Hit Man" in May. The gag was partly a comment on their son's success. The movie, directed by Richard Linklater, gave Powell his first title role: sink or swim, all on him. His parents were also poking fun at the voluminous media attention that Jr. had lately received.
The stunt generated an inferno of "Hit Man" publicity, in part because Powell fanned the flames. "The Hitman ... Killed by his own parents ððððð," he said on Instagram, where he has 1.6 million followers.
It was a savvy piece of self-deprecation -- coming at a moment when, frankly, he does seem a bit overexposed. In cahoots with Sweeney, his "Anyone but You" co-star, Powell aggressively worked the publicity circuit in December and January to support that film, resulting in a promotional campaign that bordered on performance art. "Anyone but You" had a terrible opening ( $ 6 million over three days) but went on to collect an astounding $ 220 million.
"I know it's a lot," he told me, speaking of his workload, "but I'm kind of going full-tilt right now for a reason. There is a moment in Hollywood when you have political capital, and you have to spend it before you lose it."
Powell has signed up for a dizzying number of projects (while passing on others -- reluctantly, he said -- including new chapters in the "Jurassic Park" and "Bourne Identity" franchises). His movie docket includes "Huntington," an A24 dramatic thriller about the conniving heir to a multibillion-dollar fortune, and "Monsanto," a legal drama directed by John Lee Hancock ("The Blind Side") and produced by Adam McKay ("The Big Short"). Powell is also set to star in a remake of "The Running Man," a minor Arnold Schwarzenegger hit from 1987, and perhaps in a retooled "Heaven Can Wait," Warren Beatty's 1978 body-swapping comedy.
His television jobs include a "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" series for Amazon -- with him in the Robert Redford role -- and "Chad Powers," a comedic Hulu series about a college football player.
Powell, of course, is also ready to get re-greased at a moment's notice for "Top Gun 3," after playing the cocky pilot Hangman in "Top Gun: Maverick" to wide acclaim. (A sequel to the sequel is in development at Paramount Pictures.)
That adds up to easily in excess of $ 500 million worth of projects on studio assembly lines, based on a back-of-the-envelope tally of estimated production and marketing costs.
And there are more films percolating: J.J. Abrams hasn't directed a movie since "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" in 2019, but he has a secret project in the works and Powell is in talks to play the lead. "I think Glen has just begun to scratch the surface of what he is capable of onscreen," Abrams recently told The Hollywood Reporter, adding, "He's not just an actor, but a legitimate writer and producer as well."
Powell helped produce "Hit Man." The "dumb jock" (mea culpa!) also co-wrote the screenplay with Linklater.
They loosely based the script on a 2001 Texas Monthly article about a mild-mannered man who worked undercover for the Houston police as a pretend assassin. Over a decade, more than 60 people unsuspectingly hired him; he wore a wire to gather evidence to use against them in court.
In the movie, Powell's faux hit man adopts a dozen personas using wigs and accents. While in disguise, he ends up falling for a client (Adria Arjona) with secrets of her own; it all leads to a sizzling romance.
The result is part screwball comedy and part "Body Heat," with some "Borat" flavoring. Reviews have been through the roof, prompting early awards chatter.
"Glen is one of the most curious people I have ever met, which is part of what makes him a terrific collaborator," Arjona said. "The script he wrote with Rick was so smart and so unlike anything I had read. He can produce. He acts incredibly. He has like eight or 12 abs. Glen has it all."
He's also, apparently, a helluva good time. Arjona first met Powell over a late lunch in Los Angeles in 2022. They were both doing Dry January. "It was to see if we were going to get along," she said. "Cut to four tequilas later, five hours later. He genuinely has become a close friend."
POWELL'S RISE IN HOLLYWOOD started in 2015 with "Scream Queens," a comedy-horror television series. The show, a Ryan Murphy production, lasted only two seasons, but Powell's performance as an oversexed college student turned heads.
"I remember saying to him at the end, 'You are going to be a big, big movie star,"' Jamie Lee Curtis recalled.
She played a college dean, and their first scene together was formidable. "He was basically nude in a bed," she said. "I'm in a negligee and a kimono. We're meeting for the first time two minutes before. It could have been awful."
She continued, "But he was, of course, because he's Glen, the sweetest guy ever. He does physical comedy really well -- he's funny -- but he also has depth. He is maybe not unattractive. I feel the same way about Glen as I do about Jake Gyllenhaal."
Perhaps because Powell is from Texas (and has a slight twang to prove it), he is often likened to Matthew McConaughey. "Red meat for red states," as one studio marketing executive described Powell to me, almost licking her lips. That quality has been in short supply among young male stars, a lineup that includes the twee (Timothée Chalamet, Tom Holland), the arty (Daniel Kaluuya, Barry Keoghan) and the dreamy (Michael B. Jordan, Austin Butler).
Machismo is a Hollywood cliché for a reason: It works. There is something about locker room swagger that certain audiences find irresistible. Powell dials up that part of his personality as needed. "My job is not to debunk the fantasy, but rather to become the fantasy," as his character says in "Hit Man."
Powell loves the Texas Longhorns, bro, and has been known to put back 40 ribs at the Salt Lick BBQ in Driftwood, Texas. His euphemism for sex is "smokin' the brisket," or so he told Men's Health in November. He apparently has a dimple on his tush. "Real crowd-pleaser that dimple," he said.
Less is made of the fact that he is single. "Dating me right now would be a nightmare," he said. "I basically have no free time." He has a photo of his parents as his iPhone lock screen and texts with his sisters almost every day. He carries around a little dog like Paris Hilton circa 2010.
"I have many sides, Brooks," he teased over breakfast, launching into a rather excellent impersonation of a cigarette-wielding Cruella de Vil. (Rule one of showbiz: Play to your audience.)
In his next film, "Twisters," he goes full-on Cracker Barrel as a former bull rider who dodges airborne farm equipment while recklessly driving straight into tornadoes. He then shoots fireworks into the funnel clouds for beer-drankin' pals to record on video and post online.
"When you love something," Powell's tornado chaser says in a suddenly serious moment, "you spend your whole life trying to understand it."
I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN that Powell was a child actor. He started performing with a Texas musical theater company when he was in fifth grade, learning to tap dance -- there is video evidence, according to his sister Leslie -- and appearing in "The Music Man" and "42nd Street."
He played sports, lacrosse and football in particular. But mostly he was fascinated with movies. His second-grade project was on Steven Spielberg's use of practical effects in "Jurassic Park." In 2003, when he was 14, he got his first movie role as "long-fingered boy" in "Spy Kids 3: Game Over." Two years later, he played a paperboy in "The Wendell Baker Story," a part that required him to get hit by a car, which he practiced with his mother in a church parking lot.
In 2006, Cyndy drove him five hours to Shreveport, La., to audition for Denzel Washington, who was directing and starring in "The Great Debaters." Powell got the part -- and a powerful agent: Ed Limato, who represented Washington. A year later, Limato called Powell in his dorm room at the University of Texas at Austin.
"Ed said, 'If you're going to spin the wheel on an acting career, now is the time to do it,"' Powell said.
So he dropped out of college and moved to Los Angeles in 2008. "Ed always told me, over and over, that the definition of a movie star is somebody who guys want to grab a beer with -- fun, not threatening -- and who women want to date and bring home to meet their parents," Powell said. Limato, who helped turn Mel Gibson, Richard Gere and Kevin Costner into big stars, also gave Powell another crucial career tip: Don't take on a role in a big franchise too soon, however tempting the paycheck; stars are built in smaller movies of varied genres.
Limato died two years later, leaving Powell without an advocate.
It was a rough time for the young Texan, who supported himself through coaching community sports and small acting jobs (a Dockers commercial, an episode of "The Lying Game," a cable series). The William Morris Endeavor talent agency had dropped him, and he began to question whether superstardom was even achievable anymore. Hollywood, undercut by video games and YouTube, has long wondered the same thing itself.
Michael B. Jordan might say yes. But Garrett Hedlund, Taylor Kitsch, Taylor Lautner, Ansel Elgort, Ryan Phillippe, Zac Efron, Alex Pettyfer, Eric Bana, Ben Barnes, Armie Hammer, Alden Ehrenreich, Charlie Hunnam, Miles Teller and Jai Courtney might beg to differ.
Powell regained his footing, first with "Scream Queens" and then with small but notable roles in "Hidden Figures" and Linklater's "Everybody Wants Some!!"
"Glen is methodical in his thinking," Linklater said. "He's actually pretty cerebral."
Not long after Powell moved to Los Angeles, Limato introduced him to Lynda Obst, a fellow Texan and a producer of hits like "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," "Contact" and "Sleepless in Seattle." She hired Powell as an intern, a job that involved reading scripts (two or three a day, when he wasn't popping out for auditions) and giving feedback. It was how he learned how Hollywood runs.
"He was adorable -- charm off the charts," Obst recalled. "But that is not what impressed me, and it's not why he is succeeding."
"Actors can turn on charm but they can't turn on intelligence," she said. "Glen is smart and learned about developing scripts and the structure of movies. It made him independent and wily."
Powell is clearly making a mark. But making the leap to Tom Cruise-level stardom -- or even, say, Channing Tatum-level fame -- is still far from assured.
Then again, he does like to prove people wrong.

Full text: Sometimes getting back with an ex means dealing with undesired scrutiny and doubters.
Last year, Ben Affleck made headlines for appearing to be in a bad mood. After opening a car door for his wife, Jennifer Lopez, he shut it with what viewers decided was more force than strictly necessary.
Many claimed he also appeared to be sulking while seated next to his wife at the 2023 Grammy Awards. (He later said his expression had more to do with an unplanned bit by the event's host, Trevor Noah.)
Then there was Mr. Affleck's unaccompanied appearance at the Netflix roast of Tom Brady in early May, followed the next day by Ms. Lopez's arriving without her husband at the Met Gala.
For many, Ms. Lopez's abrupt cancellation of her summer tour last week (very possibly a result of poor ticket sales) was the final bit of proof fans needed to conclude that the couple's marriage was on the rocks.
Rumors of issues between Ms. Lopez and Mr. Affleck, whose breakup-to-makeup story may be one of the most closely watched celebrity relationships in Hollywood history, began about a year after their surprise wedding in 2022. (The couple called off a first engagement 20 years ago.) But who's to say the pair's schedules haven't made it difficult to attend events together? Perhaps Mr. Affleck's seeming bad mood was unrelated to his wife when he shut that car door?
The frenzied speculation has only increased the already overwhelming attention the couple receives. Just this weekend, they were surrounded by a group of paparazzi snapping pictures as they left his son's basketball game in Santa Monica. This time, they seemed happy together, even exchanging a cheek kiss.
New love is delicate in the best of circumstances, but especially when it is rekindled. And when you're two A-list celebrities, the scrutiny that you're under becomes even harsher. Right now, only the couple knows if they really are headed toward divorce, but the world will be watching for even the smallest of hints as to which way the winds are blowing.
For the average person, that scrutiny and pressure is still felt, albeit on a smaller scale. It can come from loved ones who are worried that you might be making a mistake, or from the parasocial spectators on your feed who are thirsty for breakup gossip to sip on.
According to Lisa Marie Bobby, a psychologist and relationship counselor, it is extremely common for people to get back together after working on themselves and to have a second chapter that's more positive than the first. But during the breakup process, it's also common to speak negatively about the relationship to friends and family, which can color their perception of your partner, so she recommends resisting the temptation to tell loved ones all the very intimate details and instead talk to a professional.
"There is often a lot of anger, hurt, resentment, and when we are in that emotional space, we tend to become binary in our thinking," she said. "And when we're in that space, that is the narrative we are telling other people."
Of course, when a relationship is toxic or even abusive, her guidance is the opposite. Loved ones can help someone find the strength to leave instead of cycling in and out of the same relationship.
"They will often benefit from letting in the feedback or commentary from people who really love them and care about them," Dr. Bobby said.
If you are dealing with skepticism over your rekindled romance, Dr. Bobby recommends doing some "P.R. for your relationship" and talking to friends and family members who may have developed a negative impression of an ex and reassuring them that you've both worked on the previous issues.
Any reunion between two exes, no matter how beautiful or passionate, occurs on shaky ground. What if it doesn't work this time around and ends up being a waste of time? Is this a pursuit of destined love or an act of settling? Can the trust be rebuilt, or will old toxic cycles persist? Dr. Bobby said one of the main reasons people are anxious in this way is that they haven't worked through the issues from the previous relationship.
"There is a lot of power in doing some very deep work," she said. "If you're going to try again in a relationship, both people need to have a clear understanding of what went wrong the first time around."

Glen Powell Is Absolutely Willing to Play the Hollywood Game

LOS ANGELES — Glen Powell has been having a bona fide Hollywood moment.
He stood nude on a cliff top with Sydney Sweeney in “Anyone but You” at Christmas. He is currently starring on Netflix in “Hit Man,” a comedy-drama-thriller-romance. And in July, Powell will be outrunning big-budget tornadoes in “Twisters.”
But a superstar in the making? I figured he was a dumb jock who coasted into a movie career on his all-American good looks.
I met Powell, 35, for breakfast in April. Over the next 2 1/2 hours, a captivating person emerged: He dismantled my cynical assumptions one by one — starting with the notion that he had coasted into a movie career.
In fact, he struggled for years to gain a foothold in Hollywood. His first agency dropped him. “Lucky to be cast as a dead body in a crime show,” Powell was told after the split.

A year later, Limato called Powell in his dorm room at the University of Texas at Austin.
“Ed said, ‘If you’re going to spin the wheel on an acting career, now is the time to do it,’” Powell said.
So he dropped out of college and moved to Los Angeles in 2008. But Limato died two years later, leaving Powell without an advocate.
It was a rough time for the young Texan, who supported himself through coaching community sports and small acting jobs (a Dockers commercial, an episode of “The Lying Game,” a cable series).
Powell regained his footing, first with “Scream Queens” and then with small but notable roles in “Hidden Figures” and Linklater’s “Everybody Wants Some!!”
Not long after Powell moved to Los Angeles, Limato introduced him to Lynda Obst — a fellow Texan and a movie producer. She hired Powell as an intern; it was how he learned how Hollywood runs.
“He was adorable — charm off the charts,” Obst recalled. “But that is not what impressed me, and it’s not why he is succeeding.”
She said: “Actors can turn on charm but they can’t turn on intelligence. Glen is smart and learned about developing scripts and the structure of movies. It made him independent and wily.”

In Japan, A Flashback To the 1980s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A surprise television hit, now on Netflix, has people talking about what Japan has lost with today's changed sensibilities.
The younger generation has frequently called out Japan's entrenched elders for their casual sexism, excessive work expectations and unwillingness to give up power.
But a surprise television hit has people talking about whether the oldsters might have gotten a few things right, especially as some in Japan -- like their counterparts in the United States and Europe -- question the heightened sensitivities associated with "wokeness."
The show, "Extremely Inappropriate!," features a foul-talking, crotchety physical education teacher and widowed father who boards a public bus in 1986 Japan and finds himself whisked to 2024.
He leaves an era when it was perfectly acceptable to spank students with baseball bats, smoke on public transit and treat women like second-class citizens. Landing in the present, he discovers a country transformed by cellphones, social media and a workplace environment where managers obsessively monitor employees for signs of harassment.
The show was one of the country's most popular when its 10 episodes aired at the beginning of the year on TBS, one of Japan's main television networks. It is also streaming on Netflix, where it spent four weeks as the platform's No. 1 show in Japan.
"Extremely Inappropriate!" compares the Showa era, which stretched from 1926 to 1989, the reign of Japan's wartime emperor, Hirohito, to the current era, which is known as Reiwa and began in 2019, when the current emperor, Naruhito, took the throne.
Both the writer and executive producer are 50-something Generation Xers whose nostalgia for the more freewheeling bubble years of their youth permeates the ditsy comedic drama, whose characters occasionally break into madcap musical numbers.
Not so subtly, the show also comments on the evolution toward more inclusive and accommodating offices, caricaturing them as places where work is left undone because of strict overtime rules and employees apologize repeatedly for running afoul of "compliance rules."
Such portrayals strike a chord in Japan, where there have been complaints, often expressed on social media, about "political correctness" being used as a "club" to restrict expression or to water down television programs or films. Part of what fans have found refreshing about "Extremely Inappropriate!" is how unrestrained the portions set in the Showa era are.
While critics have called the series retrograde, some younger viewers say the show has made them question social norms they once took for granted -- and wonder about what has been lost.
Writing for an entertainment-oriented Web publication, Rio Otozuki, 25, said that the series "must have left many viewers thinking inwardly that the Showa era was more fun."
She was initially shocked by some of the 1980s behavior it depicted, she wrote. In an interview, Ms. Otozuki said she was glad not to have grown up in the earlier era after seeing sexual harassment and extreme disciplinary measures portrayed as "so normal back then."
But she also wondered if people then felt more empowered to make their own choices. She pointed to a television variety program depicted in the show, where young women cavort in skimpy outfits and compete to let their nipples slip out of their shirts, while a male host crawls between their legs making sexually suggestive comments.
At first, Ms. Otozuki recoiled from it. In the end, though, she decided that if the stars "realized that their bodies are their tools and wanted to use them for entertainment," then she could accept the variety show's approach.
Kaori Shoji, an arts critic who was a teenager in the 1980s, said she loved "Extremely Inappropriate!" She particularly appreciated how the series illuminated the chilling effects of today's tighter policing of workplaces.
"Everyone is just playing a game to see who can be the least offensive person that ever walked the earth," Ms. Shoji said. "Everyone just exchanges platitudes and inanities because they are afraid to say anything. Surely that cannot be good for a workplace."
The show pays homage to "Back to the Future," the classic movie about a 1980s-era teenager, played by Michael J. Fox, who travels back in time to the 1950s of his parents' adolescence. In "Extremely Inappropriate!" the point of view is primarily that of the parent traveling to the future -- Ichiro, played by the Japanese character actor Sadao Abe.
Some other characters, including a feminist sociologist and her teenage son, travel back in time, while Ichiro's rebellious teenage daughter spends an episode in the future getting to know a television producer and single mother who struggles to balance her work and personal life.
Both eras are often played for laughs, but the extremes are more pronounced in the contemporary scenes. A producer at a modern-day television network interrupts the on-air talent every few seconds to deem his comments inappropriate. A chorus of young women instruct the time-traveling teacher that the punctuation in his text messages is considered offensive.
Aki Isoyama, 56, the executive producer and a longtime collaborator with the series's writer, Kankuro Kudo, 53, said they wanted to create a show that reflected a "sense of discomfort toward compliance and the trends of the modern era."
"Of course, we feel like things are moving in a better direction" generally, Ms. Isoyama added during an interview at the TBS headquarters in Tokyo. "But we felt uncomfortable, and we had been talking about that."
Ms. Isoyama said she was surprised by the show's popularity. "I did want people to have a discussion," she said. "And, of course, I did want the younger generation to ask their parents, 'Was the Showa era really like this?"'
For Kumiko Nemoto, 53, a professor of management at Senshu University in Tokyo, where she focuses on gender issues, the show is merely "going back to and embracing 1980s Japan as if it was the best time."
She took issue with its portrayal of modern young men as "very confused and hypersensitive about harassment." Its female characters, she added, seemed stereotypical, with the contemporary feminist sociologist portrayed first "as a 'feminazi"' but ultimately as "a nice good mother."
In the end, the show posits a can't-we-all-find-a-middle-ground message, and the grumpy old teacher ends up evolving the most.
Ms. Shoji, the arts critic, viewed the series as a "fairy tale" that imagined what would happen if the grizzled fathers of the earlier era "got a second chance" to become gentler and more mindful of the feelings of others.
Anna Akagi, 23, a freelance writer, said that the show made her think that maybe times hadn't changed that much. Things that people used to express publicly -- and without shame -- have now simply migrated to anonymous postings online, she said.
"Maybe the shape has changed, but the things that existed in Showa exist in Reiwa in a different form," she said.

McConnell's Warning Against Isolationism: [Letter]

Re "Mitch McConnell: We Cannot Repeat the Mistakes of the 1930s" (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, June 6):
I rarely find myself agreeing with Mitch McConnell, and even then it is usually on a position he quickly backtracks from to keep himself in the good graces of the party that has pulled away from traditional Republican values. But his call to end isolationism is compelling.
Now, if he could only convince what is left of the Republican Party of that, the world would be a safer place. America needs and thrives on a true two-party system, but when one of them is blindly bound to a narcissistic wannabe dictator, that system will fail.
Mr. McConnell needs to restore his party to one that argues over policy differences with the left, as opposed to one that exists solely to support a man who would lead us back to the mistakes of the 1930s. Show some guts, Mitch.
Robert Wallenstein

To the Editor:
Bravo to Senator Mitch McConnell for praising the courageous American soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who fought in World War II to preserve freedom and democracy. And bravo to him for taking a swing at the "disgraced isolationists" who strove to persuade Americans in 1940 that the fate of our European allies was irrelevant to our own national security.
Senator McConnell, however, does not mention that the influential, pro-fascist and antisemitic isolationist organization was called America First, a slogan that Donald Trump has adopted to encapsulate his nationalist and unilateralist views.
In the months and years ahead, I suggest that we remember the words of Henry L. Stimson, the Republican who served as secretary of war under Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman and who believed that America must act with a sense of global responsibility.
"No private program and no public policy, in any sector of our national life," he wrote in 1947, "can now escape from the compelling fact that if it is not framed with reference to the world, it is framed with perfect futility."

To the Editor:
It required a great deal of restraint to read through the piece written by the Senate minority leader. Does he not see the irony in each sentence he wrote, or does he think that amnesia is so pervasive that the public won't remember his own complicity in creating the environment he warns us of?
Perhaps this will serve as a confession, a means toward easing a very guilty conscience. Sorry, Mitch, too little, too late.
Matthew Levanda
Manalapan, N.J.
To the Editor:
Mitch McConnell has written an interesting essay. However, if he is really concerned about the possibility that the world will repeat the mistakes of the 1930s, I suggest that he watch the six-part docudrama "Hitler and the Nazis: Evil on Trial," which is now airing on Netflix.
If he cannot see the timely parallels between the events that are recounted in that television series and what is happening politically in America today, I would suggest that Mr. McConnell needs new glasses.

D-Day at 80, and the Lessons for Today
To the Editor:
Re "D-Day Shows What Democracy Can Achieve," by Garrett M. Graff (Opinion guest essay, June 6):
As I read Mr. Graff's brilliant article, for me, it raised the question: Are we up to the task of defending our democracy today as the Greatest Generation was?
What we do know is that today we are a very different people than we were in World War II. We are more likely to question authority, while obeying authority is essential to the smooth running of a military. We are used to creature comforts that didn't exist then, and those that did were affordable to a smaller portion of society.
The answer is, We cannot know unless we are put to the test, and that's a test I hope we never have to take.
John A. Viteritti
Laurel, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Dozens of veterans in wheelchairs, their eyes glistening with tears but still bright. Row after row of reverently maintained white grave markers. Grainy videos of troops storming the Normandy beaches with unrelenting and deadly fire raining down from a well-entrenched enemy.
As I watch coverage of these overwhelmingly moving scenes on TV, why can't I stop thinking of the question posed by former President Donald Trump during a visit to Arlington Cemetery: "What was in it for them?"
It is up to us to make sure that the man who could make such an incredibly thoughtless inquiry never becomes commander in chief again.

'The Party of Law and Order'?
To the Editor:
Re "Biden Denounces G.O.P. Moves to Subvert the Decision of a Jury" (front page, June 1):
Silly me, I thought the Republicans prided themselves on being the party of law and order. It seems that this party of law and order is the same party that has endorsed the Jan. 6 insurrection, and the party that has decided to discredit a properly rendered jury verdict from a jury that Donald Trump's own lawyers helped to pick.
I am at a loss to understand how the G.O.P. can possibly still claim that it is the party of law and order out of one side of its mouth and still denounce the very system that it professes to uphold out of the other side.

Universities Should Say More, Not Less
To the Editor:
Re "Harvard Should Say Less. Maybe All Schools Should," by Noah Feldman and Alison Simmons (Opinion guest essay, June 2):
Schools should say more. Universities are valuable assets of cities and the global community. Their impact is great and goes beyond their walls. They should be engaged and active.
Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn., is in a neighborhood directly affected by destruction that occurred after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Scars from the aftermath were seen for months. It was imperative that the president, Fayneese Miller, speak out on behalf of the university, and she did.
The divestiture by universities (and cities and other institutions) in investments that supported apartheid South Africa was correct and made a difference. Today's debate on the divestiture of funds that support the Israeli military and the destruction in the Middle East is appropriate.
Universities should make statements on moral and ethical issues, and can demonstrate how debate can be conducted with civility. Institutions of higher education build better communities and contribute to a more just society.
Jim Scheibel
St. Paul, Minn.
The writer is a retired professor at Hamline University.
A.I. as C.E.O.? Not So Fast.
To the Editor:
Re "If A.I. Can Do Your Job, Maybe It Can Also Replace Your C.E.O." (Business, May 29):
Not so fast.
As a longtime adviser to C.E.O.s, I have found that the head of a company needs only two attributes to succeed: vision and the judgment to find the right people to achieve that vision. Yes, much of the job can (even should) be done by others, even A.I., but only humans can exhibit those attributes.

Surveillance Captures All Those Night Moves: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The folk-horror genre welcomes a young new voice in the director Ishana Night Shyamalan, but she's singing a familiar old tune.
Seeing the name Shyamalan on a movie trailer leads to certain expectations: plot twists, incremental reveals that change the nature of reality, foreboding supernatural vibe. Check, check and check with "The Watchers" -- even though in this case the filmmaker isn't M. Night Shyamalan, of "The Sixth Sense" and "Split" fame, but his daughter Ishana.
After making her debut as a director on "Servant, an Apple TV+ series Ishana has moved on to features with this folk-horror tale about a troubled young woman, Mina (Dakota Fanning, fresh from a big turn in the Netflix series "Ripley"), who finds herself stranded when her car breaks down in foreboding Irish woods while she was ferrying a parrot (you read that right) from Galway to Belfast.
Ishana is 24, and "The Watchers" shows that she truly is Jung at heart: At times the movie feels as if an eager undergraduate patched it together from the greatest hits of the Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung, most notably the forest as both physical and psychological place, the mirror as revelator and the presence of the double.
Fine, so this is a lofty way to say that the film is a little bit frightening and a big bit comically grandiose.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
As dusk sets in, Mina is rescued from the forest's terrifying noises and encroaching shadows by Madeline (Olwen Fouere), Ciara (Georgina Campbell) and Daniel (Oliver Finnegan), who live in a Brutalist house where an entire wall is a one-way mirror. This is so that every night, mysterious creatures called the Watchers can observe those who are, in effect, their prisoners; as Madeline tells Mina, whoever goes out after sunset dies. Fleeing at dawn isn't an option because there is no escape from the forest within a day's walk.
"The Watchers" is based on a novel by A.M. Shine (a sequel, "Stay in the Light," comes out in October), and works best when it fully exploits the wonders of sound design to build a feeling of Dolby-enhanced dread. The technique is so effective that the jump scares feel cheap in comparison.
In theory, surveillance and night creeps make for a good scary combo, and in a nice touch the captives' are stuck watching a DVD of a "Love Island"-like reality series. But as stifling as the atmosphere tries to be, it's just not gripping enough that plot holes will go unnoticed, especially when the four prisoners make a major discovery that had somehow eluded them for a conveniently long time.
If we go along with the story at all, it's thanks to Fanning, who resists the temptation of softening the edges of her stock character -- a guilt-ridden young woman who hides behind a detached facade because "you wouldn't like me if you knew the real me" -- while also making the standoffish Mina worth caring for. Fanning often deploys an unsentimental reserve that's very effective from a dramatic standpoint. Here, it provides a steady counterpoint to the predictably bananas plot. Mina may be emotionally shaky, but she turns out to be an anchor nonetheless.
The Watchers
Rated PG-13 for violence and creepy Irish mythology. Running time: 1 hour 42 minutes. In theaters.

Comedy
Nate Bargatze
June 9 at 7 p.m. at UBS Arena, 2400 Hempstead Turnpike, Elmont, N.Y.; ubsarena.com.
Since opening for Jimmy Fallon in 2013, Nate Bargatze has been among Fallon's favorite comedians, appearing a total of 15 times on "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon" and "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon." Bargatze's aw-shucks sensibility and family-friendly humor scored him an invitation to be a presenter at the 2022 Grammy Awards, where he was also nominated for his comedy album "The Greatest Average American."
Last year was particularly good for Bargatze: His special "Hello World" came out on Amazon Prime Video in January 2023, and he hosted "Saturday Night Live" in October. This year's highlight, aside from his arena-headlining "The Be Funny Tour," was his two nights at the Hollywood Bowl with Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Gaffigan and Sebastian Maniscalco for the Netflix Is a Joke Fest last month. All the while, he also helps produce and distribute specials for other comedians through his YouTube channel, Nateland Entertainment.
On Sunday, Bargatze's tour stops at UBS Arena in Nassau County, Long Island. Tickets are $ 33.75 on Ticketmaster. SEAN L. McCARTHY

Governors Ball Music Festival
June 7-9, noon-10 p.m., at Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Queens; governorsballmusicfestival.com.
New Yorkers are well familiar with these signs of summer: beachgoers on the A train; round-the-clock firecrackers; the smell of hot trash; and Gov Ball, the annual pop bonanza that returns this weekend to Queens.
At this year's festival, the musical theater girlies are out in full force: Chappell Roan, whose drag-inspired pop made a splash at Coachella, will perform, as will the song-of-summer contender Sabrina Carpenter (with "Espresso") and the former Broadway star Reneé Rapp. Latin music will have a strong showing, too, with appearances by the Puerto Rican reggaeton heavyweights Rauw Alejandro and Farruko and the Mexican singer Peso Pluma, who has helped catapult the regional sounds of corridos tumbados into the mainstream.
As always, household names take the headline slots: Post Malone on Friday, the Killers on Saturday and SZA on Sunday. Single-day tickets (starting at $ 179) and two-day bundles (starting at $ 358) are available on Gov Ball's website. OLIVIA HORN
'Inside Light'
Through June 14 at the Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, Manhattan; armoryonpark.org.
A leader of the postwar avant-garde known for composing works that pushed musicians to their limits, Karlheinz Stockhausen brought together innovation and discomfort in his extraordinary opera cycle "Licht." This riff on the Book of Genesis comprises seven operas for each day of the week, corresponding with the biblical order of creation and meant to be excerpted and reordered in an endless cycle of creation and destruction.
Because of its scope, a full performance of "Licht" is rare. With "Inside Light," Kathinka Pasveer, a flutist, sound projectionist and a longtime collaborator of Stockhausen's, offers selections from four of the operas. Individual selections will be performed at 7 p.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays through June 13. A marathon of all the selections will be held on Saturday with Part 1 at 4 p.m. and Part 2 at 7:30 p.m., and on June 14 with Part 1 at 6:30 p.m. and Part 2 at 10 p.m. During the concerts, audiences can sink into floor cushions or wander through Park Avenue Armory and, perhaps, get lost in the cosmos.
Tickets start at $ 50 on the Armory's website. GABRIELLE FERRARI

'Ancestral Whispers'
June 9, 2-5 p.m., at Lefferts Historic House, 452 Flatbush Avenue, Prospect Park, Brooklyn; prospectpark.org.
House museums often celebrate the prosperous and illustrious families who used to occupy their rooms. But since 2021, the 18th-century Lefferts Historic House, in the Children's Corner of Prospect Park, has been exploring the lives of its previously unacknowledged inhabitants: enslaved people.
That initiative, ReImagine Lefferts, now has its first resident artist: Adama Delphine Fawundu. On Sunday, the house will welcome families to the opening of Fawundu's show "Ancestral Whispers," which consists of 31 vertical nylon banners, each 11 feet long. Hanging from the house's porch, these fabric panels display digital imagery of waterways, Yoruban cultural motifs, tobacco leaves and documents related to the 25 enslaved individuals whose histories the project has so far unearthed.
Children attending the free festivities -- registration is encouraged but not required -- can meet Fawundu and go on a scavenger hunt for patterns found in her art. They can also print West African symbols, do art activities based on the house's history and play the ancient strategy board game oware (also known as mancala).
An outdoor barbecue-style reception will feature music by D.J. Spinna. Indoors, young visitors can learn more about formerly enslaved residents like Nero (1794-1865), who eventually attained his freedom and whose son died fighting in the Civil War. LAUREL GRAEBER

June 7-21 at the Museum of the Moving Image, 36-01 35th Avenue, Queens; movingimage.us.
Agnieszka Holland's "Green Border," a harrowing portrait of migrants caught in a Kafkaesque death trap at the Polish-Belarusian border, has already caused controversy in Poland. With the film, possibly a career high point for Holland, opening in theaters on June 21, the Museum of the Moving Image is presenting a retrospective of her work.
"Green Border" is hardly her first film to run afoul of officials. Set in the early 1900s, "Fever" (on Saturday), first shown in 1981, portrays Polish radicals fighting Russian czarist forces and was banned in Soviet-influenced Poland. "A Lonely Woman" (also on Saturday), a.k.a. "A Woman Alone," was made in 1981 but not widely seen until 1987; it was, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, "sharply critical" of the system that relegates its protagonist, a working mother (Maria Chwalibog), to a life of grim routine. The lineup also showcases Holland's early feature "Provincial Actors" (on Friday) and her international breakthrough, "Europa Europa" (on Sunday and June 20), for which she received a screenwriting Oscar nomination.

Whirlwind Romances Aren't Reserved for Thin Women: [Style Desk]

Full text: An article skeptical of the central love connection in the new season of "Bridgerton" has fans rushing to contest the idea that catching a gentleman's eye is a size-restricted pursuit.
When an opinion article published in the British weekly The Spectator last week questioned the desirability of Penelope Featherington, a character in the Netflix series "Bridgerton" played by the Irish actress Nicola Coughlan, it touched off a firestorm of objection. People rushed to criticize the claim that her pairing with Colin Bridgerton, the chiseled and handsome leading man played by Luke Newton, would never happen in real life because her character isn't thin.
After the show's third season debuted on Netflix this month, fans were offended by what they saw as body shaming in the piece, which bluntly stated that Ms. Coughlan is "not hot, and there's no escaping it." The article concluded by arguing that efforts to prioritize equality and diversity aren't enough to "make a fat girl who wins the prince remotely plausible."
Many pointed out that Ms. Coughlan wouldn't even be considered fat by many -- descriptors like "plump" and "curvy" came up often -- but others online still echoed the same point made in the article. One Threads user wrote that she was "not used to seeing a woman like Penelope get the guy like Colin" and that it "wouldn't have happened in real life," which was met with a flurry of responses by plus-size women sharing images of themselves, happily coupled.
Danielle Wallace, a plus-size woman from Houston, said in a phone interview that while she wasn't an avid watcher of the show, she had felt compelled to join the chorus of objectors under the post, as a woman happily engaged to a man who loves her.
"What one person finds attractive isn't what everybody else finds attractive, and it seems like some people don't understand that," Ms. Wallace, 51, said. "Like, it's really weird to be an adult and not understand that."
This criticism overlooked something that has been true for many cultures and communities for a long time: Curvy women are desirable, occasionally almost to the exclusion of thinner women. The many examples of bigger women being desired does not mean that fatphobia isn't a real issue, of course, because it is. But the claim that you cannot be both curvy and attractive is false.
Emily Ottney, a 28-year-old baker living outside Minneapolis, said that she and Penelope have similar body types -- short and curvy -- so that when she stumbled on this discussion, it really "rattled" her. "I'm at about, like, 170 pounds, and still being five feet tall, I still look pretty chubby," she said, adding that her husband had helped her "get to this place where I don't feel like I have to change."
"Every time that I have expressed this to him, especially when I had the hardest time with it, in the beginning, he was always so reassuring that he loves me no matter what shape I'm in," she said.
In 2017, Robbie Tripp, who became known as the "Curvy Wife Guy," was both dragged and applauded for an Instagram love note in which he praised his wife and "her curvy body." He wrote that he was often teased as a teen for being attracted to "girls on the thicker side." Because of the self-congratulatory tone of the post, it wasn't especially well received, but he was a proud straight man who liked bigger women.
Attraction to larger bodies is a fact across cultures and generations. Well before an April 2023 issue of British Vogue heralded the arrival of "The New Supers" with a cover featuring three mid- and plus-size models; well before Meghan Trainor declared that she was "all about that bass"; well before Sir Mix-A-Lot broke it to "the beanpole dames in the magazines" that "you ain't it, Miss Thing"; and perhaps as far back as 28,000 B.C. (I'm looking at you, Venus), there has always been a healthy appetite for curves. Even Kim Kardashian's own body modifications, which helped kick off the Brazilian butt lift era of the 2010s, appeared to respond to a lust for the curvier bodies often seen on Black and brown women.
In "Bridgerton," the show doesn't directly point to Penelope's body type as the reason it takes Colin so long to realize that he's in love with her, but she is noticeably bigger than the female romantic leads seen in previous seasons of the show. Perhaps that's the point: Beauty is subjective, and a highborn gentleman can find anyone, including a woman of her shape, beautiful. He could have been hesitant for other reasons.
Kymberli Joye, a 32-year-old gospel singer in southern New Jersey, said that seeing Penelope's story had resonated with her because she had also experienced a fairy-tale-like romance. Being bigger most of her life, she hadn't had many connections similar to what she saw on TV, just what had felt to her like a "relationship out of convenience." When she began dating the man who is now her husband, in 2022, everything changed.
"It was a different kind of spark: It was romantic, and I would say it felt like a movie and I felt like the main character," she said. "I felt like the leading lady in it. I didn't feel like a consolation prize."

Full text: Emmanuel Morgan is enticed by how athletes and sports leagues are increasingly dipping into music, television and other media.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
When Emmanuel Morgan was hired as a sports reporter covering the N.F.L. and combat sports for The New York Times in 2021, the job felt familiar. After all, Mr. Morgan, who grew up playing football, had been writing about the sport since high school. He went on to cover the N.F.L. for The Los Angeles Times for nearly two years.
"I knew the N.F.L. and the U.F.C. and all these other sports so well," said Mr. Morgan, 27, who also covered high school sports and basketball for The Los Angeles Times, including helping report on the death of Kobe Bryant in 2020.
So when The Times disbanded its Sports department last year, he took the opportunity to stretch himself and pitch a new beat: the intersection of sports and pop culture.
"I'm not a movie critic or a Broadway-goer, but I follow pop culture, I watch Netflix and I listen to music constantly -- in the shower every day, on the subway," he said. "I had my pulse on it." Over the past eight months, Mr. Morgan, now on the Culture desk, has written about the pop culture phenomenon of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, the growing relationship between the N.F.L. and streaming services and the rise of athlete podcasts.
In an interview, he discussed how his daily news consumption has changed and what his favorite reporting experience so far has been. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
You've been in the role for a little over eight months now. How is it going so far?
I have definitely had to be a lot more creative when it comes to finding story ideas. When I was with the Sports desk, I knew the N.F.L. and the U.F.C. so well -- covering sports is very formulaic. You know you have to have previews for big events like the Super Bowl and the N.F.L. draft, and as the season goes on the major story lines and the targets for profiles and features become pretty clear. But with this new beat, I'm reporting on stuff you don't see on TV or Twitter, and there are a lot more options, since I'm not just focusing on the N.F.L. and U.F.C. anymore. I have to make a lot more phone calls and talk to more people.
In March, a meeting with a publicist led to a timely story about how Flau'jae Johnson, one of the best women's college basketball players in the country, balanced her sports obligations with her music career.
What are some of your favorite articles you've written so far?
I worked on a number of pieces around the Super Bowl this year in Las Vegas -- I followed a retired player around Radio Row for a day for a story about how it's transformed into a colossus for the N.F.L. I wrote about how parties at the Super Bowl have become a business and use the event as a playing ground for brand activations. It was cool to show other people on the Culture desk that there's more to cover than just the halftime show.
I also wrote about Joel Embiid, a basketball player who started a media production company, which is a big thing in the sports space now. And I landed a front-page story on how the N.F.L. is trying to branch out and do more long-form projects for streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Apple.
Did you play sports growing up?
I played football in high school. I was a running back and a linebacker. I also wrestled. I've always been an athlete, but I loved to write, too. So putting the two together made sense.
What's the most fun thing you've had the chance to do for an article?
I got to follow the U.F.C. announcer Bruce Buffer around for a fight. I was able to observe how he prepared, including color-coordinating index cards he reads in the octagon, which have the fighters' names and stats on them.
What's been your biggest challenge?
Trying to detach myself from the games. My instinct is to want to cover what's happening on the field or on the court. I have to step back and look for things that aren't involved in the actual sport itself. I'm training myself to think differently.
What are your goals for future coverage of sports and culture at The Times?
To keep building it out -- it's been cool to be able to experiment and try new things; to say, "The New York Times wouldn't have covered that story before, but it's important." I'm not even a year in yet, and I keep finding new stories to cover. There's an audience for this crossover between sports and entertainment, and my goal is to find it and tell stories that resonate with them.

Russian Propagandists Churn Out Fake News To Hinder Paris Games: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Russian propagandists are spoofing broadcasters and mimicking French and U.S. intelligence agencies to stoke fear about security at the Games.
With its athletes barred from competing in the Summer Olympics under the country's flag, Russia has turned its fury on the Games and this year's host, Paris.
Russian propagandists have created an hourlong documentary, spoofed news reports and even mimicked French and American intelligence agencies to issue fake warnings urging people to avoid the Games, according to a report released on Sunday by Microsoft.
The report details the disinformation campaign created by a group the company calls Storm-1679. The campaign appears to have accelerated since March, flooding social media with short videos raising alarms about possible terrorist attacks and stoking fears about safety.
The operation, while aimed at the Games, is using various techniques to spread disinformation that could also be employed in European and U.S. elections.
American and French officials have tracked the campaign. One American official said that Russian disinformation, spread by the Kremlin via social media, continued to threaten the security of the United States and its allies.
The group has also tried to goad fact checkers into examining its claims, hoping to use the attention to spread the disinformation to new audiences as it is called out.
For months, French officials have focused on the ways Russia could seek to undermine the Games. Hackers affiliated with Russian intelligence disrupted the opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, and French officials are preparing for more cyberattacks this year.
France raised its terrorism warning level after an Islamic State attack in Moscow in March and threats against high-profile soccer matches in Paris. France also has increased security for the Olympics. Neither French nor American officials are warning people to stay away from the Games, but the Russian disinformation campaign is designed to scare people into doing just that.
Researchers at Microsoft and U.S. government officials have identified a number of groups affiliated with the Kremlin that are spreading disinformation aimed at Europe and the United States.
Some are directed by aides to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Others are affiliated with Russian intelligence. Some hide behind fake nonprofit groups. Others are veterans of the Internet Research Agency, a St. Petersburg troll farm that spread election propaganda in 2016. The agency was run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of a mercenary group who led a rebellion against the Kremlin and then was killed in a plane crash last year.
Storm-1679 appears separate from those efforts, according to Microsoft. The group's disinformation is aligned with Kremlin propaganda, but few specifics about it are known.
Bellingcat, a research group that uses publicly available data to conduct open source investigations, has been targeted by disinformation videos and has watched the campaign unfold. Eliot Higgins, the founder of Bellingcat, says his group has not established whether Storm-1679 is backed by the Russian government or is independent.
"It could be Prigozhin 2.0 doing work for the Kremlin, or an over-imaginative pro-Russian blogger doing it for kicks; we just don't know at this point," Mr. Higgins said.
The work began in earnest last summer with the release of a fake documentary about the International Olympic Committee, expropriating Netflix's logo and using an A.I.-powered voice impersonating Tom Cruise. The committee succeeded in having the video -- a spoof of the 2013 film "Olympus Has Fallen" -- removed from YouTube. The attacks have continued, though, with persistent efforts to discredit its leadership, the committee said in March, citing a campaign that used fake recordings of what purported to be telephone calls by officials of the African Union on behalf of Russia.
The group known as Storm-1679 now appears to be making shorter videos that are easier to create. It used to focus on disparaging Ukrainian refugees in the West, but after President Emmanuel Macron of France began to publicly consider sending French troops to Ukraine, it shifted to the Olympics.
Microsoft estimates that Storm-1679 produces three to eight faked videos a week, in English and French, with many impersonating the BBC, Al Jazeera and other broadcasters. The group appears to respond quickly to news events, like protests in New Caledonia, a French territory in the Pacific. Others focus on the prospect of a terrorist attack in Paris.
Most of the videos pretending to be from the C.I.A. and French intelligence are relatively simple. They are unlike anything the C.I.A. has actually produced, but to unsuspecting readers online, they could appear legitimate, using the agency's logo and stark white-on-black typography.
"They are trying to cultivate an anticipation of violence," Clint Watts, the head of Microsoft's Digital Threat Analysis Center, said of the group behind the fake posts. "They want people to be fearful of going to the Olympics."
A C.I.A. spokesman said a video that circulated online in February purporting to be a warning from the agency warning of terrorist attacks during the Games was a fabrication.
In February, Viginum, the government agency in France that combats disinformation online, identified the fake C.I.A. video as part of a campaign it called Matryoshka, after the nesting dolls that are popular in Russia.
The campaign was also responsible for fake videos about the domestic French intelligence agency, the French government said. A person briefed on the French investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence assessments, said that Viginum and the French Foreign Ministry were quickly identifying the Russian disinformation from the group aimed at undermining the Olympics.
French officials and Microsoft say one of the group's tactics appears to be trying to get the attention of fact-checking organizations.
"Normally, when Storm-1679 posts content on Telegram, it circulates there for a day or two and then goes away," Mr. Watts said. "The content doesn't normally travel from one platform to another, but when their false content is fact-checked by accounts with a large following, the content gets far more views and in front of new and different audiences."
Mr. Higgins said if baiting fact-checkers was part of the group's strategy, it did not appear to be an effective one. Bellingcat, he said, is aware that reporting on disinformation can draw attention to the propaganda, and that is factored in when his organization fact-checks videos.
"It doesn't appear that their messages are getting amplified," Mr. Higgins said. "Even among the usual circles who lap up Russian disinformation, we don't see them being shared at all."

Is 'Hacks' Trolling Seinfeld?: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The comedian's philosophies about the audience and comedy are contradicted in characterizations and plot lines on the Max series.
So many movies and television series have shown us the misery of a stand-up comic bombing and the joy of a comedian killing. But skirting cliché, the entertaining third season of "Hacks," which just concluded, dramatizes a more novel and pointed onstage moment: the crisis of success.
Coming off a triumphant special, the comic Deborah Vance (played with charm and compassion by Jean Smart) is trying out new jokes and is rattled to find her audience laughing at everything, no matter how funny.
Like most comics, she spent her career developing material by gauging the response of the crowd but must confront a problem familiar to superstar stand-ups. Her new fan base has disrupted that artistic process. Smart plays this realization with nuance, never dropping her performative charisma, but gradually showing surprise, and then panic at the idea that she can no longer trust her audience. This reveals the character's sensitivity while making a contrarian case against the idea that laughter is a purely honest response.
No comic has expressed faith in the crowd as often or with as much conviction as Jerry Seinfeld. He has said that his fame might buy him a few minutes of good will from an audience, but that after that, he must be funny to get a laugh. After seeing him perform many times on Manhattan's Upper West Side, this always struck me as hard to believe. Maybe if he went onstage and read "The Great Gatsby," as Andy Kaufman used to do, he might bomb at the Beacon Theater, but I wouldn't bet on it. Besides being one of the most successful stand-ups alive, Seinfeld is also one of its most prolific talking heads, weighing in on the art in interviews and documentaries. Comedy, to him, is the ultimate meritocracy, perhaps second to (as he has said) the N.F.L.
"Hacks" (on Max) is as obsessed as Seinfeld is with the craft and politics of comedy, and it was especially obvious this past season when its episodes coincided with his epic and relentlessly news-making promotional tour for the Netflix movie "Unfrosted." At times, the series and the star's media appearances felt as if they were in conversation with each other, with Seinfeld philosophizing about comedy and "Hacks" providing dissents.
At 72, Deborah Vance is only two years older than Jerry Seinfeld and they share a prickly personality, an inexhaustible work ethic, a love of craft and a generally apolitical perspective. But these aging legends are also a study in contrasts, starting with the fact that one is fictional, and the other a real person who happens to have made a tremendously popular fictional version of himself. Whereas Seinfeld is a model of stubborn veteran consistency, Vance listens and learns from younger critics and repeatedly evolves. Consequently, for a certain class of comedy nerds, "Hacks" can come off as a young person's fantasy of an aging comic.
In a recent interview with Bari Weiss in which Seinfeld raised eyebrows for his nostalgia for an era of "dominant masculinity," he described the rules of comedy as mercifully "immutable." "Hacks" is built around the idea that comedy, like the world it reflects, is in flux. Its central relationship embodies this, focusing on the differences between the old-school showbiz of a Vegas entertainer like Vance and her more progressive young writer, Ava (Hannah Einbinder).
Last season, Ava inspired Vance to take her work in a vulnerable direction, and this year Vance appears more open to social and political change. Seinfeld famously said he no longer played colleges but had been told by other comedians that students were too sensitive, and recently in an interview with David Remnick of The New Yorker, he oddly blamed "the extreme left and P.C. crap" for the decrease in hit network sitcoms like "Cheers" and "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." Vance is equally irritated with the so-called woke younger generation, and there are moments when the show satirizes them. But mostly her arc is one of being challenged by and growing from new ideas.
Vance walks out on a card game of older comics whose respect she has long wanted, calling them "out of touch" after they make retrograde jokes about gender. The next day, she yells at Ava for getting in her head and making her care about more than money and the approval of her peers.
This clash sets up another one in Season 3's penultimate episode when a video of Vance's cheap, stereotype-driven older jokes goes viral right before she is to be honored at U.C. Berkeley. Ava encourages her to apologize, arguing that no one really gets canceled. This gives voice to an increasingly popular (and occasionally overstated) perspective that there is no such thing as cancel culture, that comics called out never suffer real repercussions and, if anything, that their careers benefit.
To be fair, Seinfeld himself has expressed skepticism about fearmongering over cancel culture. When Weiss asked him about a new censoriousness, he shook his head, adding that it's "not a real thing." And like Vance, he has adjusted his material to suit the time, although his observational humor rarely required dramatic change. When he repeated a set from 1982 on one of David Letterman's last late-night shows in 2015, he trimmed a fat joke, telling the host that the topic was more taboo now.
But it's hard to imagine Seinfeld doing what Vance did. Not only does she appear on a college campus to answer for the offensive jokes, but she also apologizes and invites feedback. Would a comic her age really listen and take her lumps at a public forum? The comedian apology is a much mocked form, one that tends to get picked apart and invite much criticism. This is sort of the fairy tale version where not only does she not center herself, but her actions result in a New Yorker profile that celebrates her. And then this dust-up leads a television network to give her a talk-show host job. I imagine Hasan Minhaj got a grim laugh from this plotline.
The typical cancel culture narrative involves hysterical outrage and an artist in anger and despair. But this one is a model of measured criticism and reasonable accountability. If it strains credibility, it goes down easier because of the complexity of the performance from Smart, who always refuses to make the sentimental choice. What she makes clear is that while Vance evolves, it's usually when it also benefits her professionally. She might be apologizing because she feels regret, or because she badly wants to get the late-night job. Smart's portrait allows for both motivations at once.
In the superb season finale, we are reminded that what hasn't changed is that Vance's first priority is her career. She has the kind of dogged ruthlessness that a woman emerging in the sexist comedy scene of the 1970s and '80s would need.
The challenge for aging comedians is how to give their fans what they want while changing with the times. That's harder than it looks. And in some of the best scenes of the season, when Deborah and Ava get stuck in the woods, she explains that one reason to get plastic surgery is to make her body match how she thinks of herself. "I don't feel my age," she says. "Then I look in the mirror and don't recognize myself."
There's a poignancy in this confession, but also a hardheaded aspect. A performer must change but not too much. Or as Vance puts it when Ava says she redoes her face a lot: "I don't redo. I refresh."

You Can't Perform a Good Marriage: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I saw the new Netflix documentary series "Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal," anticipating just some prurient garbage to half-watch before drifting off to sleep. That's because Ashley Madison is a website for married people looking to find partners in infidelity; its tagline is "Life is short. Have an affair." The documentary is about what happened in 2015 when hackers released "members' names, user names, addresses, phone numbers and birth dates as well as details of credit card transactions," as The Times's Daniel Victor reported, a breach that "promises to roil the marital lives of its members."
While the three-part series has its lurid moments, the details of the hack and the accounts of the employees who worked at Ashley Madison were the least interesting sections. The heart of the series comes from the couples who were affected. Though one couple that had an open marriage seemed unruffled by the invasion of privacy, two other families are featured that were devastated by the hack.
One of those couples is Sam and Nia Rader, a Texas-based Christian vlogging couple who had gone viral a few times before the hack. They had millions following their wholesome family content on YouTube, like lip-syncing to a song from the Disney movie "Frozen." "For us," Sam Rader says in the second episode, "vlogging was just showing other families what it looked like to live for the Lord." He had an Ashley Madison account and ultimately admits that he was cheating on his wife, going to massage parlors and strip clubs and hitting on her friends.
Another featured couple has a truly tragic story: John Gibson was a minister who taught at a seminary in Louisiana and died by suicide six days after the leak. His widow, Christi Gibson, is interviewed at length.
Their stories are told with sensitivity and empathy, in a way that actively discourages schadenfreude, which is refreshing. As a result, my biggest takeaway from the series is that there's no way to perform a good marriage. Marriage is an intimate connection that evolves over a lifetime into an intricate partnership between two flawed people. Yes, there are commonalities between many different types of successful marriages, but there are serious downsides to becoming -- or trying to become -- a publicist for the perfect union.
In the series, both the Raders and Gibson talk about how heavily the public perception of their relationships weighed on them, even before their Ashley Madison connections were unearthed.
The Raders were performing and monetizing their marriage for the world, and their success as vloggers -- including a bizarre viral moment that involved Sam Rader secretly using the pee in their toilet to give his wife a pregnancy test -- allowed him to quit his day job as a nurse. She was a stay-at-home mom. As he put it in their new memoir, "Sam and Nia | Live in Truth: Public Scandal | Secret Vows | Restored Hearts," his marriage became his full-time job.
When he first heard about the Ashley Madison hack, Sam Rader was terrified of his involvement becoming public. "It would have just completely decimated my reputation, especially as a Christian. I would have been known for the opposite of what I stood for," he says, adding, "We were living in the public now, and suddenly I felt so vulnerable." In the immediate aftermath of the scandal, he made a video with his wife by his side in which he confessed to merely creating a profile on Ashley Madison because he wanted attention. But he maintained that he hadn't had an affair and that both she and God forgave him -- though he says he later admitted to her that the video was a lie.
Certainly, no one forced the Raders into becoming family vloggers -- or using their YouTube channel as their ministry, which is how they see it. (And frankly, it's not a great idea under most circumstances to monetize children's lives on social media before they can meaningfully consent.)
But I couldn't help feeling a bit sorry for them as the documentary rolled on. In the first episode, Nia Rader says, "I did want to be the perfect wife." And learning about her husband's infidelities, especially when he hit on her friends, made her feel as though her world was "crumbling." She says that "every single aspect of my life up until this point felt like a lie." Having the worst moment of your marital life as public fodder isn't something I would wish on anyone.
Gibson's courage in talking about the worst moment of her life is commendable; she now travels the country in an R.V. ministering and telling her story. The way she talks about the public view of her marriage in her own community shows the pressure she felt to maintain a certain appearance. "I would say most people thought we had a very happy marriage. You can work so hard at an image that you can make it very believable. You spend so much time building that that you begin to believe it's the reality," she says in Episode 2.
After she describes finding her husband after his death, Gibson expresses what might be a thesis statement for the whole series:
I'm sure there are people who are angry about Ashley Madison. But I blame the secrecy. The cancer of shame that was eating away at him. As far as the people who just were poring over that list and looking for names and the witch hunt, there's just a self-righteousness in that that I think assumes that you are without sin and without fault. And when the men were stoning the woman caught in adultery, Jesus said, "Let you who is without sin cast the first stone."
The Raders are still married, which you probably inferred from the fact that they just published a book together. They continue to vlog about their family, which to me seems ill advised, but hey, it's a free country. And most of their beliefs run counter to mine: Unlike Nia Rader, I wouldn't describe the prevalence of divorce in our society as a "pestilence." In plenty of cases I think divorce can be the right answer, and I don't think I would have stayed married had I been in their shoes. I also don't think marriage is for everyone.
Still, I'm glad that the documentary encourages viewers to give other people grace. This doesn't mean I think it's OK for couples who've vowed to be monogamous to cheat on each other; I absolutely do not. There's a reason that, as one study puts it, "research across 160 cultures revealed that spousal infidelity is the most common reason for a breakup." But I do think that all marriages, even the strongest ones, have downturns and hard times and minor and major tragedies to overcome -- and that we can never really know what's going on with other people's relationships.
A much better book about infidelity than the Raders' is "How to Stay Married: The Most Insane Love Story Ever Told," by Harrison Scott Key. He is also a Christian, but in his book you can find some thoughts about dealing with infidelity and the fragility of the marital relationship that are not unlike what you might get from the atheist sex columnist Dan Savage.
Key's wife cheated on him with a family friend, and they, too, managed to stay married. This is how he describes the institution: "The reality is that every marriage is a partnership of two broken" jerks "with good intentions and varying degrees of ability to deliver." That sentiment doesn't make for a heartwarming YouTube video, but it's honest and mostly true.

Dream Journey Carries Plenty Of Expectations: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Her new "Star Wars" show is a dream come true, but she knows it carries enormous expectations. "I would be lying if I said I wasn't scared," she said.
Leslye Headland has been telling "Star Wars" stories onscreen since she was a teenager. Ostracized at school for being different, she retreated inward, making stop-motion films starring her action figures.
So when she found success as an adult in Hollywood -- Headland helped create "Russian Doll," the 2019 Netflix comedy starring Natasha Lyonne -- and got the chance to create an actual "Star Wars" show, it was the realization of a lifelong dream.
And a chance for humiliating failure. On a galactic scale.
"I essentially cold-called Lucasfilm and, after a lot of conversations, found myself pitching a show -- utterly elated, my ultimate career goal, the culmination of my fandom," Headland said. "At the same time, I would be lying if I said I wasn't scared. There is so much pressure. It's extreme. I had never done anything this big before."
Headland's show, "The Acolyte," will debut on Disney+ on June 4. Costing roughly $ 180 million (for eight episodes) and taking four years to make, it attempts two feats at once: pleasing old-school "Star Wars" fans -- who can seem unpleasable -- while telling an entirely new story, one that requires no prior knowledge of "Star Wars" and that showcases women and people of color.
For the faithful, "The Acolyte" serves up scads of Jedi, a franchise fundamental that the other live-action "Star Wars" TV shows have depicted sparingly or not at all. The opening scene in "The Acolyte" takes place in an eatery crowded with colorful aliens, a callback to the Mos Eisley cantina from the first "Star Wars" movie, in 1977.
Other shout-outs to core fans -- we see you, we haven't forgotten about you -- are sprinkled into the dialogue: "May the force be with you" and "I have a bad feeling about this" makes an early appearance.
At the same time, "The Acolyte" embraces what some people call "New Star Wars," an era defined by diversity and expansion beyond the Skywalker saga, which started with Disney's purchase of the franchise in 2012.
Amandla Stenberg stars as a dreadlocked warrior who has a complicated relationship with a Jedi master played by Lee Jung-jae from "Squid Game," in his first English-speaking role. Jodie Turner-Smith ("Queen & Slim") plays the lesbian leader of a regal coven of witches, while the Filipino-Canadian actor Manny Jacinto ("The Good Place") appears as a shadowy trader. In one of her most action-oriented roles since "The Matrix," Carrie-Anne Moss plays a steely Jedi named Master Indara.
"The Acolyte" also breaks new ground behind the camera: While women have directed episodes of shows like "The Mandalorian" and "Obi-Wan Kenobi," Headland, 43, is the first to create a "Star Wars" series.
"It was like working on a razor's edge," she said during a Zoom interview, pushing her oversize glasses higher on her nose. "You're thinking, 'This is what people want from "Star Wars." This is what people don't want.' It can mess with your head."
"During the creative process," she continued, "I had to give myself the forgiveness, as an artist, to fall off the razor -- as long as I got back up. That was my promise to myself."
From the second that any new "Star Wars" project comes into public view -- Disney announced "The Acolyte" in 2020 -- fans claw for information and pick apart what they find. It's part of what makes "Star Wars" so powerful: People care. But the attention also creates problems.
Rumors can solidify into facts. Some "Star Wars" obsessives, for instance, have worried that Headland's show "breaks canon," or tinkers with already-established story lines in the franchise -- the ultimate "Star Wars" crime. It does not.
In fact, Headland chose to place "The Acolyte" at the very beginning of the "Star Wars" timeline so canonical issues would be minimal. The show is a mystery-thriller -- someone is killing Jedis -- set at a time when the Jedi are at their peak, the pre-"Phantom Menace" era that has been explored in "Star Wars" novels but never onscreen. The only character in "The Acolyte" that previously existed anywhere in the franchise is a Jedi Master from novels named Vernestra Rwoh. (Headland cast her wife, Rebecca Henderson, in the role, giving her a lightsaber that can transform into a whip.)
"Leslye wanted this show to be accessible -- no homework needed before watching," said Jocelyn Bioh, the Ghanaian-American writer. Headland added Bioh to the writing team for "The Acolyte" specifically because Bioh was not a "Star Wars" devotee.
"She asked me what I knew about 'Star Wars,' and my answer was, 'Harrison Ford runs around space with a giant dog?"' Bioh recalled, laughing. "And Leslye said, 'You're hired."'
"She wanted to potentially invite in new fans -- people like me," Bioh said.
The first "Acolyte" trailer, released in March, racked up 51.3 million views in its first 24 hours, a record for any live-action "Star Wars" series, including "The Mandalorian," according to Lucasfilm. Sneak-peek "Acolyte" footage, released in theaters in early May, highlighted the show's unique martial arts sequences; fan sites instantly deemed the fighting style Force Fu.
But a loud, primordial part of the "Star Wars" fandom has pushed back in predictable fashion.
"Why are there so many women, girls and minority characters increasingly dominating the ranks of Jedi?" reads a comment on "The Acolyte" trailer, with others expressing a similar worldview.
It is a version of the same misogyny and racism that greeted Rey, the female Jedi (played by Daisy Ridley) who made her debut in "The Force Awakens" in 2015, and that drove Kelly Marie Tran off social media when she appeared in "The Last Jedi" (2017). Kathleen Kennedy, who runs Lucasfilm, has also experienced it, with "South Park" harshly attacking her in an episode last year. The cartoon depicted Kennedy giving the same feedback to "Star Wars" creators over and over: "Put a chick in it! Make her lame and gay!"
Some trolls have nicknamed Headland's series "The Wokelyte."
In a brief telephone interview, Kennedy's support for "The Acolyte" was steadfast. "My belief is that storytelling does need to be representative of all people," she said. "That's an easy decision for me."
"Operating within these giant franchises now, with social media and the level of expectation -- it's terrifying," Kennedy continued. "I think Leslye has struggled a little bit with it. I think a lot of the women who step into 'Star Wars' struggle with this a bit more. Because of the fan base being so male dominated, they sometimes get attacked in ways that can be quite personal."
Headland has tried to limit her exposure to the online conversation, both good and bad, instead relying on friends for "weather reports."
"As a fan myself, I know how frustrating some 'Star Wars' storytelling in the past has been," Headland said, declining to cite specific examples. "I've felt it myself."
She followed up with a text message. "I stand by my empathy for 'Star Wars' fans," she wrote. "But I want to be clear. Anyone who engages in bigotry, racism or hate speech ... I don't consider a fan."
"Star Wars" projects aren't known for personal or idiosyncratic filmmaking. The production and marketing budgets are simply too high; the storytelling must appeal to the widest possible audience to make the numbers work.
Rian Johnson, who directed "The Last Jedi," told The New York Times in 2017 that he didn't even try to put his own stamp on the franchise. "It would be bad news if you came into this saying, 'How do I make this mine?"' he said.
Kennedy, however, pushed Headland to do just that with "The Acolyte."
"You've written a great 'Star Wars' show," Kennedy told her in 2019 in response to early scripts. "Now go write a Leslye Headland show."
Kennedy had read one of Headland's plays, "Cult of Love," which explores a complicated relationship between siblings. "It's about her personal experience," Kennedy said. "And it was just so well done and incredibly emotional. I remember reading that and saying, 'Leslye, this is exactly what you should tap into as you write this story for us."'
Explaining exactly how Headland took Kennedy's advice would spoil a major plot point in "Acolyte." Let's just say that Headland heightened a clash between characters.
"I have a very strained relationship with my youngest sister, and I feel like one of the reasons it is strained is that we both see each other as the bad guy," Headland said. "And if I was going to tell a story about bad guys, it seemed to me that the place to start should be a familial relationship where one person is adamantly convinced of her correctness and the other person is also adamantly convinced of her correctness."
"We don't speak," Headland added. "I think this will be a surprise to her."
She wouldn't say anything more on the topic, except to emphasize that she has a good relationship with her other sister, who helped make a visual presentation that Headland used to pitch "The Acolyte" to Lucasfilm. (Headland described her concept in the meeting as "'Frozen' meets 'Kill Bill."' Kennedy bought it on the spot.)
Stenberg, the show's star, said "Leslye really is driven by emotion and heart and relationships. So even though our show is within the 'Star Wars' universe and set in outer space, in a galaxy far, far away, it's really a family drama."
Headland had directed indie films ("Bachelorette," "Sleeping With Other People") and served as showrunner for "Russian Doll," the hit Netflix comedy about a New Yorker (Natasha Lyonne) caught in a reincarnation loop. But she had never managed a big-budget production.
What she lacked in experience, she made up for with "Star Wars" geekdom. Headland became a "Star Wars" superfan as a teenager. It was an apocalyptic period of her life, or at least it felt that way.
"I had no friends," she recalled. "I ate my lunch in the bathroom."
She found solace among the misfits in George Lucas's space operas, discovering books like Timothy Zahn's "Heir to the Empire" (1991) and collecting action figures. When Lucas released the "special editions" of his first three "Star Wars" movies, Headland lined up at her local theater on opening night. A few years ago, she had Ralph McQuarrie's concept art for Princess Leia tattooed on her right hand.
"'Star Wars' has been a part of my personality since I can remember," Headland said. "So working on this show has been a dream. I had to take my shot."
She paused for a moment. "If it doesn't succeed, it's because of me," she said. "That's really scary to think about."
"No, no -- I'm not going to go there," she said, climbing back on that razor's edge.

Story's Familiar, but the Staging Isn't: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Adaptations of films will be a factor at the Tonys this year. Surprisingly the best of these shows are not always the most faithful.
A passing glance at this year's Tony nominations might trick a glancer into thinking the wrong artistic medium has crept onto the list. Among the nominees are "The Notebook," "The Outsiders" and "Days of Wine and Roses," based on three movies: a 2004 Nicholas Sparks romance, a 1983 coming-of-age crime drama directed by Francis Ford Coppola and a 1962 Blake Edwards melodrama about alcoholism. (They were, in turn, based on best-selling novels and a TV play.)
It's not that movie adaptations are uncommon in theater -- a number of mega-budget shows have been driven by silver-screen nostalgia, whether it's "Back to the Future" and "Aladdin" or that stalwart of the Broadway economy, "The Lion King." Splashy musicals, in particular, often come from recognizable cinematic sources: There's "Mean Girls," "Moulin Rouge," "Kinky Boots" and many more. Not all of them are hits, as "American Psycho," "Almost Famous" and "New York, New York" prove.
Given how much theater relies on visitors buying tickets to an experience they know they'll enjoy, it makes sense. Though there's plenty of artistry on display in these productions, blockbuster adaptations can feel, to financiers, like slam dunks, safer bets than original material. The same nostalgia that drives sequels and reboots in cinema is at play: We know audiences like it, so let's give them some more.
But intellectual property that's bankable isn't everything, and increasingly, interesting theater comes from movie sources hailing from left field. "Teeth," for instance, a musical by Michael R. Jackson and Anna K. Jacobs, made a bloody, buzzy Off Broadway splash this winter at Playwrights Horizons; it's based on a 2008 indie horror classic about a young woman with vagina dentata. Over at St. Ann's in Brooklyn, Tobias Menzies starred in "The Hunt," adapted by David Farr from Thomas Vinterberg's 2013 Norwegian thriller.
Sitting in the audience, I was delighted by these shows even in the moments when they didn't quite work. They felt inventive and thoughtful, as if the creators had ingested the films and then made them their own. After each curtain call, I left the theater thinking about what made the adaptation so interesting, and what it showed about the power of both cinema and theater.
For instance, "Days of Wine and Roses," a morality tale about the evils of booze, is based on a film that leans into pedantic after-school special territory. But the production rode not on plot so much as on the musical performances of its stars, Brian d'Arcy James and Kelli O'Hara, who landed a nomination apiece -- and they were splendid. The acting was also key to "The Outsiders," which, despite its pedigree (and its own source material, S.E. Hinton's best-selling novel), is more cult classic than mainstream favorite. Its excellent translation to the stage stands brilliantly on its own legs in large part because of its kinetic cast: The performances are loaded with all the charisma and longing these teenage characters demand. Both theatrical productions also depend on songs that were not present in their source films, exposing fresh, raw nerves in the stories.
These join a relatively recent spate of adaptations of independent films, the kind found at Sundance, that have graced New York's stages in recent years and garnered both fans and awards. The films of 2007, for instance, have provided great fodder years after their release: "Once" (based on John Carney's movie musical) opened on Broadway in 2012, "Waitress" (based on Adrienne Shelly's romantic drama) opened in 2016, and "The Band's Visit" (based on Eran Kolirin's comedy) opened in 2017. Each film told an intimate story about friendship and love found in unexpected places, and onstage they eschewed splash and flash to retain that sense of modest humanity. As films, they'd all had a measure of success and acclaim. Onstage, they were phenomena.
Even documentaries can translate to the stage: See "Grey Gardens" (2006), based on the groundbreaking 1975 Maysles brothers film, or the forthcoming "The Queen of Versailles," based on Lauren Greenfield's 2012 documentary.
And unlikely pairings crop up, too, in Stephen Sondheim's final work, "Here We Are," which premiered Off Broadway last year. It draws on two movies directed by Luis Buñuel: "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" (1972) and "The Exterminating Angel" (1962). Both are masterworks of cinema, but they're more often seen at the art house or in the classroom than on, say, an airplane. Buñuel is not exactly a laid-back crowd-pleaser. The show wasn't either, but it was at least an intriguing concept.
The border between theater and film, of course, has always been porous. Stage adaptations of films have had their reverse counterparts since Hollywood's early decades, when plays and musicals were translated into a great deal of the silver screen's most iconic works, like "Casablanca" and "A Streetcar Named Desire." Playwrights often made the shift to Hollywood to work as screenwriters, and over the decades that bicoastal move has been common. The stage was loaded with ripe material for studios, to be sure, but some plays also came with the imprimatur of serious art, which meant elements that might have been eschewed in the decades of the censorious Hays Code could slip through. The film adaptation of Edward Albee's 1962 play "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf," which contained profanity technically proscribed in Hollywood at the time, was one of the films responsible for the disintegration of the Code.
But when it comes to contemporary film-to-stage adaptations, there seems to be two camps. There are the nostalgia shows, based on popular intellectual property and an expectation that the audience knows and loves the material. "Back to the Future," for instance, currently on Broadway, is more or less an eye-popping, one-to-one transfer from film to stage, featuring songs loaded with jokes that mostly functioned as fan service. An extreme recent example of this was Ian Shaw and Joseph Nixon's play "The Shark Is Broken," which took as its setting the filming of "Jaws," and made no sense at all if you weren't steeped in "Jaws" lore.
The other camp faces bigger hurdles. You might not have even heard of the original, and so the productions can't rely upon the audience's memories. These shows also take for granted that fans who do know the underlying story are ready to encounter it in a new way. "The Notebook," based on a weepie classic that fans rewatch endlessly, opted to reimagine its material, leaving the basic plot and emotional core intact while significantly mixing up how it's presented. The result works powerfully, even if you've never seen the movie; if you have, it's like a fresh lens, a cover of a favorite song that works all on its own.
In a time when theater, always precarious, feels as if it's teetering on the brink, and Hollywood is barely hanging on, it's fascinating to see theater-makers turning toward less obviously commercial movie properties for new works. For the work to actually succeed, there needs to be a willingness to experiment with the underlying property.
What's striking to me, watching the second category of shows as a film critic, is the kind of fresh insight they bring to the underlying material. After all, theater presents restrictions to artists that filmmakers don't encounter -- there's no editing, no multiple takes, no reliance on green screens, no "fixing it in post." And the way plots and characters operate in many films aims for a realism that's almost inherently absent on the stage. Theater requires the audience to engage in a much higher level of suspension of disbelief, and so the writing changes, forced into finding a truly fresh angle on the original. For film fans weary of reboots that barely bother to reimagine their source material in interesting ways, theatrical adaptations feel like a shot in the arm.
There are more to come. Productions of "Death Becomes Her" (based on Robert Zemeckis's 1992 satirical black comedy) and "Good Night, and Good Luck" (based on the 2005 drama directed by George Clooney, who will star in the Broadway show) have been announced in recent weeks. And while Disney has been in the theater game for a long time, producing shows at the New Amsterdam Theater, other film companies are eyeing the stage too. In 2023, the indie darling movie production company A24 bought the Cherry Lane Theater, a small but venerable venue in Greenwich Village. Netflix, meanwhile, is a co-producer on "Patriots," which nabbed a Tony nomination for its star, Michael Stuhlbarg.
Nobody quite knows what the future holds for the entertainment industry, and theater is, if anything, an even riskier business than movies. But it's exciting to see the age-old relationship between the cinema and the stage take on a new tenor -- and perhaps it can help reinvigorate both arts.

Full text: I just wrapped up a reporting fellowship at The Times, covering space, physics and the intersection of science and society, from Chicago. It's a job that immerses me in all things science, so in my free time I like to escape into other realms. Here are five things I've been indulging in lately.
Aaron Kamm and the One Drops
Aaron Kamm and the One Drops were performing in southern Illinois when I was there in April covering the total solar eclipse. I immediately fell in love with their sound, which is a blend of reggae, soul and blues. I'm still exploring their discography, and my favorite song so far is "Make It Better."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith
People doubted that Donald Glover could pull off "Mr. & Mrs. Smith," a new Prime Video series inspired by the 2005 film. But I'm a big fan of his genre-bending work, and this show did not disappoint. He and Maya Erskine have so much unexpected chemistry!
Proof
This Pulitzer Prize-winning play by David Auburn is about the daughter of a mathematical genius and weaves together themes of family, gender, elitism and the fine line between intelligence and insanity. I caught a production by Bluebird Arts, a Chicago theater company, and found it poignant and profound.
Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals
This might just be the best book on productivity I've ever read. Oliver Burkeman argues that efficiency is a trap, and because our life spans are only, on average, 4,000 weeks, we should embrace the fact that we will never get everything done. Only then can we cut out the noise and enjoy what really matters.
Avatar: The Last Airbender
The live-action remake of "Avatar: The Last Airbender," which came out on Netflix earlier this year, reminded me how much I loved the original animated series. It's about a boy who has to master control over the four elements so he can save the world, and I've been slowly reworking my way through it.

Actor Powered by Coffee, Tea and Cars: [Metropolitan Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Rainey starts his day with tea, and then it's time for fancy cars, making beats and Call of Duty with his friends.
Michael Rainey Jr. had looked up to the rapper 50 Cent since he was 8 years old. So when he landed the opportunity to work with him (real name: Curtis James Jackson III) on the Starz crime drama "Power," he couldn't have been more excited.
"Once I heard 50 Cent, my eyes just lit up," Mr. Rainey said.
For the past 10 years, he has been an actor in the "Power" universe -- first in the original series, which ran for six seasons, and now as the star of the spinoff "Power Book II: Ghost." He plays Tariq St. Patrick, the student-turned-drug-dealer son of the original series' lead character, Ghost.
"He's basically raised on lies, so he really grew up with trust issues," Mr. Rainey, 23, said of his character. "He has the smarts, but I feel like he's just a product of his environment, of where he grew up and the kind of family that he was raised in."
In the fourth, and final, season of "Power Book II: Ghost," which premieres on June 7, Mr. Rainey says fans can expect "nonstop, high-stakes action." "It's like no other season of 'Ghost,"' he said.
Like his character on "Power," Mr. Rainey grew up in New York. An only child, he was born to Shauna Small and Michael Rainey Sr. in Louisville, Ky., and raised on Staten Island.
"The environment and culture of New York have always been a part of my life growing up here, and made it easier to relate to my character in 'Power' and bring my genuine experiences to my performance," Mr. Rainey said.
He landed his first role at 11 years old in the Italian film "Un altro mondo," which led to appearances in the Netflix series "Orange Is the New Black," Ice Cube's "Barbershop: The Next Cut" and Lee Daniels's "The Butler."
Mr. Rainey Jr. lives alone in a loft in Jersey City, N.J., although he often has family members staying with him.
FRESH CUT I got a haircut in the morning to start the day. I woke up, brushed my teeth, and then I just got straight in the chair. My barber came to my house. I was half asleep when that was happening. I got a little shape-up, crew cut. I have to look professional for you guys.
TEA TIME I get up, wash the face, brush the teeth, pop in the shower, then I get me a cup of tea. For some reason I love tea. Tea just makes me feel good. For the most part, I really like ginger tea, like honey, ginger and lemon.
CRUISING AROUND I'll just go in my car, drive around and enjoy the weather and the sound of my car. I love my car, so I be spending a lot of time in my cars. I have multiple. I have a BMW M5, an Audi R8, a Porsche 911 Turbo S, and then I have an old-school E30 BMW. It's like an '89, I believe.
CAR CAFE Sunday Motor Co., it's like a super cool little restaurant-cafe, and every Sunday they have a car-meet thing. People come with their cars, and then they eat food. I had super fire chili eggs. Then there was this guy, and I always see his car when I go to Sunday Motor Co., but I never see him. So, I finally saw him and put a face to the car, and we had a pretty good conversation. He has a BMW-only car club, and I'm part of it now because he thinks I'm cool.
STUDIO SESSION We went to the studio, but I forgot my laptop at home. For the most part, when I'm in the studio, I'm just chilling with my friends, making beats, recording music with my friends. Then I have other producer friends that make beats, so we'll be collaborating, making beats together. It'll be four or five of us just making one beat, just going crazy, adding a million sounds, just seeing what works.
COFFEE BREAK When I am filming, I love coffee. The amount of coffee I drink when I'm filming is bad. You get a fire latte with oat milk. That's fire. I ain't going to lie to you. I'll be going to Gregorys, and the coffee is pretty all right.
KNICKS NIGHT I went to the Knicks [Game 7 against the Indiana Pacers]. The Knicks lost. I was so sad. But at halftime, I got me a good burger. I had my Daily Burger. Yo, Daily Burgers are so good. I don't know why they're so good, but they're so simple and so good. After the game, I didn't have an appetite because we lost.
VIDEO GAMES I mostly play video games over watching TV. I love playing Call of Duty on Sundays. It's a great way for me to get to hang out virtually with all of my friends, because we all play together. It's not just about the game itself, but the social aspect of connecting and spending time with my friends, even when we can't be together in person.
SHOWER HOUR I'll be in the shower forever. Maybe an hour and 20 minutes, maybe an hour and a half. I like the steam and just feel like I'm in a cloud of relaxation.

Brooke Shields on Aging and Empowerment: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some stories are so perfect and poignant that even if we suspect they are not true, we simply do not want to know.
There is a white peacock perched inside Brooke Shields's home in New York City. She named it Steve. He sits frozen on an acrylic pedestal, feathers draped to the floor. Ms. Shields was told he was rescued from other peafowl, who can turn aggressive toward their old, pecking them to death.
"I'm probably being lied to through the beak," said Ms. Shields, whose pun usage can be contagious. But the story made sense to her. She sighed at the taxidermy. "The really beautiful ones are all male. Doesn't it figure?"
There is no universal experience of aging. But surely some American women can relate to feeling pecked or prodded, and pushed aside when they reach middle age.
At least that was a sentiment shared with Ms. Shields in 2021, when she founded an online community called Beginning Is Now. More than 100,000 people followed the group's Instagram account, which posted inspirational content for women over 40.
It felt very much like a women's magazine -- with interviews, listicles, giveaways and recurring columns (Dear Brooke and Brooke Don't Cook) -- though without all of the advertising. Beginning Is Now mostly sold merch: workout sets and bright yellow hoodies.
Occasionally Ms. Shields would host group Zoom calls with her followers. They would ask questions like, "Do you feel like you're being overlooked?" Ms. Shields would answer: "As a woman, yes, I feel that somehow, once we hit a certain age, it's assumed that we're no longer sexy." Another woman would chime in: "'It's as if the light switches have been turned off,"' Ms. Shields said.
"It wasn't angry," she said of the tenor of the conversations. "I was worried that there would be this undercurrent of anger. There was more of an undercurrent of bewilderment."
It was during these Zoom calls that Beginning Is Now began to morph. Certain "fraught" age-related issues kept coming up, Ms. Shields said. Like hair -- thinning, coarsening, graying hair.
"Very soon people said, 'Well, what can we buy?"' she said.
The skin of her nascent media brand began shedding. Infographics and merch were no longer enough for Ms. Shields, who had put a small team of executives together and mined the community for ideas. In June, a new company will emerge, called Commence. It will sell three hair-care products on its website.
In the modern beauty industry, there is precedent for pivoting from content to commerce: Glossier, valued at $ 1.8 billion in 2021, was born from the blog Into the Gloss. Its first skin-care products were developed using feedback from the website's commenters.
But for anyone familiar with Ms. Shields's career, Commence also makes one of those perfect and poignant stories.
Ever since she could crawl, Ms. Shields has been the face of household products: a model for Ivory soap at 11 months, Band-Aids at 5, Colgate toothpaste at 10, Calvin Klein jeans at 15, Coppertone sunscreen at 43, La-Z-Boy furniture at 45, and that is just a highlight reel. In the 1980s, her name was put on blow dryers and curling irons and hair crimpers. "By the way, I loathe the color purple, and all of the products were purple," she said. "I didn't know I had anything to say about it."
Now, at 59, Ms. Shields is a chief executive overseeing how her products are made and how her name is used to sell them. It is capitalist empowerment.
"I've sold for other people my whole life," Ms. Shields said.
'An Accessibility'
I did not expect to find Teri Shields, famed stage mother, at her daughter's house in the West Village of Manhattan. But there she was, blending into a marble-topped bar in the living room. Among liquor bottles and barware sat Teri's urn. Ms. Shields lifted the lid to show me.
"Closest to the things that she liked the most," said Ms. Shields, whose mother died in 2012 at age 79. "Booze and me."
Their relationship formed the emotional spine of "Pretty Baby: Brooke Shields," a documentary released on Hulu last April that re-examined her early life.
The title mirrored that of a 1978 film in which Ms. Shields played a 12-year-old prostitute in early 20th-century New Orleans -- the first time she, and her mother's parenting choices, made international headlines. She became a sex symbol before she became a teenager.
Ms. Shields also discloses in the documentary that in her 20s, after graduating from Princeton University, she was raped by a Hollywood executive. She did not say his name, and to her relief and surprise, viewers moved past the revelation fairly quickly.
"I thought, 'Wow, this is a first -- so that's not all I am," Ms. Shields said. "Whereas when I was younger, my sexuality was all I was -- that and beauty."
Unlike many other celebrity documentaries, Ms. Shields did not produce the project or control the final edit. It was co-produced by people she trusted, however, including her friends Ali Wentworth and the ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos.
"I used to always say to her, 'You should either be in rehab or dead based on your childhood,"' Ms. Wentworth said. "She can be at a dinner party and tell a story, and you're laughing -- it's really entertaining -- but then you go, 'Oh, this is actually a very tragic story.' She can disassociate in a way that has protected her for her whole life."
Ms. Shields is funny and candid. But her singular gift is her ability to relate to people, even if they'll never be able to relate to her. Even among her famous friends -- like her neighbor, Bradley Cooper, who might be casually taking a call in Ms. Shields's garden on a Tuesday afternoon, unbeknown to The New York Times reporter sitting on her couch inside -- Ms. Shields's very unusual girlhood sets her apart. It isolates her. No one else on this planet was christened by Time magazine as the "look" of the 1980s.
And yet there is still "an accessibility with Brooke that people love," Ms. Wentworth said. "People feel like they know her, and that somehow, whatever she tells you to use or drink or wear, is real. A friend is telling you to do that."
Ms. Shields is well aware of her public perception, with all of its benefits (instant press when she starts a beauty brand) and drawbacks (the need to convince investors and consumers that this is not just another celebrity beauty brand in a market saturated by celebrity beauty brands).
There is always a moment -- and Ms. Shields always notices it -- when people settle into her company for the first time. They relax their grip on the idea of Brooke Shields and begin to adjust to the reality of her.
"Sometimes it's a flicker in the eye, sometimes it's an exhale," she said. Sometimes it's the moment your eyes stop flicking between Steve the peacock and Ms. Shields's rhinestone Prada loafers and the Keith Haring and Will Cotton artworks on her walls. "And then we can just do our jobs."
Privately, that was one of her motivations for pursuing the presidency of the Actors' Equity Association, a labor union representing stage performers and managers. (Ms. Shields's Broadway credits include Rizzo in "Grease," Roxie in "Chicago" and Morticia in "The Addams Family.") She saw an opportunity to champion the people who make theater possible and to use her name to bring attention to union issues. But she also liked that this job would not be explicitly about her.
"That appeals to me," said Ms. Shields, who won the election on May 24. "It's a lot of me all the time. And it has been that way since I was an infant."
'A Woman of Substance'
The summer box office may be off to a disastrous start, but as of May 23, the most-watched original film on any streaming platform was a romantic comedy starring Brooke Shields.
"Mother of the Bride" has remained in Netflix's top 10 movies, peaking at No. 1, since its release on May 9.
Of all the moving pieces of Ms. Shields's life, acting is still the thing that makes her feel like a "complete person," she said. "I go to sleep thinking about it and wake up thinking about it."
Until that moment, Ms. Shields had generally been composed and analytical in conversation -- she once stopped midsentence to deconstruct the definition of "catharsis." But when discussing her acting career, there was a new urgency in her voice: "I must continue to pursue it tirelessly," she said, sitting up in a makeup chair in a hotel bathroom, preparing for a photo shoot. There was so much pent-up desire that she seemed to struggle to express the size of it.
"If I could be in 'Hacks,"' she said, almost bursting, "that is what I want for my life. That level of humor." She recalled watching a scene from that Max series in which an iPhone is unlocked not by Face ID -- the owner's face is recovering from an eye lift -- but by the face of her wax museum figure. "I now know there is actually a God."
It is not that Ms. Shields doesn't speak about Commence with the same enthusiasm. It is just a different flavor of enthusiasm. She has raised about $ 3.5 million from investors. She can cite relevant statistics (by 2025 there will be 80 million women over 40 in the United States) and has learned the unlyrical language of the business: capitalization tables, convertible notes, price equity round, total addressable market.
But she doesn't see herself in this position forever. "I'll always be the founder," she said. "But at a certain point, we are going to grow so exponentially that it's going to take a kick-ass C.E.O. to bring us to that next level."
Last year, Ms. Shields appointed a company president, Denise Landman, who was the founder and former chief executive of Victoria's Secret Pink. That brand was tailored to young women, 18 or 19, who were "half woman, half child," Ms. Landman said. "You really haven't been humbled around too much by the world writ large."
By contrast, Ms. Landman identifies the Commence customer as "a woman of substance," someone who has accumulated knowledge and experience and pride over her decades, "much as soil layers up and becomes more nurturing over time," she said. "That substance is earned."
To Ms. Landman, who said she is in her late 60s, it is not a worthwhile exercise to dwell on problems like itchy scalps or brittle hair. "The place to dwell is, God gave me a head of hair," she said. "Let me make the most beautiful head of hair it can be."
As for Ms. Shields, she can relate to more middle-aged anxieties than one might think, she said.
Yes, she somehow survived the '80s and '90s without internalizing toxic beauty standards -- spared, she explained, by her mother's mind-set that her beauty was their path toward financial security. (Modeling was just a job with no relation to her self-worth.) And yes, she doesn't entirely mind the experience of gaining 5 or 10 pounds. ("I immediately look younger," she said. "It's like natural filler.") And yes, those eyebrows are natural and majestic.
But Ms. Shields still knows what it is like to pee a little bit when she sneezes. She still injects the crevice between her eyebrows to make it disappear before doing a movie. And she still has a minor crisis of identity over her daughters, now 18 and 21, leaving home. "If I'm not mom 24/7, who am I?" she said.
"I really identify with so much more than people have given me credit for," Ms. Shields said. "Might I remind you, I'm still a female and still human."

Full text: In a strong month for indie games, Hauntii is a hunt for memories and Crow Country offers retro survival in a creepy amusement park. The origami-like Paper Trail feels a bit thin.
In a month rife with original indie games, including Animal Well and Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, there has seemingly been something for every player. The creativity continues with Hauntii, Crow Country and Paper Trail, even though one stumbles a bit.
Hauntii
The inventive characters in Hauntii speak few words, but those words can pierce. "I hate you," one cute devil says after you climb meandering steps to reach him.
This 10-hour adventure game by the studio Moonloop can be slightly subversive as well, all the while musing upon what the afterlife means. Hauntii, a tiny, faceless Druid-esque being, embarks upon his trek energetically. But the point of his cowl hood droops behind his head, perhaps from the sheer weight of finding out he's died.
In this invitingly artful, mostly monochromatic world, Hauntii soon meets an Eternian, seemingly an angel with flowing hair. Hauntii's green eyes become wide with attraction. She lifts him to the heavens, where they ascend hand in hand to observe sparkling constellations -- a wonderful representation of love at first sight.
As it can be with relationships, she leaves. To find her, it's key to remember who you once were by collecting lustrous stars hidden among trees or locked away in cages. As you search, the characters encourage you to stay in their world, a place where you can always be safe. There's nothing good where the Eternian is, they caution.
Yet it's not safe where you are either.
A giant, chained Bell Guardian, its mouth twisted down like a Melpomene mask of tragedy, employs minions to kill you. Hopping beings that look like Q-bert with legs might stomp on you. With haunt ability, I inhabited these trumpet-nosed creatures to jump quickly past enemies. If you stray from your appointed path into a roadless blackness, red eyes appear nightmarishly. Linger for too long, and you'll lose your life.
Haunting to shake pine trees reveals pieces of hearts for health, and an occasional brilliant star. Collect enough and you're lofted into the heavens to complete a constellation. From high in space, silent stick figure vignettes appear to show momentary hints of your life, like tender parental hugs after being bullied by a teacher. That these memories have so much emotional impact is a credit to the creators.
Hauntii's most gobsmacking achievement is the Wickland Carnival. On the midway, a gangly grim reaper sells ride tickets in exchange for a portion of your soul. The line is long with adults and children, all happily queuing up to sell their very essence. As the camera pulls back, the long shot reveals a spectacular roller coaster that rumbles at the north end, looping twice as it's bathed in fireworks and its harried passengers scream gleefully. Gaining admission to the rickety ride is another puzzle Hauntii needs to solve before his journey through Eternity is complete.
Crow Country
A homage to the original PlayStation era, Crow Country is made for nostalgia lovers who don't mind graphics that aren't presented in 4K, and who love a puzzle game that requires concentration and note taking. It is especially inspired by Resident Evil, from 1996, the console's classic survival horror game.
Here, you are Mara Forest, a brown-haired investigator in a white dress who searches for the missing entrepreneur Mr. Crow. She's a no-nonsense, generally delightful presence who has limited ammo to protect herself from the grossly mutated creatures that appear in an abandoned amusement park, the eponymous Crow Country.
Inside, the overall mood is creepy rather than horrifying. Eeriness pervades. The soundtrack, full of long, tense notes and gruesome screams, gets under your skin. Nothing is really as it appears. There's the mechanical Great Fairy of Fairest Forest, which spins around to reveal a walkway once the proper code is entered, leading to more disturbing denizens. A tiny house requires crawling on hands and knees like Lewis Carroll's Alice.
The puzzles in Crow Country, from SFB Games, move from simple to quite complex, and there's much backtracking hither and yon for clues and items to aid your tasks. I used a reporter's notebook to write down hints that the park's staff members left on the walls. The world map is quite extensive with its many rooms, goony surprises and mild humor. One area is called the Mush Room. Inside, the Mushroom King sits alone at a long, dark dining table with unlit candles.
The mutated beings often come from the grim shadows. Shooting them with a laser-guided pistol isn't always accurate. And turning to run away using the D-pad is a learning experience. (If you merely want to explore Crow Country's many appealing peculiarities without fear of being attacked, there's a mode that stops mutants from appearing.)
Yet the primary answer to the mystery is one you might overlook. If you miss checking your inventory to read a crumpled yellow paper that Mr. Crow handed over during the 10-hour game's finale, you won't realize the potentially dire situation the world may encounter in the future. One eerie battle is won. But the indication is that there may be more later, thus setting up a potential sequel.
Paper Trail
In Paper Trail, a top-down fairy tale, you fold, unfold and fold again until a path is revealed to pass an obstacle in a world rendered in moody watercolor backgrounds. I quickly recalled my childhood distractions like folding paper into planes and more intricate origami but ultimately became flummoxed by all the folding.
Here in the seaside community of Southfold, a lightning storm complete with damaging winds wreaks havoc, and the eel fisherman who has been trapped because a bridge crumbled asks for assistance. Dragging and folding the game's edges as if the screen were a piece of paper, you discover a new way to traverse.
For some reason, the fisherman worries whether Aunt Maude survived the storm. How does he know her? Do they have a secret relationship? It's not revealed, but the puzzles become more intricate from there.
Maude has been eating pine cones because she's been trapped by the squall's damage. That's when Paige, an 18-year-old aspiring astrophysicist whose parents don't want her to leave for college, comes to the rescue.
Paper Trail, an eight-hour experience by Newfangled Games, is published by Netflix and playable on smartphones and all major consoles. I chose to indulge on Nintendo's Switch because of the larger touch-screen. It's not always easy, however, to pull portions of the screen to lead Paige to a new path. It's more difficult when the virtual paper edges sometimes become stuck, regardless of the hint button's how-to diagrams.
Paige moves though some compelling environments, beautifully detailed and inked like a children's book. I particularly lingered over a sunset pond just outside a cave in which she takes refuge. Fold the edges properly to reveal a green-hued morning with a white antlered stag far in the distance.
After journeys through swamps and snow, Paige eventually gets to college. Despite the apparent symbolism that the path to higher education isn't always an easy one, this trek wasn't always worth the effort. The story is paper thin and the origami-influenced gameplay mechanic doesn't always bend the space-time continuum.
Hauntii was reviewed on a PC and is also available on all major consoles. Crow Country was reviewed on the PlayStation 5 and is also available on the PC and Xbox Series X|S. Paper Trail was reviewed on the Switch and is also available on all major consoles and smartphones.

Comedy
Theo Von
May 31 at 8 p.m. at the Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, Manhattan; msg.com/beacon-theatre.
Theo Von has come a long way since he first appeared on television as a teenager competing on MTV's "Road Rules" in 2000. It took years for him to persuade people to see him as a stand-up comedian and not just another reality-TV personality. What finally helped set him apart was his podcast, "This Past Weekend," which he started in 2016.
The show is a top 10 hit on Spotify, drawing in millions of listeners wanting to hear Von's stream-of-consciousness style, responses to callers' voice mail messages and interviews with a wide range of guests, from the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson to a New York City sanitation worker. Championing the Everyman has been a theme: For his second Netflix special, "Regular People," which came out in 2021, he waxed nostalgic about the people he grew up with in small-town Louisiana.
Only a handful of tickets, which are $ 56 on Ticketmaster, remain for Von's one-night-only stop in New York City on his "Return of the Rat Tour." SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Anitta
June 2-3 at 8 p.m. at the Brooklyn Paramount, 385 Flatbush Avenue Extension, Brooklyn; brooklynparamount.com.
After garnering attention in her native Brazil through the early 2010s with Portuguese dance-pop tracks like "Show das Poderosas," Anitta made inroads in Latin America's broader Spanish-language market through collaborations with artists like Maluma. From there, she set her sights on crossing over to the United States.
But, increasingly, artists need not water down their homegrown sounds -- or perform in English -- to reach American audiences. To date, Anitta's biggest Hot 100 hit is "Bellakeo," a sweaty reggaeton duet with the Mexican singer Peso Pluma. And on her latest album, "Funk Generation," Anitta is firmly anchored in her Brazilian roots, paying tribute to funk carioca -- a bawdy fusion of Miami bass and samba born in the working-class favelas of Rio de Janeiro -- while singing in three languages.
Anitta's "Baile Funk Experience" tour stops at the Brooklyn Paramount on Sunday and Monday. Tickets start at around $ 70 on LiveNation. OLIVIA HORN
Eric Dolphy: Freedom of Sound
June 1-2 at John L. Tishman Auditorium, the New School, 63 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan; seedartists.org.
A festival celebrating the music of the trailblazing jazz explorer Eric Dolphy (1928-64) should itself be pointedly unpredictable. A source of inspiration for boundary-pushing jazz musicians who is perhaps best known for his epochal 1964 LP "Out to Lunch!" (Blue Note), Dolphy mastered multiple instruments (alto sax, flute, bass clarinet), led bold ensembles, challenged harmonic conventions and proved a crucial collaborator to Charles Mingus and John Coltrane as they smashed boundaries of their own.
A decade has passed since the first Freedom of Sound festival (held at Montclair State University in 2014), and this gathering again assembles a host of the jazz world's top players-thinkers-troublemakers, like Nicole Mitchell, Angelica Sanchez, Don Byron, Patricia Brennan, Matthew Shipp and James Brandon Lewis. The programming includes a dance concert and a symposium, as well as performances of lost Dolphy compositions and Geri Allen's "Celebration Ensemble Suite for Eric Dolphy" -- but most of all allows plenty of room for surprise.
Performances begin at 6 p.m. on Saturday and 3 p.m. on Sunday. Tickets are $ 35 for a day pass, or $ 60 for the weekend, at Seed Artists' website. ALAN SCHERSTUHL
Kids
Teens Take the Met!
May 31, 4-8 p.m., at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan; metmuseum.org.
It's rare to be able to enjoy creative activities from more than 15 museums by entering just one. But that's the enviable opportunity that awaits teenagers on Friday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
That afternoon and evening, the museum is inviting imaginative young people to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Teens Take the Met!, an annual revel for adolescent artists, performers, writers, scientists and spectators. Free for students 13 and older with a middle school or high school ID, the event features partnerships with over 50 cultural organizations.
That means, for instance, that visitors can create zines with the Bronx Museum Teen Council, build massive dowel structures with the New York Hall of Science and make a feminist-inspired altar with El Museo del Barrio. They can also experience a Battle of the Bards with Titan Theater Company and compose riddles with Writopia Lab.
The Met itself will teach about collection care and object conservation. Met Teens, participants in the museum's internship programs, will present work including "Harlem Then & Now," an immersive art installation. (A full schedule is online.)
And if the hordes are hungry -- or just hungry to move -- they can enjoy snacks and silent dance parties, too. LAUREL GRAEBER
Dance
The LaMaMa Moves! Dance Festival
Through June 2 at various locations in Manhattan; lamama.org.
Since the 1960s, LaMaMa has been a haven for adventurous artists freed from the rigid confines of genres, and since 2006, it has been home to this eclectic and imaginative festival of movement under the astute, longtime curation of Nicky Paraiso. The 19th edition concludes this weekend with a trio of distinct, probing performances.
On Saturday, Dancers Unlimited, a company based in New York and Hawaii, presents "Edible Tales: Hoʻokupu <The Offering>," an interactive work exploring cultural heritage and sustainability through dance and food, drawing on the dancers' own histories (at 2 and 7 p.m. at the Ellen Stewart Theater, 66 East 4th Street). Also on Saturday, Ryuji Yamaguchi draws on his years of living in Jordan and collaborating with Palestinian artists in "Love Story Palestine" (at 2 p.m. at the Center for Remembering and Sharing, 41 East 11th Street). And throughout the weekend, John Scott physically responds to famous German operas in "Heroes" (Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 8:30 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m. at the Club at La MaMa, 74A East 4th Street).
Tickets start at $ 10 on LaMaMa's website. BRIAN SCHAEFER

Leaping at the Chance to Spike the Competition: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This film extends the story told in an anime series about high school volleyball teams.
For someone unfamiliar with "Haikyu!!," the anime adaptation of a slice-of-life manga about a high school volleyball team, the premise may seem a bit niche. And yet the series, which continues in the form of the film "Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle," has always excelled at making its wholesome sports drama accessible to every kind of audience -- especially those who may not know anything about volleyball.
The series focuses on Shoyo Hinata, a short teenager who dreams of becoming a volleyball champion like his idol, a small-statured ace called the Little Giant. He enrolls at the Little Giant's former high school, Karasuno, and joins the volleyball team with his middle school nemesis, Tobio Kageyama. The two boys form a superhuman pair that helps revitalize the team and offers Karasuno the opportunity to return to its former glory.
Directed by Susumu Mitsunaka, "The Dumpster Battle," which feels like more of an extended episode than a stand-alone film, picks up during Karasuno's heated competition at the spring nationals. They are set to go against Nekoma, another team with which they've been caught for years in a friendly rivalry. The match takes up the entire movie, with flashbacks and series callbacks fully contextualizing the relationships and stakes at work in the game.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
As in every match in the series, the Dumpster Battle uses imaginative visual metaphors to depict each team's offensive and defensive strategies and overall playing philosophies. Karasuno is the crow, with Hinata's awe-inspiring leaps above the court represented by a crow making an airborne attack. Nekoma is the cat, grounded with solid defense, stalking and manipulating its prey until it can find the right moment to clip the crow's feathers. And both of these underdog squads want to earn respect and fight their way out of the dumpster.
Leading Nekoma is Kenma Kozume, an apathetic teen with no stamina and little athletic prowess who would rather play video games than volleyball. But Kenma, whom Hinata befriended at a training camp earlier in the series, is also Nekoma's mastermind, meticulously planning their attacks while his teammates make up for the athleticism he lacks.
In terms of the gameplay itself, while riveting and meticulously depicted, the Dumpster Battle pales in comparison to some of the more explosive multi-episode matches captured in the series. But this battle does contain more heart -- no easy feat in a show that consistently builds empathy for all of its characters, even the most abominable competitors, via arcs that relate how far passion and teamwork can take athletes striving toward victory. Under Kenma's leadership, Nekoma threatens to crush Karasuno, and particularly Hinata, who is targeted by Nekoma's offense; and yet Hinata and his team also eventually lead Kenma to a revelation about his relationship to the sport and his reasons for playing.
Though "The Dumpster Battle" is squarely aimed toward fans of the series, it has charms that may lead new viewers to the anime (streaming on Crunchyroll and Netflix) to follow the story from the beginning. Because even if crows and cats battling in a dumpster doesn't appeal to you, there's still the promise of watching good athletes play a good game -- and that's worth a seat in the bleachers.
Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle
Rated PG-13 for heated midmatch exchanges. In Japanese, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 25 minutes. In theaters.
Haikyu!! Rated PG-13 for XXXXX XXXXXXX. In Japanese, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 25 minutes. In theaters.

The Firm That Fell To Earth: [Review]

Full text: An illuminating documentary about the ill-fated (though now-revived) subscription service finds an unexpected story.
As a reporter, I spent the better part of 2018 puzzling over the meteoric rise and sensational nosedive of MoviePass, the brief beautiful dream of a subscription service that's the subject of Muta'Ali's new documentary "MoviePass, MovieCrash." Perhaps you remember those halcyon days. For about $ 10 a month, you could see any movie in any theater on any day. You received a debit card that you'd use to "purchase" the ticket, and then the company would reimburse the theater for the ticket's full cost. It worked, for a while, and it was amazing. But it made positively zero sense.
Anyone who passed third grade math can see why. If I pay $ 10 this month, and see only one movie, the company's probably already in the hole. (A normal, non-matinee ticket in New York City, where there were a whole lot of MoviePass subscribers, hovered around $ 15.) If I see two, the hole gets deeper. Now consider the people who go to two movies a week, or four, or seven, and you start to see the problem.
There was some speculation that MoviePass was working on the gym membership model -- lots of people subscribe, but few people actually use it, and they balance each other out. But that also makes very little sense. People, on the whole, tend to enjoy watching movies more than they enjoy slogging away on the StairMaster.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The only answer was that MoviePass was either trying to cut deals with studios and theaters, or selling and utilizing user data, or both -- especially since Helios and Matheson, MoviePass's publicly traded owner, was a data analytics firm. The answer is both, and the company's leadership was convinced that the bigger their user base, the more likely they'd be able to monetize audiences. After all, data showed that MoviePass drastically increased people's willingness to go to the movies, where they'd presumably spend money on concessions, too -- and that might translate to eagerness from theaters to keep the service alive. The company's chief executive, Mitchell Lowe, who was at Netflix in its early days, was certain that if they could reach five million users, they'd be operating in the black.
MoviePass didn't reach five million users, but for a while it seemed as though there would be no stopping it. Under the leadership of Lowe and Theodore Farnsworth, the chief executive of Helios and Matheson, the new subsidiary MoviePass Ventures produced the abysmal movie "Gotti" and threw a lot of very expensive parties in mid-2018. At the same time, if you were trying to actually use the service, it went from bad to worse to baffling: random blackout periods, strange requirements for purchasing tickets (like uploading photos of stubs) and near-constant changes to the terms and conditions. Eventually the Federal Trade Commission made accusations that MoviePass fraudulently deceived its customers to prevent power users from getting what they'd paid for. That era of MoviePass did not end well.
My friends and I still wistfully speak of those days, wondering what exactly happened there. Luckily, "MoviePass, MovieCrash" answers a lot of those questions, with the participation of the company's put-upon customer service agents, engineers, employees, investors and Lowe himself. But surprisingly, the film goes much further than expected. Streaming services are loaded with documentaries about scammy internet-era companies, but "MoviePass, MovieCrash" finds the barely told story in all the juicy facts.
That story is, in a sense, a tale as old as time. MoviePass in fact existed all the way back in 2011, co-founded by Stacy Spikes and Hamet Watt. The story they tell in the documentary is one of spotting a need in the market -- a threat to theatrical exhibition of films posed, in part, by the slow growth of streaming services -- and of figuring out a sustainable way to fill it. The answer was MoviePass, which cost more at the time (I believe I paid $ 49.99 per month in 2013, which was still a bargain) and seemed poised for success.
But as Spikes and Watt explain it, MoviePass is another story of Black entrepreneurs who, along with other underrepresented demographics, struggle to find investment capital and investor confidence in the market, creating something groundbreaking and then losing it to overconfident white men. There's no doubt that, under Lowe and Farnsworth, a promising service was run directly into the ground. The frustration that Spikes and Watt felt as they were pushed out of the company is palpable. And when Lowe opines on camera that Spikes "wasn't being a productive member of the team" when he voiced his concerns, you can feel that frustration, too.
All of this makes for an eye-opening documentary about a lot more than just MoviePass, worth watching whether you're nostalgic for the service or bitter about how it turned out -- or if you just think the whole thing was kind of hilarious. But there is a happy ending. In 2022, Spikes bought back the company, tweaked the service and relaunched MoviePass. And in 2023, it reported its first-ever year of profitability.

Reading Tea Leaves From Cannes: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Films backed by the studio Neon have won Cannes and gone on to Oscar nominations regularly in the last few years. That's one reason to keep an eye on "Anora."
Last year's Cannes Film Festival was practically a one-stop shop for Oscar voters, premiering three major films -- "Anatomy of a Fall," "The Zone of Interest" and "Killers of the Flower Moon" -- that would go on to be nominated for best picture.
Does this year's crop of Cannes movies have the same juice?
At the 77th edition of the festival, which concluded Saturday, Sean Baker's "Anora" was named the winner of the prestigious Palme d'Or. Three of the last four Palme winners went on to receive a best-picture nomination -- "Anatomy of a Fall," "Triangle of Sadness" and "Parasite" -- and all of them, like "Anora," were distributed by the studio Neon. That's an astonishing streak that positions "Anora" in the best way possible, lending a veneer of prestige to Baker's raucous comedy about a Brooklyn stripper who marries into Russian wealth.
In 2018, Baker's "The Florida Project" came awfully close to a best-picture nomination. If voters are more amenable to his indie sensibility this time around, expect robust campaigns for the lead Mikey Madison and for Baker's script and direction. More of a long shot but equally worthy is supporting actor Mark Eydelshteyn as the live-wire heir our title character weds: Though Oscar voters rarely reward young men, this kid's a total find, like a Russian Timothée Chalamet.
In a surprise move, the Cannes jury split the best actress award four ways, honoring the main female cast of the talked-about musical "Emilia Pérez." That means the ensemble member Selena Gomez now has a Cannes trophy that has eluded the likes of Marion Cotillard, though I suspect more fruitful Oscar campaigns would be waged on behalf of the leading lady Zoe Saldaña, who's never had a more robust role, and especially Karla Sofía Gascón, who could become the first trans actress to be nominated for an Oscar. (The fourth winner was Adriana Paz.)
Netflix has picked up "Emilia Pérez" and will certainly give it a significant awards push, though the streamer's stewardship could have drawbacks. It's true that this is a hard-to-classify film -- equal parts crime drama, trans empowerment narrative and full-blown movie musical -- which would have made it a difficult theatrical sell. But some of its more outrageous moments are certain to be memed and mocked as soon as it makes its streaming debut, which could hobble the film's reputation.
The best actor award at Cannes went to Jesse Plemons in "Kinds of Kindness," who adds invaluable humanity to the cracked Yorgos Lanthimos film, though its anthology nature -- Plemons plays different roles in each of the movie's three stories -- makes "Kinds of Kindness" an unlikely Oscar prospect. And though the talked-about horror film "The Substance" won a screenplay trophy at Cannes, it's a lot more likely to score awards attention for Demi Moore's lead performance as an actress driven to extreme lengths as she ages.
Two films that failed to win a prize or a distributor at Cannes are nevertheless hoping to mount a comeback bid this awards season. The Donald Trump biopic "The Apprentice" features Jeremy Strong as Roy Cohn in a juicy supporting performance that a studio could push if it were willing to deal with the former president's legal threats against the film. And though there will be critics and Oscar voters who admire the big swing of Francis Ford Coppola's self-financed "Megalopolis," I don't expect much traction for it outside of categories like costumes and production design.
"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga," which debuted out of competition in Cannes and opened weakly in theaters on Friday, is another likely tech player: It ought to score many of the same below-the-line nominations that its predecessor, "Mad Max: Fury Road," got in 2016, though picture and director nods aren't going to happen this time.
Cannes often premieres many of the eventual international-film nominees, but this year's biggest contender comes with a few caveats. There is no way Iran would select Mohammad Rasoulof's "The Seed of the Sacred Fig" as its official submission for the Oscar, since Rasoulof fled Iran to avoid an eight-year prison sentence for making movies that criticize that country's authoritarian government.
Neon knows how to navigate an Oscar bid for a film that won't be submitted for best international feature -- when France snubbed "Anatomy of a Fall" last year, Neon was undeterred -- though it would have helped if "Sacred Fig" had taken the Palme. But this is still a very accessible film for voters who will be moved by Rasoulof's own story.

Audra McDonald's 'Gypsy' Turn: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The six-time Tony-winning actress will play musical theater's most famous stage mother in a production directed by George C. Wolfe.
Audra McDonald has been dreaming of "Gypsy" since she was a 10-year-old in Fresno, Calif., with a small part in a dinner theater production of the musical. She played one of the children in a vaudeville act called "Uncle Jocko's Kiddie Show," and ever since, she said, "Gypsy" has remained "very much alive in my brain."
McDonald, who has won more competitive Tony Awards than any other performer in history, has for years been thinking about the show's main character, a domineering stage mother named Rose. She has even sung from the musical's score at some of her concerts.
Now, McDonald, 53, will play Rose in a Broadway revival of "Gypsy" opening later this year.
"It's one of the great roles in musical theater, and I've always thought maybe some day I could try it," McDonald said in an interview. "It scares me to death, but I certainly feel old enough now, and having experienced motherhood, perhaps I have what is needed to dive in and explore her and all that she is."
The production, directed by George C. Wolfe and choreographed by Camille A. Brown, is to begin previews on Nov. 21 and open Dec. 19 at the Majestic Theater, which has been under renovation since last year's closing of "The Phantom of the Opera." (That show ran there for 35 years.)
"Gypsy," first staged on Broadway in 1959, is inspired by the memoir of Gypsy Rose Lee, a stripper who reflects on her relationship with her mother. The musical's Rose is ravenously hungry for fame for her daughters, or maybe for herself. The role was originated by Ethel Merman, and has since been played on Broadway by Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Linda Lavin, Bernadette Peters and Patti LuPone, on film by Rosalind Russell and on television by Bette Midler.
McDonald said she sees "Gypsy," which features music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by Arthur Laurents, as "a perfect musical" and called Rose a "deeply flawed and brilliantly alive character." She recalled that in a 1989 review in The New York Times, Frank Rich wrote, "'Gypsy' is nothing if not Broadway's own brassy, unlikely answer to 'King Lear."'
McDonald has appeared in 13 Broadway shows. Most recently, she starred in a 2022 production of the Adrienne Kennedy play "Ohio State Murders." She has been nominated for Tony Awards 10 times; her six wins were for roles in "Carousel," "Master Class," "Ragtime," "A Raisin in the Sun," "Porgy and Bess" and "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill." She is the only person who has won Tonys in four different acting categories (leading and featured in musicals and plays).
Wolfe previously directed McDonald in the 2016 Broadway production of "Shuffle Along, or the Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed," as well as in last year's Netflix film "Rustin." Wolfe won Tony Awards for directing "Angels in America: Millennium Approaches" and "Bring in da Noise, Bring in da Funk" and this year is receiving a special Tony Award for lifetime achievement.
Wolfe said in an interview that McDonald asked him to direct the production, and added that he has a personal connection to one of the authors -- Laurents was among his teachers at N.Y.U. in the early 1980s, and became an early supporter of his career. He called "Gypsy" "a really great piece of theater literature" and Rose "one of the best written roles in the musical theater canon."
He said that his ideas for the production were still evolving. "The thing that keeps on resonating with me is the idea of not enough: not enough space, not enough love, not enough money," Wolfe said. "That's what's pulling me in."
The "Gypsy" revival -- which will be the sixth production of the show on Broadway -- is being lead produced by Tom Kirdahy and Mara Isaacs, who are also among the lead producers of "Hadestown."

Full text: This month's villains include naughty gay ghosts, savage seniors and a dangerously unhinged bro.
'The Jessica Cabin'
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
Have you ever said to someone: "I would kill to spend more time with you"? The characters in Daniel Montgomery's gay horror comedy say it a lot, with macabre but unexpectedly tender and very funny consequences for the living and the dead.
The film opens as a gay couple (Chase Williamson and Will Tranfo) check in at a secluded rental property of the title. There, a pair of ghost best friends -- Jackson (Montgomery) and Taylor (Riley Rose Critchlow) -- watch their new visitors eat, sleep and have sex. But the fun quickly takes a sinister turn, poignantly lifting the curtain on how Jackson and Taylor came to haunt the house and offering a reminder that trauma doesn't always leave a room when people do.
Montgomery, who wrote and directed this low-budget charmer, smartly balances the creepy and the nutty in a queer story that's as much about ghosts being catty as it is about loneliness in the here and agency in the afterlife. The cast is across-the-board good at conveying dark humor, especially in scenes that feel entirely improvised. There's nothing gory or truly scary here; you're more likely to cry than scream watching these big-hearted mortals and spirits maneuver their bizarre liminal world.
'Invasive'
Stream it on Tubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Like many cater-waiters, Kay (Khosi Ngema) and her gay bestie Riley (Matthew Vey) are eager to have a good time on a rich guy's dime. That's why they've hidden away one night in the mountaintop mansion of a smug billionaire, Pierce (Francis Chouler), after their party shift there ends. Riley leaves for a booty call, leaving Kay alone in the fortresslike home when Pierce, and later his girlfriend (Alex McGregor), unexpectedly return, kicking off a vicious cat-and-mouse game that the writer-director Jem Garrard lines with gruesome twists to bloody the way before a blowout finale.
Garrard follows up their previous Tubi original, the unfunny vampires-vs.-drag queen horror comedy "Slay," with a far more thrilling battle of wits, here between the have-a-lots and the have-nots. What could have been a heavy-handed 96-minute metaphor is instead a tight "Parasite"-aspiring thriller that's buoyed by terrific performances from Chouler (charming and sinister) and Ngema (fearless and calculating). For fans of home invasion films, this one comes with a nifty twist: The intruders are the good guys.
'The Ghost Station'
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The young reporter Na-young (Kim Bo-ra) is feeling pressure from the Korean newspaper where she works to "write a provocative story with a clickbait headline," as an editor tells her. She hits gold when she starts to cover mysterious goings-on inside an old section of a train station where people have been killed and where a child has been spotted among the darkness of the tracks. As Na-young probes the station's accident-prone history, her investigation leads her into battle against supernatural curses and undead hauntings (and greedy editors).
Hiroshi Takahashi, who co-wrote the film and who wrote the original "Ringu," here throws in a roster of J-horror best hits: demonic little kids, long-held grudges and even an evil well. But what Jeong Yong-ki's film lacks in originality it makes up for overall with an effectively creepy ghost story that, in a swift 80 minutes, doubles as a cautionary tale about the perils of shoddy journalism.
'Old People'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"There are old people everywhere!": That's the warning, and the political message, that drives this slick dystopian thriller from the German writer-director Andy Fetscher.
The film revolves around a mother (Melika Foroutan) and her kids (Bianca Nawrath and Otto Emil Koch) who head to the country for a wedding. There they meet up with the kids' grandfather (Paul Fassnacht), who lives in a decrepit, understaffed nursing home where the unsmiling, stooped-over residents look like a circle of maniacs. It's not a good time to be a German senior: The country has been rocked by a series of grisly murders inexplicably committed by older people.
Although Fetscher's script takes some harebrained turns, this is a raw killer zombie movie, of sorts, that's also a cutting and universal indictment of modern eldercare. It's not that high-minded, though: There are buckets of blood and guts, an extra-fiery finale and, best of all, revenge served senior style.
'Nightwatch: Demons Are Forever'
Stream it on Shudder.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
I'm somewhat a fan of "Nightwatch" (1994), Ole Bornedal's twisted and scrappy but tonally uneven psychological thriller about a morgue night watchman (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) who crosses paths with a psychopath scalper (Ulf Pilgaard) terrorizing Copenhagen. (Ewan McGregor starred in the 1997 American remake.)
Coster-Waldau -- or the Kingslayer Jaime Lannister, to "Game of Thrones" fans -- was the dashing heart and soul of the original. Here he returns as Martin, still dashing, in Bornedal's glossier and still tonally uneven sequel. (Pilgaard and another original cast member, Kim Bodnia, also reprise their roles.)
This time, Martin's 22-year-old daughter, Emma (Fanny Leander Bornedal) is a medical student who takes the night watch job overseeing what has become a much larger and gloomier morgue. Curious to learn more about what happened to her father when he worked there, Emma visits the scalper, now blind and disfigured and living in darkness at a mental institution. Their encounter sets them both on a sad and disturbing "Silence of the Lambs"-style trip with consequences that put Martin in the cross hairs.
You don't need to have seen "Nightwatch" to appreciate this film's meditations on suffering, aging and mental illness. I very much recommend this film to fellow horror lovers who have waited 30 years to find out what became of Martin after his weird night shift went to hell.

Michelle Buteau Has Sashayed Into the Lead: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Once relegated to supporting roles, this comedian is a star of the film "Babes" and is moving to a bigger stage, Radio City Music Hall, for her new special.
"Oh my God, are we best friends?" the comedian Michelle Buteau said, 27 seconds into meeting me.
Honestly, it was a joke that felt like it could ricochet into reality. It didn't. But that is the power of Buteau's ebullient charisma, which telegraphs to audiences that her preternatural comic rhythm and dolled-up, side-eye style of delivery are in service of being a warmhearted bestie. To her TV, film, podcast and stand-up fans, she's a moral center with a blue streak. "I truly, sincerely care," she said, "about these bitches."
The B-word is one that Buteau and her friend and co-star in the new comedy "Babes," Ilana Glazer, roll and dice into multiple syllables and meanings, in a sisterhood built on tell-it-like-it-is endearments, unfiltered but uplifting, like Buteau's comedy.
In "Babes," which was directed by Pamela Adlon, Buteau plays an exhausted working mother of two young children, reconfiguring her life minute by minute, task by task, to accommodate her career, her family, her partner and her friendships. Also the occasional hallucinogenic trip and breast pump-destroying dance party.
In real life, Buteau does that (or most of it), and is both cleareyed and funny about it: "Every day feels like a panic room -- I'm just searching for the next clue." Having 5-year-old twins with her Dutch husband, a house in the Bronx, some dogs and an ascending, multistrand career is undeniably a lot; the movie reflects that, too. "There's no such thing as balance," she said, during a recent lunch interview. "You do what you can, when you can."
In the last five years, Buteau, 46, has made the leap from a 20-year stalwart of the New York comedy scene to a headliner and the star of her own scripted Netflix series, "Survival of the Thickest," loosely based on her 2020 essay collection of the same name, and heading toward its second season. With "Babes," now in wide release, she also moves up from the BFF and assistants she played in Ali Wong's "Always Be My Maybe" and Jennifer Lopez's "Marry Me," to a lead: the movie is centered on the friendship between Glazer and Buteau's characters. It arrives as Buteau is preparing to film her second hourlong Netflix special, "Full Heart, Tight Jeans," on June 6 at Radio City Music Hall.
Her stories in that show, which she toured last year, lean inclusive and positive in what the New Yorker critic Hilton Als has described as a comedy of kindness. It's a style that bucks convention, the typical denigration of standup. She is "a luscious wisecracker," he wrote, who "treats herself -- and us -- like a snack."
Buteau has consciously positioned herself against other big-name comics who have griped about social change; onstage, she has called out Dave Chappelle by name for his anti-trans rhetoric. "I just want them to evolve a little bit more," she said of her (largely male) peers. "I don't know why it's so unpopular to be open-minded."
"I choose to lead with love because if I don't -- like, I would just be on the floor the whole time," she added. "I've been through enough hard stuff," including, as she describes in her book, reproductive struggles, colorism and body-shaming. "I want to be happy."
Overstretched, she initially turned down "Babes," which was filming right before she went into production on the first season of her Netflix series. But Glazer, the "Babes" co-writer and "Broad City" alum who's been a friend for over a decade, repeatedly begged her to reconsider, trimming down scenes to fit her schedule. "She's just a bright, shining star -- she doesn't suck air out of the room," Glazer said. "She gives light, and then we're all lit up." Even when Buteau pokes fun, "it's never seeking to destroy. It's curious, you know what I mean? She is naturally celebratory."
Buteau's self-confidence is expansive. It must feel good to be you right now, Stephen Colbert told her during a recent appearance on "The Late Show," ticking off her accomplishments. It does, she agreed. "But it always felt good." In her last special, she described her looks as "an achievable Beyoncé for government workers."
Buteau grew up in New Jersey, the only child of a Jamaican mother and a Haitian father. It was a deeply Catholic household -- an uncle is the archbishop of Jamaica -- with large, raucous gatherings, courtesy of her Caribbean extended family in Brooklyn, and an explicit reggae soundtrack. The B-word (or as she now sometimes says, "bish") was always part of her vocabulary, she said.
Still, "I didn't know I was funny," she said. "I just thought I was surviving -- trying not to get beat up in Jersey, or, whatever racist teacher I had, trying to defuse their toxicity."
Her first ambition was to be an entertainment reporter, but a college professor told her, in front of the class, that she was "too fat to be on camera," she recalled. "And I believed him, because Downtown Julie Brown" -- the '80s and '90s MTV V.J. -- "wasn't a size 18." Buteau went into production, becoming a news editor at local TV stations, where colleagues suggested she had the chops for comedy. That surprised her: "I'm like, really? I thought I was just happy. When I started working in the news, I realized how sad people were."
Buteau's stand-up origin story is either depressing or uniquely hopeful: She first got onstage on Sept. 14, 2001, after editing footage about the attacks three days before, and realizing she needed a different path.
Her family was not initially supportive. Talking about penises onstage "after he paid for college in cash?" she said of her father, an international auditor. Her mother, a customs broker, "was really sad." And she didn't want to ask them for money. So she continued to work her midnight production shift, going from comedy clubs to the newsroom, for six years, building up her network of besties along the way.
"I met Michelle at a grimy club in San Francisco that doesn't exist anymore," Wong, the comedian and Emmy-winning actress, said. "I was truly blown away by how funny and original she was. And I knew that if she had traveled all the way to San Francisco to perform at a place where the carpet was riddled with dry semen, she was going to make it."
Besides their comic chemistry, Wong cast Buteau in her rom-com because "she's just a very nurturing person offstage," Wong said. "I just wanted an excuse to spend a lot of time with her."
Over a delightful pasta lunch on the Upper West Side, Buteau riffed on making things happen and loving New York. She once lived nearby, in a building that was like "a Jewish retirement center," she said. "No one thought I lived there; they thought I was, like, a nanny. And then -- I don't know how this rumor got started -- I was Harry Belafonte's niece. I wasn't fighting it. I was like, 'Yes, Esther, that's who I am."'
Her material can be raunchy, but there's also a layer of graciousness to it: If she had her own perfume, she wrote in her book, it would be called "Just Sassy Enough." But she makes a point to showcase lust and relationships, like how her one-night stand with a tourist, Gijs van der Most, turned into marriage. He's a photographer and furniture store owner, and she has mined a lot from their cultural differences, although now she's careful. "I don't want him to always feel like he's content," she said.
In "Survival of the Thickest," her character, a body-positive fashion stylist reeling from a breakup after catching her boyfriend cheating, barely suffers a night alone. The comedy is not in her wallowing, but in her harnessing her inherent sex appeal and ambition, and she meets-cute with a charming Italian man before the end of the season. In "Babes," she has a supportive and adoring husband (Hasan Minhaj) who helps her through the waves of overwhelm.
For Adlon, a creator of the series "Better Things" who made her feature directing debut with "Babes," the idea was to upend in a sneaky way the traditional Hollywood pregnancy and motherhood narratives (ineffectual spouse; postpartum bodies that immediately "bounce back"). "I like to do TED talks inside of a Milky Way bar," she said. "Like, it's delicious going down."
Buteau was instrumental. "She's just a perfect comedy machine," the filmmaker said -- although for this role, Adlon did direct the comedian to do less. "She's like, you're tired -- lean into that; be still," Buteau said. She worked on quieting her grandly expressive face. "You know, in stand-up comedy, you don't want to hear any silence," Buteau said, adding, "Pamela's like, 'Just take your time.' And that's real life."
In her own show, "Full Heart," Buteau hopes to have that breathing space, too, to tell stories "and just live in them," she said. "Playing these bigger theaters has really allowed me to kind of grow into the comedian I've always wanted to be."
It was expensive to book and challenging to fill, but choosing a large, notable venue like Radio City -- where she opened for Jonathan Van Ness, the "Queer Eye" personality, a few years ago -- was meant to be an explicit message, she said, to other generations of performers, especially marginalized ones, that they belong on a big stage, too.
"I'm excited," she said. "I mean, I want to take a poop every time I think about it. It keeps me regular, in more ways than one."

'Furiosa' Fails to Reach Box Office Expectations: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Memorial Day weekend ticket sales in North America are expected to total $ 125 million, down 40 percent from last year.
Hollywood expected "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga" to scorch the box office over the holiday weekend. Instead, the big-budget Warner Bros. prequel iced it over.
"Furiosa," which cost $ 168 million to make, not including tens of millions of dollars in marketing costs, collected an estimated $ 25.6 million in the United States and Canada from Thursday night to Sunday. Box office analysts expected the film to take in about $ 5.4 million on Monday, for a holiday-weekend total of $ 31 million.
That would be the worst Memorial Day weekend result in 43 years after adjusting for inflation -- ever since "Bustin' Loose," a comedic drama starring Richard Pryor, collected $ 24 million in 1981. (Box office records exclude 2020, when most theaters were closed because of the coronavirus pandemic.)
The franchise's previous chapter, "Mad Max: Fury Road," took in $ 45.4 million in 2015, or roughly $ 61 million in today's dollars -- and that was without the benefit of a holiday weekend.
Hollywood had high expectations for "Furiosa," which Warner Bros. premiered at the Cannes Film Festival; the movie received exceptional reviews. On Sunday, however, it was unclear whether "Furiosa" would manage even first place at the box office. Analysts said the poorly reviewed "Garfield" (Sony), which cost $ 60 million to make, could inch ahead. It could also be a tie.
Sony declared victory, saying it expected "Garfield," produced and financed by Alcon Entertainment, to be No. 1, with $ 31.8 million in ticket sales. "With summer holidays beginning this week, the film is well-positioned for a long theatrical run," Sony said, adding that it had successfully "relaunched" the lasagna-loving character as a movie franchise.
Why did fewer moviegoers turn out for "Furiosa" than expected? Warner Bros. declined to comment, but the film capital was rife with theories. One involved Anya Taylor-Joy, who played the title role in "Furiosa."
The 28-year-old actress has been ascending for nearly a decade, gaining attention in 2015 for "The Witch," an art house horror movie, and winning awards in 2020 for playing a troubled chess prodigy in "The Queen's Gambit," a Netflix mini-series. But she had never anchored a big-budget summer movie before.
Increasing the pressure, Ms. Taylor-Joy took over the role of Furiosa from the Oscar-winning Charlize Theron, now 48, who helped turn "Mad Max: Fury Road" into a hit in 2015.
"Moviegoers do not want prequel origin stories," where significant franchise characters are "portrayed not by the actor who originated and defined them, but by a younger, less-famous performer," Scott Mendelson, a box office analyst who publishes a subscription newsletter, wrote on Saturday.
"Furiosa," directed by George Miller and co-starring Chris Hemsworth, may have been released too soon after the similar-looking "Dune: Part Two," which delivered giant ticket sales in March, some film executives said. At the same time, they added, "Furiosa" may have been released too long after "Fury Road," allowing the "Mad Max" fan base to cool.
There has also been a lack of momentum at the box office, noted Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore media analyst. Hollywood's summer season started with "The Fall Guy," which arrived to $ 28 million in ticket sales earlier this month -- the lowest summer kickoff since 1995. The April box office suffered from a shortage of movies, which studios blamed on lingering fallout from union strikes in 2023.
"The current malaise shows the importance of the health of the overall marketplace in the months leading up to this all-important moviegoing season," Mr. Dergarabedian said in an email.
Theaters in the United States and Canada were expected to sell about $ 125 million in tickets over the weekend, down roughly 40 percent from last year, according to Comscore. For the year to date, ticket sales in the two countries total $ 2.6 billion, down 22 percent from the same period a year ago, Comscore said.
Mr. Dergarabedian is an optimist, however.
"It's not game over for theaters this summer as many have asserted," he said, noting that sequels like "Inside Out 2," "Despicable Me 4" and "Deadpool & Wolverine" could arrive as major hits in June and July. If those films deliver, he said, Hollywood can salvage "the perception of the movie theater business as a viable and relevant part of the entertainment ecosystem."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The actress Maria Bello and the Michelin-starred chef Dominique Crenn said they owe their journey to the "three C's": cancer, Covid and, now, commitment.
Dominique Isabel Pascale Crenn receives countless DMs on Instagram from people trying to get a table at her San Francisco restaurant, Atelier Crenn. She doesn't usually respond.
But when Maria Elaina Bello sent her a DM in April 2018, the message resonated with her.
Lorraine Silvera, a friend of Ms. Bello's and a fellow food lover, had seen Ms. Crenn on the Netflix documentary series "Chef's Table." Ms. Silvera and Ms. Bello were flying to San Francisco from Los Angeles for dinner at Atelier Crenn, but reservations were fully booked.
Ms. Bello, 57, sent a message to Ms. Crenn, 59, on Instagram: "My friend Lolo who started the first Italian restaurant in Cap-Haïtien, Haiti, is coming to visit next week and wants nothing more than to eat your divine food. We will fly from L.A. Thursday if it's possible to get into the restaurant."
As it happened, Ms. Crenn had been to Haiti the year before with her friend Michelle Jean, who is Haitian, to help farmers who had been affected by Hurricane Matthew, which devastated the country in October 2016. Their efforts to rebuild infrastructure included planting trees for coffee and cacao farmers. Ms. Crenn felt compelled to respond to Ms. Bello, and she made space at the restaurant for her and her friend.
"It was the most amazing food I ever had," Ms. Bello said. "She was so kind, we knew that night we'd be friends forever. But I wasn't in a dating place. She wasn't in a dating place."
Ms. Crenn said she immediately felt safe around Ms. Bello, and that Ms. Bello gave her a hug that made her feel at peace. "Especially in my industry sometimes, so many people come to the restaurant and everybody wants to be your friend," Ms. Crenn said.
Ms. Crenn, who was born in Versailles, France, is a celebrated chef and the first woman in the United States to receive three stars from the Michelin Guide, its highest rating, for Atelier Crenn.
Ms. Bello is not unfamiliar with celebrity culture. She is an actress who most recently appeared on the Netflix series "Beef," for which she received an Emmy nomination for best supporting actress in a limited series. Ms. Bello won the 2024 Critics Choice Award for the role.
After they met, for two nights in a row, Ms. Bello was featured in Ms. Crenn's dreams as her "protector" from people who were trying to take advantage of her. "I was like, 'Whoa, what's happening?"' Ms. Crenn said.
They kept in touch and messaged here and there. In October 2018, six months after their first visit, Ms. Bello returned to the restaurant with the same friend, Ms. Silvera. On a whim, they joined Ms. Crenn to travel to a food and wine festival in Valle de Guadalupe, Mexico, the next day.
"It was just a spur of the moment adventure, and it was really fun," Ms. Bello said. During the trip, they cooked, picked flowers, set tables and ate together.
"We really admired each other," Ms. Crenn said. They realized that their friendship could be something more in March 2019, when Ms. Crenn visited Los Angeles for a photo shoot. They both agreed they had feelings for each other, but that they would take the time to figure out what a relationship "would look like," Ms. Bello said.
Ms. Crenn traveled to New York shortly afterward to celebrate her birthday on April 7. The day before, when she stepped out of the shower, she found a lump on her breast.
"At that moment, I was just like, 'It's not going to be good,"' Ms. Crenn said. "I felt it."
After her birthday, she visited her doctor, who, upon performing a biopsy, told her she had the "c word," Ms. Crenn said -- that it was triple-negative breast cancer at stage 2, almost at stage 3.
She and Ms. Bello met in San Francisco, and she told her about the cancer. "Falling in love with someone -- you don't want to put that on them," Ms. Crenn said.
But Ms. Bello's response was: "Let's do cancer." It was her way of making the relationship official.
"It was sort of that simple," Ms. Bello said. "My mother had cancer since I was a kid. I had a job where I could travel and I felt like I'm a caretaker in a lot of ways. And I just felt like this was too special to walk away from."

Ms. Bello flew back and forth between San Francisco and Los Angeles, where she was filming at the time for a main role on the TV drama "NCIS," to take care of Ms. Crenn.
"This woman danced through cancer," Ms. Bello said. "It's like she hears music in her brain all of the time and can't help moving with joy."
"I think I cried more through it than she did," Ms. Bello added. "And that was for about nine months -- nine really painful months." Those nine months involved 16 sessions of chemotherapy, eight blood transfusions and a double mastectomy.
"I always say our honeymoon phase was cancer," Ms. Bello said. "I feel like I kept her up in so many ways. Falling in love is a really exciting thing, and it's good for your body and your soul."
At the end of Ms. Crenn's last treatment, she was feeling particularly ill. She called Ms. Bello, who flew to San Francisco the next morning.
"Somehow I woke up and I thought that was the end for me because I saw death," Ms. Crenn said. "It was very weird. I kind of passed out, and she walked in."
Ms. Bello took her to the hospital and slept next to her that night in a bed by the window. They were still able to joke and laugh, despite the difficulty of the situation.
"It was all about positivity and love," Ms. Crenn said.
In December 2019, Ms. Bello purchased a home in Los Angeles. The two also rent an apartment together in Île Saint-Louis, Paris. Ms. Crenn, who has two other restaurants and bars in San Francisco -- Bar Crenn and Petit Crenn -- has a home in Sausalito, just north of the city. The couple live between those three homes.
Ms. Bello grew up in Norristown, Pa., and graduated from Villanova University with a bachelor's degree in political science. She has one son, Jackson, who is 23, from a previous relationship.
Ms. Crenn graduated from Cours Charlemagne in Paris with a bachelor's degree in economics. She has 10-year-old twin daughters, Charlotte and Olivia.
In December 2019, the couple went to Pavillon Ledoyen, a three-Michelin-starred restaurant by Yannick Alléno in Paris. Mr. Alléno, a friend of Ms. Crenn's, arranged a private room for the couple. They had dinner, and Ms. Crenn proposed. Then Ms. Bello proposed.
"It was magical," Ms. Bello said. "We danced in this little room, and then we spent that week just walking around Paris. It was cold and snowy a little bit. It was just a romantic time."
That February, they went out together as a couple for the first time at the annual Vanity Fair Oscars Party. "We said, let's go out and be social and be seen," Ms. Bello said.
And then the pandemic struck, but they kept moving forward. They had a group of friends they spent time with in Los Angeles. They cooked a lot, drove back and forth from San Francisco to Los Angeles and made videos singing to songs by Whitney Houston, Ms. Crenn's favorite artist.
The couple were legally wed in the backyard of their Los Angeles home on April 7. Seano McFarland, a close friend who was previously ordained by the Universal Life Church, officiated. The women's three children were the only guests present.
On May 12 -- Mother's Day -- they had their wedding celebration in front of 140 guests at Montage Los Cabos in Baja California, Mexico.
Their children played an integral role in the celebration. Ms. Bello's son walked her down the aisle to "Time Flies" by Burna Boy, her favorite artist. Ms. Crenn's daughters and Peggy Keon, the mother of her former partner, walked down the aisle with her to the song "Kiss" by Prince. ("They said yes to Maria," Ms. Crenn said. "They said, 'Yeah, you can marry her.' They're obsessed with her.")
During the celebration, the couple sat onstage with Mr. McFarland, who conducted an interview with them so the guests could learn their love story. The ceremony revolved around what they call "the 3 C's": their journey through cancer, Covid, and, now, commitment.
After the ceremony, the couple left the stage dancing to the song "I Wanna Dance with Somebody" by Whitney Houston with the crowd cheering.
"Listen, I've been in so many relationships in my life with men and women -- very passionate affairs," Ms. Bello said. "I just never thought I'd get married. When I met Dom and started to fall in love with her, I realized that it was so much deeper and I was definitely in a place in my life being in the second half of life, being older. It was a very mature love in a lot of ways, but we also played a lot together."
"How cool is that? To know that until the end," Ms. Crenn added, "I can hold somebody else's hand and they can smile at me, and they got me."

A Culinary Experience The wedding fittingly treated guests to a top-notch food experience. Guests were greeted with a seafood bar serving tuna tostadas and oysters, along with passed hors d'oeuvres. After the ceremony, they indulged in a family-style dinner with a menu curated by the chef Xavier Salomon.
Dior and Denim The couple were dressed by Dior for their ceremony looks: Ms. Bello in a fuchsia blouse and skirt and Ms. Crenn in a custom white vest and pants. During the dinner, they changed into jeans -- partway through dancing, and after enough tequila, Ms. Crenn said, jokingly.
A Tribute to the Mothers Ms. Bello's son delivered an emotional speech about the significance of the wedding taking place on Mother's Day. He paid homage to his grandmother, Kathleen Bello, who was in attendance. He shouted out his stepmother, Jill Cooper, who is married to his father and Ms. Bello's former partner, Dan McDermott, who was also in attendance, and ended the speech pronouncing his new, fourth mother, Ms. Crenn. He celebrated his "modern family" -- a reference to Ms. Bello's Modern Love piece in 2013 titled "Coming Out as a Modern Family."

Full text: I've been a reporter at the Paris bureau of The New York Times for nearly a decade, covering French society, politics and more. Much of my cultural intake is dictated by what I can squeeze in between work and caring for two (soon to be three) adorable young daughters, with a preference for whatever takes my mind off the news. Here are five things that I've been enjoying recently.
Caesar III
My Roman Empire. One of Sierra's classic city builders, with isometric and slightly pixelated graphics that are firmly rooted in 1998, when the game was released. But being the provincial governor of Lugdunum, Lutetia or Carthage is as addictive as ever as you fend off military invasions, carefully manage your industry and cater to Caesar's whims.
Moi et François Mitterrand (François Mitterrand and I)
Hervé Le Tellier released this delightfully absurd epistolary novel in French in 2016. A man writes repeatedly to France's president, receives the same pro forma reply each time, but interprets each letter as a personally crafted response -- sending him into a hilarious spiral of delusion over a nonexistent friendship.
Class Act
This seven-episode Netflix biopic chronicles the rise and fall of Bernard Tapie, the swaggering businessman, singer, sports impresario and government minister who "lurched throughout his life from wild success to humiliation, knowing everything from high political office to the prison cell," as my colleague Roger Cohen wrote in a 2021 obituary.
Deeper Well
"Do we have any say in this mess?" Kacey Musgraves asks on "The Architect," one of the songs from her new album. I ponder those words as my 3-year-old draws on her hands, glues erasers to a chair and slaps dozens of multicolored stickers onto the floor.
Critical Role
Tabletop role-playing shows are increasingly popular, but few are as successful as this one, in which veteran voice actors play Dungeons & Dragons. It's hard to explain a yearslong obsession over people rolling dice for four hours. But the emotions are real -- just ask the crowds that filled London's Wembley Arena to see a live show.

Gladiators Compete For Sales and Fame: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: On the reality TV show, a motley crew of camera-ready real estate agents navigates the cutthroat market of multimillion dollar houses.
Like the Hamptons itself, where white-sand beaches and white-glove service await those with enough equity each summer, the reality TV show "Selling the Hamptons" is an escape and an indulgence. Now in its second season on Max, the streaming service formerly known as HBO Max, the show follows the cast in the storied vacationland of moneyed New Yorkers.
The show's stars are a motley crew of ambitious, good-looking real estate agents who all work for the luxury brokerage Nest Seekers International: the bad-boy pro surfer who has anointed himself the "Prince of Montauk," an aspiring pop princess whose favorite topic of conversation is her wealthy developer father, an agent known as "Deals in Heels," an entrepreneur with $ 10 billion in her portfolio and, of course, two former models.
They are all in a cutthroat competition for a razor-thin inventory of houses for sale in the resort towns of Long Island, and they always seem to be popping up, in stilettos or suit jackets, at each other's listings. It's not only about the drama; it's their livelihood, some members of the cast said.
"My goal is to make as much money as I can," said Mia Calabrese, 32, a model-turned-luxury agent who grew up on the South Side of Chicago. She got her real estate license in 2019 and joined the show for its first season just two years later.
"I'm not just doing this to be on television. I'm doing it to grow my business," Ms. Calabrese said.
How It Started
Three members of the show got their start on Netflix's "Million Dollar Beach House": Peggy Zabakolas, owner of both a broker's license and a law degree; Michael Fulfree, a former Milan runway model turned doting dad; and J.B. Andreassi, who declined to be interviewed for this story. Ms. Zabakolas, 37, said she understands the risk and reward of being on reality TV. "People are going to love you and people are going to hate you," she said. "Being in sales, you spin it to your advantage."
Ms. Zabakolas, the self-anointed "Dealsinheels" who is so enamored of her title that she bought the trademark, doesn't shy away from drama. She sparred with Mr. Andreassi over a $ 20 million listing. She accused new agent Ashley Allen of trash-talking her behind her back. These sparks, Ms. Zabakolas said, are reality TV's raison d'être.
"People tune in to watch drama," she said, adding that off camera, she rarely gets into conflicts with people. "If people tuned in to my real life, they would have a snooze fest."
Being on the show, Ms. Zabakolas said, has given her a well-shod leg up in a market where the average sale price of a home is more than $ 3 million and inventory all but disappears after the close of summer. "Some people invest in billboards or postcards. But I have a TV show," she said. "It's another marketing tool in my portfolio."
On the Monday afternoon when The New York Times interviewed some of the cast members, Mr. Fulfree, the show's resident nice guy who nevertheless has an affinity for profanity, was rushing to visit a new, all-glass eight-bedroom oceanfront home in Bridgehampton. He had to coach his son Luca's T-ball game at 5 p.m., and was anxiously checking the time.
The home has a floating staircase, 8,600 square feet of living space and a putting green on the rooftop. It's an open listing -- any agent who wants to can try and bring in a buyer -- and the builder, Joe Farrell, is hoping it goes for $ 80 million. Mr. Fulfree, 35, believes he can be the one to close the deal.
"You can like me or not," Mr. Fulfree said, but he makes the people who work with him a great deal of money, he said, using a more colorful term that rhymes with truckload.
Brokerage or Talent Agency?
The drama may be turned up, but the show isn't scripted, said Bianca D'Alessio, 31, who runs her own team of agents and is a managing director at Nest Seekers.
"Everything that I put onscreen is who I am as a person," she said in an interview.
The agents' lifestyles are gladiatorial, and no pair have as much conflict as Mr. Fulfree and Dylan Eckhardt, a notorious Hamptons party boy and native son who years ago made a name for himself on the professional surfing circuit. In Season 2, he appears to have been plucked from central casting because Nest Seekers was seeking a villain, and in one scene he and Mr. Fulfree nearly come to blows.
Mr. Eckhardt, who declined to be interviewed, has a personal tagline: "Whatever I touch turns to sold." Eddie Shapiro, the president of Nest Seekers, said the show's sudsy drama is all part of the plan. "We consider ourselves a talent agency and a casting agency as much as we are a brokerage," he said.
Occasionally, the company's wealthy buyers are turned off by the prospect of cameras and histrionics, he said. But not often.
"Sometimes, they will say, 'My property is my most important asset, and I saw your show and the only thing I saw was a silly 10-minute back and forth of some people fighting on the beach,"' he said. "That can happen."
On the other hand, he said, "People don't list with us just because we're on TV. But they will certainly give us a shot over a brand that may not have any exposure at all." Max declined to disclose ratings information for the show. After Netflix's "Million Dollar Beach House," lasted a single season, its production team moved on to "Selling the Hamptons," which earned a second season, gaining cast members in the process. Max has now invested in another similar show, "Serving the Hamptons," which follows a crew of servers and bartenders at a stylish Hamptons restaurant.
Ms. Allen, a new agent who joined the cast in Season 2 and regularly appears alongside her father, the real estate developer Jeff Allen, said she is enjoying the spotlight.
Mr. Allen was a longtime music agent before crossing over into real estate, and Ms. Allen, 35, flirted with a singing career in her 20s, and now speaks excitedly of releasing a single this month. Real estate is just a side gig for her, she said, but the exposure of "Selling the Hamptons" is a boon.
"As my godfather James Brown would always say to my dad and to me, 'Any press is good press,"' she said. "So if they're talking about you, you must be doing something right."

Real-Life Movies Starring Some Imaginary Friends: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Author: Piepenburg, Erik

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Multiple films this year, including the new family comedy "IF," explore the concept of imaginary friends on the big screen.
In the new family comedy "IF," Ryan Reynolds plays a frazzled matchmaker who, with help from a young girl (Cailey Fleming), unites humans with imaginary friends.
John Krasinski, who wrote and directed the film, said the idea took shape as he watched his daughters' lights dim during the pandemic.
"They were playing fewer and fewer imaginary games and I could see they were letting the fears of the real world in and I thought, this is the definition of growing up," he explained in an email.
He said he decided to make the movie, now in theaters, to show his kids that the "magical world they've created, that place of such joy and hope and magic, exists. And you can always go back."
Krasinski isn't alone in bringing imaginary friendships to life this year. "IF" is one of five new movies that explore imaginary friends, in a variety of genres: supernatural horror ("Imaginary"), adult comedy ("Ricky Stanicky"), children's animated fantasy ("The Imaginary") and documentary ("My Secret Country").
Why the convergence? Marjorie Taylor, professor emerita of psychology at the University of Oregon and an expert on imaginary friends, wasn't sure. But she said she wasn't surprised, considering that pretend friends, as she calls them, have long been artistic catnip.
"Imaginary friends are fascinating for people who write fiction because they are great vehicles for storytelling" about feelings and fears, said Taylor, whose book "Imaginary Friends and the People Who Create Them," coauthored in a new expanded edition with Naomi R. Aguiar, comes out this fall.
Imaginary friends can be purely for entertainment, but they can also mirror difficult emotions and stages in a child's life. If a family member is sick, a child's imaginary friend may get sick too, a way to help navigate sadness and uncertainty. An imaginary friend can be a child or an adult, an animal or a fanciful creature or, as in the popular comic strip "Calvin and Hobbes," a stuffed animal.
Research by Taylor and colleagues showed that as many as 65 percent of children have interacted with personified objects or invisible friends by the time they are 7. Some pretend friends are retained much longer.
Imaginary friends are considered ageless in both "IF" and "The Imaginary," directed by Yoshiyuki Momose and coming to Netflix on July 5. Both films give imaginary friends their own points of view, and both feature young girls as protagonists. Both also focus on how memories of imaginary friends -- or "imaginaries," as they're called in "The Imaginary" -- are what keep them alive as people age and become less needful of created worlds.
Yoshiaki Nishimura, the producer of "The Imaginary," put it this way in an email: "Imaginary friends are not the only beings that we trust and love very much as children, but forget as adults. I don't remember the faces or names of my kindergarten and elementary school teachers, but they certainly helped me, supported and guided me, and are a part of my life."
Imaginary friends have long fueled the horror genre, where unseen beings possess bodies and minds to all kinds of evil ends, a manifestation of and metaphor for mental illness. "Imaginary," now on demand, uses the horror convention of a possessed toy -- in this case a teddy bear named Chauncey -- to explore the dark side of imaginary friendships.
Jeff Wadlow, who directed the film, said what's sinister about a cuddly doll who does bad things is that it's uniquely macabre but also tenderly familiar.
Chauncey "had a Paddington look to him but at the same time he's unsettling," he said. "His eyes and ears create an unease. But people love him."
Not all horror movie imaginary friends are pretend, though: In "Psycho," Norman Bates had an imaginary friend, and she turned a shower into a blood bath.
Adults don't have to be mentally unstable to have imaginary friends. Taylor said the author Agatha Christie and the choreographer Paul Taylor have talked about having unseen companions who were a source of support and inspiration throughout their lives. Then again, imaginary friends can be socially devitalizing; many Americans have imaginary beliefs about who the president is, or what vaccines do to bodies.
In "Ricky Stanicky" (streaming on Amazon Prime Video), the imaginary friend is a grown man made up by three friends -- played by Zac Efron, Andrew Santino and Jermaine Fowler -- who pretend to call on him as cover when they want to lie about their whereabouts. When one of their duplicitous plans starts to crack, they hire an actor (John Cena) to make Ricky real.
Peter Farrelly, the film's director and one of six people credited with the screenplay, said his comedy is rooted in very adult concerns about what happens "when your lies come alive."
"You create this lie where you cover all the time and this person protects you, like, this guy bought the beer or this guy bought the weed, and you get out of trouble," said Farrelly, the director of the Oscar-winning "Green Book." If you're getting good things from lying, he said, "it's hard to stop. But one day you have to say, I am a liar. It's part of growing up: telling the truth."
Are we in an imaginary friend golden age? Marlo McKenzie, the director of "My Secret Country" -- in which animation makes real children's imaginary friends come to life -- sure hopes so. McKenzie said her film, which debuts on June 2 at the San Francisco Documentary Film Festival, was born in part by having worked at a homeless youth shelter where many children with backgrounds of abuse "weren't able to imagine a world where they were loved."
"Imagination," she said, "is way more important than we realize."
Krasinski also finds this to be true. If it wasn't for Sam Brace, his childhood imaginary friend, "IF" may never have been made.
"We had a video store about a half mile away from our house," he wrote. "Sam and I would walk to pick out a movie and along the way live through those movies. I have often wondered if it was actually Sam who directed this movie."

On 'Bridgerton,' A Larger Role Means a Makeover: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: The stars of the Shondaland series, streaming on Netflix, are given very different looks when they're promoted from the supporting cast -- a phenomenon fans have dubbed "the Bridgerton glow-up."
When the actress Nicola Coughlan joined the cast of Shondaland's period costume drama "Bridgerton," as the young socialite and secret gossip pamphleteer Penelope Featherington, the hair and makeup artist Marc Pilcher informed her that the creative brief they had for her character was only one word: "dowdy."
Penelope, the demure youngest daughter of the domineering matriarch Lady Portia Featherington, was to be done up in garish pastel dresses and gaudy jewelry, with a hairdo clogged with curls -- none of it particularly flattering. "For the first two seasons, the objective, in the nicest way, was not meant to make me look nice," Coughlan said in a recent interview. "A lot of the Featherington aesthetic was a 'more is more' approach."
A supporting player through the show's first two seasons, Penelope is the main character of Season 3, which begins streaming May 16 on Netflix. And as she has moved into the spotlight, her entire style has been altered: a transformation that fans of the show refer to as the "Bridgerton glow-up."
Gone are the canary-yellow gowns and tacky headpieces. She's now wearing milder colors and less ostentatious jewelry, and her hairstyles are looser and more elegant. In short, she is no longer dowdy. "At the first fitting for Season 3, I got teary-eyed," Coughlan said. "It felt like a 'Pretty Woman' moment. They were finally going to let me shine."
This kind of stylistic reinvention has become common practice on a series known for rotating actors in and out of its sweeping ensemble, and adapting their appearances accordingly. "When the transition is made from side character to leading character, we think a lot about what story it is we're trying to tell," the showrunner and executive producer Jess Brownell explained. When it comes to styling, she said, "it's a lot more heady when it comes to the main characters."
The phenomenon was first apparent when Anthony (Jonathan Bailey), the eldest son of the Bridgerton family, became one of the main characters of the show during its second season after a stint on the sidelines in Season 1. He effectively replaced Simon Basset (Regé-Jean Page), who was the first season's primary love interest and de facto leading man. Anthony's transition to the lead featured one especially drastic revision: the removal of his large sideburns. Though they were appropriate for an overbearing eldest brother, Brownell said, "once we got into his love story, it was like, 'You gotta go."' To fans, this change represented more than just a glow-up: It was a full-blown metamorphosis. "The sorcery that [Shonda Rhimes] is doing on these 'Bridgerton' men, it needs to be investigated," declared one TikTok creator, in a video that has been viewed more than 16 million times.
For Penelope, the transformation starts with her makeup, which has been radically enhanced. "In Season 1, she's supposed to be the wallflower that literally falls into the wall: You can't see her," said Erika Ökvist, the show's lead hair and makeup designer. "Season 2, she's trying to become a woman, so we're using quite round shapes, accentuating the roundness of her eyes." Season 3 finds Penelope in a heated romance with Colin, the Bridgerton son played by Luke Newton, a pursuit that informed her look: "To make her eyes more siren-like, as it were, we're using more angular lines -- her eyes look more almond, less round and innocent."
Colin himself, in his shift from peripheral character to leading man, has also adopted a new look. Earlier seasons found him plucky and boyish, styled in jaunty pastels that Brownell said "signified his youth." Season 3 Colin, who has traveled abroad and "come back a new man," has a darker palette reflecting a new worldliness. "I think the internet has dubbed him Pirate Colin, which isn't too far from what we intended," Brownell said.
Notably, the "Bridgerton" glow-ups do not involve the kinds of bodily overhauls -- packing on muscle or slimming down -- that are often associated with Hollywood transformations; in fact, the showrunners cut a plotline from the novel "Romancing Mister Bridgerton," which is the basis for Season 3, that involved Penelope losing weight. "We think that Penelope is beautiful, and I don't think it's really a part of her story," Brownell told Variety.
John Glaser, the show's costume designer, said that when a character moves into the spotlight, the wardrobe department takes a pared-down approach. "When Penelope became the leading lady, we just pulled back," he said. "We took all of her best attributes and focused on them."
Playing to Coughlan's best features meant simplifying her silhouette -- even if the changes were not all quite period-appropriate. "This period does not give women a waistline, and we gave her a waistline," Glaser said, citing the film noir star Lauren Bacall as a reference. "We made her more like a little '50s Dior style."
Brownell emphasized that the character dictates the wardrobe, not the other way around: Penelope's new look reflects her growth as a person, not simply that she needs a makeover because she's moved up to top billing. "She's this character who has been on the sidelines for so long and, appearance-wise, she's really just done what her mother wanted her to," she said. "So she was wearing citrus colors, which are very much Portia Featherington's favorite palette, and she's wearing these tight little poodle curls, which is also a Featherington special." Coming into Season 3, Brownell said, her look "is really about separating herself from her mother and her family."
Penelope's new aesthetic has been greeted rapturously by fans. "Finally they got my girl in some blue and a dress that actually fits she looks so beautiful," one said in an Instagram comment, which has been liked more than 3,000 times. Another put it more bluntly: "Oh thank god she's not wearing yellow."
Coughlan said she wasn't personally bothered by Penelope's tawdry pre-glow-up style. But she admitted that dressing for Season 3 was a welcome change. "It felt soft and romantic and beautiful," she said. "It was honestly magical."

Frank Shrontz, 92, Dies; Led Boeing During a Decade of Spectacular Growth: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Known for his leadership and his commitment to company culture, he left as chief executive in 1996, opening the door to a corporate makeover.
Frank Shrontz, a widely admired executive who led Boeing in the 1980s and '90s, a decade of spectacular growth in both its bottom line and its prestige as one of the world's premier aerospace companies -- a period very different from its current crisis of public confidence -- died on May 3 at an assisted living home in Seattle. He was 92.
His son Craig confirmed the death.
Although he spent the bulk of his career at Boeing, Mr. Shrontz, who had a law degree and an M.B.A., was an unlikely choice to lead a company that prided itself on letting engineers and not businessmen set the pace.
Yet during his time at the helm -- he became president in 1985, chief executive in 1986 and chairman of the board in 1988 -- he led Boeing through a growth market, a recession and a thorough restructuring that produced one of the most successful commercial aircraft ever put into service, the 777.
Mr. Shrontz was known as a calm hand at the company tiller, with an everymanager's feeling for the rank and file. He walked the floors at the factories around Boeing's headquarters in Seattle, and he regularly met with groups of employees to hear their views and gather ideas.
"Frank Shrontz is who I think about when people ask me who the Boeing C.E.O. needs to be," Richard Aboulafia, the managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, said in a phone interview.
His tenure started on a high note in the late 1980s, a boom time in commercial aircraft sales. But then came a pair of challenges: the recession of 1990 and 1991 and the end of the Cold War, which punched a hole in Boeing's defense business.
Mr. Shrontz saw the downturn as an opportunity. Among other initiatives, he pushed Boeing into the space industry, landing a contract to build parts of the International Space Station. He also created teams drawn from different parts of the company -- engineers, designers and manufacturing specialists -- to develop and build aircraft, while investing heavily in what was then a novel technology: computer-assisted design.
The first major result of Mr. Shrontz's restructuring was the 777. Designed from the ground up, it went from conception to production in just five years, astounding the industry. And it cost just $ 4 billion to develop, a figure dwarfed by the hundreds of billions the company has earned from it.
Yet he insisted that success had not gone to his head, or to Boeing's.
"I don't think any private company can consider itself to be bulletproof," he told The Los Angeles Times in 1991. "I think as soon as you start getting complacent in that regard, you're heading for serious problems. We run scared, and we think that's the way it should be."
Frank Anderson Shrontz was born on Dec. 14, 1931, in Boise, Idaho, the son of Thurlyn and Florence (Anderson) Shrontz. His father owned the only licensed Schwinn bicycle retailer in the city.
He studied law at the University of Idaho, graduating in 1954 and, after spending two years in the Army, enrolled in Harvard Business School. He received his M.B.A. in 1958, the same year he joined Boeing.
He married Harriet Ann Houghton in 1954. She died in 2012. Along with his son Craig, he is survived by another son, David, and two grandchildren. A third son, Richard, died in 2017.
Mr. Shrontz left Boeing in 1973 to join the Department of Defense, where he served as an assistant secretary of the Air Force and then as an assistant secretary of defense. He returned to Boeing in 1977, at which point he was singled out as a potential top executive.
He was assigned to run three of the company's busiest programs, overseeing the 707, 727 and 737 jetliners. While many people in the company were focused on the glamorous 747, Boeing's massive intercontinental jetliner, he invested heavily in the 737, a smaller workhorse of a plane -- and his bet paid off, as domestic travel grew in the early 1980s, both in the United States and in foreign markets.
Mr. Shrontz stepped down as chief executive and president in 1996, and as chairman a year later. His departure coincided with another internal revolution at Boeing: In 1997 the company bought one of its major rivals, McDonnell Douglas, and in 2001 it moved its headquarters to Chicago from Seattle. (It is now based in Northern Virginia.)
The company had long relied on internal hires to occupy its upper ranks, but the influx of McDonnell Douglas executives changed everything. A new emphasis on profits and cost-cutting led to decades of underinvestment in safety and engineering, a change documented in the 2022 Netflix documentary "Downfall: The Case Against Boeing." The result, critics say, is a company very different from the one Mr. Shrontz ran.
In recent years Boeing has suffered a series of accidents and disasters. Within six months in 2018 and 2019, two Boeing 737 Max airliners crashed, one in Indonesia and the other in Ethiopia, killing 346 people.
Both crashes were traced to misfiring anti-stall sensors. A 2020 investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives found that the company had dismissed employee concerns about the sensors, and in 2021 Boeing agreed to pay $ 2.5 billion to settle fraud charges.
More accidents followed, including an incident in January in which a door plug on an Alaskan Airlines 737 Max blew out. (No one was seriously injured.) On May 14 the Department of Justice found that the company had violated the terms of the 2021 settlement.
Earlier this year Boeing's chief executive, Dave Calhoun, and Larry Kellner, the chairman of the board, announced that they would step down.
Since his retirement, Mr. Shrontz had rarely spoken directly about the decline of his old company's reputation. But his views were not hard to parse from interviews.
"There was a lot of pride among the people," he said of Boeing in an interview with The Puget Sound Business Journal in 2015. "It was kind of a family feeling, a feeling you don't find at modern companies where people are much more likely to hire in, stay for a few years and move on."

Full text: Glen Powell stars in one of the year's funniest, sexiest, most enjoyable movies -- and somehow it's surprisingly deep, too.
If I see a movie more delightful than "Hit Man" this year, I'll be surprised. It's the kind of romp people are talking about when they say that "they don't make them like they used to": It's romantic, sexy, hilarious, satisfying and a genuine star-clinching turn for Glen Powell, who's been having a moment for about two years now. It's got the cheeky verve of a 1940s screwball rom-com in a thoroughly contemporary (and slightly racier) package. I've seen it twice, and a huge grin plastered itself across my face both times.
That's why it's a shame most people will see it at home -- Netflix is barely giving it a theatrical release before it hits streaming even though it's the sort of movie that begs for the experience of collective gut-splitting joy. Oh well. If you can see it in a theater, it's worth it. If not, then get your friends together, pop some popcorn and settle in for a good old-fashioned movie for grown-ups.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The director Richard Linklater and Powell collaborated on the "Hit Man" script, which is loosely based on Skip Hollandsworth's 2001 Texas Monthly article about Gary Johnson, a faux hit man who actually worked for the Houston Police Department. In the movie version, Gary (Powell) is a mild-mannered philosophy professor in New Orleans with a part-time side gig doing tech work for law enforcement. One day, he is accidentally pulled into pretending to be a hit man in a sting operation, and soon realizes he loves playing the role.
Or roles, really: The more Gary gets into it, the more he realizes that each person's fantasy of a hit man is different, and he starts to dress up, preparing for the part before he meets with the client. (If this movie were solely constructed as a de facto reel demonstrating Powell's range, it would work just fine.) Then, one day, pretending to be a sexy, confident hit man named Ron, he meets Madison (Adria Arjona, practically glowing from within), a put-upon housewife seeking his services. And everything changes for Gary.
A great deal of the enjoyment of "Hit Man" comes from simply witnessing Powell and Arjona's white-hot chemistry. Seeing Powell transmogrify from nerdy Gary to five o'clock shadow Ron and back again is both hilarious and tantalizing, while Arjona has a big-eyed innocence crossed with wily smarts that keeps everyone, including Gary, guessing. Multiple layers of deception keep the movie from feeling formulaic -- you're always trying to keep track of who thinks what, and why. Eventually, when "Hit Man" morphs into a kind of caper comedy, part of the joy is rooting for characters as they make choices that are, at best, flexibly ethical. In doing so, we get to be naughty too. In a movie starring a philosophy professor, that's especially funny, a wry joke on us all.
But there's more surprising philosophical depth in "Hit Man" than meets the eye. While on the surface it's more or less a romantic comedy, beneath the hood it's a coming-of-age story for Gary, whose life has stagnated. After a divorce, he lives alone with his two cats named Id and Ego and a large collection of plants; his students make fun of him for driving a Honda Civic, and he eats cereal for dinner. Gary is perfectly content with his life, or at least he thinks he is. But it slowly becomes clear the simplicity is less choice and more comfort zone. He's lost himself somewhere along the way. He's ruled out the possibility of surprise and adventure. Being a fake hit man gives him the possibility of inhabiting other selves, other lives -- of trying on identities for size.
The question of the self -- where it resides, whether we're stagnant or able to change -- has long been a fixation for philosophers, and Gary is no different. He declares his "primary interest" to be "the eternal mystery of human consciousness and behavior." At the start of the semester, he tells his students that they'll be challenging the notion of the self that semester, from social identity to close relationships. "What if your 'self' is a construction, an illusion, an act, a role you've been playing every day since you can remember?" he asks them, smiling. Teacher, teach thyself.
That inquiry is woven throughout "Hit Man," which takes a definite point of view on the subject. Yes, the self is changeable -- but it takes a bit of bravery to discover who you want to be. What's more, no man is an island. The self doesn't change when we grit our teeth and decide to be different, but when other people see us, recognize who we are and decide to love us for it.
Don't get me wrong. I can imagine some enterprising philosophy teachers constructing extra credit assignments around "Hit Man," but it definitely doesn't feel like homework. You don't even have to pick up on the headier bits to have a load of fun. It's radiant and loose and confident, the kind of movie that you can just tell was a blast to make, which makes it a blast to watch. As our overstuffed big-budget era starts to falter, let's hope they start making movies like this again.

Kevin James Thornton
May 26 at 6:30 p.m. at City Winery, 25 11th Avenue, Manhattan; citywinery.com.
Kevin James Thornton had taken multiple one-handers on the road before the pandemic, but he started to reach an even bigger audience when he went viral in 2021 with a TikTok on how at his church he once blurted out, "Shamala hamala." Thornton's confessional vignettes stand out not only because of the tales he tells of growing up gay in a religious community, but also because of the mellifluous flair he adds to his vocals by running them through Auto-Tune. He now has 1.7 million followers on TikTok and almost 750,000 on Instagram.
Last year, Thornton debuted his first stand-up special, "Be Yourself," which is available to buy or rent on most major platforms. His current show, which is a reminiscence on life in the 1990s, swings through New York City on Sunday after selling out Los Angeles earlier this month during the Netflix Is a Joke Fest.
Tickets start at $ 35 on City Winery's website. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Salt Cathedral and NOIA
May 25 at 7 p.m. at Public Records, 233 Butler Street, Brooklyn; publicrecords.nyc.
The two acts sharing Saturday night's bill at Public Records are based in Brooklyn, but perform under names that foreground their roots abroad. Salt Cathedral takes its moniker from a famed underground church in Colombia, where the group's members Juliana Ronderos and Nicolas Losada were born. The pair studied jazz at Berklee College of Music before turning to bubbly electro-pop compositions that often incorporate dembow rhythms. Salt Cathedral's new album, "Before It's Gone," deploys more organic instrumentation and retains the band's signature sense of buoyancy, even as its lyrics rifle through existential crises like climate change and tech-induced alienation.
NOIA, the alias that Gisela Fullà-Silvestre records under, comes from the word for girl in Catalan -- a language in which the Barcelona-born artist frequently sings, as she has said, "because it's my most private language and I want to keep it alive." Compared with Salt Cathedral, NOIA's take on pop is opulent, stormy and full of contrasts, pairing hard edges with soft, melismatic vocals.
Tickets for Saturday's show are around $ 26 on dice.fm. OLIVIA HORN
'New York Stories'
May 24 at 7:30 p.m. at OPERA America, 330 Seventh Avenue, Manhattan; americanmodernensemble.org.
Surprisingly, while we may see a lot of opera in New York City, we don't always get too many operas set here. (Where else can the everyday so easily become operatic?)
This weekend, American Modern Ensemble compensates for this dearth with its world premiere of Robert Paterson's "New York Stories."
To create this piece, Paterson collaborated with six writers -- Mark Campbell, Margot Connolly, David Cote, Briana Elyse Hunter, John de los Santos and Sokunthary Svay -- who contributed short librettos of New York lives across the five boroughs. Many scenes will be familiar to locals: people-watching sessions, unexpected connections, private moments made public. There's also an action adventure lifted from the seemingly mundane: a race against the clock (and the traffic cops) to move a car before the street sweeper arrives. Paterson's expressive tonal melodies and energetic percussive accents tie the stories together.
Tickets are two for the price of one, $ 30 with fees, on the ensemble's website. GABRIELLE FERRARI
Kids
'Waves, All That Glows Sees'
May 25-26 at Flushing Town Hall, 137-35 Northern Boulevard, Queens; flushingtownhall.org.
If you can't take your children to the seashore this weekend, Flushing Town Hall offers a beguiling alternative: a theatrical experience that uses lighting, props, music and inventive staging to conjure an oceanic adventure.
Created by Véronique Côté and performed by the Canadian troupe le Théâtre des Confettis, "Waves, All That Glows Sees" begins by welcoming its target audience -- toddlers to first graders -- inside a tent. There, a musician sits with various instruments, while an actor narrates from behind a desk of sorts; its movable, semicircular top functions as a stage.
Then the fun starts. The narrator (Guy Daniel Tremblay) sends miniature pieces -- an ocean liner, sea gulls -- on journeys by clipping them to a moving clothesline. He pours sand for a beach and evokes the ocean with a silken blue cloth. The musician (this weekend, Frédéric Blanchette) provides sound effects and songs as many visual surprises emerge, some from under the lid of a small piano. This is not a magic show, but it powerfully enchants.
Performances are also in a choice of languages: English on Saturday at 1 p.m.; Spanish on Saturday at 3 p.m.; and Mandarin (with some spoken English) on Sunday at 2:15 p.m. Tickets start at $ 8. LAUREL GRAEBER
Film
Out of the '80s
Through June 13 at Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, Manhattan; filmforum.org.
It's strange to think that members of the Brat Pack are now old enough to be getting revival screenings at Film Forum, which opened its current location in 1990, but the detentionees of John Hughes's "The Breakfast Club" (on Sunday, June 6 and June 11) remain eternal high schoolers onscreen. In conjunction with a run of Richard Shepard's "Film Geek," an essay movie built out of film clips, the theater is presenting a look at a wide variety of titles from the 1980s.
In retrospect, the decade's shopping-mall cinemas appear to have had a lot to offer. Beyond Hughes, the Reagan era brought us the Coen brothers' debut feature, "Blood Simple" (on Sunday, Monday and May 30), and Jim Jarmusch's breakthrough film, "Stranger Than Paradise" (on Friday, Monday, June 3 and June 8), as well as Ivan Passer's "Cutter's Way" (on Thursday and Friday), with Jeff Bridges and John Heard sniffing out a potential cover-up behind a murder in Santa Barbara, Calif.

Nissan Delays Its PlansFor 2 New Electric Sedans
Nissan has paused development plans for two battery-powered sedans while expanding its E.V. lineup to five vehicles in the United States, the Japanese automaker said on Tuesday.
"We are adjusting the timeline for the introduction of these five new models to ensure we bring the vehicles to the market at the right time," a Nissan spokesperson told Reuters.
The company's new lineup for the U.S. also includes battery-powered crossover S.U.V.s. While Nissan's electric sedans are still in the production plan, the company expects the S.U.V.s to be rolled out faster. The company also said its Canton, Miss., factory would support manufacturing of its next-generation vehicles.
The announcement comes as weaker-than-expected E.V. demand prompts automakers to pull back from ambitious electrification plans to focus on hybrids and gas-powered models instead. Reuters
ENTERTAINMENT
Comcast's StreamSaverWill Cost $ 15 Per Month
Comcast's new streaming bundle, packaging its Peacock service with Netflix and Apple TV+, will cost $ 15 per month for all Xfinity internet and TV customers, the media and broadband company said on Tuesday.
The new bundle, StreamSaver, is a "companion to broadband" and offers savings of more than 30 percent to customers, Comcast Cable's chief executive, David Watson, said at the J.P. Morgan Technology, Media and Communications Conference.
Customers can also combine StreamSaver with Comcast's newest offering "NOW TV," which includes more than 40 streaming channels, for $ 30 per month.
"StreamSaver is a home run for consumers who want top-tier entertainment and live sports," Mr. Watson said in a statement.
Comcast said the service would be rolled out on May 29 for Xfinity customers in the United States. Reuters
TRANSPORTATION
Busy Month for Imports Of Vehicles in Georgia
The Georgia Ports Authority reported Tuesday that April was its busiest month ever for automobile shipments as the Port of Brunswick took in thousands of additional car and truck imports rerouted from Baltimore following a deadly bridge collapse.
The second-busiest U.S. port for autos, Brunswick moved over 80,000 vehicles and heavy machinery units across its docks last month, a whopping 44 percent increase compared with April 2023.
The surge included 9,000 automobile imports and 1,000 pieces of heavy machinery that were diverted from the Port of Baltimore, the nation's top auto port. Baltimore has been closed to most ships since the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed March 26, killing six people, after a container ship crashed into one of its columns.
The Brunswick port had plenty of room to absorb the overflow, said Griff Lynch, chief executive of the Georgia Ports Authority. Associated Press

PC Makers Turning to A.I. To Reverse Years of Decline: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Microsoft, HP, Dell and others unveiled a new kind of laptop tailored to work with artificial intelligence. Analysts expect Apple to do something similar.
The race to put artificial intelligence everywhere is taking a detour through the good old laptop computer.
Microsoft on Monday introduced a new kind of computer designed for artificial intelligence. The machines, Microsoft says, will run A.I. systems on chips and other gear inside the computers so they are faster, more personal and more private.
The new computers, called Copilot+ PC, will allow people to use A.I. to make it easier to find documents and files they have worked on, emails they have read, or websites they have browsed. Their A.I. systems will also automate tasks like photo editing and language translation.
The new design will be included in Microsoft's Surface laptops and high-end products that run on the Windows operating system offered by Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung, some of the largest PC makers in the world.
The A.I. PC, industry analysts believe, could reverse a longtime decline in the importance of the personal computer. For the last two decades, the demand for the fastest laptops has diminished because so much software was moved into cloud computing centers. A strong internet connection and web browser was all most people needed.
But A.I. stretches that long-distance relationship to its limits. ChatGPT and other generative A.I. tools are run in data centers stuffed with expensive and sophisticated chips that can process the largest, most advanced systems. Even the most cutting-edge chatbots take time to receive a query, process it and send back a response. It is also extremely expensive to manage.
Microsoft wants to run A.I. systems directly on a personal computer to eliminate that lag time and cut the price. Microsoft has been shrinking the size of A.I. systems, called models, to make them easier to run outside of data centers. It said more than 40 will run directly on the laptops. The smaller models are generally not as powerful or accurate as the most cutting-edge A.I. systems, but they are improving enough to be useful to the average consumer.
"We are entering a new era where computers not only understand us, but can anticipate what we want and our intents," said Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, at an event at its headquarters in Redmond, Wash.
Analysts expect Apple to follow suit next month at its conference for software developers, where the company will announce an overhaul for Siri, its virtual assistant, and an overall strategy for integrating more A.I. capabilities into its laptops and iPhones.
Whether the A.I. PC takes off depends on the companies' ability to create compelling reasons for buyers to upgrade. The initial sales of these new computers, which cost more than $ 1,000, will be small, said Linn Huang, an analyst at IDC, which closely tracks the market. But by the end of the decade -- assuming A.I. tools turn out to be useful -- they will be "ubiquitous," he predicted. "Everything will be an A.I. PC."
The computer industry is looking for a jolt. Consumers have been upgrading their own computers less frequently, as the music and photos they once stored on their machines now often live online, on Spotify, Netflix or iCloud. Computer purchases by companies, schools and other institutions have finally stabilized after booming -- and then crashing -- during the pandemic.
Some high-end smartphones have already been integrating A.I. chips, but the sales have fallen short because the features "are still not sophisticated enough to catalyze a faster upgrade cycle," Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group, wrote in a research note. It will be at least another year, he said, before enough meaningful breakthroughs will lead consumers to take note.
At the event, Microsoft showed new laptops with what it likened to having a photographic memory. Users can ask Copilot, Microsoft's chatbot, to use a feature called Recall to look up a file by typing a question using natural language, such as, "Can you find me a video call I had with Joe recently where he was holding an 'I Love New York' coffee mug?" The computer will then immediately be able to retrieve the file containing those details because the A.I. systems are constantly scanning what the user does on the laptop.
"It remembers things that I forget," said Matt Barlow, Microsoft's head of marketing for Surface computers, in an interview.
Microsoft said the information used for this Recall function was stored directly on the laptop for privacy, and would not be sent back to the company's servers or to be used in training future A.I. systems. Pavan Davuluri, a Microsoft executive overseeing Windows, said that with the Recall system users would also be able to opt out of sharing certain types of information, such as visits to a specific website, but that some sensitive data, such as financial information and private browsing sessions, would not be monitored by default.
Microsoft also demonstrated live transcripts that translate in real time, which it said would be available on any video that streams across a laptop's screen.
Microsoft last month released A.I. models small enough to run on a phone that it said performed almost as well as GPT-3.5, the much larger system that initially underpinned OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot when it debuted in late 2022.
(The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft in December for copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems.)
Chipmakers have also made advances, like adjusting a laptop's battery life to allow for the enormous number of calculations that A.I. demands. The new computers have dedicated chips built by Qualcomm, the largest chip provider for smartphones.
Though the type of chip inside the new A.I. computers, known as a neural processing unit, specializes in handling complex A.I. tasks, such as generating images and summarizing documents, the benefits may still be unnoticeable to consumers, said Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor and researcher of artificial intelligence at Arizona State University.
Most of the data processing for A.I. still has to be done on a company's servers instead of directly on the devices, so it's still important that people have a fast internet connection, he added.
But the neural processing chips also speed up other tasks, such as video editing or the ability to use a virtual background inside a video call, said Brad Linder, the editor of Liliputing, a blog that has covered computers for nearly two decades. So, even if people don't buy into the hype surrounding artificial intelligence, they may end up getting an A.I. computer for other reasons.

Building a Community One Dice Roll at a Time: [Review]

Full text: Improv adds a theatrical dimension to the role-playing game, which has been undergoing a renaissance as it turns 50 this year.
While familiarity with things like non-player characters and their degree of disposability is not strictly necessary to enjoy "Dungeons and Dragons: The Twenty-Sided Tavern," it certainly helps. At the very least, try tagging along with someone with an awareness of tabletop role-playing games.
Indeed, hearing such jokes as "Be gentle -- this NPC doesn't have the 'essential' tag," made me grateful for the quality hours I spent playing Chivalry & Sorcery in my 20s. And the raucous laughter that welcomed the line at a recent performance of this Chicago import, now at Stage 42, confirmed I was among folks who shared an understanding.
This is less restrictive than it might sound in terms of potential audience because Dungeons & Dragons, which is turning 50 this year, has been undergoing a startling renaissance. People gather for regular sessions and the game maintains a strong pop-culture presence, from being a key component of the Netflix series "Stranger Things" to providing the framework for films like last year's "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves."
But unlike that straightforward fantasy tale, "The Twenty-Sided Tavern" is basically a play session. This makes it closer to the wildly popular output of Critical Role Productions, which presents live role-playing campaigns on various platforms.
Practically speaking, the show follows the basic steps of a D&D adventure. Three actors try to pull off a mission by reacting to prompts, solving riddles and, naturally, engaging in fights. This all happens under the direction of a dungeon master, played by DAGL (though his real name is David Andrew Laws), who created "The Twenty-Sided Tavern" with David Carpenter and Sarah Davis Reynolds (herself playing the watering hole's keeper).
Three of the actors can handle several characters within the same class: Madelyn Murphy can play three versions of a mage, Tyler Nowell Felix three versions of a fighter and Diego F. Salinas three types of rogue. The specific characters and their mission are assigned at the start of the show, the first of many narrative forks each performance can take. The audience can use their phones to participate via the browser-based platform Gamiotics. (My phone sometimes lagged, preventing me from casting votes I like to think would have been crucial, but most likely weren't.)
As with the tabletop version, the show relies heavily on a combination of scripted shenanigans, chance (those dice rolls!) and improvisation -- getting into the plot details of the mission I saw makes little sense here as each performance is different. When it came to the improv component, the lively, quick-thinking Murphy clearly stood out, but all four actors threw themselves into the ambient silliness. (Families looking for an outing should note that the show is appropriate for kids ages 8 and up.)
If anything, the show is not so much traditional theater as community-building, starting with the theater itself: The upstairs lobby is decked out in D&D-themed paraphernalia, including a figure of a Mimic creature, and well-stocked bars help explain the crowd's increased giddiness after intermission. At "The Twenty-Sided Tavern," everybody knows your name, and your dexterity score.

Nine-Day Whirl Of Opening Nights (And Matinees): [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: It's a challenging time for the theater industry, but as the Tonys deadline approached each new show had reason to pause for a moment and celebrate.
Broadway is in the midst of a rolling celebration -- of artistic expression, of audience enthusiasm, of song and dance and storytelling itself.
The overlapping runs constitute a risky bet by producers and investors, who have staked tens of millions of dollars on their ability to sell seats. Even in the best of times, most Broadway shows fail, and these are not the best of times: Production costs have soared, and season-to-date attendance is 18 percent below prepandemic levels.
But the shakeout comes later. First: fanfare and flowers, ovations and optimism.
'The Wiz'
A revival of a 1975 musical that reimagines "The Wizard of Oz" for an all-Black cast.
Of course "The Wiz" was going to have a yellow carpet. The show's recurring song is "Ease on Down the Road," and that road is the yellow brick one -- the path to Oz, but also, to self-discovery.
So there, on a rainy Wednesday evening, was a 100-foot stretch of yellowness in a breezeway outside the Marquis Theater.
Hillary Rodham Clinton and the rapper Common smiled for the cameras, as did the original Wiz, André De Shields; Dee Dee Bridgewater, who won a 1975 Tony as the good witch Glinda; and Stephanie Mills, who played Dorothy.
"I was a young girl -- I was 17 -- and I could have never thought that the show would last this long," said Mills, now 67. And why does she think the story endures? "Everyone needs courage, everyone needs a heart, and everyone needs brains to get through this world."
'Suffs'
A musical about the fight for women's right to vote in early 20th-century America.
One of the quirkiest traditions on Broadway is the Legacy Robe, an opening-night, musicals-only ceremony in which the chorus member who has worked in the most Broadway choruses dons a patchwork robe with appliqués from other musicals, circles the stage counterclockwise three times, and then visits dressing rooms to bestow a blessing. It's one of the rare Broadway ceremonies that celebrates ensemble members, and it's treasured.
So two hours before curtain, the "Suffs" cast and crew gathered onstage at the Music Box Theater to holler as Kirsten Scott, a swing in the company, received the robe in recognition of her five ensemble roles on Broadway.
Scott, teary and giddy, accepted the robe from Judith Franklin of "The Wiz," who had received it just the night before (the garment passes from show to show as each new one opens). Scott raced around the stage as the cast, crew and the show's creators (including its writer and star, Shaina Taub) touched the robe seeking good luck. Then, Scott rounded the dressing rooms, returned to the stage, and stretched out her arms as she gazed across the empty theater and offered a prayer.
"Let us be here for a very long time," she said. "Theater gods, smile upon us."
'The Heart of Rock and Roll'
A musical comedy, set in 1987, about love, family and cardboard manufacturing, powered by the songs of Huey Lewis and the News.
Pity the red carpet. Once the ubiquitous sign of an opening, now timeworn and ready for a refresh.
After "The Wiz" went with yellow and "Suffs" with purple (for suffrage), "The Heart of Rock and Roll" went with hot pink, a homage to fashion of the 1980s, when Huey Lewis and the News had its run of hits. The show leans hard into '80s-core, with neon colors and aerobics and the Walkman.
The pink carpet, along with the celebrity guests (Cyndi Lauper, Ben Vereen), the curtain speeches and the after-party (at the Hard Rock Cafe, natch), was held three days before the show's official opening (April 22) to avoid conflicting with the first night of Passover (also April 22).
Lewis, whose songs make up the score of the musical, arrived at the James Earl Jones Theater well before showtime, rocking a burgundy suit, hanging with his friend Jimmy Kimmel and signing autographs for fans.
"It feels great to have the songs have this other life that I never considered," Lewis said, "and to see them all reimagined -- I learn things about myself I didn't even know."
'Stereophonic'
A behind-the-music play, set in California in the 1970s, about a fictional band making an album.
"Stereophonic" isn't a musical. It's a play. With music.
But music is the play's subject, and it features original songs, performed by the cast, and written by Will Butler, formerly of Arcade Fire.
So on opening night, the invited audience was treated to an encore of sorts -- an original song played by the cast, joined by Butler, on the stage of the John Golden Theater, which now features a remarkable facsimile of a recording studio.
The playwright, David Adjmi, who has long labored in the nonprofit theater world, found himself a bit overwhelmed at having arrived on Broadway with a play he had been developing for about a decade.
"Hello?" Adjmi said as he haltingly accepted the microphone at the opening night curtain call. "Oh boy. I'm a playwright, and we don't like getting on stages, but I'm going to do this, because this is such a profound moment for me."
He noted that, for a time, he had considered giving up on playwriting, and he marveled at the moment -- his play, with no major stars, minimal action, and a single set, is now a leading contender for the best play Tony Award. "I was so scared to do a commercial production," he said as the crowd cheered encouragement, "because I am not a commercial guy, and I don't know how this happened."
'Hell's Kitchen'
A musical from Alicia Keys -- it uses her songs and is loosely based on her life -- about a 17-year-old girl growing up in Manhattan, finding her voice as an artist.
Alicia Keys has been developing "Hell's Kitchen" for 13 years, so when she finally got her Broadway opening, she pulled out all the stops. Guests included Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey. A prop piano sat on the carpet (this one was blue) and bucket drummers performed at the Pier 60 after-party where Keys's husband, Swizz Beatz, D.J.ed and their youngest son, Genesis, danced.
"We're finally here!" Keys said outside the Shubert Theater, feeling all the feels.
"I feel grateful. I feel blessed. I feel excited. I feel triumphant. I feel like dreams are possible. Man, what-what! I feel enchanted disbelief. That's how I feel."
Among those posing for pictures with Keys was Linda Aziza Miller, who was one of Keys's early piano teachers, and who is now making her Broadway debut playing in the "Hell's Kitchen" band. "I came out of retirement when Alicia called me," Miller said. "I said, 'Alicia, I'm retired!' She said, 'You need to come and do this.' So here I am."
At its core, "Hell's Kitchen" is a mother-daughter story -- filled with tension, but redeemed by love -- and Keys closed by addressing her own mother, who was in the audience. "Every sacrifice that she ever made, and every dream she ever had is here tonight," Keys said. "I love you, Mommy."
'Cabaret'
A revival of the 1966 musical, set in Berlin in 1929 and 1930, about the community in and around a seedy nightclub as the Nazi party accumulated power.
"Cabaret" is one of the season's biggest productions -- costly, because the producers remade the August Wilson Theater into the Kit Kat Club where the show is set, and starry, with Eddie Redmayne as that club's impresario. The opening was so big it was spread across two nights -- with two red carpets, two groups of celebrity attendees, and two after-parties.
Both Redmayne and his co-star Gayle Rankin, who is playing the nightclub performer Sally Bowles, have histories with the musical -- he had performed the same role as a student, and she played smaller roles in a revival a decade ago.
"Who gets this chance, 10 years apart, to mark your own growth as an artist and as a person?" she asked while walking the show's second carpet. "It's going to take me a long time to process. But it's the biggest privilege of my life."
And why do theater makers keep returning to this musical? "It's deeply entertaining," she said, "and it shakes us awake."
'Mary Jane'
A play about a single mother caring for a small child disabled by cerebral palsy and other disorders.
This year's string of opening nights was shaped not only by congestion -- there were three days featuring two scheduled openings, which is not ideal, because each show wants its own moment in the sun -- but also by another complication: Passover came unusually late, during the Broadway season's closing days. So some shows moved their start times or their party dates to minimize overlap and to avoid the first two nights of Passover, which is when Seders are held.
That's how "Mary Jane," which stars Rachel McAdams, wound up having its party and celebratory performance on a Sunday night, even though it was opening on a Tuesday night.
And what is a non-celebratory opening night? It's a regular performance, with a paying audience (attendees at celebratory opening nights are often invited guests); the only distinguishing feature is it's the night that press embargoes lift and reviews are published. At the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, where "Mary Jane" is running, the official opening was just like any other performance, but for one unsettling moment, when a woman in the audience shouted at the stage, "I love you, Rachel McAdams." Unsettling, because unruly audience members can get out of hand -- earlier this month, a woman was ejected after grabbing Eddie Redmayne's skirt at "Cabaret."
Happily, the disruption was fleeting, and McAdams, who an hour later would get positive reviews for her performance, stayed in character and kept going.
'Patriots'
A play about an oligarch's role in the rise of the Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the businessman's mysterious death after falling out with the autocratic leader.
"Patriots" is a high-octane ride through a portentous historical episode, and to get ready for that journey, the play's company has developed an unusual warm-up: Before each show, they play a backstage game with a Koosh ball.
The play, a late addition to the season, opted for a rare Monday matinee as its opening performance. So after the unorthodox warm-up at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, the cast walked a red carpet (on-brand, given the color's prominence in Russian culture), followed by a number of actors from the casts of Broadway shows (here's looking at you, Sarah Paulson) who were able to see a play without missing their own.
Also on the red carpet: Ted Sarandos, the co-chief executive of Netflix, which is making its Broadway debut as a producing entity with "Patriots." "One of the things I learned from Norman Lear early, early on: I said, 'What was your secret sauce back then, when you dominated television?' and he goes, 'I knew Broadway. I knew Broadway actors. I knew Broadway writers. And no one else did.' That always rang in my head."
Netflix has another reason for supporting "Patriots" -- the playwright, Peter Morgan, created "The Crown," one of the streamer's biggest successes. Netflix is already seeking to develop "Patriots" for the screen.
Morgan noted ruefully "a sad currency to this play," which he had written several years ago, but which is being staged in New York following the death in February of Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny. "It's just become more urgent and more timely," Morgan said.
But Morgan, who also wrote "The Audience" and "Frost/Nixon," said he worries about the economic viability of plays on Broadway. "I just hope plays like this can survive," he said.
'Uncle Vanya'
A revival of the 19th-century Russian play about a family whose equanimity is upset when an elderly professor and his young wife come to visit their farm.
Chekhov's classic drama first arrived on Broadway in 1923, and has been revived 10 times since, including this current production, with a new, idiomatically contemporary translation by Heidi Schreck.
The "Uncle Vanya" opening, at Lincoln Center Theater, was low-key, with a small step-and-repeat beforehand, and then post-show cast interviews before a private party.
The show's star, Steve Carell, is making his Broadway debut, and drawing crowds thanks to fame earned from years on "The Office."
"What am I going to say? It's incredibly exciting," he said. "It's what everybody says when they appear on Broadway. It's exhilarating."
Carell added that he has been wanting to work in theater, but waited until his children were grown. "I waited to go back and do anything onstage until we were empty nesters," he said. "I just didn't want to skip out on any moments with my children."
He said he thinks theater will benefit at a time when artificial intelligence is causing people to doubt what they see on screens. "Live performance is indisputable. You can't hide anything. And I think people are going to seek it out even more than they have in the past, because it's pure."
'Illinoise'
A dialogue-free musical that uses dance and song to tell a coming-of-age story inspired by a Sufjan Stevens album.
"Back. Front. Back. Front. Other leg! We slide to the side! Yes! Hit It!"
In a basement below the St. James Theater, Craig Salstein, a dance captain, was leading the cast of "Illinoise" through an exuberant preshow warm-up. The production had installed a bright yellow sprung dance floor, coated with slip-resistant vinyl, and the performers, some wearing socks and some barefoot, were dancing in circles, jumping up and down, stretching on the floor, and beaming. ("Smile," Salstein reminded them. "Show me attitude!")
"Illinoise," a narrative dance show from the choreographer Justin Peck and the playwright Jackie Sibblies Drury, took the fast lane to Broadway. It was playing Off Broadway at the Park Avenue Armory until March 26, and, after getting strong reviews, opted for a transfer so speedy that there was no time for previews.
That meant the first performance -- a Wednesday matinee -- would also be the official opening, and partying would wait until May. But the company gave Peck and Drury framed miniatures of the theater facade, and Peck gave the company a short hosanna, ending with "Let's do this thing!"
The cast is filled with performers making their Broadway debuts. Among them is Gaby Diaz, a winner of "So You Think You Can Dance," who said she didn't think she'd make it to Broadway because she's not a singer. "I'm very overwhelmed. I'm very emotional. But there's a real sense of safety and community in getting to do this with so many people for the first time -- it feels much bigger than me."
Diaz said she had begun the day by taking time to thank an early mentor. "I called my dance teacher from growing up, who flew in to come see me," she said. "I just said, 'Thank you for watering this seed inside me for so many years.' It's led me to here."
'Mother Play'
A play about a family in which a gin-swilling mother struggles to accept the homosexuality of her two children.
Paula Vogel, the playwright whose own life story informs "Mother Play," has been on Broadway twice before -- with "Indecent" and "How I Learned to Drive" -- but this is the first time she has written a play to be staged on Broadway without a previous production, and on opening day she was riding high.
"It's pretty exciting to open cold on Broadway," she said, "and I feel good."
She also feels a sort of catharsis, seeing some of her own experiences exorcised on the stage of the Helen Hayes Theater.
"I've tried to craft a funny, secular, ritual of forgiveness, and I'm really feeling released," she said. She added that she took particular joy seeing a version of her mother played by an accomplished actress. "There is a matter of turning over what was weight to other people. I couldn't pay for all the therapy in the world to equal one night of watching Jessica Lange."
Vogel was more sanguine than some about this jam-packed season. "I keep thinking back to a time when this is the way it was -- we've atrophied in terms of the number of openings in the commercial market, and I think the good thing about having this density of imagination and creativity is that we all have to concentrate on our own work ahead," she said. "I know every writer of a new play on Broadway, and I respect them and love them. This feels like getting your turn to speak at the Seder dinner, and that's really nice."
'Great Gatsby'
A musical based on the classic novel about a millionaire's tragic determination to rekindle a lost love.
Cars play a notable role in "The Great Gatsby." They are displays of affluence, objects of desire, and, in the end, an instrument of death.
So it made sense for the producers of "The Great Gatsby" musical to lean into the car motif for their opening night celebration. The show rented two antiques, a Hudson Greater Eight and a Chevrolet Superior K, and used them to ferry the principal actors on a one-block journey so they could arrive in style.
The theme almost backfired, because as the stars posed for pictures on a red carpet outside the Broadway Theater, a Tesla slammed into a pedestrian just a few feet away, at the intersection of Broadway and 53rd Street. Police officers staffing the opening responded, and the pedestrian was able to walk and talk; many of the celebrants, surrounded by well-wishers and besieged by cameras, didn't even notice.
The show's stars, Jeremy Jordan and Eva Noblezada, worked the crowd -- patiently posing for pictures and pausing for interviews.
"It's weird being in a season with so many shows -- I think it's unprecedented, especially the tide of them that has come in this past week," said Jordan, a fan favorite thanks to "Newsies" and "Smash." "It just feels like this weird alignment. And it's scary -- I can't lie and say that it's not nerve-racking to know that all of these shows are coming at once, and probably not all of them are going to make it."

LONDON — Luke Newton is yet to experience what it means to be a “Bridgerton” leading man, but he has been trying to prepare himself.
He has played Colin Bridgerton on the ornate, sexually charged Netflix show for two seasons, but for the third — which premiered this week — Newton is following in the footsteps of Regé-Jean Page and Jonathan Bailey and stepping into the role of a co-lead — or chief hunk.
“I feel slightly overwhelmed,” Newton, 31, said in a recent interview, adding that he was only just starting to appreciate the responsibilities of being a “Bridgerton” lead, rather than a co-star.
After watching both Page and Bailey navigate successful seasons and, later, careers in Hollywood, Newton asked both actors for advice. Page just suggested he take a vacation as soon as the season wrapped, Newton said, but Bailey — who continues to play Anthony, Colin’s older brother, in Season 3 — was around to support him throughout. “Whatever stress there was, whatever situation, I could just call him,” Newton said.
After the last season aired, Bailey’s status — both as a celebrity and a sex symbol — skyrocketed, leading to an “extraordinary change” in his life, Bailey said. But he wasn’t worried about how his co-star would handle the same shift: He said Newton could deal with the “absurd” nature of a sudden rush of fame.
“Bridgerton,” which is based on a series of novels by author Julia Quinn, follows eight siblings as they pine for love and reckon with relationships in early-19th-century London. The show, produced by Shonda Rhimes, has been praised both for its inclusive casting and raw approach to intimacy onscreen.
In the third season, most of the intimacy develops between longtime friends Colin and Penelope (a bashful debutante played by Nicola Coughlan), who fall for each other.
Early in the season, Colin returns from a summer spent traveling appearing “quietly confident,” Newton said, but only Penelope can see that this newfound confidence is “a bit of a show.”
Colin also gained some muscle, which Newton said was more about portraying the character’s growth while abroad than playing to his own ego as he prepared to shoot the season’s sex scenes.
Being “Bridgerton,” nudity remains part of the deal, but the romantic story line between Colin and Penelope is different from those of previous seasons, Newton said. Colin is “sensitive and compassionate,” he said, compared to the womanizing male characters who have previously led the show.
Coughlan, who called Newton “a very caring person,” said that “a lot of the lovely parts of Colin Bridgerton are also the lovely parts of Luke Newton.” Filming sex scenes was always nerve-racking, she added, but when she was recording those with Newton, she felt “like he really had my back.”
Newton grew up near Brighton, on the southern coast of England, and many of his family members were involved in the performing arts. He decided he wanted to act after seeing two aunts appear together onstage in “Les Misérables” when he was 6, he said. Newton attended amateur dramatic groups and cut his teeth in children’s television and stage acting, before studying theater at college and briefly joining a boy band.
Early on, Newton said he considered a career in musical theater over screen work, because he has dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which affect his ability to read scripts. “If I’m reading something I struggle with, I easily get distracted,” he said.
In 2018, when he auditioned to to play the Duke of Hastings in “Bridgerton” — the part Page eventually got — Newton said he had struggled to understand the script’s blend of contemporary and period elements. But he sent in an audition tape anyway. “I was lucky enough that they saw something,” he said: eventually, he was offered the role of Colin.
At the time, Newton hadn’t booked an acting gig for a while, and he was working in a bar and living on a friend’s sofa bed after a breakup. “When you come from a place of being an unemployed actor for so many years,” the show’s potential for a long run was a huge comfort, Newton said. Three seasons in, Newton said “Bridgerton” had “changed how I work, and how much I like to dive into something.”
After Season 3 wrapped, Newton returned to the stage for the first time in more than five years, in a production of Neil LaBute’s romantic drama “The Shape of Things.” He hoped to do more theater in the future, he said, and to work on a film that tells a character’s “whole story.”
Newton said he hopes to “take a step back” from the spotlight for Season 4. The actors playing the Bridgerton siblings have a group chat, and whichever of them takes the reins, Newton said he plans on supporting them however he can. He called it “returning the favor.”

Flatness Pervades Black Satire's Current Moment: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Recent releases like "American Fiction" and "The American Society of Magical Negroes" have used absurdist humor to examine race. But they have also depicted narrow views of Blackness.
In 2017, Jordan Peele's "Get Out" was a critical and commercial smash that immediately became one of the defining movies of the Trump Era. The next year, Boots Riley's masterful "Sorry to Bother You" seemed to herald a new golden age for Black satire films. But as those movies stood out for using surreal plot twists to humorously -- and horrifically -- unpack complex ideas like racial appropriation and consumer culture, the crop that has followed hasn't kept pace. The current moment is defined by a central question: What does the "Black" look like in Black satire films today? Too often lately it's "not Black enough."
By that I mean to say a recent influx of films, including "The American Society of Magical Negroes," "American Fiction" and "The Blackening," have failed to represent Blackness with all its due complexity -- as sometimes messy, sometimes contradictory. Instead, they flatten and simplify Blackness to serve a more singular, and thus digestible, form of satirical storytelling.
The foremost example is "American Fiction," inspired by Percival Everett's 2001 novel "Erasure," which won this year's Oscar for best screenplay. In the film, a Black author and professor named Monk (played by Jeffrey Wright) finds literary success through "My Pafology," a novel satirizing books that feed negative Black stereotypes. But Monk's audience receives his book with earnest praise, forcing him to reconcile his newfound prosperity with his racial ethics.
The surface layer of satire is obvious: The white audiences and publishing professionals who celebrate "My Pafology" do so not because of its merits but because the book allows them to fetishize another tragic Black story. It's a performance of racial acceptance; these fans are literally buying into their own white guilt.
Monk's foil in the film is another Black author, Sintara Golden (Issa Rae), who publishes a popular book of sensationalist Black trauma about life in the ghetto. Profiting on her white audience's racist assumptions about Blackness, Sintara is this satire's race traitor -- or so it initially seems. Because when, in one scene, Monk questions whether Sintara's book is any different from "My Pafology," which she dismisses as pandering, she counters that she is spotlighting an authentic Black experience. Sintara accuses Monk of snobbery, saying that his highfalutin notion of Blackness excludes other Black experiences because he is too ashamed to recognize them.
But the fact that it is Sintara who voices the film's criticism of Monk shows how loath "American Fiction" is to make a value statement on the characters' actions within the context of their Blackness. Sintara, whom Monk catches reading "White Negroes," a text about Black cultural appropriation, somehow isn't winkingly framed as the hypocrite or the inauthentic one pointing out the hypocrisy and inauthenticity of the hero.
This adaptation seems to misunderstand that "Erasure" is as much a critique of how white audiences perceive these Black characters' art and their identities as it is about how the characters decide to manipulate or contradict these perceptions. "American Fiction" takes the easy way out by making both of these characters right, a move which undercuts the nuances of how Monk and Sintara are negotiating themselves as Black people and the ethical weight of their choices.
In the similarly watered-down comedy-horror film "The Blackening," a group of Black college friends reunites in a remote cabin for a Juneteenth celebration. Once there, the friends are hunted and threatened by unknown assailants and forced to play a minstrel-style trivia game proving their Blackness.
The racial satire of "The Blackening" is straightforward: The villains are white people who appropriate, sell and kill Black bodies. And the whole concept of the film is based on that common racist horror film trope in which the Black character is the first to die.
Like "American Fiction," it falls into the trap of building its scaffolding from an outside look at Blackness, as something defined by and reactionary against whiteness. The result is another film that neglects being "too Black" -- skimping on an interior look into Blackness that may sometimes contradict or betray itself. Blackness is so singularly defined -- these Black friends are celebrating Juneteenth, and the game asks them questions about rap lyrics and "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" -- that neither the plot's action nor the comedy surprises. The reveal that the nerdy Trump-voting Black character (played by Jermaine Fowler) is the true bad guy is obvious, and says little on a satirical level beyond that "illegitimate" or "inauthentic" Blackness is dangerous and easy to spot.
"The American Society of Magical Negroes," a title that references a particular character trope seen in movies like "The Green Mile" and "The Legend of Bagger Vance," also fails to offer a three-dimensional depiction of Blackness. In the movie, a meek Black man named Aren (Justice Smith) is introduced to the titular group by longtime member Roger (David Alan Grier). Aren initially denies that he's concerned about race but then embraces his role as a magical Negro -- until his love life intersects with his first assignment, forcing him to choose between embracing agency over his own life and defying society.
The film's fantastical central idea, however, is more show than substance. For most of a film that's supposed to mock a racist character trope, it's ironic that we don't see much of these characters beyond their acting in this trope. Aren's Blackness tellingly feels incidental though it's central to the plot. His biracial identity is thrown out as a brief aside, when it seems like a prominent character detail to explore in a satire about proscribed racial roles.
The one-handed satirical approach of these films may, to some extent, come down to a failure of the writing. But there's another factor at play -- box office politics. The more obvious layer of satire, addressing white oppression and white guilt, seems aimed at white liberal audiences so they can feel in on the joke. Black audiences, on the other hand, are left with a simplified representation of their race that doesn't dare be too controversial.
Just a few years ago "Get Out" and "Sorry to Bother You" each offered its own sharp satire about how whiteness may break down the Black psyche. While both films build their action around the absurd ways whiteness sabotages the protagonists on a societal level, they differ from the newer satires by representing, either metaphorically or literally, spaces of Black interiority or consciousness damaged by whiteness. In "Get Out," it's the Black hero's entrapment in the Sunken Place, which became one of the defining metaphors of its time. In "Sorry to Bother You," the hero's moment of truth arrives when he must choose whether to retain his identity and class status, or to continue using a racial performance to gain clout and success, to lose his humanity.
There is one recent exception to the recent spate of middling Black satirical films: Netflix's "They Cloned Tyrone." In the film, a drug dealer named Fontaine (John Boyega), a pimp named Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx) and a prostitute named Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris) discover a clandestine program at work within their town. The Black residents are being cloned, experimented on and mind-controlled via rap music and stereotypically Black products like fried chicken and chemical relaxers.
But the satire works in both directions. The film cleverly makes the main three characters conscious of the stereotypes they portray. They question whether those roles serve them or serve the racist scheming happening around them. Fontaine eventually discovers that the big bad is the original Fontaine, who initiated the cloning process and is trying to whitewash Black people into white people a la another famous satire, "Black No More." Through this twist, "They Cloned Tyrone" showcases how racism can subvert the minds of even the marginalized.
"They Cloned Tyrone" succeeds in its depiction of "authentic Blackness" in comparison to other recent satires. It's not just about the way characters speak or the exaggerated depictions of their lives; it's also about their internal conflicts, whether they choose to submit to a racist narrative and how much agency they have over their own narratives.
These satires, after all, come down to narratives: Beneath the commentary, the jokes and the ironies are meant to reveal what are, essentially, Black stories. But so many of these films fail to understand the central, perhaps the only, parameter of a "Black story": that it be honest and complicated and, at the very least, inclusive of the people it depicts.

Full text: A heady market rally extended to a second day after Keith Gill, the trader known as Roaring Kitty who rallied small investors to buy out-of-favor stocks in the pandemic, returned to social media.
Wall Street is feeling meme stock déjà vu.
An army of small investors this week have been driving up the price of GameStop, the video game retailer whose enormous 2021 rally led to fame for the stock's chief social-media savvy booster (Keith Gill, known as Roaring Kitty), a Netflix series and a movie, a congressional hearing, an investigation by securities regulators -- and steep losses for those who mistimed the stock's rapid rise and fall.
GameStop's stock closed about 60 percent higher on Tuesday, after it gained more than 70 percent on Monday, adding billions in market value. The shares of the movie theater chain AMC Entertainment were similarly buoyant, and obscure cryptocurrencies named after Roaring Kitty and GameStop also posted gains.
Retail traders have been spurred on by the return of Roaring Kitty to social media after a three-year hiatus. Mr. Gill posted a cryptic series of video clips from movies, television shows and music videos on Monday and Tuesday on his X account. He made no mention of GameStop, the company he enthusiastically promoted online, making him the face of the meme-stock phenomenon in 2021 and 2022, when the prices of beaten-down stocks like GameStop and AMC suddenly jumped 1,000 percent or more.
In recent days, investors have loaded up on GameStop "call" options -- essentially, bets that the stock will continue to rise -- according to Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. Aside from Roaring Kitty's return to social media, the rally was not driven by any evident news about GameStop or AMC. "Given my past experience in analyzing the periodic bouts of meme stock activity, consider me suspicious," Sosnick wrote in a research note.
The sharp upturn has saddled short sellers, who bet on stock prices falling, with huge losses. GameStop shorts started the week with $ 392 million in profits so far this year. By the close on Monday, that had turned into $ 852 million in losses, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of S3 Partners, a data firm.
"Short sellers may be in for a bumpy and bloody ride," he added.
According to Bloomberg, there are only two Wall Street analysts who cover GameStop, and their ratings are a "sell" and an "underperform." The retailer has recently laid off staff and a stream of executives have left. Sales have been slumping, with annual revenue falling in four of the past five years.

TV Has a New Hero: The Crusading Podcaster: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Why have podcasters emerged as the rumpled protagonists of numerous television shows? We'll discuss after the break.
Gilbert Power, a public radio veteran and the host of the podcast "On Record," went to a small town in Ireland to make a show about a 20-year-old missing-persons case. The podcast, he explained, was meant to be "a bit of fun, something to listen to on your drive home. I didn't understand then how much power a story actually has. But stories can change us."
Gilbert, played by a grinning Will Forte, is the lightly inane hero of "Bodkin," a seven-episode series that premiered last week on Netflix. And as the fictional host of a fictional podcast, he has plenty of onscreen competition.
In the past five years, podcasters have emerged as the rumpled protagonists of numerous television shows ("Based on a True Story," "Truth Be Told," "Only Murders in the Building," "Alex Inc.") and films ("C'mon C'mon," "Vengeance," "Monolith," "Bros"). Even the trendsetting Carrie Bradshaw was onboard; in "And Just Like That...," she moved from print journalism to the advice podcast "X, Y and Me," before going solo.
Some of these works are comedies, some dramas. Many of them involve one or more mysteries in homage to or parody of true-crime podcasting. In these shows and movies, podcasters fill the roles once occupied by journalists or amateur sleuths, as tyros desperate for answers. These protagonists are often bumbling, and their relationship to ethics is distinctly off-and-on.
But characters like these help fulfill a very particular fantasy: that we can tell the truth while also telling a good, possibly even powerful, story. And maybe land a mattress sponsorship while we're at it.
Jez Scharf, the creator of "Bodkin," dreamed up the show after several work trips to Ireland. (He and Alex Metcalf are the showrunners.) Scharf, who was raised in England, felt awkward in Ireland, an outsider. He was listening to a lot of podcasts at the time, especially true crime -- "S Town," "Serial," "West Cork." The democratization of the internet meant that anyone with access to a phone could make a podcast. What would it be like, he wondered, for an outsider to show up in a strange place and question people about their most traumatic experiences?
"I found that idea broadly quite absurd and an interesting means of making a slightly different detective show," he said during a recent video call.
Podcasters are of course not the only people with a tendency to arrive and ask difficult questions. Journalists do that, too; "Bodkin" saddles Gilbert with one of them, Dove, a Guardian reporter played by Siobhan Cullen. But not all podcasters are journalists, and not all podcasters feel bound to journalistic ethics.
Metcalf said: "We were really conscious of the relationship between what journalism should be -- after the truth, 'just the facts, ma'am' -- and this burgeoning world of proto-journalism, done by anybody who happens to have a microphone."
Even actual journalists can find podcasting liberating. Rebecca Jarvis, an ABC News correspondent and the host of the podcasts "No Limits With Rebecca Jarvis" and "The Dropout," said that while traditional journalism has traditions and rules, podcasting offers new freedoms. "It can feel a little bit more like the Wild West," she said in an interview.
Those freedoms can be abused, however, which opens up killer storytelling possibilities. Smart people making upstanding choices makes for boring television. And the fact that anyone with an internet connection can throw up their own feed lends a vicarious thrill -- Are you nosy and own a smartphone? You can be a detective and a show host too! -- while generating dramatic tension from everyday people being in way over their heads.
Take, for example, the amoral protagonists of the Peacock series "Based on a True Story," an occasionally lurid satire of the American obsession with true crime. It hinges on an objectively terrible choice made by a bored married couple: When a tennis pro (Chris Messina) and his real estate agent wife (Kaley Cuoco) discover that their plumber is a serial killer, instead of calling the police they decide to record a podcast with him, cashing in on the criminality even as he continues to kill. Annie Weisman, the showrunner for Season 2, said that putting podcasters at the center of the show allowed for liberties in the storytelling.
"Stories about responsible, ethical journalism are not as much fun because the reality of it is a very methodical, tedious, boring, long process when it's done well and done right," she said. "We need that for democracy, and it's very important. But when we're playing in this pulpier true-crime world, we're unhitching ourselves from those constraints."
Some think such unhitching devalues the reputation of fact-finders. Joe Saltzman, a professor at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, who studies the depiction of journalists in popular culture, does not discriminate between podcasters and broadcast and print reporters. He believes that they are represented in similar, often negative ways.
"People love gossip and the news, but they hate the people who bring them that information," he said. "And the more they see of the process involved, the more they hate them."
Saltzman argues that when it comes to TV and film, journalists writ large -- reporters, podcasters, bloggers, vloggers -- will generally be forgiven for their ethical lapses as long as they are performing in the public interest. But sometimes, as in "Bodkin," "Based on a True Story" and "Only Murders in the Building," those interests are more private.
"When they use the precious commodity of the news media for their own personal gain, then there's a really negative image of the journalists," he said.
In a moment when the news business is flailing, journalists in many places are under threat, and "fake news" has become a frequent drumbeat, watching podcasters make bad choices, rather than professional reporters do that, feels less icky, at least. (Want that ick? Then you may enjoy playing a spot-the-ethical-violations game with "The Girls on the Bus" or "The Morning Show.") Showing podcasters as dumb, craven or corrupt doesn't invite as many reputational consequences. Sometimes, it's even fun.
John Hoffman, who created "Only Murders in the Building" with Steve Martin, wanted to add a podcast element partly to create a landscape for Martin and his co-star Martin Short to play in.
The true-crime podcast format allows Charles (Martin) and Oliver (Short), joined by Selena Gomez playing Mabel, to make ethical and investigative stumbles while allowing for plenty of character-based comedy. The show, an acclaimed Hulu series, also managed a bit of commentary about the vulturous nature of the true-crime genre when it made the Season 2 murderer a podcast producer. (A further upside: It gave her colleague, played by Tina Fey, plenty of material.)
"Podcasters are looking to tell the story, but they're also bringing the personal in," Hoffman said. "I'm really interested in the humanity of everyone involved around an incident or a tragedy."
Jarvis, the journalist podcaster, is a fan of "Only Murders in the Building." She enjoys how the show skewers podcast clichés, while also portraying the thrill of making a podcast. "They capture that excitement of a small group of people who are hustling and working really hard to tell a story," she said.
That excitement comes more easily, she added, because "Only Murders" doesn't have to show the work that real journalists and many real podcasters would do -- the research, the fact-checking. And that's fine with Jarvis.
"I just enjoy it as entertainment," she said of the show. "If it was intended to be a representation of how we do the work that we do, it would not be an accurate one."

Bo Burnham Is Everywhere. And Nowhere.: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He's managed to turn his supposed absence into a performance, whether on "The Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show" or in your social media feed.
Early in his bold and vexing new reality show, Jerrod Carmichael hears a knock at the door and opens it to find a very tall man in a ski mask and goggles just standing there. He pauses to process, then concludes: "This makes sense."
Most viewers probably thought: Really? But certain comedy fans would come to a different response: Welcome back, Bo Burnham.
Sure, we don't know it's him. On "The Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show" (HBO), this lanky masked man is referred to as Anonymous and his voice is disguised. But if this isn't Bo Burnham, it's a pretty good impression -- or at least, one of him dressed to rob a bank.
Burnham has been conspicuously quiet since rocketing to superstar status by producing one of the signal works of art about the pandemic, the 2021 musical comedy "Inside." He dropped out of a role in a TV series and appeared in no new specials, movies or live shows. Except for "Inside" outtakes, he hasn't shown up in any new work -- until, possibly, now.
Starring in three of the eight episodes, Anonymous comes off like a performance piece, half-abstraction and half-person, with no background, identity, face. He stands out more by revealing little, which is only one of the ways he's in opposition to Carmichael, who is seen doing stand-up in short clips and having thorny, difficult conversations with his loved ones. Anonymous plays a crucial role, an exasperated ombudsman, picking apart the entire enterprise from the inside, providing a critique of its authenticity and the perils of performing for an audience.
These are hallmarks of Bo Burnham's work dating at least to his far-too-overlooked MTV sitcom, "Zach Stone Is Gonna Be Famous," a satire of reality shows.
One way to look at "The Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show" is as a counterpoint to the last decade of Burnham works, culminating with "Inside," which portrays not just the isolation of lockdown, but also the corrosive impact of life in the public eye. Burnham was one of the earliest YouTube stars and later a trenchant critic of such fame.
In "Inside," he watches one of his teenage videos, grim-faced. The special builds on the idea that performing can destroy your mental health, a point he most directly articulated in his previous Netflix hour, "Make Happy," which ended with him leaving the stage and walking into the same room where "Inside" takes place. (In an apt coincidence, it happens to be the home where the original "Nightmare on Elm Street" was filmed). "I know very little about anything," he says. "But what I do know is that if you can live your life without an audience, you should do it."
CARMICHAEL HAD A DIFFERENT VIEW. The audience, as he sees it, gives him the courage to live more honestly. His comedy shifted course with his last special, "Rothaniel," which, as it happens, was directed by Burnham. Carmichael came out of the closet publicly in that hour and told family secrets; now, in his reality show, he insists he needs the camera to have tough conversations.
This show features him examining deeply personal and uncomfortable subjects in every episode, whether it's being a bad friend, cheating on his boyfriend or celebrating being cheated on in his own apartment. He confronts his parents about homophobia and infidelity. The episode in which he emotionally ambushes his father ends with the older man looking trapped and desperate to escape the view of the camera.
Most of the humor is cringe comedy, like explaining to his father the difference between daddies, bears and otters. This show can feel like a provocation, a dare to hate Carmichael, then love him and back again. Whereas Burnham suggests that the audience distorts reality, Carmichael says he needs it to tell the truth. He refuses to go anywhere without a camera crew no matter how much it frustrates his loved ones.
He's been accused of exploiting private pain for entertainment, and there's some validity to that. Is needing the camera so he can be honest a way to rationalize invading others' privacy? He can seem like a bully, but there's just enough tenderness in this portrait of everyone he trains his camera on (not to mention self-criticism) to complicate your reaction. The show wants to challenge and confuse and move its audience. Even in moments when he's hard to take, I respect that he's aiming for something other than Mid TV.
Burnham plays a valuable role here, standing in for the flummoxed audience. When he calls Carmichael an exhibitionist, the star responds, "What's wrong with that?" Burnham comes back with: "There's public and private and there's masturbatory public."
This is a harsh but accurate description of some of this reality show, but part of what it questions is whether all personal art taps into some voyeuristic pleasures, Burnham's included. He's been making this critique of the dangers of constantly performing for more than a decade. And while he skewers Carmichael for exposing himself, Burnham (or, OK, Anonymous) is participating, too, even if he acts disgusted by the whole thing.
As Burnham himself once said, "Self-awareness does not absolve anybody of anything."
TO BE A LITTLE MORE CYNICAL, once you reach a certain level of fame and success, disappearing can be a smart career move. Quitting his show and going underground transformed Dave Chappelle from a popular comedian into a modern myth.
It's harder to escape the public eye in the social media era. Burnham inspires an obsessive community of fans on Reddit and TikTok who analyze every scrap of information about him. If you're paying close attention, he hasn't vanished at all. He's in your feed wearing a mask at the Emmys or walking with his girlfriend, Phoebe Bridgers. (Asked by a fan why he wore a mask to those awards, he said, "You'll see")
The only thing that abhors a vacuum more than nature is the celebrity press. Burnham not only knows this but exploits it.
Earlier this year, an old screen shot from his website circulated in which he predicted he would die on Jan. 17, 2024. An interview from many years ago in which he predicted the same thing went viral. As the day grew closer, his fan base became increasingly worried. Burnham erased most of his social media posts and replaced his avatar with a photo of the ocean, goosing the furor more.
This may be nothing, a prank or part of some future project (my money's on a collaboration with Ari Aster or Nathan Fielder). But what's clear is that while he has not appeared onstage in years, Burnham is still alert to his audience. He's performing absence. His masked man is there but not all there.
Even in shows he's not involved with, you see this tease. His friends help. A memorable episode of "The Bear," created by Christopher Storer, who co-directed Burnham's special "Make Happy," followed the workers at a fancy Chicago restaurant. The patrons are supposed to include Burnham, and everything about the script creates expectations that he will show up. But he doesn't. His absence stands out.
"Inside" ended with Burnham in a screening room, watching the show he's in. The final episode of "The Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show," which will be released Friday, takes a similar turn, but with Carmichael and Anonymous. The masked man tells Carmichael he wants no part of the series, and adds: "This is going to be viewed by the giant revolting mass of people that is argumentative, insane. That's a scary collective for the most precious things in your life."
This echoes what Burnham told me in a 2016 interview: He used to feel that talking about his relationship to the audience was indulgent, but he realized that when everyone has a camera in their pocket, the subject of how it feels to perform is more universally relatable. "To me, they're a mob," he said of the audience. "Intimidating, strange and creepy."
I wonder if Carmichael now is more sympathetic to this point. He appeared on the "Breakfast Club" radio show and responded a bit defensively to criticism while pleading guilty to being an egomaniac.
All artists plumb their personal lives for public consumption. But there is no assurance such vulnerability will be well-received or understood, and assuming so is naïve. The audience likes what it likes -- and hates a little bit of everything all of the time.
Bo Burnham understands this well, which is why the masked man might be a clever answer to an impossible question: Once you build a huge and loyal audience performing the damage done by performing for an audience, what's next?

A Night to Remember at the Opera, Complete With a Phantom: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the pitch-dark auditorium of Rome's Teatro Costanzi, a high-pitched lament floated from the top galleries. Dozens of flashlights snapped on, their beams crisscrossing crazily, seeking the source of the sound.
The shafts of light homed in on a spectral figure -- a slim, dark-haired woman dressed in white, moving at a funereal pace and plaintively singing. In the audience, 130-odd children, ages 8 to 10, let loose squeals, some gasps, and one "it's not real." Several called out "Emma, Emma."
The children had just been told that the Costanzi, the capital's opera house, had a resident phantom. No, not that one. This was said to be the spirit of Emma Carelli, an Italian soprano who managed the theater a century ago, and loved it so much that she was loath to leave it, even in death.
"The theater is a place where strange things happen, where what is impossible becomes possible," Francesco Giambrone, the Costanzi's general manager, told the children Saturday afternoon when they arrived to participate in a get-to-know-the-theater-sleepover.
Music education ranks as a low priority in Italy, the country that invented opera and gave the world some of its greatest composers. Many experts, including Mr. Giambrone, say their country has rested on its considerable laurels rather than cultivate a musical culture that encourages students to learn about their illustrious heritage.
With little backing from schools or lawmakers, arts organizations like the Costanzi have concluded that it is up to them to reach out to the young.
Mr. Giambrone sought to dispel opera's stuffy image by abandoning the genre's strict dress code. That change, like the sleepover, is part of his effort to make opera, often seen as an elitist, highbrow and abstruse art form for the initiated, more familiar and accessible, especially to children.
"We believe that the theater should be for everyone, and that it should make people feel at home," Mr. Giambrone said in an interview. Hence the decision to welcome youngsters to eat, sleep and play there. "Once a theater is a home, it is no longer something distant, something a bit austere to fear, or somewhere you feel inadequate," he said.
"There's a lot of talk about Made in Italy, but real shortsightedness when it comes to our musical patrimony, which is envied throughout the world," said Maestro Antonio Caroccia, who teaches music history at the Santa Cecilia conservatory in Rome. He said that "politicians are deaf to it."
"Italy is far behind" many other countries, said Barbara Minghetti, of Opera Education, which creates programs for children. "This I can guarantee."
When he was in Italy's Parliament, Michele Nitti, a musician and former lawmaker with the 5 Star Movement, proposed a law adding musical education to school curricula. His bill never made it to a parliamentary vote.
He said that not even Giuseppe Verdi, the 19th century composer who also served in Parliament, was able, in his time, to get his fellow lawmakers to support music education in schools.
Mr. Nitti was also unsuccessful in getting lawmakers to declare opera singing a national treasure. He did support the country's successful bid to have the practice of opera singing in Italy put on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity after switching to the Democratic Party.
"Oh well," he said.
Rather than letting its opera culture wither, Mr. Giambrone said, "Italy should be teaching other countries how it's done."
At the Teatro Costanzi, more than half of the children at the sleepover belonged to scout troops from Rome's outlying neighborhoods. They were accompanied by coolheaded scout leaders who -- impressively -- commanded silence just by raising a finger.
Most of the children had never visited the theater before. "Come to think of it, I haven't been there either," said Gianpaolo Ricciarelli, one of the parents who dropped off his son.
Another father, Armando Cereoli, said, "Between video games, cellphones and Netflix, there's tough competition to get kids interested in beautiful things."
Some of the children came from disadvantaged neighborhoods, so the visit was "a chance to free their minds and to dream," said Sara Greci, a scout leader and Red Cross worker who brought four girls from a home for abused women and their children.
The opera house runs several outreach programs for the homeless or people who live in Rome's most far-flung neighborhoods, a way to open the theater to the city and broaden its reach, said Andrea Bonadio, who was hired by the theater to work on such programs.
Nunzia Nigro, the theater's director for marketing and education, said that several of the children who had participated in the theater's educational programs over the past 25 years were loyal patrons today. "We're beginning to reap some of those efforts, and have a younger public," she said.
Ms. Nigro helped organize the sleepover, tailoring it for 8- to 10-year-olds -- old enough to sleep away from home but not old enough to have hormones kick in, she said. As it was, two boys felt homesick enough to get their moms to pick them up.
On Saturday, the children watched part of a rehearsal for an upcoming performance of Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony -- "the conductor uses a wand to direct music, not so different from Harry Potter's but more important," Ms. Nigro said. They learned how the staff cleaned the world's biggest chandelier in a historic building, and they got to know the ins and outs of the theater via a treasure hunt (read general mayhem) that had them scrambling up and down stairs, flitting in and out of stalls like a multicharacter French farce.
Emma the phantom -- Valentina Gargano, a soprano in the opera's young artists program -- made an encore, exacting a promise from the children that they would tell their friends about "this magic place" and come back when they grew up.
One girl had been so convinced that Ms. Gargano was a real ghost that the organizers made sure they met when the soprano was in street clothes.
After being serenaded with music, including Brahms' classic lullaby, the children settled down (or tried to) in a patchwork of sleeping bags on an artificial green lawn used in a previous production of Madama Butterfly. Above them loomed oversize photos of some of the stars who performed at the Costanzi, like Maria Callas, Herbert von Karajan and Rudolf Nureyev.
After breakfast on Sunday, the children took part in workshops at which they designed colorful paper ballet costumes, learned basic ballet positions, sang as part of a choir (some more enthusiastically than others) and played an opera-themed version of snakes and ladders. The game was designed and overseen by Giordano Punturo, the opera's stage manager, done up in a tuxedo and colorful top hat.
He didn't know about the kids, he said, "but I had the time of my life."
After a group singalong and photo, it was almost time to head home.
"Did you have fun?" Mr. Giambrone asked the kids. "Yes!!" they cheered. "Did you sleep well?" he asked, to a more mixed response. Several "No "s were notably heard. Come back soon, he said.
After hugging his parents who had come to pick him up, Andrea Quadrini, almost 11, couldn't wait to tell them that his team had won at snakes and ladders, and that the treasure hunt had been especially fun.
"Wow," he said. "I saw an opera theater for the first time."

ROME — In the pitch-dark auditorium of Rome’s Teatro Costanzi, a high-pitched lament floated from the top galleries. Dozens of flashlights snapped on, their beams crisscrossing crazily, seeking the source of the sound.
The shafts of light homed in on a spectral figure — a slim, dark-haired woman dressed in white, moving at a funereal pace and plaintively singing. In the audience, 130-odd children, ages 8 to 10, let loose squeals, some gasps, and one “it’s not real.” Several called out “Emma, Emma.”
The children had just been told that the Costanzi, the capital’s opera house, had a resident phantom. No, not that one. This was said to be the spirit of Emma Carelli, an Italian soprano who managed the theater a century ago, and loved it so much that she was loath to leave it, even in death.
“The theater is a place where strange things happen, where what is impossible becomes possible,” Francesco Giambrone, the Costanzi’s general manager, told the children Saturday afternoon when they arrived to participate in a get-to-know-the-theater-sleepover.
Music education ranks as a low priority in Italy, the country that invented opera and gave the world some of its greatest composers. Many experts, including Giambrone, say their country has rested on its considerable laurels rather than cultivate a musical culture that encourages students to learn about their illustrious heritage.
With little backing from schools or lawmakers, arts organizations like the Costanzi have concluded that it is up to them to reach out to the young.
Giambrone sought to dispel opera's stuffy image by abandoning the genre’s strict dress code. That change, like the sleepover, is part of his effort to make opera, often seen as an elitist, highbrow and abstruse art form for the initiated, more familiar and accessible, especially to children.
“We believe that the theater should be for everyone, and that it should make people feel at home,” Giambrone said in an interview. Hence the decision to welcome youngsters to eat, sleep and play there. “Once a theater is a home, it is no longer something distant, something a bit austere to fear, or somewhere you feel inadequate,” he said.
“There’s a lot of talk about ‘made in Italy,’ but real shortsightedness when it comes to our musical patrimony, which is envied throughout the world,” said maestro Antonio Caroccia, who teaches music history at the Santa Cecilia conservatory in Rome. He said that “politicians are deaf to it.”
“Italy is far behind” many other countries, said Barbara Minghetti, of Opera Education, which creates programs for children. “This I can guarantee.”
When he was in Italy’s parliament, Michele Nitti, a musician and former lawmaker with the 5 Star Movement, proposed a law adding musical education to school curricula. His bill never made it to a parliamentary vote.
He said that not even Giuseppe Verdi, the 19th century composer who also served in parliament, was able, in his time, to get his fellow lawmakers to support music education in schools.
Nitti was also unsuccessful in getting lawmakers to declare opera singing a national treasure. He did support the country’s successful bid to have the practice of opera singing in Italy put on UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity after switching to the Democratic Party.
“Oh well,” he said.
Rather than letting its opera culture wither, Giambrone said, “Italy should be teaching other countries how it’s done.”
At the Teatro Costanzi, more than half of the children at the sleepover belonged to scout troops from Rome’s outlying neighborhoods. They were accompanied by coolheaded scout leaders who — impressively — commanded silence just by raising a finger.
Most of the children had never visited the theater before. “Come to think of it, I haven’t been there either,” said Gianpaolo Ricciarelli, one of the parents who dropped off his son.
Another father, Armando Cereoli, said, “Between video games, cellphones and Netflix, there’s tough competition to get kids interested in beautiful things.”
Some of the children came from disadvantaged neighborhoods, so the visit was “a chance to free their minds and to dream,” said Sara Greci, a scout leader and Red Cross worker who brought four girls from a home for abused women and their children.
The opera house runs several outreach programs for the homeless or people who live in Rome’s most far-flung neighborhoods, a way to open the theater to the city and broaden its reach, said Andrea Bonadio, who was hired by the theater to work on such programs.
Nunzia Nigro, the theater’s director for marketing and education, said that several of the children who had participated in the theater’s educational programs over the past 25 years were loyal patrons today. “We’re beginning to reap some of those efforts, and have a younger public,” she said.
Nigro helped organize the sleepover, tailoring it for 8- to 10-year-olds — old enough to sleep away from home but not old enough to have hormones kick in, she said. As it was, two boys felt homesick enough to get their moms to pick them up.
On Saturday, the children watched part of a rehearsal for an upcoming performance of Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony — “the conductor uses a wand to direct music, not so different from Harry Potter’s but more important,” Nigro said. They learned how the staff cleaned the world’s biggest chandelier in a historic building, and they got to know the ins and outs of the theater via a treasure hunt (read general mayhem) that had them scrambling up and down stairs, flitting in and out of stalls like a multicharacter French farce.
Emma the phantom — Valentina Gargano, a soprano in the opera’s young artists program — made an encore, exacting a promise from the children that they would tell their friends about “this magic place” and come back when they grew up.
One girl had been so convinced that Gargano was a real ghost that the organizers made sure they met when the soprano was in street clothes.
After being serenaded with music, including Brahms’ classic lullaby, the children settled down (or tried to) in a patchwork of sleeping bags on an artificial green lawn used in a previous production of Madama Butterfly. Above them loomed oversize photos of some of the stars who performed at the Costanzi, including Maria Callas, Herbert von Karajan and Rudolf Nureyev.
After breakfast Sunday, the children took part in workshops at which they designed colorful paper ballet costumes, learned basic ballet positions, sang as part of a choir (some more enthusiastically than others) and played an opera-themed version of snakes and ladders. The game was designed and overseen by Giordano Punturo, the opera’s stage manager, done up in a tuxedo and colorful top hat.
He didn’t know about the kids, he said, “but I had the time of my life.”
After a group singalong and photo, it was almost time to head home.
“Did you have fun?” Giambrone asked the kids. “Yes!!” they cheered. “Did you sleep well?” he asked, to a more mixed response. Several “No”s were notably heard. Come back soon, he said.
After hugging his parents who had come to pick him up, Andrea Quadrini, almost 11, couldn’t wait to tell them that his team had won at snakes and ladders, and that the treasure hunt had been especially fun.
“Wow,” he said. “I saw an opera theater for the first time.”

Jeannie Epper, 83, Who Hurtled and Tumbled in Hollywood, Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Her first stunt was riding a horse bareback down a cliff when she was 9. She went on to soar on the hit TV series "Wonder Woman" and in many other places.
Jeannie Epper had at least 100 screen roles, maybe even 150 -- no one is quite sure. But because she was a stunt double, galloping on horseback, crashing cars and kicking down doors for the stars of films and television shows, hers was not a household name.
In her heyday, however, Ms. Epper was ubiquitous. She hurtled through the air most weeks as Lynda Carter's stunt double on the hit television series "Wonder Woman" and mimed Ms. Carter's leggy lope. She tumbled through a scrum of mud and rocks as Kathleen Turner's double in the 1984 comedy-adventure film "Romancing the Stone," which also starred Michael Douglas. She threw punches for Linda Evans in one of her many ballyhooed cat fights with Joan Collins on the frothy long-running 1980s nighttime soap opera "Dynasty."
And, in what she often said was her favorite stunt -- or gag, to use the industry term -- Ms. Epper skidded a Corvette into a 180-degree turn as Shirley MacLaine's character in "Terms of Endearment" (1983), neatly hurling Jack Nicholson's double into the Gulf of Mexico.
Ms. Epper, whose bruising career spanned 70 years, died on Sunday at her home in Simi Valley, Calif. She was 83.
Her daughter, Eurlyne Epper, confirmed the death. She said her mother had been ill for some time and caught an infection during a recent hospital visit.
Ms. Epper was stunt royalty; her father was John Epper, a Swiss-born master horseman who doubled in westerns for Gary Cooper, Randolph Scott and Ronald Reagan. Like her five siblings, Ms. Epper joined the family business.
She was just 9 when she rode a horse bareback down a cliff in her first stunt. Her first film credit, however, as The Hollywood Reporter discovered, was "Cheyenne Autumn," a 1964 western directed by John Ford. And she was a regular on the western series "The Big Valley," which ran on ABC from 1965 to 1969, often doubling for Barbara Stanwyck.
"Wonder Woman," which debuted on ABC in 1976, was a watershed moment not just for Ms. Epper but also for all women in her industry. Despite the work of Ms. Epper and others, stunt doubling had long been mostly a man's game, with men dressing as women to do their stunts -- a practice known as wigging. The series was groundbreaking for featuring a female action hero, as was another ABC series, "Charlie's Angels," that same year.
"Actresses didn't want hairy-legged boys as doubles," Ms. Epper told Variety in 2007. "They wanted pretty girls. It slowly started changing the order of things."
The rangy, 5-foot-9 Ms. Epper was used to the rough and tumble of the brotherhood that accepted her because of her father, and also because she had her own moxie. She was savvy about the sexism of the stunt world, and the movie business.
Zoë Bell, a New Zealand-born actor and stuntwoman whom Ms. Epper mentored, described the advice Ms. Epper gave her when she was putting together her résumé for a job doubling for Uma Thurman in "Kill Bill: Volume 1," Quentin Tarantino's 2003 martial arts splatterfest. (Ms. Bell, a talented gymnast, had been Lucy Lawless's double during every season of "Xena: Warrior Princess," which was shot in New Zealand and ran from 1995 to 2001.)
"She asked me what I weighed," Ms. Bell recalled by phone. "I said '145-ish.' Jeannie, without missing a beat, said 'OK, so put 130. You look 130 and the actresses all lie.' She went on to talk about recognizing a broken system and devising new rules that one feels good about, in order to be able to keep playing the game."
Ms. Epper and Ms. Bell were the joint subjects of "Double Dare," a 2004 documentary directed by Amanda Micheli, which followed Ms. Epper as she hunted for work in her 60s and Ms. Bell, who was in her early 20s, as her career was just taking off.
"Jeannie was up against the inequity of women not getting promoted," Ms. Micheli said. "The working life span of a stunt performer is brief, like a professional athlete's. They're using their bodies, they're hitting the ground every day.
"The best stuntmen go on to become stunt coordinators, or even second-unit directors, which is a powerful role on an action film," she continued. "Jeannie's brother Gary got those opportunities, while she just kept hitting a wall. Instead of getting to call the shots, she was hustling for small jobs here and there, and taking hits well past her prime. I saw the pain that caused her, both figuratively and literally."
In Ms. Epper's youth, there were the usual mishaps. While jumping a horse off a raft in "Mackenna's Gold" (1969), she nearly drowned when the horse floundered and flipped in the water. She was almost knocked out by Pam Grier in the 1974 blaxploitation film "Foxy Brown" when Ms. Grier smashed a painting over her head and sliced open her skull. She caught fire when a stunt went south in an episode of the late-1960s television series "Lancer."
The years of stunts mostly took their toll in torn ligaments and battered joints. Not that she complained.
"Jeannie was bad-ass and a sweetheart," Ms. Bell said. "A lady and one of the boys. A cowgirl and a finishing school graduate. A Christian and one of my favorite people to crack filthy jokes with."
Jean Luann Epper was born on Jan. 27, 1941, in Glendale, Calif., and grew up in North Hollywood. Her father served in the cavalry in his native Switzerland and moved in the 1920s to Hollywood, where he opened a riding academy and trained actors who were appearing in westerns, and also where he married Frances Robertson. He got into the stunt business when he was delivering a horse to a set and ended up doing the stunt himself -- the scene involved jumping the animal over a car. He taught his three girls and three boys how to ride, how to jump and, most important, how to roll and how to fall.
As a young teenager, Jeannie was sent to finishing school for a few years in Switzerland -- she hated it -- and when she returned, she married at just 16, became a mother and went to work.
Her marriages to Wes Fuller, Richard Spaethe and Lee Sanders ended in divorce. In addition to her daughter, who is also a stuntwoman, Ms. Epper is survived by her husband, Tim Kimack; her son, Richard; five grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.
Among her many other credits, Ms. Epper appeared in eight films produced or directed by Steven Spielberg, including "1941," the 1979 slapstick comedy that imagines an alternate reality to what happened in the days after Pearl Harbor. Most of her family was cast in that film, too. In Ms. Micheli's documentary, Mr. Spielberg called the Eppers "the Flying Wallendas of film" and added that in a bar fight scene in "1941," "there were Eppers flying all over the place."
Ms. Epper's last role was not a stunt, exactly. In 2019, at 78, she was cast as a hostage in an episode of the ABC series "The Rookie" that involved being bound, gagged and duct-taped to a chair with a shotgun strapped to her shoulder and pointed at her head.
Debbie Evans, a much-lauded stuntwoman who said she considered Ms. Epper her "stunt mom," drove her to the set. "It was a special day," Ms. Evans recalled. "She was so high and happy."

Full text: I'm a movie critic at The New York Times, reviewing new releases and writing about broader film trends. Perhaps surprisingly, I spend a lot of my free time watching movies for fun, but I'm also culturally omnivorous: I love any art that expands my brain and grabs my imagination. Here are five things I've recently enjoyed watching, reading and listening to.
Ripley
Few things are juicier and more wicked than a new Patricia Highsmith adaptation, and thanks to an assignment to write about all the ways Tom Ripley has been portrayed onscreen, I got to watch the new Netflix series starring Andrew Scott ahead of its release. It's arch and wry and gorgeous and a smart take on the character.
Wiser Than Me
Julia Louis-Dreyfus's podcast just came back for its second season, and I find it so nourishing and delightful (and cheeky, too). She interviews well-known women, all over 70 or so, about their lives, and reflects on lessons she's learned. At the end of each episode, she calls her mother, the poet Judith Bowles, to debrief. It's great.
Playing the Piano 12122020
In the midst of researching for a review of the wonderful documentary "Ryuichi Sakamoto: Opus," I listened to a solo piano concert that Sakamoto performed in December 2011, and now I'm listening to it every day. Calming, intricate, gentle -- just beautiful.
Once Again ... (Statues Never Die)
The piece in the Whitney Biennial that won't leave me is this video installation by Isaac Julien. André Holland, as the Harlem Renaissance critic Alain Locke, and Danny Huston, as the philanthropist Albert Barnes, discuss African art, the ethics of collection and a whole lot more.
Splinters
I inhaled this memoir in two sittings. Leslie Jamison chronicles her life as a newly divorced single mother at the start of the pandemic -- all of which sounds like a bummer. But it's suffused with humor and longing and self-awareness in a way that's rare and, I think, important.

Tension Is This Kitchen's Secret Ingredient: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Looking for some kitchen adrenaline between seasons of "The Bear"? Try the British series "Boiling Point" on Netflix.
A new season of "The Bear" is still a few months out, but if you crave the adrenaline and misery of a fine-dining kitchen in the meantime, "Boiling Point," on Netflix, puts its own tasty spin on similar ingredients.
The show is technically a sequel to the 2021 movie "Boiling Point," a single-shot movie about one catastrophic night at a fancy restaurant. This "Boiling Point," which aired in the U.K. in 2023, picks up months later and includes many of the same characters. Urgent moments from the film surface in flashback, but the show feels like a distinct work, not just an iteration in a franchise. Its characters themselves are figuring out how to make something -- a restaurant, even just one dish, even just one serving of that dish -- that can stand on its own two feet, how to differentiate their work from the output of others.
Our fearless leader is Carly (Vinette Robinson), who runs her kitchen with positivity and support, who believes in both order and praise. She is spread so thin you can see through her, and each passing minute drains her further. Her difficult mother, some rude investors, the squabbling subordinate chefs -- everyone needs something from her. She clenches her fists while she sleeps, scowling with worry even while unconscious.
When we meet her, Carly is giving an energizing pep talk and introducing a new chef around the kitchen. It soon becomes clear that he has overstated his qualifications, and things start falling apart. By the end of the night, the social structure of the staff is shattered, and catastrophe and chaos spiral from there for the subsequent four episodes. Nothing seems to go right, so much so that both the audience and the characters start to wonder: Has anything ever gone right?
"Boiling Point" is festive with its dishes, and the ensemble chemistry is top-notch. Its real feat, though, is its sense of strength and failure. Carly and her staff are obviously capable, but it's never enough. Stress motivates and destroys all the characters here, driving them to addiction, self-harm and exhaustion, but they also come back hungry for more striving, eager for more struggle. One must imagine Sisyphus saying "yes, chef."

Full text: CBS and other well-known properties would be sold if Sony and Apollo were able to buy Paramount. But the new owners would keep the movie studio.
Shari Redstone helped build Paramount Global into a media empire, but if Sony Pictures Entertainment and the private-equity giant Apollo Global Management succeed in acquiring it, they plan to break it all up, according to three people familiar with the matter.
The plan would include auctioning off CBS, cable channels like MTV and the Paramount Plus streaming service, said the people, who asked not to be identified sharing private details. Paramount Pictures -- home to blockbusters like "The Godfather," "Top Gun" and the "Mission: Impossible" franchise -- would be combined with Sony's business.
Sony and Apollo, which made a nonbinding expression of interest in acquiring Paramount for $ 26 billion last week, are also likely to keep Paramount's library of films and TV shows and the rights to well-known characters, including the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and SpongeBob SquarePants. They have not yet outlined this plan to Paramount or its advisers.
A breakup of Paramount would represent a major changing of the guard in the entertainment industry. CBS and Paramount have been controlled by the Redstone family for decades, since the media mogul Sumner Redstone assembled the conglomerate in a series of audacious deals. His daughter, Ms. Redstone, championed a 2019 deal to reunite it, and she remains Paramount's controlling shareholder.
Sony and Apollo are now engaging with Paramount's financial advisers on next steps in their proposal, the people said. The two companies have not yet signed formal nondisclosure agreements or begun due diligence reviews, a process that could take weeks.
Though it's still early, the two bidders have already begun to envision how a deal for Paramount could unfold. The two would likely operate the company as a joint venture controlled by Sony, with a minority stake owned by Apollo, the people said. Sony would look to combine the marketing and distribution functions of the Paramount movie studio with its own operations, and divest the rest of the properties.
Over time, Apollo could sell its stake in the joint venture back to Sony or to another buyer. It's not yet clear just how large a stake Apollo would hold in the business, though the company plans to invest billions in the deal, one person said.
A breakup of Paramount is not a preferred outcome for Ms. Redstone, who would prefer the company to pass on to another buyer intact, a person familiar with her thinking said. But it wouldn't necessarily be a dealbreaker if the offer was compelling, the person said.
There are other suitors. Skydance, a media company founded by the tech scion David Ellison, has been in discussions with Paramount for months about a potential deal. Exclusive negotiations between Skydance and Paramount lapsed last week, shortly after Sony and Apollo put in their expression of interest. But Skydance remains interested.
Sony and Paramount have different approaches to the entertainment business, and a deal would probably result in a U-turn for Paramount. Unlike Paramount, which streams its content on Paramount+, Sony licenses its movies and TV shows to companies like Netflix and Disney. Sony would probably not change that approach in a deal with Paramount and would most likely look to combine Paramount+ with a rival service, such as Comcast's Peacock or Warner Bros. Discovery's Max.
Sony has long pursued Paramount's movie studio. Several years ago, Sony executives reached out to Paramount to see if the company would be willing to sell Paramount Pictures or merge it into a joint venture, but Paramount signaled it was interested only in a deal for the whole company. So when Apollo made a bid for all of Paramount this year, Sony decided to team up.
Any deal by Sony would face regulatory hurdles. Regulations restrict foreign owners from holding licenses for U.S. broadcast stations, which could prevent Sony -- which is owned by the Japanese-based Sony Group -- from owning CBS-affiliated TV stations. But they could divest the stations immediately, or have Apollo apply for the license. They are also considering other options for the stations.
The deal would also most likely require clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the panel in Washington that scrutinizes acquisitions by foreign owners.
Sony and Apollo believe that when they decide to sell the Paramount assets, there could be many logical buyers, the three sources said. Warner Bros. Discovery, which does not own a broadcast network, could be a suitor for CBS. TV station groups like Nexstar and Tegna could be logical buyers for CBS's owned and operated TV stations.
The hardest asset to sell would most likely be Paramount's cable networks, like MTV and Nickelodeon, but those could be sold to a TV programmer looking for greater scale in negotiations with cable companies like Charter and Comcast.

Tense U.S.C. Splinters Its Main Commencement Into Smaller Ceremonies: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A Netflix star will not speak at a ceremony. Security is high. And some professors are pushing for the valedictorian, whose speech was canceled, to give an address.
Few West Coast universities rival the pomp of the University of Southern California's commencements. Flags fly. Trumpets blare. Tens of thousands of relatives from around the world fill the Los Angeles campus, cheering for newly minted alumni. There are catered luncheons under chandeliers and Very Important Speakers: Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, took the stage last year to the "Avengers" theme song before delivering the commencement address.
This week, however, the pageantry has been sorely tested, barraged by weeks of campus protest and controversy. The Class of 2024 will have no grand main-stage commencement, no Hollywood executive dispensing wisdom to graduates from across the university.
While smaller celebrations will go on at the university's 23 schools and academic units, at least two keynote speakers have publicly withdrawn from the school of education's commencement, and others have quietly pulled out at the last minute.
The school of dramatic arts confirmed Monday that Liza Colón-Zayas, who plays Tina on the FX series "The Bear," "is no longer able to join us." The actor Jaren Lewison, of the Netflix series "Never Have I Ever," withdrew this week from his commitment to address thousands of graduates at two large commencements for the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, the school confirmed Wednesday. Two of three speakers at the engineering school's ceremony disappeared abruptly from the school's graduation website.
The verdant campus -- ordinarily covered with rows of folding chairs at this time of year, as if for a mass wedding -- has been closed to noncredentialed visitors behind a system of T.S.A.-like checkpoints. Movement will be tightly controlled at commencement. Families of graduates will need special digital tickets to move among venues. Bags will be searched and banners, beach umbrellas, selfie sticks and other equipment that might be repurposed for political protest will be confiscated.
A hastily arranged party at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will offer some semblance of the usual grandeur, but just how many of the 18,000 graduates and their relatives will attend the weeknight event is unclear.
"Some of my friends say they're just going to go and boo the administration," said Ella Blain, 23, who blamed senior university leaders for upending her graduation from the School of Dramatic Arts. A self-described "fourth-generation Trojan" from Pasadena, Ms. Blain, who has spent much of her life imagining her own U.S.C. commencement, called this year's graduation "a joke."
As student protests over Israel's war in Gaza collide with commencements around the country, universities are scrambling to preserve some shred of the time-honored rite of passage. In this globally conflicted moment, that aspiration is turning out to be a tall order: a ceremony that somehow honors a sea of capped-and-gowned young people and thousands of their loved ones without violating free speech, stifling jubilation or enabling rogue protests.
At some schools, that challenge has been daunting. Last weekend, demonstrators disrupted ceremonies at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Indiana University at Bloomington and Northeastern University in Boston.
Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, dropped out as the University of Vermont's commencement speaker under pressure from student groups that objected to the Biden administration's support of Israel. Arizona's public universities ramped up security and barricaded fields in advance of this week's ceremonies. On Monday, Columbia University canceled its main commencement ceremony, leaving only smaller, individual school events.
At U.S.C., where commencement ceremonies are set to begin on Wednesday, university leaders are straining to hold the school's renowned graduation together amid backlash to a series of moves that were aimed, paradoxically, at heading off potential conflict and unrest.
In mid-April, U.S.C. canceled the speech by its valedictorian, Asna Tabassum, after pro-Israel groups complained about a pro-Palestinian link on her social media bio. Four days later, the university announced that it was "redesigning the commencement" and canceled its keynote speech by an alumnus, Jon M. Chu, the director of "Crazy Rich Asians."
"The provost at U.S.C. called me at work," said Marcia McNutt, the president of the National Academy of Sciences, who had been slated to receive an honorary degree. "They just said that, given all the turmoil, they thought it was best to postpone the honorary degrees, and I said I completely agreed."
The decision only escalated the uproar. Pro-Palestinian students tried to set up an encampment on campus days later, and university officials summoned the Los Angeles police. The ensuing demonstration ended in the arrest of 93 people, of whom more than a third were unaffiliated with the campus. The university announced the next day that it was canceling its main commencement entirely.
Since then, U.S.C. has struggled to manage the fallout.
"This has just been a train wreck," said Ms. Blain's mother, Annette Ricchiazzi, 52, a U.S.C. alumna and former university employee, referring to the university leadership's "inconsistent and confusing" handling of the cancellations and protests. "Many parents are disgusted and up in arms."
In messages to the campus, President Carol Folt has underscored the university's respect for free speech and its responsibility to protect students. Missives have alternately announced that protesters would be referred for disciplinary action and that plans for some 47 satellite commencement ceremonies are "in full swing."
And normalcy has prevailed, in some corners of the 47,000-student campus.
A representative of the actor Sean Penn -- known for his progressive stances on international issues -- confirmed that he remained on track to address graduates of the pharmacy school, which worked with Community Organized Relief Effort, a nonprofit that he co-founded, to distribute Covid-19 vaccinations at Dodger Stadium during the pandemic.
Justice Goodwin Liu of the California Supreme Court, who is one of the state's best-known liberal jurists, remained committed to delivering the keynote address at the law school, according to Merrill Balassone, a spokeswoman.
Phil Chan, co-founder of Final Bow for Yellowface, an organization that pushes to eliminate demeaning depictions of Asians in ballet, said that he would keep his commitment to the school of dance to promote his message of inclusion.
And yet, he acknowledged, "it's a very uncomfortable position to be in."
By contrast, the writers C Pam Zhang and Safiya Umoja Noble, a MacArthur fellow, dropped out as keynote speakers for the commencement ceremonies at the Rossier School of Education -- citing the invitation of police to campus, the arrest of dozens of protesters, and the decision to censor Ms. Tabassum. And Mr. Lewison, who is Jewish, postponed his engagement as the keynote for two Dornsife College commencements. The college said Wednesday that the new speaker would be Jane Coaston, a libertarian fellow with U.S.C.'s Center for the Political Future and a contributing writer to The New York Times.
At the engineering school, where Ms. Tabassum, the valedictorian, will be graduating, professors were trying to resurrect her chance to speak.
A resolution by the executive council of the engineering school's faculty asked that she address its commencement ceremony. The school's dean, Yannis C. Yortsos, did not respond to questions about whether the request would be approved.
And a petition, signed by 400 professors and expected to be discussed by the faculty Senate on Wednesday, demands that the university apologize to Ms. Tabassum and also calls for the censure of both Dr. Folt and the university provost.
Adding to the drama: the engineering school's website is no longer listing two previously announced graduation speakers: Kevin Crawford Knight, chief scientist for the ride-hailing company Didi Global, and Zohreh Khademi, a Microsoft executive. A spokesman for the school did not respond to questions about whether Ms. Khademi and Mr. Knight had withdrawn, and neither of them could be reached for comment.
A university committee had picked Ms. Tabassum, who is Muslim and of South Asian ancestry, from about 100 undergraduates with near 4.0 grade point averages. Her selection as graduation speaker sparked a bitter backlash from several pro-Israel groups. who objected to a pro-Palestinian site that she had linked to in a social media account.
Citing threats of a "disruption," the university canceled the valedictory speech, a campus tradition.
Ms. Tabassum, who grew up east of Los Angeles in suburban San Bernardino County, said in a statement that she was "profoundly disappointed" and questioned the school's motivation. She now faces harassment. An organization called Accuracy in Media, known for doxxing students, put up a web page calling her U.S.C.s "leading antisemite."
Hossein Hashemi, a professor of engineering, said that Ms. Tabassum, an aspiring physician, is widely respected by faculty. "At this point, she probably wishes she was not even elected as valedictorian," said Dr. Hashemi, who is leading a campaign on her behalf.
Not all the pomp has been lost. The last-minute party being thrown by the school on Thursday night will include the Trojan Marching Band, fireworks and drone shows.
"Not going to lie, it sounds like a cool event," said Dustin Jeffords, 37, who will receive a master's degree in communications management. He, his wife, his parents, his in-laws and two siblings are planning to be there.
Still, he said, having come to college late, after military service, he had been especially excited about the big U.S.C. commencement, with its bells and whistles, given the sacrifice that earned it.
"As great as these convocation ceremonies are, the big one with the pomp and circumstance is such a big deal and something I was looking forward to," he said. "To have the finish line disappear in front of your eyes is disappointing."

Disney Reports Strong Earnings, But Sees Signs of Bumps Ahead: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In a surprise, Disney+ made money for the first time in the latest quarter, but the company said it expected a slowdown in its parks division.
Disney reported strong earnings on Tuesday, driven in part by a surprise profit at its flagship streaming service -- a first. But investors responded nervously to a coming slowdown at Disney theme parks, which have recently been the company's primary growth engine.
Disney shares fell more than 9 percent, to about $ 105, by the close of trading.
Revenue at Disney Experiences, a division that includes theme parks and cruise ships, totaled $ 8.4 billion, a 10 percent year-on-year increase. Operating income totaled $ 2.3 billion, up 12 percent. Wall Street, however, had hoped for stronger profit margins. In addition, Disney said higher wages, expenses tied to the arrival of two new cruise liners and -- crucially -- a general slowdown in travel would negatively affect the coming quarter.
"We are seeing some evidence of a global moderation from peak post-Covid travel," Hugh Johnston, the chief financial officer of Disney, said on a conference call with analysts.
Disney+ had been expected to lose more than $ 100 million in the most recent quarter, widening losses since its 2019 arrival to roughly $ 12 billion. Instead, it swung to a $ 47 million profit, in part by adding 6.3 million subscriptions worldwide (excluding India), to bring its total to 117.6 million. Average revenue per paid subscriber climbed 6 percent, to $ 7.28.
Investors, however, did not like what Mr. Johnston had to say about streaming in the coming quarter -- namely that Disney+ was not expected to add subscribers and that it would again lose money, a result of programming expenses at Disney+ Hotstar, a low-price streaming service in India.
Subscriptions to Hulu, which Disney also owns, were largely flat (50 million), while the company's sports-oriented streaming service, ESPN+, shed a few hundred thousand subscriptions to end the quarter with 24.8 million. Together, Disney's three streaming services lost $ 18 million, an improvement from $ 659 million a year earlier.
Mr. Johnston said Disney's streaming portfolio was on track to turn a profit as a whole by September.
By the end of the year, Disney said, limited ESPN programming will be added to Disney+ for the first time. Disney called the addition of an ESPN "tile" a step toward bringing the sports giant's full heft to the service in the future.
Disney's per-share earnings for the most recent quarter rose 30 percent from a year earlier. Revenue inched up 1 percent, to $ 22.1 billion. (Mr. Johnston announced that adjusted per-share earnings for the year would rise 25 percent, up from a previous forecast of 20 percent.)
Disney beat analyst expectations for per-share earnings by 10 percent. The company matched expectations for revenue.
Traditional television, with fewer people paying for cable hookups, continued its downward trajectory. Revenue at Disney's entertainment networks, which include ABC, FX and National Geographic, declined 8 percent, while operating income plunged 22 percent. Advertising growth at ESPN contributed to a 2 percent increase in revenue and helped limit a decline in operating income to 2 percent.
Disney last reported earnings in February, pairing strong results with a blizzard of announcements about future entertainment offerings. A "Moana" sequel. A partnership with Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite. A timeline for the rollout of a flagship ESPN streaming service that integrates sports programming with ESPN's fantasy platforms and ESPN Bet.
At the time, multiple activist investors, including Nelson Peltz, were running proxy campaigns for board seats. While the activists had sharply different views on how Disney should be managed -- one wanted "Netflix-like margins" of up to 20 percent in streaming, another floated splitting up the company -- they expressed the same basic motivation: Disney's stock price was not high enough.
Disney shares have been trading at about $ 117, up from $ 85 six months ago. But the stock was priced at about $ 197 three years ago.
Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, ultimately defeated them. But Mr. Peltz told CNBC that he would "watch and wait" to see if Disney delivered on growth and succession promises. If it didn't, he said, "you'll see me again."

Pick an Exercise Option: Morning, Noon or Night: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's an age-old question. But a few recent studies have brought us closer to an answer.
What is the best time of day to exercise?
It's a straightforward question with a frustrating number of answers, based on research results that can be downright contradictory.
The latest piece of evidence came last month from a group of Australian researchers, who argued that evening was the healthiest time to break a sweat, at least for those who are overweight. Their study looked at 30,000 middle-aged people with obesity and found that evening exercisers were 28 percent less likely to die of any cause than those who worked out in the morning or afternoon.
"We were surprised by the gap," said Angelo Sabag, an exercise physiologist at the University of Sydney who led the study. The team expected to see a benefit from evening workouts, but "we didn't think the risk reduction would be as pronounced as it was."
So does that mean that evening swimmers and night runners had the right idea all along?
"It's not settled," said Juleen Zierath, a physiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. "It's an emerging area of research. We haven't done all the experiments. We're learning a lot every month."
No single study can dictate when you should exercise. For many people, the choice comes down to fitness goals, work schedules and plain old preferences. That said, certain times of day may offer slight advantages, depending on what you hope to achieve.
The case for morning exercise
According to a 2022 study, morning exercise may be especially beneficial for heart health. It may also lead to better sleep.
And when it comes to weight loss, there have been good arguments made for morning workouts. Last year, a study published in the journal Obesity found that people who exercised between the hours of 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. had a lower body mass index than counterparts who exercised in the afternoon or at night, though it did not track them over time, unlike the Australian study, which followed participants for an average of eight years.
Of course, the biggest argument for morning exercise may be purely practical. "For a lot of people, the morning is more convenient," said Shawn Youngstedt, an exercise science professor at Arizona State University. Even if rising early to work out can be challenging at first, morning exercise won't get in the way of Zoom meetings, play dates or your latest Netflix binge.
The case for afternoon exercise
A few small studies suggest that the best workout time, at least for elite athletes, might be the least convenient for many of us.
Body temperature, which is lower in the morning but peaks in late afternoon, plays a role in athletic performance. Several recent small studies with competitive athletes suggest that lower body temperature reduces performance (though warm-ups exercises help counter that) and afternoon workouts help them play better and sleep longer.
If you have the luxury of ample time, one small New Zealand study found that it can help to nap first. As far as the rest of us are concerned, a Chinese study of 92,000 people found that the best time to exercise for your heart was between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m.
"The main difference is our population," Dr. Sabag said. While his study was restricted to obese people, the Chinese study was not. "Individuals with obesity may be more sensitive to the time-of-day effects of exercise," he said.
The case for evening exercise
This latest study may not settle the debate, but it certainly suggests that those struggling with obesity might benefit from a later workout.
Exercise makes insulin more effective at lowering blood sugar levels, which in turn fends off weight gain and Type 2 diabetes, a common and devastating consequence of obesity.
"In the evening, you are most insulin resistant," Dr. Sabag said. "So if you can compensate for that natural change in insulin sensitivity by doing exercise," he explained, you can lower your blood glucose levels, and thus help keep diabetes and cardiovascular disease at bay.
One persistent concern about evening exercise is that vigorous activity can disturb sleep. However, some experts have argued that these concerns have been overstated.
The case that it may not matter
While many of these studies are fascinating, none of them is definitive. For one thing, most are simply showing a correlation between exercise times and health benefits, not identifying them as the cause.
"The definitive study would be to actually randomize people to different times," Dr. Youngstedt said, which would be phenomenally expensive and difficult for academics.
One thing public health experts do agree on is that most Americans are far too sedentary. And that any movement is good movement.
"Whenever you can exercise," Dr. Sabag urged. "That is the answer."
In a recent edition of his newsletter that discussed the Australian study, Arnold Schwarzenegger -- bodybuilder, actor, former governor -- seemed to agree. He cited a 2023 study suggesting that there really isn't any difference in outcomes based on which time of day you exercise. In which case, it's all about what works best for you.
"I will continue to train in the morning," the former Mr. Universe wrote. "It's automatic for me."
Alexander Nazaryan is a science and culture writer who prefers to run in the early evening.

'Baby Reindeer' Is All in the Ending: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The Netflix stalker series combines the appeal of a twisty thriller with a deep sense of empathy. The conclusion illustrates why it's become one of the most-discussed shows of the year.
This article includes spoilers for all of "Baby Reindeer."
The mini-series "Baby Reindeer" arrived on Netflix on April 11 without much advance hype, but it quickly became one of the most talked-about TV shows of 2024.
It's not hard to understand why. Based on the Scottish comedian Richard Gadd's award-winning 2019 one-man stage show, "Baby Reindeer" baits its hook in the first episode, which introduces Martha (Jessica Gunning), an emotionally fragile middle-aged woman who appreciates the kindness shown to her by Donny (Gadd), a struggling stand-up comic who offers her a free drink in the pub where he works.
By the end of that first episode, Martha's neediness has begun to shade into creepiness. And by the time Donny discovers that his new friend has a history of stalking, she's already begun what will eventually become a torrent of abuse, as she floods his email and social media with poorly spelled messages that insult his character and sometimes threaten sexual violence.
What makes "Baby Reindeer" so effective is that as Martha pushes further and further into Donny's personal life -- attending his comedy shows, befriending his landlady, calling his parents -- the audience shares his mounting feelings of powerlessness and frustration, cut with flashes of pity for the woman who is ruining his life. The show has the "slow-motion train wreck" appeal of a twisty true-crime documentary, but balanced with empathy for two profoundly broken people.
A story as dark and uneasy as this one needs a proper ending, though. "Baby Reindeer" has one that is satisfying in its particulars, if haunting in its implications.
Gadd (who wrote every episode) plants the seeds for the finale in the penultimate episode, the sixth, which ends with Donny having a career-altering meltdown while competing in a stand-up comedy contest. Donny's comic style is highly conceptual, involving corny props and awkward jokes, designed to leave his audience wondering whether or not they're meant to laugh. He's like a Scottish (and much less effective) version of Steve Martin in his "Wild and Crazy Guy" days. (Or, as Donny puts it: "I'm a comedian when they laugh, a performance artist when they don't.")
When the crowd can't get on his wavelength at the competition, Donny ditches his props and just talks, sharing with a stunned audience the story that we have been watching for the previous five episodes. He tells them about how when he was a young and inexperienced comedian, he took an unpaid gig working for Darrien O'Connor (Tom Goodman-Hill), a well-respected TV writer who repeatedly drugged and sexually assaulted him. He tells them about his transgender girlfriend, Teri (Nava Mau), whom he's too embarrassed to kiss in public.
And, of course, he tells them about Martha, the angel and the devil on his shoulders: sometimes telling him how sweet, funny and handsome he is, and sometimes calling him a weak-willed, talentless degenerate.
As the show's seventh and final episode opens, a video of Donny's train-wreck performance has landed on YouTube (under the title "Comedian Has Epic Breakdown"), bringing him viral fame and new opportunities. The pressure of that higher profile -- coupled with Martha's ceaseless string of threatening voice mail messages -- prompts Donny to confide in his unexpectedly sympathetic parents about being raped. All of these confessions feel liberating.
Not too long after, one of Martha's threats is dire enough to get her arrested -- and eventually jailed. Gadd brings the conflict between Donny and Martha to a logical conclusion, with Martha finally acknowledging the harm she's done by pleading guilty.
So Donny lives happily ... but not for ever after. More like for a day or two.
The unsettling ambiguities of the "Baby Reindeer" epilogue -- the real ending, which comes after Martha is safely locked away -- are a big part of what has made the show a word-of-mouth hit.
First, Donny finds himself going back over Martha's old messages, and turning every one of their past interactions into pieces of a puzzle that he then pins up on his wall -- like a detective trying to crack a complicated case. His inquiry even leads him back to the doorstep of the man who molested him, where Donny falls into an old pattern of deference and eagerness to please.
Then, in the series's knockout closing scene, a bartender gives a teary-eyed Donny a free drink, echoing what Donny once did for Martha. What makes Donny so upset? Take your pick: He's still processing what Martha and Darrien have done to him. He's furious with himself for not standing up to his abuser. He attained the fame he always craved and found that it didn't solve his problems.
The final trigger comes when, as he listens to one of Martha's old messages, he hears her explain that she always calls him "reindeer" because he reminds her of the stuffed toy that comforted her during a rough childhood. For a moment, this former terrifying nuisance goes back to being a person worthy of understanding and even grace. Or maybe, again, it's actually empathy: Donny ending the story in the same state in which he first encountered Martha makes manifest the bond between them.
Part of the global popularity of "Baby Reindeer" is no doubt a result of the web sleuth dimension -- the online rush to identify the real figures behind Martha and Darrien. Gadd has discouraged such speculation, and innocent people have been accused.
But much of the show's distinctive appeal comes from how, at a time when trauma narratives almost have become cliché in high-end TV drama, "Baby Reindeer" presents a more nuanced version of one. It authentically depicts trauma and mental illness as confusing, unpredictable and deeply personal, all of which is underscored by the emotional ambivalence of its conclusion.
"Baby Reindeer" relies a lot on its subjective point of view. Donny's voice-over narration dominates every episode, recounting in vivid detail his disgust with himself. The series's two directors, Weronika Tofilska and Josephine Bornebusch, often keep the camera trained on Donny's face, capturing his feelings of disorientation as even his best moments are disrupted by Martha's constant intrusions. Viewers are drawn deep into Donny's neuroses, which include, he and we begin to understand, an addiction to being the object of one woman's obsession.
But while this show holds close to Donny's perspective, in a way it also sees the world through Martha's eyes -- or at least to the extent that Donny identifies with her. She's out of his life by the end of the finale, but he still has to live with that part of himself that feels exactly how she feels.
Throughout "Baby Reindeer," Donny struggles to explain why he's not more proactive when it comes to Martha. Why doesn't he warn his friends about her? Why does he take so long to get the police involved? Why doesn't he freeze her out the first time she turns weird?
The answer is that, on some level, he gets it. He too is lost, lonely and awkward much of the time. That's why there is no real triumph in besting Martha. For Donny, it's like defeating himself -- something he already does nearly every day.

Physics as a Portal to Regret and Desire: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In this new Apple TV+ techno-thriller, a portal to parallel realities allows people to visit new worlds and revisit their own past decisions.
In the new series "Dark Matter," a physics professor (Joel Edgerton) is abducted off the streets of Chicago and replaced by an alternative version of himself. This version, instead of toiling away teaching distracted undergrads, is a prize-winning scientist who, among his various accomplishments, has invented a box that can superposition people into parallel worlds.
This alternative Jason, despite his riches and renown in his own universe, covets the humbler Jason's life and family -- his loving wife (Jennifer Connelly) and son (Oakes Fegley). So he steals them, leaving the original Jason to negotiate a limbo of parallel realities, hopping from one to another as he tries to find his way home, like a sci-fi Odysseus.
"Dark Matter," which premieres May 8 on Apple TV+, was created by Blake Crouch, adapting his own 2016 novel of the same title. The series is part thriller, part family drama and part physics primer, enlisting heady concepts like quantum mechanics, superposition and, well, dark matter, to tell a story about longing, regret and desire.
It is the latest project to depict physics as a vital, fraught and even sexy subject, joining the Oscar giant biopic "Oppenheimer" and the Netflix alien invasion series "3 Body Problem," which is named for a classical mechanics problem. In these stories, physicists wrestle with matters of life and death that, as in reality, are intertwined with matters of love.
They're human tales about human dilemmas. But they're also happy to throw some science into the equation.
"More than anything, Blake and I wanted people to be excited in every episode, learn something in every episode, but also maybe cry in every episode," Jacquelyn Ben-Zekry said in a video interview. She is a writer and producer on the series and has been Crouch's developmental story editor since the publication of his 2012 novel "Pines" -- she is also married to him.
"We wanted you to feel something in every episode," she continued. "At the end of the day, it's the story of a man who loves his wife and child. Everything else is just about making it interesting and exciting, and giving us something to talk about."
And yet, that man is a physicist; in the first episode of "Dark Matter" we see Jason try to explain the quantum superposition experiment of Schrödinger's cat, which bears directly on the plot, to a classroom full of largely uninterested students. The heroes of "Oppenheimer," chiefly the title character, and "3 Body Problem," about a team of Oxford-trained friends tasked with saving the world, are also physicists. (So are the socially befuddled young brainiacs of "The Big Bang Theory," the hit sitcom that spawned a prequel, "Young Sheldon," though the science took a back seat to high jinks and catchphrases.)
These series and movies go into technical specifics to varying degrees. "Dark Matter" dangles its central concepts enough to help make the Jasons' world-jumping seem at least somewhat plausible and to bring some science to the science fiction.
The series is a techno-thriller, a subgenre popularized by authors like Michael Crichton ("Jurassic Park"), whom Crouch cites as a major influence. It is also a cautionary sci-fi tale, the kind with roots digging down to the origins of the genre, including Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" (1818). These are tales of ambition -- and often transgression -- about the consequences of meddling with the forces of nature. "Oppenheimer," a historical drama, deals directly with these consequences, asking what it might have felt like to unleash the apocalyptic powers of the atomic bomb (and explaining the concept of fission along the way).
Crouch, best known on TV for the short-lived sci-fi thriller "Wayward Pines" (which was based on his trilogy of novels), is definitely not a physicist. As an English major at the University of North Carolina, he studied geology to fulfill his science requirement.
"Rocks seemed safe, so I did rocks," he said in a video interview. But he was also a big fan of science fiction, particularly Crichton. "He didn't invent the techno-thriller, but he made it fun," he said. "A lot of people think 'Jurassic Park' is just schlocky pulp fiction, but it's really amazing that he wrote a book about dinosaurs and chaos theory. It's in the weeds on some of that stuff."
Crouch is pretty comfortable wading in the weeds. He's enamored of the physicist Aaron O'Connell, and his experiments in superposition. In layman's terms, superposition refers to the ability of a quantum system to be in multiple different states simultaneously until it is measured. (In the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, a cat in a box is both is alive and dead at the same time, in a quantum theoretical sense.) While writing "Dark Matter," Crouch also consulted with the astrophysicist Clifford V. Johnson, a professor at the University of Southern California who, according to his official bio, is "mainly concerned with the development of theoretical tools for the description of the basic fabric of nature."
But for the purposes of the series, as Ben-Zekry put it, "You have to tell a propulsive story. Nobody cares about your science and how smart you are if they're not entertained and if they're not excited."
Viewers might recognize "Dark Matter" as a variation on the multiverse story, made popular in recent years by Oscar winners including "Everything Everywhere All At Once" and "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse" (and its sequels). It is a popular conceit in the fantasy franchise world, and a useful way to expand those franchise's storytelling universes. But for Edgerton, the appeal of "Dark Matter" lies largely in the ordinariness of the characters, the fact that they're dealing with everyday concerns like life-work balance and raising a family.
"It's a parallel universe narrative for the average family," Edgerton said in a video interview alongside Connolly. "Rather than going outward into the galaxies and trying to go through wormholes, it becomes a show that looks more inward."
The defining question behind "Dark Matter" can be summed up by the title of the first episode: "Are You Happy in Your Life?" "It has its own suburban kind of esoteric, pensive pondering about it that I think is superhuman rather than supernatural," Edgerton said.
And if you learn a little about a subject that gave you fits in high school, Connolly said, that's great, too. "I think science is exciting personally," she said. "If people take that away from it, good. Science is super captivating and sexy."
While acknowledging their imperative to entertain, Crouch and Ben-Zekry also see a higher purpose in putting science front and center, especially in an age when the very concept of facts is increasingly under attack.
"I hope shows like these will go a long way toward uniting thought and reminding people that we're all in this together," Ben-Zekry said. "That you don't have to believe the same things as me, but science can at least give us some objective reality."
As Crouch sees it, the current climate is enough to make one feel like they've tumbled into an alternative reality. Just like Jason.
"Especially post-2016, it feels like we all slipped into another dimension, with this notion of fake news and the question of what is real anymore," he said. "There's a destruction of truth and reality. I think we all still want to understand what reality is."

Peloton's C.E.O. Is Leaving Amid Planned Layoffs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Barry McCarthy took over as C.E.O. in February 2022 to revive Peloton from its late-pandemic slump, but the company has struggled to become profitable.
Peloton said on Thursday that its chief executive, Barry McCarthy, was stepping down and that it would lay off more workers, as it continued to struggle in the fitness market.
The connected-fitness company announced disappointing quarterly earnings on Thursday, with revenue down 4 percent from last year. The company, which has not turned a profit since December 2020, is also looking to refinance more than $ 1 billion in debt.
Peloton had a spectacular rise at the start of the pandemic, when gyms and fitness centers closed and consumers were hungry for at-home workout options. But after gyms reopened, Peloton began to face stiffer competition from companies like Bowflex and Lululemon.
It is reducing its head count by 15 percent, or 400 workers, in an effort to cut its costs by $ 200 million by June 2025. Peloton has had several other rounds of job cuts in the past couple of years, most recently in October 2022, when it laid off about 12 percent of employees, or about 500 people.
"Hard as the decision has been to make additional head count cuts, Peloton simply had no other way to bring its spending in line with its revenue," Mr. McCarthy said in a statement.
Investors appeared optimistic about the news; Peloton's stock price rose about 9 percent in premarket trading.
The company said it was looking to reduce its retail footprint and instead invest in "software, hardware and content portfolio and in improvements" for paying subscribers.
Mr. McCarthy, a former Spotify and Netflix executive, joined Peloton in February 2022, taking over from the company's founder, John Foley. Two board members, Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo, will serve as interim co-chief executives.

Breakfast, However Sweet, Was Never This Exciting: [Review]

Full text: Starring Jerry Seinfeld in his feature directing debut, "Unfrosted: The Pop-Tarts Story" is the only corporate saga whose main ingredient is high-fructose sarcasm.
Pop-Tarts were invented over four hectic months in 1964. Jerry Seinfeld has been developing jokes about them for over 10 years, first in his stand-up act, and now as a full-fledged, fully ridiculous feature comedy targeted to the audience's sweet-and-salty dopamine receptors. "Unfrosted," directed by Seinfeld with a script by him and longtime collaborators Spike Feresten, Andy Robin and Barry Marder, gives the comic his first-ever live action leading film role as Bob Cabana, a fictional cereal flack who revolutionizes the breakfast industry. (William Post, the real-life person who helped create Pop-Tarts, died in February at the age of 96.) Cinema has endured branded biopics on everything from Air Jordans to the BlackBerry to Flamin' Hot Cheetos. This is the only corporate saga whose main ingredient is high-fructose sarcasm.
Should we care about the history of the Pop-Tart? Seinfeld postures that the Kellogg's launch of a mylar-wrapped, shelf-stable, heatable pastry is a technological innovation on the scale of the space race and the Manhattan Project. One pivotal move comes when Cabana hires Donna Stankowski (Melissa McCarthy) away from NASA's beakers of Tang. As the launch date nears, the cinematographer William Pope shoots close-ups of scorching toaster springs with the drama of a roiling booster rocket.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The film is as estranged from the facts as Pop-Tarts are from genuine fruit. Still, it's true that Battle Creek, Mich. -- "cereal's Silicon Valley," Seinfeld once cracked -- was ground zero of a Cold War rivalry between Kellogg's and General Foods to sell a breakfast that broke free from the need for a bowl and spoon. Here, the General Foods' owner Marjorie Post (Amy Schumer), once the richest woman in America, swans about in jewel-toned turbans and jets off to Moscow to enlist Nikita Khrushchev (Dean Norris) in her cause. At the same time, the dimwitted head of Kellogg's (Jim Gaffigan) allows his company to align with President John F. Kennedy (Bill Burr), Chef Boy Ardee (Bobby Moynihan), the celebrity fitness guru Jack LaLanne (James Marsden), and the early computer Univac who acts up in ways that recall Bing's sexually charged A.I. chatbot. Things take an even darker turn with the entrance of a vengeful milkman (Christian Slater) and a threatening figure named El Sucre (Felix Solis) who's aware that millions of dollars hinge on access to his addictive white powder.
As junk food goes, "Unfrosted" is delightful with a sprinkle of morbidity. Building on last December's publicity stunt where an anthropomorphic Pop-Tart cooked and served itself to the Kansas State Wildcats, we're here treated to a funeral where the deceased is given Full Cereal Honors. I will spoil nothing except to say Snap, Crackle and Pop have a ceremonial duty.
The jokes spill forth so fast that there's no time for the shtick to get soggy. Yet, the film also crams its running time with goofy detours, like a subplot where the voice of Tony the Tiger (Hugh Grant, once again seizing any opportunity to wear a fatuous cravat) leads his fellow mascots in a rebellion. Despite all these famous faces splashing into the frame, the scene stealer is the child actor Eleanor Sweeney making her debut as an opinionated taste tester. She's g-r-r-reat.
Unfrosted
Rated PG-13 for some suggestive references and language. Running time: 1 hour 33 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

Universal Music Group Exceeds Earnings Forecast
Universal Music Group on Thursday reported first-quarter earnings that comfortably beat expectations, helped by the record-breaking success of its star act Taylor Swift.
UMG executive were also upbeat about the label's new deal with TikTok, also announced on Thursday, which settled a dispute over artist pay and helped address wider artificial intelligence concerns in the industry.
UMG, the world's biggest music label, posted adjusted core earnings of 591 million euros ( $ 632.6 million), up 15.9 percent year-on-year and above the 567 million euros expected by analysts in a Visible Alpha consensus shared by the company.
Swift's commercial success has boosted the group's earnings through royalties from streaming, album sales and concert tickets.
Taylor's Eras Tour, consisting of 152 shows across five continents, has generated more than $ 1 billion in ticket sales, making it the world's highest-grossing concert tour. And her new album, released in April, is dominating the charts.
Other top sellers in the quarter were Noah Kahan, Ariana Grande and Olivia Rodrigo, UMG said.
Earlier on Thursday, UMG and TikTok said they had reached a new licensing agreement that will restore the label's songs and artists to the social media platform. REUTERS

Full text: A Times photojournalist embarked on a nuclear-powered attack sub to see how the Pentagon is training for a potential war below the frozen sea.
U.S. Navy sailors aboard nuclear-powered submarines have long trained in the Arctic, learning to hunt their Russian counterparts in case of war. But America's sub force is sharpening its combat skills at the edge of the world as Russia expands military operations there.
One day in March, the black metal sail of a 360-foot attack sub armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles and torpedoes punched through the dense ice of the Beaufort Sea during Operation Ice Camp.
For many of the 152 sailors on board the U.S.S. Hampton, it is their first patrol.
In the sub's nerve center, where sailors navigate the boat and stand watch over sonar, radio and weapons consoles, Master Chief Petty Officer Jacob Green mentors the junior officers and crew members as they carry out their duties.
Everyone calls him "Cob" -- for chief of the boat.
Operating a sub in the Arctic is especially challenging. First, navigation. In some areas, shallow waters force the crew to thread a narrow path between twin threats: the ice above and the ocean floor below.
Ice keels -- huge chunks of overturned sea ice pointing downward -- are also a hazard here. This was the case when Cmdr. Mike Brown and his crew aboard the Hampton transited through the Bering Strait.
"We operated the boat 20 feet off the bottom with 40, 60 feet of ice above us and we were able to dodge the ice keels," Commander Brown said.
Second, water condensation that comes from the freezing ocean waters against the boat's hull creates the risk of small electrical fires on the submarine.
Since a loss of propulsion could mean getting stuck under the ice, keeping the sub's small nuclear power plant in top form becomes a matter of life or death.
As on any sub, space is at a premium.
Beds often have to be shared as the sailors work in shifts (rotating bunks is called "hot racking"). Cooks frequently bake fresh bread so they don't have to store premade loaves (the supply officer is called "Chop," like pork chop). Menus must be meticulously planned for the duration of the underwater mission. In emergencies, surgeries can be performed on the wardroom table.
The small dining areas for officers and sailors are among the few places where the crew can unwind together and study the minutiae of submarine operations for hours on end.
Crew members play the strategy card game cribbage to pass time, and so, they say, as not to let time pass them.
But time does pass, and all of the sailors will miss milestones in the lives of their families and friends. When they do finally return home, they will be unable to talk in detail about their efforts at sea because most of what they do is classified.
Some sailors spend their downtime on smartphones, reading old messages or watching TV shows and movies downloaded before the patrol. "Day 31 is sometimes the lowest morale day while underway," said Capt. Mickaila Johnston, an undersea medical officer. "App downloads expire: Spotify, Netflix, etc."
Being "underway" on a sub, the sailors say, is like working in a small office space with no windows, no way to leave, no Wi-Fi and zero cell service. Crucial military decisions are made entirely on the boat, with no outside communication.
The layout of the boat resembles an elongated maze of extremely dark passageways no wider than the aisle on a school bus. Sailors must turn parallel when walking past each other. The companionways between two primary decks are so narrow that only one person at a time can use them. Nothing and no one is ever far away.
Commander Brown leads an all-male crew. A ban on women serving in the submarine force ended only in 2010, and many female officers are rising through the ranks aboard subs like his. None are yet senior enough to command a submarine.
On this particular day the Hampton has risen from the depths for Ice Camp -- a three-week mission testing the crew's ability to fight in one of the most unforgiving places on Earth.
Several miles away other service members and researchers have built Camp Whale, a clutch of winterized tents and a small command center on a large ice floe that itself moves about a half mile an hour on the frozen ocean.
Life there is rugged. No showers. No running water. The outside air dips to 40 degrees below zero. Above, the northern lights sometimes shimmer after sunset.
Teams are flown by helicopter back and forth between the subs and the camp when physical contact with the subs is necessary.
"The goal here is twofold," Commander Brown said in an interview. "It's geopolitical. It's also just building the proficiency of being able to operate under the ice. I have a crew full of sailors that by and large have never been here, have never been under the ice. And so one of my primary focuses is to train the next generation of sailors."
U.S. Navy submarines run classified missions around the world every single day. Attack boats like the Hampton might collect intelligence on enemy warships or eavesdrop on unfriendly governments, while much larger ballistic missile submarines stay submerged for 90 days at a time, carrying enough nuclear warheads to destroy entire countries.
Before long, it is time to break through the unforgiving Arctic ice again.
As the crew concludes its mission in the Beaufort Sea, the sub heads north before surfacing at the North Pole.
These submariners will then press on, continuing their voyage under the icy sea in silence.

Hollywood Rediscovers Joy of Sex: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Studios obsessively focused on PG-13 franchises and animation in recent years, but movies like "Challengers" and "Saltburn" show eroticism has returned.
Zendaya, clad in a skintight dress, gyrates on a dance floor in "Challengers," a $ 56 million sports drama that arrived in multiplexes on Friday. "It's getting hot in here," the hip-hop soundtrack intones, as she closes her eyes and runs her hands through her hair, lost in fantasy. "So take off all your clothes."
The story continues at a motel, where Zendaya, playing a tennis prodigy, begins a ménage à trois with two guys; it fizzles after they become more interested in each other. The plot moves on -- to sultry interplay on the hood of a car, in a dorm room, in the back seat of a car, on the wooden slats of a sauna. There is erotic churro eating.
"Sex is back!" shouted an apparently elated man at the conclusion of a prerelease "Challengers" screening in West Hollywood, Calif., this month.
Trend spotting in cinema is a hazardous pursuit. Think about how many times the rom-com has been declared dead -- and alive -- and dead. (No, wait, alive.) But this much can be said with surety: Hollywood is hornier than it has been in years.
"It absolutely feels like the pendulum has swung back toward filmmakers exploring adult relationships and sexuality in their projects," said Amy Pascal, the former chairwoman of Sony Pictures and producing force behind "Challengers."
"I welcome that," she added.
Eroticism used to be common in studio movies like "Challengers," which was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. "Body Heat," "Basic Instinct," "An Officer and a Gentleman," "Fatal Attraction," "Disclosure," "Cruel Intentions" and "Eyes Wide Shut" are among the many examples from the 1980s and '90s.
In the 2000s, however, film companies started to obsessively focus on PG-13 franchises and animation -- genres that could play to a global audience and sell merchandise. Studios also wanted to expand into China, where censors do not allow sex scenes. As a result, steamy storytelling began to dwindle on the big screen (except at art house theaters). Premium television picked up the slack.
Sex in mainstream movies was "pretty much gone" by 2019, as Ann Hornaday, chief film critic for The Washington Post, wrote in a column that year. A few months later, Kate Hagen, writing in Playboy magazine, found that only about 1.2 percent of films released between 2010 and 2020 contained an overt sex scene, the lowest decade total since the 1960s. (It peaked in the 1990s. Coincidentally or not, that was the decade when pornography started to become available online.)
Now, some filmmakers are pushing back.
Awards season brought "Saltburn," with its arousing-disturbing bathtub scene and Barry Keoghan's twirling, full-frontal finale. "Poor Things" found an insatiable Emma Stone romping through a Paris brothel. Christopher Nolan filmed the first sex scenes of his 35-year career for "Oppenheimer." ("More interested in the joys of sex than any recent season I can remember," as Kyle Buchanan, awards columnist for The New York Times, described the crop of contenders in February.)
Over the past year, the trickle of R-rated sex comedies in theaters turned into a relative torrent. "Anyone but You" found Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell going at it. "No Hard Feelings" starred Jennifer Lawrence as a kinda-sorta prostitute on a mission to deflower an awkward student. The libidinous "Bottoms," "Back on the Strip" and "Joy Ride" also tried mixing sex with laughs.
In late May, Mr. Powell will return to theaters in the comedic "Hit Man," about an undercover agent who begins a smoking-hot affair with a suspect, played by Adria Arjona. In addition to acting in the R-rated film, he co-wrote the screenplay with Richard Linklater and served as a producer. (It will arrive on Netflix in June.)
"'Body Heat' was one of the inspirations," Mr. Powell said in January, when "Hit Man" debuted to rave reviews at the Sundance Film Festival. "There aren't many sex scenes in movies anymore, and certainly not many that are done well."
He continued, "'Body Heat' has a lot of foreplay, which is one reason it feels so intense -- steamy, carnal." ("Body Heat," released in 1981, starred Kathleen Turner as a wealthy woman who plots the murder of her husband while having a torrid affair with a sleazy lawyer, played by William Hurt.)
The multiplex lineup for this summer includes "Deadpool & Wolverine," from Disney-owned Marvel Studios; a trailer included a joke about an intimate act involving a sex toy. (The activity "isn't new for me," Ryan Reynolds jokes as the mischievous Deadpool, "but it is for Disney.") "Blink Twice," a twisted thriller starring Channing Tatum as a mogul who lures women to a private retreat, is scheduled for release in August.
The upturn may simply be a scheduling quirk. "Challengers" was supposed to come out last year, but it was delayed because of union strikes. Its arrival now -- sandwiched between "Poor Things" and "Hit Man" -- could be creating the false appearance of a film industry turn.
But there are signs that suggest a genuine shift. One involves intimacy coordinators, or experts who help performers navigate the awkwardness of filming sex scenes. Their inclusion on sets, once a rarity, became common after the #MeToo movement of the late 2010s. Film producers say stars have become more willing to participate in simulated intimacy as a result.
Young screenwriters and directors also seem to be rediscovering movies like "American Gigolo" (1980) and "9½ Weeks" (1986) and drawing inspiration. Some studio executives say filmmakers like Luca Guadagnino, who directed "Challengers," are interested in exploring changing attitudes about sex -- as seen in the rise of OnlyFans and the shame-free embrace of sexual fluidity by younger millennials and Gen Z. (One counterpoint: In a study last year by the Center for Scholars & Storytellers at the University of California, Los Angeles, about 52 percent of respondents ages 13 to 24 said they wanted movies and TV shows to focus more on friendships and platonic relationships.)
Perhaps contributing a degree of sexual liberation: Studios have stopped chasing China, where ticket buyers have turned against Hollywood movies en masse.
So far, results at the box office have been mixed. "Anyone but You," made by Sony for $ 25 million, collected a hefty $ 219 million this year, while "Poor Things," which cost Searchlight Pictures $ 35 million, took in a solid $ 117 million. Other attempts ("Joy Ride," "No Hard Feelings") have disappointed or fizzled entirely.
Reviews for "Challengers" have been extremely positive. Box office analysts expect it to collect roughly $ 15 million in its debut weekend in the United States and Canada, where it is playing in 3,400 theaters, enough for No. 1.

F.C.C. Votes To Bring Back Net Neutrality: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Commissioners voted along party lines to revive the rules that declare broadband as a utility-like service that could be regulated like phones and water.
The Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to restore regulations that expand government oversight of broadband providers and aim to protect consumer access to the internet, a move that will reignite a long-running battle over the open internet.
Known as net neutrality, the regulations were first put in place nearly a decade ago under the Obama administration and are aimed at preventing internet service providers like Verizon or Comcast from blocking or degrading the delivery of services from competitors like Netflix and YouTube. The rules were repealed under President Donald J. Trump, and have proved to be a contentious partisan issue over the years while pitting tech giants against broadband providers.
In a 3-to-2 vote along party lines, the five-member commission appointed by President Biden revived the rules that declare broadband a utility-like service regulated like phones and water. The rules also give the F.C.C. the ability to demand broadband providers report and respond to outages, as well as expand the agency's oversight of the providers' security issues.
Jessica Rosenworcel, the chairwoman of the F.C.C. and a Democrat, said the rules reflected the importance of high-speed internet as the main mode of communications for many Americans.
"Every consumer deserves internet access that is fast, open and fair," Ms. Rosenworcel said. "This is common sense."
Broadband providers are expected to sue to try to overturn the reinstated rules.
"This is a nonissue for broadband consumers, who have enjoyed an open internet for decades," said Jonathan Spalter, the president of a broadband lobbying group, USTelecom. The organization said it would "pursue all available options, including in the courts."
In a letter sent to Ms. Rosenworcel this week, dozens of leading Republican lawmakers warned that regulating broadband providers like a utility would harm the growth of the telecommunications industry.
The core purpose of the regulations is to prevent internet service providers from controlling the quality of consumers' experience when they visit websites and use services online. When the rules were established, Google, Netflix and other online services warned that broadband providers had the incentive to slow down or block access to their services. Consumer and free speech groups supported this view.
There have been few examples of blocking or slowing of sites, which proponents of net neutrality say is largely because of fear that the companies would invite scrutiny if they did so. And opponents say the rules could lead to more and unnecessary government oversight of the industry.
"The internet in America has thrived in the absence of 1930s command-and-control regulation by the government," said Brendan Carr, a Republican commissioner.
A decade ago, the potential new regulations prompted raucous demonstrations. At the time, telecom companies were losing business to online streaming services. Sites like Facebook, Google and Amazon feared they would be forced to pay telecom companies for better delivery of their services.
During the Trump administration, the F.C.C. rolled back net neutrality. Republican lawmakers and F.C.C. commissioners have balked that the rules were unnecessary and government overreach.
Democrats have argued they are critical to consumer protection. In the vacuum of federal regulations, several states including California and Washington created their own net neutrality laws.

Full text: Check out Jim Gaffigan before Pop-Tarts and bourbon propelled him to super stardom, or catch up with the award-winning Japanese director Ryusuke Hamaguchi before his new film comes out.
Comedy
Jim Gaffigan
April 25-28 at Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, Manhattan; msg.com/beacon-theatre.
Jim Gaffigan's comedy career took off in 2006 because of a series of jokes about Hot Pockets, but he might find even more success thanks to Pop-Tarts and bourbon.
The upcoming Netflix film "Unfrosted," starring a hilarious host of comedians including Gaffigan and Jerry Seinfeld, who also directs, goes back to the 1960s to reimagine the invention of the Pop-Tart. In real life, Gaffigan debuted his own specialty brand of bourbon, Fathertime, earlier this month. He is also still regularly delivering commentary for "CBS News Sunday Morning," which won him a Daytime Emmy in 2016, and last weekend, he filmed the Boston stops on his "Barely Alive Tour" for what will be his 11th stand-up special.
That tour is coming to the Beacon Theater, with shows at 8 p.m. on Thursday and Friday, at 5 and 8 p.m. on Saturday and at 4 and 7 p.m. on Sunday. Tickets are available for varying prices on Ticketmaster. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Oneohtrix Point Never
April 26 at 7 p.m. at the Brooklyn Paramount, 385 Flatbush Avenue Extension; brooklynparamount.com.
Few devoutly experimental musicians have reached so far into mainstream culture as Daniel Lopatin. Recording under the name Oneohtrix Point Never, he garnered a niche but rabid following in the late 2000s and early 2010s with warped electronic compositions that mashed together bits of cultural detritus, often intentionally tacky relics of the 1980s. More widely known are his recent contributions to pop: Lopatin has produced for FKA twigs and Charli XCX, and scored films for the Safdie brothers. He also partnered with the Weeknd on "Dawn FM," the commercial kingpin's 2022 album, which brims with the ultra-synthetic music of decades past that fascinates Lopatin.
On his own, Lopatin continues to look both backward and forward: His latest solo release, "Again," takes inspiration from '90s alt rock and experiments with artificial intelligence. Known for immersive multimedia performances, Lopatin is currently touring the album with a highly choreographed production involving projection and puppetry, art-directed by the French artist Freeka Tet.
Lopatin's show at the Paramount this weekend is sold out, but tickets can be found on secondary markets, and a handful will be available at the door. OLIVIA HORN
'HOME(land)'
April 27 at 7:30 p.m. at the 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, Manhattan; 92ny.org.
On Saturday, the mezzo-soprano Fleur Barron and the pianist Myra Huang will present a diverse program centered on the ideas of home and homeland and encompassing the feelings of comfort, longing and alienation. Barron will reflect on her own upbringing -- the singer is Singaporean and British, but grew up in Hong Kong -- by mixing works by Chinese and Chinese diaspora composers such as Huang Ruo and Chen Yi with pieces by Charles Ives, Alban Berg and Johannes Brahms.
In the latter half of the performance, Barron will trade off between songs by Toru Takemitsu and ones by Charles Trenet for an unexpectedly jazzy set. Of particular interest might be the United States premiere of Alex Ho's "Four Miniatures for Our Little Selves," which considers a childhood caught between cultures, and Zubaida Azezi and Edo Frenkel's "Ananurhan," based on a Uyghur folk melody. That piece applies throat singing to classical vocals and suggests the notion of finding a home with one's own body, especially in the face of displacement and discrimination.
Tickets start at $ 30 on 92NY's website. The concert will also be livestreamed for $ 25. GABRIELLE FERRARI
Kids
'Common Ground'
Through May 11 at TADA! Youth Theater, 15 West 28th Street, Manhattan; tadatheater.com.
Amid the controversy over border policies, it's sometimes forgotten that immigrants are distinct individuals and not mere statistics. In its first two-act musical, TADA! Youth Theater gives the humanity of newly arrived adolescents center stage.
Based on real teenagers -- Lisa Diana Shapiro, author of the show's book and lyrics, used to teach in a refugee program -- the characters in "Common Ground" include a boy who's fled poverty in Ivory Coast and girls escaping their abusive father in Honduras. But it focuses on Ysabella, a proud newcomer from Colombia and budding social media star.
With a score by Julia Jordan Kamanda and additional music by Georgia Stitt, the production at first explores the high school experiences of Ysabella and her brother, and Ysabella's complicated friendship with Emma, a bullied yet resourceful middle-class American. But the show takes a darker turn when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detains Ysabella and her family, and her peers learn what they can -- and cannot -- do to help.
Directed and choreographed by Alex Sanchez and performed with heartfelt conviction by its diverse young cast, "Common Ground" plays Thursdays and Fridays at 7 p.m., Saturdays at 2 and 7 p.m., and Sundays at 2 p.m.
Tickets start at $ 15. LAUREL GRAEBER
Film
Hamaguchi I & II
April 26-30 at Film at Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, Manhattan; filmlinc.org.
Riding a surge of recent acclaim, the Japanese director Ryusuke Hamaguchi, the subject of this retrospective, has continuously played with conventions of cinematic structure, length and even exhibition. His Oscar-winning "Drive My Car" (showing on Friday and Saturday) situates its opening titles well into its three-hour running time. "Happy Hour" (on Sunday) spends more than five hours observing the small interactions that cause people to fall in and out of love. "Asako I & II" (on Saturday and Monday), which gives the program its title, borrows its narrative template from "Vertigo."
The series is a prelude to the release of Hamaguchi's latest feature, "Evil Does Not Exist," on May 3. That release itself will be preceded by three performances of a companion piece, "Gift," on May 1 and 2. Shot in tandem with "Evil," "Gift" consists of silent footage that will be accompanied live by the musician Eiko Ishibashi, who collaborated with Hamaguchi on both works (and wrote the score for "Drive My Car"). The three "Gift" showings are currently standby-only. BEN KENIGSBERG

How 'Anyone but You' Beat the Rom-Com Odds: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Here are their takeaways after the film, debuting on Netflix, went from box office miss to runaway hit.
As Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell promoted their romantic comedy, "Anyone but You," last year, life appeared to be imitating art: The co-stars posed cheek to cheek while sightseeing in Australia. Powell dipped a gleeful Sweeney in his arms. Sweeney cast longing gazes up at Powell on red carpets. The pair flirted and giggled in interviews.
When Powell and his long-term girlfriend broke up, and Sweeney remained engaged to her fiancé, Jonathan Davino (an executive producer of "Anyone but You"), rumors of an illicit offscreen relationship between the two actors took hold.
The speculation played out, the stars said, exactly as they intended.
"The two things that you have to sell a rom-com are fun and chemistry. Sydney and I have a ton of fun together, and we have a ton of effortless chemistry," Powell said in an interview. "That's people wanting what's on the screen off the screen, and sometimes you just have to lean into it a bit -- and it worked wonderfully. Sydney is very smart."
Sweeney, who is also an executive producer through her Fifty-Fifty Films company, said she was intimately involved with the marketing strategy on the Columbia Pictures film, including, perhaps, fanning those headline-generating flames.
"I was on every call. I was in text group chats. I was probably keeping everybody over at Sony marketing and distribution awake at night because I couldn't stop with ideas," she said. "I wanted to make sure that we were actively having a conversation with the audience as we were promoting this film, because at the end of the day, they're the ones who created the entire narrative."
The R-rated romance follows Bea (Sweeney) and Ben (Powell), who share a night that ends badly and are then thrust together at a destination wedding in Australia, where Ben's friend and Bea's sister are getting married. The film is based loosely on Shakespeare's "Much Ado About Nothing" and is full of bawdy zingers, grand gestures and sun-dappled scenery.
"You've got to get the ingredients in the meal just right: the story, the cast, the filmmakers, the chemistry, the ending," said Tom Rothman, chairman and chief executive of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, which includes Columbia. He added that the execution of a romantic comedy in particular "is a delicate task. So, if you're going to make one and go for it theatrically, it better be good."
Critics were divided on "Anyone but You," and it had an anemic start at the box office. It took in about $ 8 million over the long Christmas weekend against its $ 25 million budget, and opened in fifth place behind the latest "Aquaman" and "Wonka."
"I kept my expectations low and, in retrospect, not low enough," the director Will Gluck said. "The first week was disappointing."
But then something unusual happened: The audience for "Anyone but You" grew in its second and third weeks, and the film remained in the Top 5 at the U.S. box office each weekend through the end of January, thanks in part to multiple viewings by younger audiences. Sales also surged overseas, even in non-English-language markets, which are notoriously difficult for Hollywood comedies to crack.
Sony kept the film in U.S. theaters through February, and by the time "Anyone but You" arrives on Netflix this week as part of Sony's licensing deal with the streamer, the rom-com will have grossed more than $ 218 million worldwide.
While Rothman said that Sony "never really subscribed to the notions of the punditocracy that the rom-com was dead" at the box office, the studio put only a single, low-budget romantic comedy ("The Broken Hearts Gallery") into wide release between 2016 and 2022.
Here are three takeaways from the film's success.
The actors contributed off-camera, too.
The film's journey began in earnest in early 2022, when Sweeney, a star of "Euphoria" and "Immaculate," was actively seeking rom-com scripts to act in and produce. She and the producer Jeff Kirschenbaum came across one by Ilana Wolpert, a screenwriter best known at the time for "High School Musical: The Musical: The Series."
"Ilana took such a cool, modern twist on Shakespeare, I felt like I was reading an early 2000s rom-com," Sweeney said of the script. "I loved wanting to be kissed in the rain, wanting to fall in love once I finished reading the script, wanting to cry, laugh, feeling all the feels."
Sweeney spent months meeting with potential lead actors and had narrowed it down to two or three others before meeting Powell at the MTV Movie & TV Awards. After a follow-up video call with him, she said she was convinced the actor, best known then for "Top Gun: Maverick," "had all the chops" to play Ben.
The stars then approached Gluck, whose credits include "Easy A" and "Friends With Benefits" at Sony, to direct and revise the script as they shopped it to studios. Within a matter of weeks, Sony snapped up the project -- a feat Sweeney partly attributed to her "building a great relationship" with the studio by acting in the superhero movie "Madame Web."
"Sydney is a force of nature," Rothman said, adding that Sony is lucky to be in business with her on future projects, which include a new "Barbarella."
Ahead of the release of "Anyone but You," Sweeney said she pushed Sony to take "a leap of faith" and release a viral promo clip of her and Powell whispering raunchy "ASMR pickup lines" that has since been viewed nearly 25 million times on TikTok. And after the film hit theaters, Sweeney noticed a handful of TikToking moviegoers lip-syncing and dancing to the Natasha Bedingfield song "Unwritten" -- which plays a key role in the film -- and fueled the trend by sharing their clips with her nearly 20 million Instagram followers.
"I was like, this is really interesting, so I saved that and I storied that," Sweeney said, referring to Instagram's Stories feature. "Before I knew it, I was doing it every single night. It just spiraled into this thing that created a TikTok trend, and that is truly what built the audience."
Rom-com history matters.
For Dermot Mulroney, the veteran actor who plays a supporting role as Bea's father in "Anyone but You," being part of the film's success is a full-circle moment. He was in his early 30s when he starred in the 1997 rom-com "My Best Friend's Wedding," which made almost $ 300 million globally against its $ 35 million budget. Yet, Mulroney, who played the object of Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz's affections in that hit, found he had few opportunities in the immediate aftermath.
"I was sitting there ready for the gift with purchase that was supposed to come along with being in a popular movie, and instead, I probably didn't work for a year," Mulroney said. "I chalked it up to me being so tiny on the poster, the little guy on the cake. I thought, gosh, you guys, if you'd made me a little bigger, maybe I could have gotten a job."
But Mulroney, now 60, said he was still approached daily by fans of the film -- decades after its release -- some of whom tell him they grew up watching it with their grandmothers.
The night before filming began on "Anyone but You" in Sydney, Gluck gathered the cast to watch "My Best Friend's Wedding" at a Sony screening room. It was the first time Mulroney had seen it since its premiere; afterward he spoke to the room, and Powell in particular, about the unexpected weight of being in a theatrical rom-com.
"I didn't want him to do what I did, which was minimize how important something is that might feel a little light or a little fluff when you're doing it," Mulroney said. "'What these movies mean to people,' I told Glen, 'will last for decades.' It will last until after you're gone in a way that maybe the other cool stuff he's doing won't. It has a different kind of absorption."
Powell took the message to heart and also relished the chance to embrace the goofier aspects of playing the love interest in a romantic comedy.
"For some reason, the rom-com male lead has just been reduced to a brooding male model that occasionally smiles at the girl across the room," Powell said. "But for me, if you're a male and you leave a rom-com looking cool, you've totally messed it up."
Gluck agreed. "We were very conscious of making it feel like a huge movie with big production and big escapism and big moments and big acts of love," he said, adding, "a lot of life's moments are cheesy and cringe."
Don't expect Hollywood to learn these lessons.
Gluck said he has had talks with Sweeney and Powell about reteaming on another film. And while Rothman said there has been "nothing official" discussed at the studio level, he would prefer to see the actors pair up again in an unrelated romantic comedy, similar to Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan's filmography together.
"Not that we wouldn't consider a sequel -- obviously, we would," Rothman said. "But I think maybe the healthiest opportunity is another original starring the two of them."
Mulroney said he and Roberts have discussed ways they could reunite in another rom-com. "I'd give anything to go around again with Julia," he said. "We're trying, for sure. We'll do whatever anybody can get up and going."
Still, Gluck is skeptical that the success of "Anyone but You" will herald a new wave of theatrical rom-coms. (Universal recently announced that its fourth "Bridget Jones" film will go straight to Peacock in the United States next year.)
"There's one thing I know for certain: Nothing will be learned from this," Gluck said. "I hope I'm wrong, but it's not like, in six months get ready for a rom-com revolution every weekend. I still think people are a little hesitant to figure out why it worked."

A Coin in This Jukebox Pays Off With Pure Fun: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The new musical doesn't take itself too seriously and has many winning moments -- almost enough to eclipse the weaknesses of its story.
It's 2024, and Huey Lewis is having a moment. Just let that sink in.
Lewis was an unexpected highlight of the recent Netflix documentary "The Greatest Night in Pop," about the star-studded 1985 session where "We Are the World" was recorded. An everyman rocker, Lewis was amazed (and still is) that he was rubbing elbows with Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Tina Turner and Bruce Springsteen. He even got to sing the part originally intended for Prince.
Now comes the new Broadway show "The Heart of Rock and Roll," which is not so much a Huey Lewis (and the News) musical as the Huey Lewis of musicals: not taking itself too seriously, doing what it does well, and just happy to be on Broadway, keeping company with starrier productions.
Like most jukeboxes, "The Heart of Rock and Roll" shoehorns big hits, including "The Power of Love" and "Stuck With You," with lesser-known tracks into a plot generic enough to accommodate them.
Set in 1987, Jonathan A. Abrams's book, based on a story by Tyler Mitchell and Abrams, centers on Bobby (Corey Cott, from the underrated "Bandstand"), an employee at an ailing cardboard box manufacturer, Stone Incorporated, in Milwaukee. Bobby works on the assembly line, but he really wants to join the sales department so he can "Be Someone," as the show's new song puts it. Wait, no, maybe what he really wants is to rock out with his old band, the Loop. Bobby might sing "It's Hip to Be Square," but deep down, does he really believe it?
By now you might have noticed that dreams play a big part in "The Heart of Rock and Roll." There are numerous references to chasing the dream, making it come true and living it, but also giving it up. Sentimentality is often ladled out, along with clichés. And Bobby, whose sole personality trait appears to be "good guy," carries more than his share of both -- he hears the fateful siren call "one last show" and lugs emotional baggage related to his "old man." At least Cott gives Bobby a laid-back charm that's not unlike Lewis's own, along with his emotional big Act II aria, "The Only One."
Fortunately, there is also enough good-natured goofball humor to keep Gordon Greenberg's production from sinking into cloying goo. Much of the levity comes from amusing supporting characters, starting with Bobby's love interest and his boss's daughter, Cassandra (McKenzie Kurtz, a recent Glinda in "Wicked"). She is an uber-dork with a fondness for spreadsheets, and Kurtz's Cassandra is a daffy delight that recalls Annaleigh Ashford's performance in "Kinky Boots."
That is not the only time "The Heart of Rock and Roll" brings to mind that hit, which is also set at a factory. Like Jerry Mitchell's in the earlier show, Lorin Latarro's high-energy choreography here makes clever use of props, having employees slide on cardboard sheets and deploying the ensemble in a number that involves jumping on Bubble Wrap.
That scene takes place at a packaging convention, where Stone Inc. is trying to drum up business. For obscure reasons, the company's sensible head of H.R., Roz (a wonderfully droll Tamika Lawrence), has tagged along. She, too, had to make a life-changing decision once -- "and it's a good thing," Roz dryly quips, "because otherwise I never would have found the unbridled joy of 'human resources."' (This sets up the best plot twist, which comes at the very end.)
Naturally, nice Midwesterners need a wicked antagonist, preferably of the putting-on-airs kind (a big no-no in the Huey Lewis universe). And here the show over-delivers thanks to the loose-limbed physical-comedy ace Billy Harrigan Tighe and his memorable performance as Tucker, Cassandra's cocky finance-bro ex. In the number "Give Me the Keys (And I'll Drive You Crazy)," he and his old Princeton a cappella group, the Undertones, invite Cassandra for a ride in a pretend car. The moment when Kurtz mimes opening the door and Tighe mimes rolling down the window is a strong contender for single funniest scene of the Broadway spring.
While the dialogue has occasional pop, it's the performances that keep the show rolling, along with Greenberg and Latarro's fast-paced, resourceful staging. Bobby's "I Want a New Drug," for example, is an economical summary of why many men join rock bands: In his hotel room at the convention, just as he pulls out his beloved guitar, handling it like a holy relic, three women magically emerge from inside the bed -- in a nifty touch, their outfits are stylized representations of Bobby's axe. (The costumes are by Jen Caprio.)
"The Heart of Rock and Roll" is not going to be the subject of think pieces and graduate theses, but its easygoing good spirits are bolstered by solid craftsmanship, and it'd be silly to turn up our noses at that. "Have a good time," Huey Lewis once sang, wisely quoting Curtis Mayfield. "'Cause it's all right."

The Man Who Made Putin: [Review]

Full text: Michael Stuhlbarg and Will Keen shine as a kingmaker and his creature. But in Peter Morgan's cheesy-fun play, it's not always clear which is which.
"In the West you have no idea."
So begins Peter Morgan's play "Patriots," which opened on Monday at the Ethel Barrymore Theater. The line is spoken by the Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky, referring to the foods, sights and music that supposedly feed the great Russian soul. These are represented, in Rupert Goold's entertaining if overcaffeinated production, by boozy singing and balalaikas, sometimes even fur hats.
But "Patriots" also sets out to demonstrate how little the West knows about the real world of realpolitik: the grudges, enmities and insulted dignities that in the post-Soviet 1990s, with casino capitalism rampant in Russia, created Vladimir Putin.
If you could ask Berezovsky, though, he'd tell you it was he who created Putin, a tenth-rate provincial nobody he eased into power, first as prime minister and later as president. Berezovsky (Michael Stuhlbarg) calls himself Putin's "krysha" -- literally his roof, figuratively his protector or, as he explains, the "bully on your side."
Spoken in the weirdly accented English of this production, which originated in London and has been remounted for Broadway with key cast changes and Netflix as a producer, "krysha" sounds confusingly like "creature." It turns out to be a useful confusion. "Patriots" is a wild story of makers switching places with the made, of Pinocchios devouring Geppettos.
Putin (Will Keen) was and is both: a liar and a manipulator. Berezovsky (Michael Stuhlbarg) was at least the latter -- but, well, in the West we have no idea. We meet him in "Patriots" as a 9-year-old math prodigy, an obnoxious "golden child" fixated on winning a Nobel Prize. (That there is no Nobel in mathematics is one of Morgan's many shortcuts.) The boy's interests, at least as selected for ironic reference later, are in the predictability of decision making, under rational and even irrational circumstances.
Both come into play. Through rational choices, the know-it-all becomes a billionaire, ruthlessly plotting to expand his business from cars to television to oil. When his attempts to grease the seemingly ungreasable Putin with money and a Mercedes fail, he switches to peddling power, which works. The chaos of the presidency of Boris Yeltsin -- in Paul Kynman's hilarious performance, a pickled parade balloon -- creates massive opportunities for grift and privatization that Berezovsky, with Putin in his pocket, is primed to exploit.
The scenes in which he creates his creature -- and bleeds everyone else with a combination of charm, petulance and ruthlessness -- are great fun. Both lead actors are superb, bringing physical, gestural and thus emotional life to characters who might seem, from the outside, to have no insides worth exploring. Stuhlbarg has rounded himself into a big baby, complete with balled fists, squeezed eyes and tantrums. Keen, from the London production, uses a pinched voice to suggest Putin's pinched soul. Wooden stances become turkey-like preening as he grows uncomfortably comfortable with power.
That power turns on Berezovsky the minute Putin becomes president. For the rest of the play, as for the rest of his life, Berezovsky plots to bring down the man he made and, for the sake of the motherland, his government as well.
Morgan does not offer a strong point of view on whether Berezovsky was truly patriotic or just infuriated by the wounds to his narcissism and bank account. But after Roman Abramovich, another of his creatures, turns on him too, the on-the-skids oligarch loses his grip on the rationality of decision making. He dies, a probable suicide, in exile.
That's no spoiler; it's the news, dateline London, 2013. But I wouldn't generally take "Patriots" as a reliable source of information. (The math is mostly mumbo-jumbo.) Like Morgan's "The Crown," it's a bit cheesy, making its sometimes baggy drama (it could reasonably have been half or twice as long) from a highly tendentious selection of facts and a perhaps overliberal imagination.
In so doing, it provides, also like "The Crown," the opportunity for some very enjoyable performances, not just from Stuhlbarg and Keen but also from Luke Thallon as an implausibly beamish Abramovich. Just don't look for interesting women here; they are mostly afterthoughts, arm candy and Bechdel test flunk-outs.
But then "Patriots" is no better a source for moral news than the other kind. Perhaps no play is. Here, though, Putin is given way more than his due: glamorized as a shy, upstanding mayor corrupted by Berezovsky and his plutocratic ilk. Whereas Berezovsky, who did after all try to bring Putin down, is left in the gutter, with a certain amount of dramaturgical glee. Goold stages his downfall like a rock opera, with strobes, bursts of loud noise (these are often assassination attempts) and weird dancers.
If not moral clarity, then, "Patriots" at least offers a lesson: There are moments when tyrants are still tyros, when Putins are nobodies -- and evil can be redirected or sidelined. Wait too long and you could lose your chance.
That's something, "Patriots" suggests, about which the West can no longer afford to "have no idea."

FIFA Said to Be Discussing A Tournament With Apple: [Sports Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The agreement would give the tech company worldwide rights for a monthlong World Cup-style competition between top teams set to take place next year.
FIFA, soccer's global governing body, is close to an agreement with Apple that would give the tech company worldwide television rights for a major new tournament, a monthlong, World Cup-style competition for top teams that will be played for the first time in the United States next summer.
The agreement could be announced as soon as this month, according to three people familiar with the matter, who were not authorized to discuss the deal publicly because it has yet to be officially confirmed. It comes after several false starts for a competition championed by FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino. Plans to hold it in China in 2021 were scuttled because of the pandemic.
The value of the deal might be as little as a quarter of the $ 4 billion FIFA had first estimated, the people said. It is unclear if the deal with Apple will include any free-to-air rights, meaning the entire event could be available only to subscribers of Apple TV+, a factor over which senior executives at FIFA have raised concerns.
Should the deal go through, it would be the first time that FIFA, which will stage the first expanded 48-team men's World Cup in the United States in 2026, has agreed to a single worldwide contract. It would also represent the latest foray into soccer for Apple, which in 2022 signed a 10-year, $ 2.5 billion agreement for the global streaming rights to Major League Soccer.
Streaming services have become increasingly interested in live sports, as they seek to woo more subscribers. Peacock streamed a National Football League playoff game last season and Amazon Prime has been streaming Thursday night N.F.L. games since 2022. Apple also has a deal to stream Major League Baseball games. Netflix focuses more on sports documentaries, though it recently pushed into live "sports-adjacent programming," including a multibillion deal to stream World Wrestling Entertainment's flagship weekly wrestling show, "Raw." It also announced that it would stream a boxing match between the former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and the social media influencer Jake Paul in July.
FIFA was hoping that the tournament, which will feature a mix of successful teams from across the globe, including 12 from Europe, where most of the world's top talent plays, would create huge demand from broadcasters and commercial partners. But a combination of poor planning and delays prompted broadcasters to balk at the figures FIFA had sought. Sponsors have so far also been reluctant to commit the $ 150 million that the organization is seeking for sponsorship packages, according to the people.
A global deal with a major company like Apple may give the tournament, which will be played every four years, the veneer of high quality that Infantino has been trying to secure. Tom Neumayr, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment. "As a general practice, FIFA does not confirm or deny commercial discussions," FIFA said in a statement.
FIFA has set aside June 15 to July 13 in 2025 for the tournament to be played. That comes after the long European season, and has traditionally been a time when no major events take place in order to allow players to rest in the off-season a year before the World Cup. Players unions have criticized FIFA for not consulting them before announcing the event.
FIFA also faces significant costs by playing the event in the United States, where it will act as a tuneup for the World Cup. Some games will be in large arenas, including N.F.L. stadiums that must be leased. FIFA had hoped to secure major sponsorship partners willing to pay as much as the $ 100 million that World Cup sponsors pay per cycle, but with little more than a year to go, no title partners have been announced for the event.
The deal must be concluded soon in order to be announced ahead of the upfronts later next month, during which entertainment companies try to woo advertisers by talking about future programming.
European clubs have been pressing FIFA for months for concrete details of the event, including the cities where it will be staged, and even its name. FIFA had said the event would be called the Mundial de Clubes FIFA, but teams have now been told that is under review.

Full text: His new play "Patriots," now on Broadway, follows Putin's rise to power and the Russian oligarchs who mistakenly thought he'd be their puppet.
Going from Princess Diana, a lovely icon who generated waves of sympathy, to Vladimir Putin, an icy villain who generates waves of disdain, might be difficult for some writers.
Not Peter Morgan.
After pulling back the curtain on the British royal family for six seasons of "The Crown," Morgan was keen to move on. He had an idea for a play about the oligarchs who, in the 1990s, helped propel an obscure Putin to power and then had to watch as their Frankenstein changed the course of Russian history in a disastrous way.
The resulting drama, "Patriots," which opens on Broadway on April 22, offered Morgan a different way to approach recent history, and a new challenge: switching from the royals, who are household names but not ultimately very powerful, to oligarchs, who are super powerful but not generally household names.
Morgan enjoys writing about the vilified, giving them a fighting chance. In "Patriots," he creates a jigsaw of four Russian men, their fates intertwining in the post-Soviet era, who represent a Byzantine spectrum of moral values.
"It's just a delicious combination of characters," Morgan, 60, told me, in an interview at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in Times Square. "There's a sort of violence, whereas in 'The Crown,' there's this politeness and there's repression, and it's very female. There's something very male, very violent about this play. It felt like a natural thing to do, having spent so much time in the one world to go into another world just to relax a little."
There were several oligarchs who helped Putin rise from a K.G.B. apparatchik in Leningrad to autocrat in the Kremlin. Morgan chose the most colorful of them for his protagonist: Boris Berezovsky, who cast himself as "the Jew behind the czar."
Morgan tailors the tale to do one of the things he does best: One character self-destructs, and another exploits that spiral.
Michael Sheen, who played Tony Blair onscreen in a trilogy of Morgan opuses, "The Queen" with Helen Mirren, "The Deal" and "The Special Relationship," told me that Morgan "finds a moment that is able to ripple out in front and behind, and illuminate what matters."
Morgan said he loves "riveting personal interactions" with a backdrop of history, when you see the impetus for an event and realize "it's because of envy, or it's because of persecution or it's because of jealousy or because of love."
Despite the model of Shakespeare, he thinks that we too often tend to separate the emotional and psychological from our reading of history and politics.
"In a sense, I enjoy painting with a brush that is not too realistic, because that's what drama can do," he said. "We have cameras for verisimilitude and for likeness."
Morgan is known -- and oft chided -- for mixing research and invention, looking for an underlying dramatic truth rather than pure accuracy. As with "The Crown," he turned to a flock of advisers, this time Russian ones, for "Patriots." He said he wanted to be careful not to demonize Russia. And he spent time with people who were close to Berezovsky.
He traces the rise and fall of Berezovsky (Michael Stuhlbarg), a math prodigy -- "a golden child," as a teacher calls him in the play -- who built a fortune in cars, oil and TV and became a political power. He even had his own exclusive private club in Moscow.
"If there was a rock star of that era," Morgan said, "if there was an iconic character who most typified the indulgence, the excess, in a sense the lawlessness of oligarchy, it would be him. I was interested in somebody that everybody felt was magnetic."
Nina L. Khrushcheva, a professor of international affairs at the New School in Manhattan and Nikita S. Khrushchev's great-granddaughter, was one of Morgan's advisers on Russian history. Sitting with us, she offered her gloss on Berezovsky: "He's the King Lear. He's the most tragic figure you can imagine."
Berezovsky blithely bribed and plundered. One security official told my colleague Steven Lee Myers for his biography of Putin, "The New Tsar: The Rise and Reign of Vladimir Putin," that Berezovsky divided people into two categories: "A condom in its packaging and a condom that has been used." Once in power, Putin, who had been Berezovsky's protégé, checked the power of oligarchs, including him. And Berezovsky came to see Putin as a killer who was snuffing out reforms implemented by Boris Yeltsin.
"The thing that sent me straight to my laptop, as it were," Morgan told me, "was the tragedy of Berezovsky, something about having all those ideals and then being shattered and outmaneuvered."
Khrushcheva interjected dryly: "Berezovsky and ideals. There's a little bit of a stretch, right?"
Morgan defended his antihero: "The thing that Boris had to take to his grave is that he weaponized Putin through his own transgressions, being so voraciously greedy, stealing from the Russian state." Once Putin got to the top and clamped down on the oligarchs, Berezovsky, stripped of power, became "a reluctant revolutionary."
Other historic figures are brought into the mix. There is Alexander Litvinenko (Alex Hurt), who worked for the federal security service and investigated the bombing of Berezovsky's car in 1994, which left his chauffeur decapitated. He grew close to Berezovsky, became disillusioned with Putin and defected to Britain, where, in 2006, he was poisoned with polonium-210, a radioactive isotope, and died.
Then there is the luxe oligarch Roman Abramovich (Luke Thallon), described as "the kid" when Berezovsky first meets him in the play and agrees to go into the oil business with him and become his protector. They too fall out, and in 2011 Berezovsky sues Abramovich in London, seeking billions, and loses. The judge calls Berezovsky "an unimpressive and inherently unreliable witness who regarded truth as transitory."
Sonia Friedman, the play's producer, said that while Morgan had initially set out to write the story of "Boris as a kingmaker," he made Putin more central because "as the play was developing, the world was changing around the play."
The drama is animated by the shifting relationship between Berezovsky and Putin.
When we first encounter Putin -- played by Will Keen, a "Crown" alum who won an Olivier Award last year after the play's successful London run -- he's a deputy mayor of St. Petersburg politely rebuffing a bribe from Berezovsky, who wants to give the politician a Mercedes in return for letting him set up a car dealership.
Putin says he's happy to keep driving his old Zaporozhets: "It has sentimental value. It used to belong to my parents."
At this point, the woman next to me, the night I saw the play, called out "Awwwww!" impressed with Putin's filial affection.
"I think you put anyone on stage, and you cannot help but humanize them," said Rupert Goold, the director. "That's true of Macbeth."
Berezovsky shepherds the mild-mannered young pol's career, pulling him into Yeltsin's inner circle -- "letting a form of the devil into his orbit," as Goold puts it. When the unlikely Putin ascends to the presidency -- and Stalin's dacha -- he has no intention of being Berezovsky's puppet, or even ally.
As Putin tells his former mentor, people have grown tired of "your treason and treachery, of your criminality and your disloyalty, of your perfidy and your whining and your thieving and your bribes and your decadence -- all of which you dress up as patriotism and some kind of 'political movement."'
MORGAN, WHO LOVES WRITING about power, saw the abuse of power at an early age. His German Jewish father fled before the war to escape the Nazis, and his Roman Catholic Polish mother fled after the war to escape the Soviets. They raised Peter in Wimbledon.
"The culture in the house that I grew up in was: You can lose anything overnight," he said. "It was a very, very Jewish culture that I grew up in, but also people who'd lost everything. Immigrants who come to a country with nothing. Both of my parents came to the U.K. with a paper bag."
Does Berezovsky's Jewishness inform the play?
"A lot of the first generation of oligarchs were Jewish," Morgan said. "Interestingly, Putin has a very positive relationship with Jews. There's nothing antisemitic about Putin, I don't think."
Morgan describes his characters as "four people with very different views about patriotism, what's best for Russia, and very different views of each other."
After Berezovsky's death, Putin's aides claimed that the castoff puppet master had written the president, apologizing for his "mistakes" and asking to come home to Russia; Berezovsky's last girlfriend said it was true. Morgan had this in the London version but left it out of the Broadway version because, as Goold said, they had "one too many endings."
(At the first Broadway preview, Stuhlbarg was able to go on as Berezovsky, even though the day before he had been hit with a rock by a homeless man in Central Park; in an odd twist, the suspect was caught near the Russian consulate on the Upper East Side.)
Losing the London court case to Abramovich broke Berezovsky, both financially and emotionally. Seven months after the verdict, he was dead. He was found hanging in his bathroom in his mansion outside London. People are still arguing whether it was a suicide or a murder.
Morgan said that originally he wanted "to make it really unambiguously a suicide, because if you put me on a lie-detector test, I would probably say that's what it was. I've gone down that rabbit hole so many times. I've said, 'Why was there no camera footage of anybody? There were no cars leaving. He was found in a bathroom locked on the inside."'
He asked Khrushcheva where she stood on the matter. "I am one of those people who think that you can expect everything and anything from the K.G.B.," she said, adding that she wouldn't put anything past Putin "ever."
After the Russian opposition leader Aleksei A. Navalny' s death in February in an Arctic penal colony, Morgan decided to make the cause more ambiguous. "I kept thinking that it was almost a disrespect to Navalny, and a disrespect to the other political prisoners to put Boris's death as unambiguously a suicide," he said, adding, "There was known to be a hit squad in the U.K. at the time."
Russian oligarchs are of particular interest in London, where "Patriots" originated. Litvinenko was killed there. Berezovsky went into self-imposed exile and died there. Abramovich was the owner of the Chelsea Football Club until forced by sanctions to sell it. "These are all characters that we all felt connected to," Morgan said.
But Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the death of Navalny, have fueled curiosity about Putin and his rise. At one point in the play, Putin rages that Berezovsky has sent millions to help fund Ukraine's Orange Revolution "against his own country -- the country he claims to love."
"The reality of Ukraine," Morgan said, "has somehow seeped into the way in which an audience responds to Putin."
I asked Morgan if Berezovsky was really so different from American billionaires who finance everything from presidential campaigns to Supreme Court vacations to satellite use over Ukraine? He replied that "oligarchy exists everywhere."
"They have the power and influence of nation-states," he said. "They're supra governmental, and they're supranational, actually."
And what if an American oligarch cuts out the middlemen and simply makes an unlikely climb to power himself? I ask Khrushcheva if she understands Trump's obsession with Putin.
She said that Putin was trained as a K.G.B. recruiter and therefore was capable of "amazing charm," a "nobody pimple who came from Leningrad" who managed to leave the intelligentsia and the oligarchs "absolutely smitten."
She surprised Morgan when she said she would rather have dinner with the murderous Vladimir than the roguish Boris. "I met him twice and he was probably as charming as Bill Clinton," Khrushcheva said of Putin.
Outside the theater the night of the first preview, I chatted with Morgan and his girlfriend, the actress Gillian Anderson, who played Margaret Thatcher in "The Crown" and stars as anchorwoman Emily Maitlis in the new Netflix drama "Scoop," about the BBC interview with Prince Andrew about his seamy friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.
The Netflix power duo -- the streaming giant is a co-producer of "Patriots" and is considering a screen adaptation -- appeared cozy, both with startling blue eyes and a casual-glam look, greeting friends and fans. So how is the romance going, I wondered.
"We're just two old people trying to be in love," said the very private Morgan. "Stop it!"
And what about the royals? When he sees the monarchy roiled by searing dramas, doesn't he get the urge to go once more, unto the breach, and explore the new traumas of Harry and Meghan, Kate and William, Charles and Camilla? Isn't Meghan's American Riviera Orchard brand a siren song for a royal troubadour?
"Not even for a split second," he said.

Head of Struggling Warner Bros. Discovery Received a $50 Million Pay Package in 2023: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The chief executive's 2023 pay package rose 26 percent from the year before, while the company's losses totaled $ 3 billion.
David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, received $ 49.7 million in compensation last year, a 26 percent increase from the previous year, according to a proxy statement filed on Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
It is common for chief executives in media to receive lavish pay packages. Mr. Zaslav's compensation for 2023 is notable, however, because Warner Bros. Discovery is not exactly a portrait of health. Losses totaled $ 3 billion in 2023, which was actually an improvement from $ 7 billion in losses the year before. Revenue fell 4 percent, largely because of the company's atrophying cable television business, which includes CNN.
In addition, Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders sent a clear message about Mr. Zaslav's pay at the company's most recent annual meeting: It's too high.
In a nonbinding "say on pay" vote, only 50.8 percent of shareholders approved of the $ 39.3 million he was paid in 2022. Approval by less than 70 percent is considered "low support" by ISS, a leading corporate governance firm.
For 2023, the Warner Bros. Discovery board adjusted compensation formulas for its top executives. The adjustment involved certain bonuses -- tying them more to the generation of free cash flow, which is helpful in paying down debt, and less to the company's stock price. (Shares have lately traded at about $ 8, down from $ 24 two years ago.)
In terms of free cash flow, Warner Bros. Discovery had a spectacular 2023. Free cash flow totaled $ 6.2 billion, an 86 percent increase from the year before, vastly more than Wall Street had expected. That was partly a result of improved financials at the company's streaming division, which became profitable. The union strikes that shut down Hollywood for six months also contributed, saving on production costs.
The money allowed Warner Bros. Discovery to trim its total debt by 11 percent, to $ 44.2 billion, in 2023.
Mr. Zaslav's compensation for 2023 included a $ 3 million base salary and long-term stock awards of $ 23 million, according to the proxy. He also received $ 22 million in cash, a payment guaranteed by a 2021 employment contract and related to his role in merging Discovery and WarnerMedia. (In 2021, Mr. Zaslav, then running Discovery, received compensation valued at $ 246.6 million.) An additional $ 1.6 million was related to security and personal use of the corporate jet.
"We were impacted by the changing landscape of advertising spending and continued weakness in the advertising market overall; declines in linear television viewing; increased competition from other traditional media companies and the enhanced presence of large technology companies in the media space; lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on movie-theater attendance," Warner Bros. Discovery said in the proxy.
Despite those challenges, Mr. Zaslav "provided exceptional leadership and delivered on several financial, operational and strategic priorities," the company said. (It also gave hefty raises to its chief financial officer, president of streaming, chief revenue and strategy officer, and international president.)
To compare, Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, received a pay package worth $ 31.6 million in 2023, a 31 percent decline from 2021. (In the interim, he retired and unretired.) Ted Sarandos, Netflix's co-chief executive, received $ 49.8 million, on a par with a year earlier. Bob Bakish, chief executive of the troubled Paramount Global, was paid $ 31.3 million in 2023, down 2 percent.
Pay packages like these -- when entertainment companies have been walloped by the shift to streaming from traditional television -- played a major role in the union strikes. "They plead poverty, that they're losing money left and right when giving hundreds of millions of dollars to their C.E.O.s," Fran Drescher, the president of the actors' union, said at July rally. "It is disgusting."
Most of the big media companies slashed costs in 2023, laying off thousands of people and announcing plans to make fewer movies and television shows. But Mr. Zaslav and his lieutenants have been particularly aggressive, even shelving nearly finished content like "Batgirl" and "Coyote vs. Acme."
"We said no sacred cows," Mr. Zaslav said at The New York Times's DealBook Summit in November.

Nine Arrests In Gold Heist From Airport In Canada: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The stolen gold was partly used to buy guns that were bound for Canada, the police said.
It was a brazen theft: thousands of gold bars and millions of dollars in bank notes stolen a year ago from Toronto's international airport.
On Wednesday, Canadian authorities announced the arrest of nine people, including an Air Canada employee, in connection with the theft of more than 20 million Canadian dollars, about $ 14.5 million, in gold bars and 2.5 million dollars, about $ 1.8 million, in bank notes that vanished from a warehouse at Toronto Pearson Airport in April 2023.
Arrest warrants have also been issued for three other people, including a manager at the airline.
"This story is a sensational one," Nishan Duraiappah, chief of the Peel Regional Police, said at a news conference on Wednesday, where he stood in front of a truck he said was used in the heist. "One we jokingly say belongs in a Netflix series." The Peel police are responsible for law enforcement at Toronto's airport.
The gold, Chief Duraiappah said, was partly used to buy guns that were bound for Canada. The man who drove the truck used in the gold theft was arrested in Pennsylvania in September after a police officer stopped a rental car he was driving for a traffic violation and found 65 guns, two of which were fully automatic rifles. The man has been charged with conspiracy to illegally traffic firearms into Canada.
It is unclear if that arrest and a separate investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in the United States into the firearms smuggling revealed the broader theft plot. Eric DeGree, a special agent for the A.T.F. who was at the news conference, said that the agency contacted the Peel police after finding the man's name in a police information database.
The gold theft, which Chief Duraiappah said was Canada's largest, appeared to be remarkably simple. The gold and cash arrived at the Toronto airport in a special container aboard an Air Canada flight from Switzerland on April 17, 2023, and was moved to one of the airline's warehouses.
The container held 6,600 gold bars that were destined for a Toronto-based bank and bank notes bound for a currency exchange.
About two hours later, a truck driven by the man who was arrested in Pennsylvania pulled up at the warehouse. The man carried a waybill -- a document usually issued by a carrier with details about a shipment -- that gave him access to the warehouse, the police said.
It was actually a duplicate of a waybill, printed on an Air Canada printer, for a shipment of seafood that had been picked up a day earlier.
The container with the gold bars and bank notes was loaded into the truck.
"They needed people inside Air Canada to facilitate this theft," Mike Mavity, a detective sergeant with the Peel police, said at the news conference.
Video recordings showed the truck traveling down Canada's busiest highway before eventually disappearing from sight in a rural area west of the city.
Peel police officers were called early the next morning after a Brink's armored truck arrived with the actual waybill for the shipment of gold and bank notes.
The police said on Wednesday that they believe the gold bars, which had serial numbers, were all melted down and that they had seized smelting pots. The only gold recovered, the police said, was six bracelets made out of about 89,000 Canadian dollars' worth of pure gold. Among the people arrested was the owner of a jewelry shop in Toronto.
During the news conference, the police displayed two handwritten lists that they said detailed the payouts to the people involved in the theft.
"This is a story about reverse alchemy," said Nando Iannicca, the chairman of the regional government. "This is about how gold becomes guns."

Participant Media, Maker of Movies With a Conscience, Is Shutting Down: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company had critical and commercial hits over two decades but never made money consistently and faced a challenging entertainment landscape.
For 20 years, Participant Media has been Hollywood's pre-eminent maker of activist entertainment, backing socially conscious films like "An Inconvenient Truth," a climate change cri de coeur, and "Wonder," about a boy with birth defects. Its movies have won 21 Academy Awards.
But the company never quite managed to do good while also making money, at least not consistently. Matt Damon in a fracking drama ("Promised Land," a 2012 Participant effort) has a hard time competing with "Avengers: Infinity War" in 3-D.
On Tuesday, the company's founder and financial lifeline, the eBay billionaire Jeff Skoll, pulled the plug -- a decision based, at least in part, on the atrophying entertainment business. Participant relies on studios and streaming services to distribute its content, and those partners are cutting back -- especially on the "niche" films and shows in which Participant specializes -- as they contend with continuing weakness at the box office, higher labor costs and increased profit pressure from Wall Street.
Streaming services like Disney+ and Netflix have started to sell ads, and advertisers prefer all-audience, apolitical content. Eat-your-broccoli documentaries and dramas that explore underrepresented communities (both Participant sweet spots) are harder to sell than ever.
"The entertainment industry has seen revolutionary changes in how content is created, distributed and consumed," Mr. Skoll said in an email to Participant employees that was viewed by The New York Times. A spokesman said Mr. Skoll was unavailable for an interview.
Participant will immediately lay off most of its 100 employees. A skeleton staff will remain for a time to work on coming films like "Out of My Mind," about a nonverbal sixth grader with cerebral palsy, and "BLKNWS," about what the media leave out, or misrepresent, in reporting on Black culture.
Mr. Skoll has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Participant since its founding in 2004. The company, working with partners like DreamWorks, found critical and commercial success with movies like "The Help" (2011), focused on racial reconciliation, and "Spotlight" (2015), about a newspaper's investigation into child abuse.
Participant's documentary film division was second to none. "An Inconvenient Truth," released in 2006, still ranks as one of the most successful documentaries in box office history; it cost $ 1.5 million to make and collected $ 50 million. Participant also backed "The Cove," a searing 2009 documentary about dolphin hunters, and "RBG," an affectionate 2018 portrait of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. (Participant was dealt a blow in 2021 when its longtime president of documentary films, Diane Weyerman, died of lung cancer.)
The company often operated at a loss. When asked about profitability, Participant executives would purse their lips and somewhat impatiently explain the concept of a "double bottom line," meaning performance measured by profit (the first bottom line) or social return (the second).
A money-losing Participant movie could still be "profitable" if the social impact was large enough, they said. "The Soloist," starring Jamie Foxx as a homeless musical genius, cost $ 60 million to make in 2009; it took in $ 38 million. But it went down as a win in Participant's books because of an accompanying action campaign that involved school curriculum guides and the collection and dispersal of 250,000 pairs of jeans to people living on the streets.
Over the last decade, other activism-oriented entertainment entrepreneurs have followed Participant's lead. Ava DuVernay's company, Array, describes its mission as "amplifying work from Black artists, filmmakers of color and women of all kinds." Barack and Michelle Obama founded Higher Ground Productions.
Somewhat paradoxically, Participant itself has rarely been stronger.
David Linde, a former chairman of Universal Pictures, has run Participant since 2015. When he arrived, the company was in crisis. Bets on movies like "The Beaver," focused on mental health, were not paying off. Mr. Linde's predecessor had made the ill-advised decision to start a cable channel, Pivot, and expand into digital publishing. The company's head count swelled to nearly 300.
Mr. Linde shut down Pivot, sharpened Participant's social action campaigns and routed funds toward the development of film and television ideas. The result was a string of critical and commercial hits, including "Roma," a period drama that brought attention to domestic workers, and "Green Book," a racial issues film in the form of a road trip. "Green Book" won the Oscar for best picture in 2019; it cost $ 23 million and sold $ 322 million in tickets worldwide.
Mr. Linde declined to comment on the decision to shut down Participant.
Mr. Skoll's involvement with Participant has waned in recent years. He said in the note to Participant employees that he wanted to focus more on his philanthropic foundation, which champions social entrepreneurship. In 2021, citing smoke from wildfires, he moved to Florida from California.
"I did what I could in my time there and I'm grateful," he wrote on X when he left the state. "Onwards to a new chapter."

Full text: The musical, which stars Nicole Scherzinger, won seven awards at Britain's version of the Tonys. And Sarah Snook won best actress for "The Picture of Dorian Gray."
A reimagining of Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard," starring Nicole Scherzinger as Norma Desmond, the long forgotten silent movie star who descends into madness, was the big winner at this year's Olivier Awards, Britain's equivalent of the Tonys.
The musical, which will open at the St. James Theater on Broadway this fall, was honored Sunday during a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London with seven awards, including best musical revival, best actress in a musical for Scherzinger, best actor in a musical for Tom Francis, as the screenwriter who falls for Desmond's charms, and best director for Jamie Lloyd.
The number of awards was hardly a surprise. After the musical opened last fall, critics praised Lloyd's stark production, especially highlighting its contemporary twists that included using cameras to zoom in on characters' faces, then beam their emotions onto a screen at the back of the stage.
Matt Wolf, writing in The New York Times, said that Lloyd's production belonged firmly "to the here and now." With this show, the director "takes an established musical by the scruff of the neck and sends it careering into the modern day," Wolf added.
Sarah Hemming, in The Financial Times, was among the critics to praise Scherzinger's magnetic performance. "She's not afraid to look scary or ridiculous," Hemming said, "but there's also a strung-out vulnerability about her. And when she sings, she pins you to your seat with the harrowing intensity of her delivery."
"Sunset Boulevard" beat several other acclaimed productions to the best musical revival award, including "Guys & Dolls" at the Bridge Theater and "Hadestown" at the Lyric Theater.
A host of musicals and plays shared the night's other major prizes. "Operation Mincemeat," a word-of-mouth hit about a bizarre World War II counterintelligence plot that is running at the Fortune Theater, won best new musical. While "Stranger Things: The First Shadow," a prequel to the Netflix show, now at the Phoenix Theater, was chosen as best new entertainment or comedy play.
The best new play award went to James Graham's "Dear England," about the English national soccer team, which transferred to the West End from the National Theater.
In the hotly contested acting categories, Sarah Snook ("Succession") was named best actress for "The Picture of Dorian Gray," a solo show running through May 11 at the Theater Royal Haymarket. Snook plays all 26 roles, often interacting with recorded projections of her characters.
Before Sunday's ceremony, some critics had expected the best actor award to go to Andrew Scott for a similarly dazzling solo performance: a one-man "Vanya" at the Duke of York's Theater. In the end, the prize went to Mark Gatiss for his role as the revered actor and director John Gielgud in "The Motive and the Cue," a play by Jack Thorne that dramatizes the fraught backstage relationship between Gielgud and Richard Burton as they worked on a Broadway show. Like "Dear England," that play ran at the National Theater before transferring to the West End.

Full text: I'm a Berlin-based correspondent for The New York Times, covering Germany, Austria and Switzerland. I'm drawn to culture that reflects the history of the place or people I write about, especially in ways that turn my understanding of them on its head. I also gravitate toward art that creates a cultural crossroad between Europe and the Middle East, where I lived and worked for a decade before coming to Berlin.
Kairos
I am in awe of Jenny Erpenbeck's writing. Like all her works, her latest novel is lyrical, yet sparse. Her stories are as much about what is not said as what lies on the page. This story of a torrid affair is not just the story of two lovers, but of the dying days of former East Germany.
Munich Displaced: The Surviving Remnant
This exhibit at Munich's Jewish Museum looks at the history of the Jews who stayed in Germany, or fled there from other parts of Europe, in the wake of World War II. Inside displacement camps, they made soccer teams, Yiddish newspapers and art in the country that had just sought to destroy them. A fascinating chapter of postwar history I knew nothing about.
@berlinauslandermemes
Whenever gray Berlin winters are getting me down, or a German official sniffs some disdainful comment at me, I brush it off by scrolling through this Instagram account devoted to making fun of Berlin, Germans and the foreigners who chose to live among them. Whatever my complaint, it's guaranteed someone has already made a meme about it that I can laugh at.
Kleo
This is a bizarre and rollicking assassin revenge story that is just lots of fun. It really evokes a sense of the heady days of excitement and upheaval after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
Shkoon
This duo -- a Hamburg-born German and a Syrian immigrant -- blends traditional Arab songs and electronic beats with ethereal results. Collaborations like this are compelling to me at a time when hostility toward immigrants in Europe is surging.

Falling Into Manhattan's Embrace: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Dani Lubnitzki, who is better known as Dani Luv, puts his own spin on Sinatra during the week, but on Sundays he shops for his grandchildren and has a jam session with friends.
For more than two decades, Dani Lubnitzki was the resident lounge singer and pianist at Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse on the Lower East Side, where bottles of vodka were served lodged in blocks of ice and the entertainment was as schmaltzy as the chopped liver.
"It's like a disco with comedy," said Mr. Lubnitzki, 67, who performs under the stage name Dani Luv.
The restaurant was a home for the musician, who delivered smutty insults to diners' faces and performed renditions of "Hey Jude" (his version is called "Hey Jew"), "Dayenu" and the Hora six nights a week until the coronavirus pandemic brought indoor dining to halt.
"It was March 14, a Saturday night, we had 300 people on the book," he said. "And we were left with 40. Somehow it was a fun night."
The restaurant shuttered entirely in early 2021, forcing Mr. Lubnitzki to take his one-man show -- garish and heavy on the shiksa jokes -- on the road. He's been hustling as a freelancer ever since. He held a residency at Edith's in Williamsburg in 2022, but has mostly relied on one-off gigs: bar mitzvahs, birthdays and house parties.
Now, Sammy's Roumanian is planning its return, this time at 112 Stanton Street, a few blocks from its previous location on Chrystie Street. The new restaurant will open on May 3, the owner, David Zimmerman, said. Mr. Lubnitzki will be back, too.
He grew up in Israel and moved to New York in 1982 at 25 years old. He later married and moved back to Israel in 1993, but just before he left he landed an unusual, high-profile job as the entertainment for a private party -- for Billy Crystal. It was his first appearance at Sammy's Roumanian. Mr. Lubnitzki and his wife divorced after a few years and in 1998 he returned to New York. A month later he was at the restaurant again, the start of his 22-year-run.
"It was really beshert," he said, using the Yiddish term for destiny. "It was crazy."
Mr. Lubnitzki lives in a one-bedroom apartment in Kew Gardens Hills, Queens.
STILL DARK If I didn't work on Saturday, I will wake up at 5 or 6 in the morning and go to Starbucks, or I'll go to the local diner, Blue Bay Diner, that has the best coffee in the world. And I will have like four or five cups of coffee to get ready for Manhattan's energy.
I like this little adventure, to wake up when it's still dark. I usually get a bagel and cream cheese or an omelet, which I feel more comfortable eating here because there's no bacon on the same grill. I'm not very, very kosher, but when it comes to meat I am.
ALTERNATIVE GREETINGS Then I'll go to Manhattan to meet friends or Linda, my ex-girlfriend. I'm not a subway guy. I have an S.U.V., a little car I lease, and I take the car. That's the reason I can't live in the city. It's crazy with a car. I find parking on Sundays. Usually I'll go to the Lower East Side. I get a lot of: "Dani Luv, Dani Luv, what's going on? When's Sammy's coming back?" And people giving me the finger, all in the spirit of fun. I live for these moments. I love it.
SMELLS LIKE MANHATTAN I'll meet my friends or my ex-girlfriend for lunch, or a late brunch. For lunch, some of our regular spots are The Smith; Pylos, a Greek restaurant; sometimes Little Poland; Veselka; Second Avenue Deli, I love. I was a pescatarian for 13 years, but a year and a half ago I started eating meat again. It's amazing how the compulsion came back for hot pastrami and stuff like that. I like very Eastern European food -- stuffed cabbage -- or very Middle Eastern, like spicy fish, shawarma, hummus and falafel. Also just dairy. I love dairy.
It's like a long Sunday kind of thing: We're sitting for sometimes two or three hours and talking with musicians or just interesting people. I'm an ex-smoker, so afterward coffee, no cigarettes, but some of my friends smoke. I'm a cigarette-holic. Even though I haven't smoked for 14, 15 years, I still love the smell. It smells like Manhattan. It registers fun.
JAM SESSION Food kills me; I need an activity right away. I can fall asleep in the restaurant. Usually we then go to someone's apartment. We may work on comedy or have a jam session. My friends play the saxophone, the flute, the guitar. Some of them are Israelis, some of them American; they're all great musicians. When we're really jamming it could go until very late. I have a lot of friends in the city, but in the middle of the week everyone is busy, so if I have a Sunday it's like a party. I love days -- they're optimistic -- but I'm a night person. Basically, everything is upside down.
THE CITY'S SPOILS Some Sundays I'll go shopping for my six grandkids, especially for kids' clothes. I go with Linda because I don't know what to buy. I mean, I know what to buy for me -- it's always a black shirt and black pants. Those days it's shopping and that's it. Other days we'll go to a museum, or get half-price theater tickets and see a Broadway musical or a straight play, which can be very interesting or boring. The city offers so much culture, but it's because of Linda and other friends who know what's going on that I get to take advantage.
A DOSE OF OPTIMISM When I get home, the first thing is Netflix. I like very optimistic movies. I no longer have a stomach for violence and all that. I watch sweet movies with good endings and love stories that I wouldn't necessarily have watched 20 years ago. Some of them are very good; some of them are plastic. I watch a lot of Christmas movies -- I'll fall asleep with a movie on. I will do half a movie, sleep for a couple of hours, wake up and continue. I'm like a Jewish vampire -- I live in the night.
I'm 67, but I feel like I'm 30 or 40. It's crazy. Hopefully I'll have another 10 years at the new Sammy's, and my Sundays will be there.

Full text: Hoa Xuande had only one Hollywood credit when he was chosen to lead this starry HBO adaptation of a prize-winning novel. He needed all the encouragement he could get.
Some three months into shooting "The Sympathizer," Robert Downey Jr. sat Hoa Xuande down. He had something to show him.
"I remember Rob walking in -- he had this cheeky grin," Xuande recalled on a recent afternoon in Los Angeles. A teaser trailer for the HBO series, an adaptation of Viet Thanh Nguyen's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, had just been cut. Downey, who is the show's executive producer and plays multiple roles in it, saw definitive proof of a star-making turn in "The Sympathizer." He wanted Xuande, the star in question, to see it too.
"There's only one time that I've had this experience before, and it's when I saw the teaser that we brought to Comic-Con for 'Iron Man,"' Downey said. Seeing himself onscreen in the Iron Man suit was what finally convinced Downey that he had done justice to a daunting role.
"And because I'd had that experience," he said, "I knew that he needed it."
In many ways, Xuande (pronounced Shawn-day) did. A 36-year old Vietnamese Australian actor who had one Hollywood credit to his name, he still wasn't sure he was the right choice to lead a series with such an impressive pedigree: an HBO adaptation of an acclaimed novel, produced by the Oscar-winning art-house studio A24, directed by the revered Korean auteur Park Chan-wook and co-starring a screen legend in Downey. He needed all the encouragement he could get.
"I made him watch it six times," Downey said.
Seeing himself in the trailer had finally quieted his doubts, Xuande said, over lunch at a Venice restaurant. He had flown in from his home base in Sydney hours earlier and had barely settled into Downey's spare live-work space, where Xuande sometimes stays.
He first met his co-star on the fourth day of shooting -- Downey was wearing a bulging prosthetic nose and had a skittering Yorkshire terrier in tow. Is that really him? Xuande remembers wondering from afar.
Downey had arrived on set in costume for one of the multiple characters he plays in "The Sympathizer," including a cartoonish professor, an empty-suited congressman and a gonzo filmmaker -- different people who together embody the face of the American establishment. On this day, Downey was Claude, the C.I.A. handler for Xuande's character, who is known as the Captain, a nameless Communist spy whose undercover assignment leads him to Los Angeles after the fall of Saigon in 1975. His role as a double agent in the United States becomes increasingly dicey, bloodying his hands and landing him, for reasons we don't quite know, in the Vietnamese re-education camp where the show opens.
"He made me feel really at home, as much as I could feel," Xuande said of that first encounter. "And then he just put his hand on my shoulder. He was like, 'Buddy, you and me, we're going to screw this up together."'
It put Xuande at ease -- slightly. Before he got the role that could change his life, he had already let it go many times over. He was chosen through a worldwide casting call and a monthslong audition process that included long stretches of radio silence. During those times, he would take nighttime strolls from his home to the Sydney Harbor, where he would sit for hours, making peace with the fact that he probably hadn't gotten the part.
Finally landing it was a profound professional leap: Beyond a side role on Netflix's live-action anime adaptation "Cowboy Bebop," he had spent a decade taking minor parts in Australia. Hollywood had been a faraway notion.
Xuande grew up in Melbourne, the son of bakers who had fled postwar Vietnam.
"They had to escape on a boat," he said. "They were months at sea, and they made it to Indonesia, where they made it to a refugee camp."
Naturally, something as fanciful as acting wasn't on Xuande's radar, and for years he dreamed instead of playing Australian rules football professionally. "I did a random school play once," he said of his early acting experience. "I came on for the last scene of this two-hour play and said two lines."
He added, "I did it because they needed an Asian guy for that moment."
After moving to Sydney for college and juggling odd jobs in his early 20s, he fell in with a group of creative friends and began doing amateur theater. A director saw his potential and pushed him to get training, leading Xuande to the Western Australia Academy of Performing Arts in Perth. After several years of hustling in mostly bit parts, he had a breakthrough with "Bebop," his introduction to the machine of a major Hollywood production. "The Sympathizer," though, was a trial by fire.
Because of visa issues he was unable to join the production until just a week before the intense six-month shoot began. It took place mostly in Los Angeles and Thailand. After a crash course to upgrade his Vietnamese, he found himself on set acting opposite Sandra Oh, another award-winning co-star, and the many versions of Downey, under the direction of Park, who communicated via a translator.
Don McKellar, who was co-showrunner with Park, said Xuande appears in nearly every scene. In describing the demands of the role, McKellar said, "He had to have that kind of charm, he had to have that kind of masculinity, but he still had to have the sensitivity," adding that the director "really wanted him to have an edge, too -- something mysterious about him, that we can look at him and think he's withholding something."
The show's tone strikes a tricky balance between political satire and outright tragedy, and the Captain is the character most responsible for pulling it off. It is a role that is, in essence, about playing roles: In most scenes, Xuande seems to be wearing a mask -- a perpetual knowing smirk, as if he is reacting to a joke he's telling only to himself.
"Everything has to have that flavor of, if I didn't laugh at this, I'd cry about it," Xuande said of his approach.
It was a great deal of pressure for an actor new to Hollywood. But Oh, who plays Ms. Mori, the Captain's love interest, said, "if he was terrified, I never felt it."
"I would always say, 'Are you sleeping?"' she recalled. "And he was just kind of like, 'Nope."'
On set, Oh often stepped up for Xuande, demanding time or boundaries for a newcomer who was suddenly at the top of the call sheet. "Sandra mothered me -- she would speak up on my behalf when I didn't feel comfortable to," Xuande said. "And Robert would father me. He would just look after me on the other side of things."
Xuande shares more screen time with Downey than anyone else, but with Downey's multiple roles, most days required rediscovering their dynamic.
"It was kind of like we were blind dating," Downey said. Their partnership made the recent Oscar winner (for "Oppenheimer") nostalgic for his days as a younger star making films with seasoned actors like Anthony Hopkins and James Woods.
"I was trying to bring the best of what I got and pass it on to him," Downey said.
Xuande is trying to stay levelheaded about his own exposure to the spotlight and what it means for his career. He hopes "The Sympathizer" gets another season -- Nguyen wrote a sequel, "The Committed," published in 2021 -- but Xuande knows the industry can be fickle.
"I hope that it leads to other opportunities," he said. "But I've been saying to my friends that this could be it."
He's joking -- sort of. Even with such a big-ticket series under his belt, he still has the mentality of a gigging actor, climbing his way up.
"You never know: It could be months, years, in between work," he said with a hint of the Captain's smirk. "But I'm happy I got to do this."

A Blank Canvas Named Tom Ripley: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Author: Wilkinson, Alissa

Publication info: Wilkinson, Alissa. 

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/blank-canvas-named-tom-ripley/docview/3034914520/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the new series and in five previous movies, the character serves as a blank slate to examine the mores and concerns of the time.
Tom Ripley's background is always sketchy. Patricia Highsmith provides only a few rudimentary details in the first few chapters of "The Talented Mr. Ripley," her 1955 novel that kicked off a series of five books about the elusive con artist. Tom lives in New York, in near-destitute circumstances. He has some friends -- acquaintances, really -- whom he hates, mentally labeling them "the riffraff, the vulgarians, the slobs." He wants nothing more than to be rid of them, and after the first few chapters, he succeeds. He receives money from an aunt in Boston; she raised him after his parents drowned in the harbor there. He hates her, too.
When we meet Tom, he has been committing check fraud through the mail, amassing payments in the amount of $ 1,863.14 that he does not plan to cash. The con job was, he thinks, "no more than a practical joke, really. Good clean sport." He'll destroy the checks before boarding the ship that will take him to Europe, where he's tasked with hunting down Dickie Greenleaf, the scion of a shipbuilding mogul who's been wasting time, and money, in Italy.
The curious thing about these features of Tom Ripley's life is that they add up to nothing. Highsmith structures them as telling details, the kinds of specifics that writers employ like shorthand to build a person in the reader's mind. But in fact, we get very little from them, and at every turn our attempts to wrap our heads around this character are rebuffed. You might think Tom is a man of taste and talent, except he doesn't exhibit any real taste, and the talent seems limited to a knack for forgery and impersonation. You might think he's a malevolent mastermind seeking to bilk a wealthy family of their fortune, but he's really just pathetic, far more concerned with making sure the Greenleafs view him as a man of their own social class. Unfortunately, he's charmless.
Tom is not particularly handsome, clever or well-connected. He's just miserable, but he doesn't have much in the way of plans, or goals, beyond getting away from where he is.
This does not make Tom Ripley a screen-ready hero. He's not even really a strong template for an antihero. But that has not stopped filmmakers from trying. Five films and now a Netflix series, starring a parade of alluring actors, have tried out various angles on the Ripley question. Who is this guy, really? A criminal? A climber? A sociopath? A thief?
Who knows? He's a mystery, which is what makes him so primed for reinvention. A close look at the various Mr. Ripleys suggests something both confounding and fascinating: Ripley is less character than cipher, an outline of a figure onto which filmmakers (and audiences) have projected their cultural moments. Watching them all is like watching eras swing past you in living color. (And, eventually, in black and white.)
René Clément's 1960 adaptation, "Purple Noon" (streaming on the Criterion Channel and on Kanopy; for rent on most major platforms) stars a very young Alain Delon. It's a curious film, in that even the Americans speak and act French. (Dickie's name is changed to Philippe.) Tom, as played by Delon, is gorgeously off-putting. He's far more alluring than Highsmith's version, but in an unsettling and grasping sense, as if something is not quite right upstairs. You can see the seeds of Barry Keoghan's grifter Oliver from "Saltburn," a vulnerable exterior concealing something more conniving beneath.
The Tom Ripley of "Purple Noon" is an existential hero, in tune with the tenor of his time, and with the novel, too -- after all, the movie was released only a few years after the book's publication. In his own strange sense, he's self-made, the product of amoral choices that define his character, a man without wit or scruples. Held up against the book and its sequels, this seems like a perfect way to translate Tom, even if the details are transposed Frenchily. He is a character without a single essence -- he's not a born killer, not a smooth operator, not really anything in particular -- who is slowly defined over the course of many books: an existential hero, in the classic Sartrean sense. It's also why he's so alarming and addictive. You cannot quite predict what Tom Ripley will do.
It took 17 years to see another cinematic Ripley, this time in "The American Friend" (streaming on Criterion and for rent on most major platforms). Directed by Wim Wenders, this loose adaptation of "Ripley's Game," the third book in Highsmith's series, stars counterculture icon Dennis Hopper as Tom, and it's set in Hamburg, Germany -- another city Highsmith's Ripley never lives.
Tom, now involved in an art forgery scheme, feels slighted by an upright German framer (that is, he frames art) played by Bruno Ganz. It turns into a thriller, heightened noir, a terrifically fascinating take on the character that flamboyantly emphasizes his American-ness. What's most arresting about this Tom is the outfits Wenders puts him in. He's shown early in New York, purchasing a massive Stetson, which he dons proudly. "Do you wear that hat in Hamburg?" a friend asks.
"What's wrong with a cowboy in Hamburg?" he replies.
Indeed. The film's title emphasizes that Tom is American, but so does his get-up: jeans, a denim jacket, his Marlboros, his T-shirts, his loud taste in home furnishings, and of course his hat, all of which mark him out as an American on the streets of what was West Germany. Highsmith saw the film and at first didn't like it; later, Wenders has said, she told him that she had changed her mind, and that it "captured the essence of that Ripley character better than any other films."
What is that essence? It's America. Tom belongs to a postwar world where American power and wealth are fresh and abundant, but American taste varied wildly based on social class. He is the most American of archetypes, the hustler, hawking art that's fake. He is vengeful and loyal at the same time, a man with both power and an endearing simplicity. Couple that with the fact that the film was released one year after the American bicentennial -- in a time of national ennui -- and Ripley's ostentatious Americanness, which contrasts starkly with the aestheticized Europhilia of Highsmith's character, takes on even more significance.
Both Delon and Hopper deliver midcentury takes on Ripley; by the turn of the millennium, the film business wasn't looking for their kinds of characters. In 1999, "The Talented Mr. Ripley," Anthony Minghella's take on the first novel (streaming on Paramount+; for rent on most major platforms), ushered in a different type of Ripley. This version is sometimes held up as faithful to the novel, but that's a misapprehension. Several prominent characters are completely invented. The body count is higher, too. Most important, though, Tom has undergone a transformation. He is now a relatively talented, or at least employable, pianist who is able to quickly develop an appreciation for jazz and to rub shoulders with wealthy Manhattanites. He's pathetically needy but also goofily handsome, all teeth but, let's face it, with the look of a movie star. (Damon was swapping in for Leonardo DiCaprio, the filmmakers' first choice.)
In this version, Tom is also clearly gay, if closeted perhaps even to himself. There are hints in the novel that Tom may be gay, or more accurately worried about appearing gay, in a vague way that suggests he prefers not to look too hard at his own desires. (Highsmith said she didn't think he was gay; he deploys sex only when it's absolutely necessary to secure his station.) But the film is propelled by his desire for Dickie -- to be his, to be him. Watching it, you're reminded of what movies aimed at general audiences were like in 1999, one of the greatest years in Hollywood history. Everyone was beautiful. Everyone was very thin. And everyone seemed to be driven, primarily, by sex.
That's even more obvious in the subsequent movies, made to capitalize on Ripley fever (and its five Oscar nominations), "Ripley's Game" (2004) and "Ripley Under Ground" (2005). The former, directed by Liliana Cavani (and for rent on most major platforms), stars John Malkovich and treads much of the same ground as "The American Friend," but with a very different kind of Tom. Malkovich always brings an air of the discomfiting to his roles, but his Tom is quite different from ravishing Delon or creepy Damon, and not just because he's older. This guy is now just a seductive con artist, a genius with a knack for pulling off sophisticated deceptions and bedding beautiful women. He might freak a few people out, but only because he's so ruthless.
This is not Highsmith's Ripley. It's Hollywood's Ripley. Whereas the adaptation of "The Talented Mr. Ripley" gives Tom a healthy dose of shame and social climbing desperation, "Ripley's Game" is about a suave monster, a cross between the hypercompetent antiheroes who would soon take over prestige television and a conscience-free serial killer.
"Ripley Under Ground" similarly features a hypercompetent Tom stripped of his weirdness. Directed by Roger Spottiswoode, it's probably the most ludicrous of the five movies. (It's also the hardest one to find; it's not even rentable on digital platforms or, as far as I can tell, available on a DVD that will play in the United States.) The movie stars Barry Pepper, with flowing blond locks. He's not good in it, but he is supposed to be not just a con man and a killer, but also a player, immensely desirable, irresistible. This is not a Tom Ripley I recognize.
The latter Ripleys reflect a Hollywood machine with a very narrow imagination. Could you even have a protagonist who wasn't both sexually obsessed and insanely attractive? Would anyone watch a movie where the protagonist wasn't trying to seduce beautiful people?
Thinking about the other Ripleys when watching the new Netflix series "Ripley," stylishly adapted and directed by Steven Zaillian and shot by the great Robert Elswit, can provoke whiplash. It's in black and white, the opposite of previous adaptations' lush sensuality. Andrew Scott, who plays this Ripley, hews as closely to Highsmith's character as I can imagine, aside from being much older (and thus, more desperate and pathetic). His face is often blank, leaving you wondering if he is great at hiding or, alternately, just has nothing to hide. Scott molds his handsomeness into ordinariness; you would never stop to look at him on the street. He seems almost simple, which is why his arc is so chilling. Perhaps a TV show was the right way to give us a window into Ripley's strangeness all along.
But it's not all that interesting to rank the Ripleys. Pop culture is most fascinating as a mirror reflecting us and the people who make it, and Ripley has provided unnervingly canny reflections. Highsmith's Ripley gives a perfect blank slate onto which generations of filmmakers have projected their ideas about the world, and about what it is we want to watch. In the end, perhaps, the frightening, alluring, dangerous thing about Tom Ripley is that he is simply us.

Oklahoma’s Booming Film Industry Has Texas’ Attention

OKLAHOMA CITY — For a very brief moment, Taylor Sheridan’s hit television series starring Sylvester Stallone had the working title “Kansas City Mob.” But at the time, Missouri had no state funding for film subsidies.
“Tulsa King” was born.
“We had the incentive, so we got the name,” said Rachel Cannon, founder of Prairie Surf Studios in Oklahoma City, where much of the show’s first season was filmed.
As Oklahoma poured more and more funding into its rebate program, major productions came to collect. The incentives helped attract “Killers of the Flower Moon,” which was an Oscar nominee for best picture, and the popular television show “Reservation Dogs.”
Eventually, Oklahoma’s program grew to $30 million, slightly more money on an annual basis than what was being offered in the much larger state of Texas. Famous Texans noticed, successfully urging lawmakers last year to increase funding for the program to $200 million for the next two years, from $45 million. Now, Oklahoma is pursuing legislation that would more than double its offerings.
And that is how the Red River Rivalry spilled over from football to film.
“They’ve got a good thing going,” actor Dennis Quaid, a Houston native, said in an interview about Oklahoma and its film incentives. “But there’s no reason why competition can’t be healthy for everybody.”
Economists say the fear of falling behind is a key reason that states continue to set aside money for Hollywood subsidies even though they have a poor return on investment. States have spent more than $25 billion as part of the rough-and-tumble fight to win projects.
It can be particularly hard to stand out when a neighbor offers a more lucrative deal. Under mounting pressure from New Jersey, which hopes to attract a Netflix production hub, New York recently expanded its film incentive program to $700 million a year from $420 million.
A similar border war is brewing in Oklahoma. When Quaid, Matthew McConaughey, Glen Powell, Woody Harrelson and Owen Wilson joined forces in a video last year to call on Texans to support more funding for film and TV, they took a few playful jabs at Oklahoma, which is preparing its counterpunch.
“Thirty million is not enough,” Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell of Oklahoma, who has been pushing a bill that would pump up the state’s incentives to $80 million annually, said in an interview in his office. A separate legislative effort would add many millions solely for episodic television series that include a live studio audience.
“We have to stay competitive,” he said.
For many years, the arid plains and wide skies of Oklahoma did not radiate Hollywood dynamism. But the state is a birthplace of boom, one with an unending appetite for opportunity. So Oklahoma made a major bet on film incentives.
“Killers of the Flower Moon” has received more than $4 million in incentives for filming in the city of Pawhuska, with more payments pending. “Reservation Dogs” filmed a pilot and three seasons in and around Okmulgee with the help of $12.8 million in state funding, and “Tulsa King” got a $14.1 million rebate for the episodes it filmed in Oklahoma City.
Film and TV enthusiasts in Oklahoma insist there is plenty of room for more.
In recent months, the anticipated summer film “Twisters,” a reboot of the 1996 movie “Twister,” took over Prairie Surf, which has 1.3 million square feet of production space in Oklahoma City’s former convention center.
“The only way that I lose is if we don’t have enough money to offer,” said Cannon, who has a framed editorial cartoon involving tax credits and Stallone hanging in her office.
The Cherokee Nation, in northeastern Oklahoma, has also decided that film is a good investment. It has a film office, a cutting-edge soundstage and an incentive program.
“When we bring films here, Georgia strikes out or Texas strikes out,” said Chuck Hoskin Jr., principal chief of the Cherokee Nation. “And if you’re from Oklahoma, you really want Texas to come in second . ”
The film industry, emphasizing the potential return on investment, says states are competing for an industry that creates good jobs and bolsters the local economy.
“The fact that 38 states have implemented programs with bipartisan support to incentivize film, television and streaming productions is because of the industry’s proven economic impact,” Kathy Bañuelos, a senior vice president at the Motion Picture Association, said in a statement.
Andrea Sporcic Klund, director of the Missouri Film Office, knows what it feels like to not be one of the 38. For years, the state smarted over the fact that “Ozark,” the Netflix hit featuring the Lake of the Ozarks, was filmed in Georgia.
Sporcic Klund said that at one trade show, she and her colleagues began making notes every time someone asked whether Missouri had filming incentives.
“It was pages and pages of tally marks, and it was a conversation ender,” she recalled. “We would say, ‘We don’t have an incentive,’ and they would walk away.”
By 2023, after missing out on both “Ozark” and “Tulsa King,” Missouri lawmakers had passed the Show MO Act, which restarted the state’s dormant film and TV incentive program.
Now it is Oklahoma that has been left at the altar. The second season of “Tulsa King” will be filmed primarily in Atlanta, in a state with an uncapped tax incentive program.
Showrunners did not choose Tulsa strictly because of Oklahoma’s rebate program, according to an executive connected to the show, who asked to remain unidentified to share insight into sensitive discussions. And the decision to move to Georgia, the executive said, was made mostly because actors and crew members are more readily available there.
Cannon was left with the impression that the move was largely a financial one.
“They didn’t give us a reason they chose not to stay,” she said, “other than I know they didn’t get enough money back.”
Oklahoma also increasingly has to worry about movies and shows being lured by Texas, which is doing what it does best: Building big.
Last year, Stray Vista Studios, the state’s largest space for virtual production, opened in Dripping Springs, 25 miles west of Austin. Hill Country Studios, a 200-acre production hub in San Marcos, is expected to open its first seven soundstages next year. And a 600-acre project in Bastrop, an hour’s drive from San Marcos, is on the way, too.
“Most Texans like to be bigger and better than everybody, not just Oklahomans,” said Four Price, a House member who last session sponsored an unsuccessful bill that would have created an entirely new incentive program.
Supporters of that effort say it would create more stable funding, in part by giving productions transferable tax credits. (The state’s current program uses cash grants.)
A new video from famous Texans will appear soon, said Chase Musslewhite, who is helping lead a coalition called Media for Texas. By 2025, she hopes to have a new bill to put in front of the Legislature.
How much funding will the group seek?
Musslewhite noted that Georgia’s program has no cap, and that New York and California are able to spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year. “So we would want to be in that realm,” she said. “To be as competitive as that would be the goal.”
Quaid was more precise.
“The next time we come back,” he said, “we’re going to ask for $1 billion.”

Full text: What does ambition look like at 90? How do you explain the drive that makes people like Giorgio Armani, fully in command of his global design empire as he approaches his 10th decade, tick? When the artist Betye Saar wakes every day, she sets to work on creating the assemblages that are widely exhibited and avidly sought by collectors and major museums, artworks with origins she traces to her early girlhood in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, during the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Why bother? Wasn't retirement supposed to be the goal of a contented old age? Didn't the plan call for taking up needlepoint or golf? The old, as it happens, represent a rapidly growing global population: the proportion of those 65 and above is increasing at a faster rate than those below that age, according to World Population Prospects, a United Nations study. Between 2022, when the report was issued, and 2050, the global population of those over 65 is expected to rise from 10 to 16 percent. People are already working longer, and, as they do, it would appear that a road map is needed, a means of understanding what keeps people like Martha Stewart, at 82, not only undiminished by age but actively in the game.
Over the course of the past months, we asked what makes people like Ms. Stewart so seemingly unstoppable. Is there an explanation for why, besides prosperity and good health, some people are driven to chase their dreams long past the age when recent history suggests we were meant to be kicking back in our rocking chairs? -- Guy Trebay Below, Martha Stewart explains, in her own words, what continues to motivate her.
This year I made time to grow the best vegetables, monster vegetables, that I've ever grown in my life. My houses are never done. And I'm writing my autobiography. That's the scariest project for me because I don't really like everything about myself -- where I've been, what I've done.
I get up at 6:30 every morning. My housekeeper comes at 7, and I can't be in bed when she arrives. That would be very embarrassing. I'm a bad sleeper, in any case. At times I'd rather watch a documentary. Other times, I might be anxious, not for me but for my grandchildren. If I wake in the night, I read the headlines to make sure we're not being bombed.
Maybe a little uncertainty can help fuel ambition. When I left my job on Wall Street, I knew I had to create a career for myself. I became a caterer, catering parties every night. Still I thought, "Will there come a time when my granddaughter -- she's 12 -- is asked, "What did grandma do?" And all she can say is "Oh, she made parties for people." I thought, "I have to do something more than this." That was in the 1980s, when I wrote my first book, the one on entertaining.
At that time I wasn't keeping my eye on the home, even though I was known as a homemaker. It wasn't enough for a marriage. Maybe I regret not having had more children. Maybe I regret that my marriage ended abruptly. We'd been together 27 years. That used to be considered a long time, so when a long marriage ended, it was like somebody died. Maybe I would have liked getting married again. I didn't, but I don't mind. Still, I'm curious about what could have been.
My never-ending curiosity drives me. Will it stop? That's never even occurred to me.
Current and upcoming projects: Autobiography in progress; an untitled Martha Stewart documentary from R.J. Cutler, who directed "The September Issue," to stream on Netflix in 2024; a PBS documentary series, "Hope In the Water," set for broadcast in 2024; a partnership with Samsung for a 2023-2024 advertising campaign; a line of gardening clothes and accessories in collaboration with French Dressing Jeans and Marquee Brands.

From Sidekick to Action Hero: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: With his feature filmmaking debut, "Monkey Man," Dev Patel joins a list of performers known for dramas taking on unlikely parts.
Ten years ago, when Dev Patel started thinking about making the film that would eventually become his feature directing debut, "Monkey Man," he was not getting offered roles that, in his words, had "any sort of ass kickery involved or coolness."
"I think if I was to feature in an action film back then, the roles I was getting were more akin to the comedic relief, sidekick, the guy that can hack the mainframe," he said in a phone interview. (Indeed in 2014, he was playing a tech-savvy character on the TV series "The Newsroom" and was about to reprise his role as the sweet but goofy romantic hero in "The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.")
In "Monkey Man," however, Patel is not relegated to the sidelines. He plays Kid, a young man who slashes, punches and shoots his way through elite circles in a fictional Indian city. He seeks revenge on behalf of his mother, who was brutalized by a police chief now working for a corrupt politician, who is in turn supported by an evil guru. Inspired by the tales of the half-monkey Hindu god Hanuman, Kid takes on those in power who are abusing members of lower castes. The film, which was released Friday, is both Patel's homage to the action genre, an obsession that started when he watched Bruce Lee's "Enter the Dragon" (1973) as a child, and an attempt to remake it in his own image, wanting to tell a politically charged story with a hero who looks like him.
"Monkey Man" also marks Patel, 33, best known for his turn in the Oscar best picture winner "Slumdog Millionaire" (2008), as the latest actor to transform himself into an action star. Gone are the days when the genre belonged to the Sylvester Stallones, Jason Stathams and Jackie Chans of the world. Especially, in a post-"John Wick" era, actors who made their names in serious dramatic work (and sometimes comedy) have decided to make the leap to action.
The "Better Call Saul" star Bob Odenkirk, after playing a retired assassin in "Nobody" (2021), is now set to reunite with that film's screenwriter, Derek Kolstad, for an action flick called "Normal." In 2022, David Harbour, from "Stranger Things," turned into a terrorist-pummeling Santa for "Violent Night." And this year, Jake Gyllenhaal is throwing punches in "Road House," while Ryan Gosling is getting his stunt man on in "The Fall Guy." (Both of those men have flirted with action before, it is worth noting.)
"I think a lot of actors have always wanted to do action, but I think they always felt like they couldn't or we could never lift a movie with them in it," Kelly McCormick, a producer on "The Fall Guy," "Nobody" and "Violent Night," said, adding, "Now it's actually within reach." McCormick is the founder of 87North Productions alongside her husband, the "Fall Guy" director David Leitch, who co-directed the first "John Wick" with Chad Stahelski, and also made "Atomic Blonde," starring another action convert, Charlize Theron.
McCormick said that before the success of "John Wick" and "Nobody," it was hard to get action movies made featuring actors who didn't fit the typical mode of Hollywood action heroes. One of their coming films, "With Love," stars Ke Huy Quan, the supporting actor Oscar-winner in 2023 for "Everything Everywhere All at Once"; it's his first leading role. "He will be the next unique action star," McCormick said.
All of these parts keep the appeal of what makes these stars a draw, while adding more bloodletting. The gruff but jolly persona that makes Harbour interesting on his Netflix show translates to the Christmas melee. Gyllenhaal brings his slyly nervy energy to the role of a former UFC fighter turned bouncer. Gosling's "Fall Guy" character has the lovelorn qualities of his turns in "The Notebook," "La La Land" and "Barbie."
Patel is well aware that he's played the unlikely hero throughout his career, which took off with "Slumdog Millionaire," in which his character, the young worker Jamal, rises from poverty to win a game show. "I was like, maybe we can take the essence of that guy from 'Slumdog' or whatever," he said. "How hard would it be for him to challenge the untouchable, one of the most powerful men in the country?"
A similar reflection on his own fame led Odenkirk to "Nobody." When he first got the itch to do an action movie, it was because he realized he had a global fan base from "Better Call Saul" and wanted to make a movie to market internationally, he said in an interview. He believed the scrappiness of the lawyer Saul Goodman, the character originally from "Breaking Bad," was essentially that of an action hero minus the punches. Shooting fight sequences for "Nobody" reminded Odenkirk of being in a comedy writers room, which is where he got his start working on "Saturday Night Live" and "Mr. Show With Bob and David."
"I was surprised at that degree of camaraderie, fun, problem-solving," he said. Odenkirk, who added that he "hated exercise" before taking on the role, trained for two years with the stunt actor Daniel Bernhardt.
Patel, who practiced martial arts when he was younger, had to be a lot more resourceful given the lo-fi nature of the "Monkey Man" production in Indonesia. He said that he bulked up by eating a diet of salmon, sweet potato and lettuce three times a day for nine months, and by doing resistance band and body weight workouts in the hotel. "It started off like super Jane Fonda," he said.
That make-do attitude fit the story he was trying to tell about Kid's fighting, which goes from tussling in an underground wrestling ring to besuited action more like Wick. "I wanted to capture a sense of desperation in the performance and the choreography," he said. "He's kind of a cornered animal that will do anything to survive, his teeth showing, drooling, biting, truly primal. As he improves as the film goes on, he starts to kind of master his emotions and his style becomes more steely and composed." And yet in one climactic fight he does use his teeth to drag a knife across a foe's throat.
Patel had his doubters. One of the film's producers, Jomon Thomas, said that while buyers and distributors appreciated Patel's performances, they were unsure about whether he could handle the directing or the heavy action. Even the fight choreographer, Brahim Chab, was at first skeptical. "He pulled me aside one day and said, 'I've seen Dev, he's an amazing actor,' and he's one of the best out there, but the choreography is going to be really tough physically, is he up to it?"' Thomas said, adding that Chab's fears were quelled after the first training session.
Patel described the action as "some of the hardest performing I've ever had to do." In the process of filming he broke "some toes" and his hand, and tore a shoulder muscle. "I'm no Jackie Chan," he said of the action star who has suffered a number of injuries on sets. "But it's pretty hard."
Still, Patel didn't make "Monkey Man" as a calling card for more action roles. "To be honest, I never really thought past it," he said. "This was a very specific story and I thought, 'Wow, what an amazing way to explore our mythology and revitalize it and change it and apply it to our times."'
He said he enjoyed the experience, but it took a lot out of him. "I pulled all of myself into it and broke a lot of myself during it."

Full text: Jeremiah Brent, the newest cast member of Netflix's "Queer Eye," shows how he styles the shelves in the home he shares with his husband, Nate Berkus.
In a public library, styling a bookshelf is easy: Just fill it with books. At home, a bookcase needs to do a lot more than hold books.
So how do the pros do it?
Start by thinking of your shelves as a kind of three-dimensional wallpaper that adds visual interest to a room. The things you choose to display should express your personality.
"It's like a little cabinet of curiosities," said Jeremiah Brent, an interior designer and the newest cast member of Netflix's "Queer Eye." Your bookshelves, he added, offer "an opportunity for people to look in and see where you've been and where you're going."
In the Manhattan home he shares with his husband, Nate Berkus -- a much-photographed space featured in Mr. Brent's new book, "The Space That Keeps You," and often seen on Instagram, as well -- the bookshelves in the den are always changing. But they're usually filled with stacks of favorite design books, photos of loved ones and pieces of art made by their children, Poppy and Oskar.
"It's about having fun and playing around with different ways to layer things in and tell your story," Mr. Brent said. Here's how he does it.
Choose Your Favorite Books
Stuffing your shelves completely full of books can look great, especially in a home library. But if you want to mix in objects, art and photos, you may have to pick and choose which books to display.
Start by choosing ones with good-looking covers. "We try to keep the colors coordinated in groupings," Mr. Brent said, hastening to add: "We also try to keep them within their category: art, history, décor, jewelry or whatever it may be."
Well-worn paperbacks and other less attractive books can be stored elsewhere. In Mr. Brent's home, cabinets with doors at the bottom of the bookshelves hold the overflow.
Stack Them Up
Don't line up your books in endless rows. Instead, try building stacks.
"There are things we do that really help" to create a collected look, Mr. Brent said, "like mixing books horizontally and vertically."
When you're adding a horizontal stack to a shelf, "usually, piles of three or more feels nice," he said. Also, "think about mixing different heights."
On some shelves, Mr. Brent may stack lots of books to create a stepped pyramid that fills the space. On others, he may use only a few to create a pedestal for other objects.
Add Objects That Mean Something
Your bookshelves shouldn't resemble something out of a catalog: Forget about displaying anything impersonal, even if it looks nice. This is the place to show off things you have collected over many years.
"We've got artifacts that my husband and I have collected since we met," Mr. Brent said. "Everywhere we go, we pick up pottery or funny little sculptures. We've got tassels from curtains in old homes that we've kept and laid across books. We've got feathers that my daughter grabbed. It's a mishmash of everything that we find beautiful, or an expression of somewhere we've been."
The goal?
"The existential step I have for people," Mr. Brent explained, "is to try to figure out a way they can incorporate their past and present, but still leave room for the future."
Create Balance
Once you've selected most of the books and objects you want to display, you're still only halfway there.
Now, Mr. Brent said, "you've got to play around with balance and scale."
The goal is to spread the pieces across the shelves equally -- mixing tall and short, light and weighty objects -- so you don't end up with some sections that looked stuffed while others feel emptier.
"If you've got a shelf that's heavy with books," Mr. Brent suggested, "lighten it up with some objects next to it."
Even for design pros, he said, "there are no rules." Balance can be achieved only through trial and error.
"It only really happens," he continued, "when you get up there and play with it."
Hang Interesting Pieces on Top
For the ultimate layered look, use picture hangers to mount one or a few special pieces of art on the front of the bookcase.
"I love to hang art on the face of the bookshelf," Mr. Brent said, "so it almost feels like things are spilling out."
And not just framed artwork: Sometime he'll adorn a bookcase with other pieces, like ceramic beads or a mirror finished in shell.
"I love the organized chaos of a bookshelf that spills over with story," Mr. Brent said.

A Con Man With Restraint: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Andrew Scott stars in a Netflix series that looks like what you might get if Antonioni or Resnais had directed a season of "The White Lotus."
Patricia Highsmith's 1955 novel "The Talented Mr. Ripley" sets its dark action in a succession of colorful Italian locales: the Amalfi coast, San Remo, Rome, Palermo, Venice. Movies based on the book, like René Clément's "Plein Soleil" (released in the United States as "Purple Noon") and Anthony Minghella's "The Talented Mr. Ripley," have taken the opportunity Highsmith gave them to capitalize on sun and scenery. The audience gets its brutal murders and brazen deceit wrapped in bright visual pleasure.
For "Ripley," an eight-episode adaptation of the book that premieres on Netflix on Thursday, Steven Zaillian has decided to do without the color. Shot -- beautifully -- in sharply etched black and white by the Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Elswit ("There Will Be Blood"), "Ripley" offers a different sort of pleasure: the chilly embrace of the art house.
Reflecting what the more high-minded filmmakers of the show's time period (it is set in 1961) were up to, Zaillian, who wrote and directed all the episodes, takes an approach that harmonizes with Elswit's austerity. The entire season moves along sleekly -- you could say somnolently -- at the same measured pace, with the same arch tone and on the same note of muted, stylish apprehension. Highsmith's pulpy concoction, with its hair-trigger killings and sudden reversals, is run through a strainer and comes out smooth. It feels like what you might get if the early-'60s Antonioni or Resnais had directed a season of "The White Lotus."
And Zaillian appears to have asked his actors to practice a similar restraint. Their overall affect isn't flat, exactly, but it's within a narrow range, with physicality tightly reined in and the eyes asked to do a lot of work. When you have the eyes of Andrew Scott, the gifted Irish actor ("Sherlock," "Fleabag") who plays Tom Ripley, that's not a big problem.
Zaillian has been faithful, in broad outline, to Highsmith's story. Ripley, a slacker and a con man grinding out a living in postwar New York, is sent to Italy to try to persuade a trust-funded idler to come home and take over the family business. He has only a passing acquaintance with his target, Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn), but in the first of a long series of misunderstandings and lucky strokes that go Ripley's way, Greenleaf's father thinks they are good friends.
Highsmith's novel is a training manual for the sociopath: Once Ripley sees the indolent lives led by Greenleaf and his sort-of girlfriend, Marge Sherwood (Dakota Fanning), in a picturesque fishing village on the Amalfi coast, he ups his game from tedious grifting to full-contact identity theft. Wedging himself between Dickie and Marge, he becomes obsessed -- an obsession in which the lines between befriending Dickie, sponging off Dickie and becoming Dickie are progressively erased.
The novel is both a psychological study and, in its second two-thirds, a parlor trick, as Highsmith maneuvers Ripley into and out of one seemingly disastrous setback after another. "Ripley" stays more firmly on the surface, and Zaillian makes a number of changes, small and large, that maintain the tension while making the story's convolutions more believable. (At one point Ripley actually dons a disguise, something he never bothers to do in the book. And his successful forgery of a will, which severely stretched credulity, is dispensed with.)
Rationalizing the plot does not make it more enjoyable, however, and Zaillian's elevation of the material takes some of the low life out of it. There is also an overlay of condescension -- Zaillian is not kind to his characters, especially Marge, who is now equal parts tasteless, uptight and mercenary -- and occasionally a knowing, simplistic humor that feeds into the patronizing tone.
The greatest effect is on the character of Ripley. To be fair, it was easier for Highsmith to suggest the operatic intensity of Ripley's aspirations and the desperate need he feels to escape his previous life and his previous self. But in Zaillian's conception, Ripley is simply less interesting -- more pitched toward cunning and greed, less toward passion. The charm he requires to carry out his schemes is less evident, and the sympathy for him that Highsmith drew from her readers is harder to realize.
Within those confines, Scott does an admirable job. He can't give the character the vivid life you would like in someone who is onscreen for most of an eight-hour series. But he does a meticulous job of portraying Ripley's transition from shifty timidity to insolent confidence, from lost boy to aesthete, through subtle shifts of expression and posture. As Ripley's schemes keep meeting with success, Scott's eyes somehow become both softer and more challenging. Flynn is also good as Greenleaf, well meaning but, in today's terms, trapped by his privilege. Fanning, a fine actress, is perfectly capable as Sherwood but the character is a hollow shell.
Zaillian and Elswit's "Ripley" certainly has its good points -- it is gorgeous to look at, in its own way, and within the cool approach there are ideas that pay off. Ripley's sexuality is undefined but heavily hinted at, as it was in the book, but Zaillian brings the question to the surface in the final episode in a way that is both chilling and poignant. Zaillian also creates a thematic link between Ripley and the artist Caravaggio -- both murderously angry and jealous, each supreme in his field of art -- that is not especially interesting but that involves a lot of screen time for magnificent paintings.
Those with a nostalgic love for a certain sort of cinematic experience are likely to be strong fans of the highly controlled, hermetic "Ripley." (A cameo by John Malkovich, playing a character from Highsmith's second Ripley novel, "Ripley Under Ground," is a promise of more seasons to come.) A clue to what the viewer is in for comes at the end of every episode, when the credits begin "Directed by Steven Zaillian," "Written for television by Steven Zaillian" and "Created for television by Steven Zaillian."

Full text: Julian Phethean's first canvas in London was a shed in his backyard where he covered the walls with bold lettering in spray paint. When he moved his art to the city's streets in the 1980s, it was largely unwelcome -- and he was even arrested a few times.
"We had nowhere to practice," he said. "It was just seen as vandalism."
These days, the canvases come to Mr. Phethean, better known as the muralist Mr Cenz. Recent facades, which he shares with his sizable following, have included an abstract mural on a Tesla showroom and a portrait of Biggie Smalls, sponsored by Pepsi Max.
"I never would have envisioned that I'd be able to do it for a living," he said.
Landlords wanting to attract young professionals once scrubbed off the rebellious scrawls. That was before graffiti moved from countercultural to mainstream. Now building owners are willing to pay for it.
From Berlin to London to Miami, the wider acceptance of graffiti has attracted developers looking to expand into trendy areas, companies wanting to relocate to hipper neighborhoods and brands seeking creative ways to advertise their products.
But that attention to once overlooked neighborhoods has pushed up rents, leaving artists, fans and local officials with a quandary: What happens after the street art that brought character becomes commodified?
Contemporary graffiti traces back to the anti-establishment expression of the 1960s and 1970s, when anyone with a can of spray paint could tag the sidewalks of Philadelphia and the subway cars of New York. In Soviet-era Berlin, protesters splattered the west side of the wall while the east side remained blank -- until it fell in 1989, opening vast new canvases overnight.
The gallery world took note, but it was social media and the fame of artists like Banksy, Vhils and Lady Pink that propelled it to a wider audience. What followed was a movement that experts say has been reproduced from Australia to Argentina, as street art added to a neighborhood's cultural cachet.
Take Shoreditch in east London as an example: Decades ago, developers deemed it a run-down industrial area. Still, it was a sanctuary for artists who made use of cheap rents to build a creative enclave.
"What artists bring is a sense of buzz: newness, creativity, trends," said Rosie Haslem, managing director of Streetsense UK, a consulting agency. "Hipsters attract more hipsters who have more money and are able to start paying higher prices."
That buzz also drew developers and companies that sought to leverage the popularity of Shoreditch. A former tea-packing plant now hosts a branch of the private members' club Soho House. Down the road is Amazon's largest corporate office in the region.
Spray painters still add political messages to the mosaic of artwork in east London. But they are nestled between more commercial interests: hand-painted campaigns sponsored by L'Oréal, Sky and Adidas, and street tours that treat the art as a tourist attraction.
Many campaigns are from agencies that act as middlemen between artists and the businesses interested in their work.
"We were splashing around in the water and a wave came," said Lee Bofkin, a co-founder of Global Street Art, a London advertising agency. In the decade since its inception, it has grown to more than 30 employees, and Adidas, Moncler and Valentino have leased its walls.
Developers are responsible for a chunk of the 300 or so murals splattering Miami's Wynwood neighborhood. The windowless walls of the former garment district had long appealed to graffiti artists, but one developer helped drive the 2009 opening of the Wynwood Walls, an open-air gallery visited by three million people each year.
"We had to find a carrot to try to bring investment into the area," said Manny Gonzalez, the executive director of the Wynwood Business Improvement District. Street art, he said, was the lure. "We knew that we needed to keep the art."
Five years ago, there were no office buildings in Wynwood. Now, tenants include Spotify, the accounting firm PwC and the venture capitalist Founders Fund. Sony Music has leased office space there. And tech companies from San Francisco and New York are coming, Mr. Gonzalez said.
Those employees will need somewhere to live, and developers are betting they stay local. At the forefront is the Related Group, a developer that has built a "market rate" co-living apartment building with a rooftop pool and a distinctive mural by the artist El Mac. Last year, Related broke ground on luxury condominiums, and it commissions artists to add visual flair to its buildings.
"Every lobby, every hallway, common space, public area of the building has art in it," said Patricia Hanna, art director at Related. "The philosophy is to continue what Wynwood is."
For investors, backing buildings in these districts is paying off. In Shoreditch, leasing a prime work space cost about $ 90 per square foot in the last quarter of 2023, according to CBRE, 112 percent higher than the same quarter in 2008. Rents in the City of London, the financial district, increased 40 percent in the same period.
The asking price for office leases in Wynwood was about $ 80 per square foot in the fourth quarter of 2023, 83 percent higher than the average in Miami-Dade County, according to Colliers.
The east side of the Berlin Wall in Friedrichshain is now an open-air gallery, and the average rent in the area has doubled in the past 10 years, higher growth than in neighboring districts, according to Savills. Developers have tried to bring that artistic buzz to other neighborhoods: One popular exhibit, The Haus, was hosted in a former bank by a developer, Pandion, which later replaced the old building with sleek condominiums. All of them have sold.
A large outdoor facade could cost six figures, said Charlotte Specht, a co-founder of Basa Studio, an agency in Berlin that has helped street artists collaborate with brands like Maybelline and Netflix. Brands eager for campaigns have a demographic in mind for their target customers: "They use Uber, they have an Apple Mac, they get their latte to go, they travel," Ms. Specht said.
Street art had acted as "a powerful engine" to turn some neighborhoods into economic and cultural centers, said Thomas Zabel, managing director of Savills Germany. "Everybody wants to live there."
But officials are wondering how to regulate street art, and whether the commercialization changes a neighborhood's identity.
In Lisbon, a municipal body called the Urban Art Gallery presides over new creations, resulting in a visual feast: Street art is splashed on walkways and train stations, and officials have pushed street art festivals and tours to beautify the city's rougher neighborhoods. International students, digital nomads and foreign investors have rushed in.
Researchers say Lisbon has successfully used that art to brand itself as a hip destination. But its revival is divisive for the city's less privileged, who argue that they have been pushed out of their homes.
In Wynwood, property owners promise that they intend to preserve the neighborhood's artistic heritage. New buildings must include some art on their facades, and hand-painted advertisements are illegal.
But those regulations, some say, have led to diminishing organic spaces for artists, who cannot make the most of sponsored opportunities. "The developers become gatekeepers to some extent as to what the public gets to see," said Allison Freidin, a co-founder of Miami's Museum of Graffiti. "And you hope that the developers make a great decision."
A harder-to-quantify cost is the displacement of residents who can no longer afford to live there.
"It's really seen as a success story: Oh, look how art transformed this desolate area of a wasteland into this beautiful successful hipster area with restaurants and tourists," said Rafael Schacter, an anthropologist at University College London. The art, he believes, has been complicit in erasing communities for not being "the right kind of people."
Residents have pushed back. In Kreuzberg, a cultural haven near Berlin's old wall, residents criticized the opening of a Google tech incubator, which eventually moved elsewhere. Artists there have painted over their own murals to protest gentrification and voiced concerns over sponsored content's replacing public art. In Los Angeles, graffiti artists risked trespassing charges to slather an abandoned luxury tower, which in turn has boosted curiosity toward it.
Aware of the tensions, businesses have started charitable arms that their commercial projects help fund. Some, like Global Street Art, paint murals in local neighborhoods. Others, like Basa Studio, say they want to help artists get paid fairly for their contributions.
But places like Shoreditch have already lost their edge as they have turned mainstream, Ms. Haslem of Streetsense, the consulting agency, said. "The risk in commodifying or commercializing some of this graffiti is you end up sanitizing it," she said.
"It's a double-edged sword," said Dean Stockton, who has painted for years under the name D*Face. He was disconcerted by the number of tourists on buses who stared as he worked on a recent Wynwood mural with the words "I WANT TO LEAVE."
"If you are going to dance with the devil," he said, "make sure you are getting paid handsomely."

Full text: In his new Netflix special, "Demetri Deconstructed," he tries a more conceptual approach than the simplicity he was known for.
A comedy career can be a tricky puzzle. You must evolve to stay relevant and interesting, but change too much and fans will revolt.
The prolific stand-up Demetri Martin, 50, has always had the mind of a puzzle-maker and a knack for paradox. A characteristic joke: "I am a man of my word: That word is unreliable." In "Demetri Deconstructed" (Netflix), the inventive seventh special of what has become a major, joke-dense career, he seems to be answering a riddle: How does an eternally boyish alternative comedian mature into middle age?
Martin steers clear of common temptations like storytelling or culture war or revelation. He is now married with kids, but he's not the kind of comic to tell jokes about parenting. After two decades, including three books and a movie, "Dean" (2016), he directed and starred in, we barely know him. The move he's making with the new special is away from a lodestar: simplicity. His jokes always sought out absurdity in as few words as possible; the delivery was unvarnished and there was little physicality. His floppy hair and crisp bluejeans are so consistent that they have become a kind of uniform.
Embracing the increasingly cinematic aesthetic of stand-up specials, his new hour, which he directed and is actually closer to 50 minutes, takes his act and wraps it around an intricate high concept. The first step to this move was in his previous special, "The Overthinker" (2018), which was funnier, if less radical. The theme there was in the title, and he illustrated it through the formal device of occasional interruptions with narration that represented his inner voice.
In one bit, his narrator wondered what the cartoon sitting on an easel next to him onstage would look like from the balcony, which led to a shot from farther back where you couldn't make out the picture at all. This perspective shift was heady: It wouldn't get a big laugh but made for a memorable critique of comedy in big rooms and a self-mocking joke about how not everyone would get him.
"Demetri Deconstructed" doubles down on such experiments. Instead of occasional intrusions of thought, the conceit here is that the special takes place entirely inside his mind, allowing for a more surreal visual language. A framing device has him hooked up to an EEG of sorts with a dubious doctor who wants him to imagine a comedy show. (Think "The Matrix" but for comedians.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The rare special in black and white, it features visuals that are constantly shifting, shrinking and expanding, breaking into split screens, offering multiple versions of the comic sometimes in scenes together or telling jokes over each other, so we can hear neither. (It's a conceptual bit that almost seems like a spoof of conceptual bits.) His jokes rewind and repeat, as if he was editing them in real time. A curtain with titles periodically appears, in a theatrical touch out of a Wes Anderson film. Like the work of that director, this comedy asks you to tune into its frequency, one that can be at times more clever than hilarious but that sets a high bar for surprise.
We are in an era when the process of comedy is discussed, analyzed, picked apart even more than the final product. So, Martin seems to be saying, why not blur the lines? The idea that stand-up specials recreate the live experience has been slowly replaced with an embrace of the artifice of film. "Demetri Deconstructed" often feels less like a stand-up show than a vaudeville variety act, with an old-school soundscape, moody spotlights, even a spin on ventriloquism. As usual, he brings along an easel, where he displays simple cartoons to set up jokes, some of which, like his very funny ruminations on the letter R, share a sensibility with next-generation alternative comedians like Julio Torres.
Martin opens with a joke praising his fans for being "respectful," and notes, "I'll be at a farmers market and no one will." He pauses and shifts his posture just enough for the crowd to finish the joke and laugh. He then reaches the punchline, that his fans are so decent that they don't "bother or even look at me," and gets another laugh. Told with the kind of timing developed from two decades of performance, this self-deprecating joke represents a shift of sorts for a comic who had a charmed early career, with a hit Edinburgh show that led to jobs for Conan O'Brien and "The Daily Show." There are hints at career anxiety in this special.
What's most striking about the comedy is that while Martin has long been likened to deadpan joke writers like Steven Wright and Mitch Hedberg, his persona was never as alien as theirs were. It's become increasingly clear that Martin's absurdity was rooted more in the real world, in oddball observations that made you look at mundane things in new ways. Listen to his jokes about buying toothpaste or the phrase "you wouldn't touch something with a 10-foot pole," and you can hear the cadence of Jerry Seinfeld. You also hear it in his complaints about people who use the word "adulting."
Where he's gotten weirder is in the form, not the content. Like all comics who specialize in deadpan short jokes, his act risks seeming repetitive, and all head, no heart. The inclusion of his inner voice is a way to recognize the issue. And what we see in his inner thoughts is hints of insecurity of the kind of comedy he doesn't do. His version of crowd work finds him making the mistake of addressing the entire group. "Where's everybody from?" he asks, and the answer is awkward silence
In jokes like these, Martin is aware of his own failure to connect. But he seems unwilling or uninterested in exploring the source. Or even showing more of the weirdness that lurks beneath his persona. One is left wondering about the framing device: What brought him to this place hooked up to wires? What is wrong with the real world that makes him retreat to his overheated imagination?
He's such a model of equanimity that the smallest departure from calm could have a large comic impact. But he reserves the special's most surprising incongruities for the visuals. And while there are plenty of short setups and punchlines -- "How long did it take to make the first clock? No one will ever know" -- the overall impression is of someone finding creative ways to dig around in their own navel. Occasionally, he sounds trapped in it.
At one point, his inner voice says: "Try something topical." But every time he starts a joke, the narrator expresses quick disapproval, so he stops after a second or two and starts again. This is a man overthinking so much that his joke ends before it ever began. Martin's punchline: "That's an example of a joke that won't be in the special."

Boeing Pays $ 160 MillionTo Alaska Airlines for Loss
Alaska Airlines says Boeing has paid it $ 160 million in "initial compensation" for a panel that blew off an Alaska Boeing 737 Max 9 jetliner in January.
The payment covered Alaska's pretax loss related to the accident, including lost revenue and the cost of returning its Max 9 fleet to service after the planes were grounded for three weeks. The airline described the compensation in a regulatory filing and said it expects additional compensation. Boeing declined to comment on Alaska's filing.
The panel, which plugs a gap left for an extra emergency exit, blew off the Alaska jet as it flew over Oregon on Jan. 5. The plane landed safely with no injuries.
Alaska's filing said it expected to lose $ 1.05 to $ 1.15 per share for the January-to-March quarter, with 95 cents per share of the loss related to the accident. Analysts expected a loss of 86 cents per share, according to a FactSet survey. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Disney to Crack DownOn Password Sharing
Walt Disney's streaming service will start cracking down on password-sharing in June, the company's chief executive, Robert A. Iger, told CNBC on Thursday. H e also signaled a need for consolidation in the streaming industry and said Disney was "eventually" looking at double-digit margins for the business.
Netflix's password-sharing crackdown helped it add nearly 22 million subscribers in the second half of 2023.
Mr. Iger was interviewed just a day after Disney investors backed him and other company directors in a proxy battle with activist investors, including Nelson Peltz, who argued that the company had underperformed in the streaming-television era.
"The proxy vote was a decisive, true endorsement of the board," said Mr. Iger, who was strengthened by the win at a crucial time. REUTERS
FOOD
A Rebound in DemandLifts Conagra's Profits
Conagra Brands beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter revenue and profit on Thursday, buoyed by a rebound in demand for its pantry staples and frozen food items from more consumers cooking meals at home in the face of sticky inflation.
Shares of the Slim Jim beef jerky maker rose 5% after it also raised annual adjusted operating margin forecast and said its cost-saving attempts were paying off.
Conagra has veered towards lowering prices in some categories such as refrigerated and frozen foods segment, and increasing promotions to appeal to budget-conscious consumers.
Packaged food companies have been looking to stem the fall in volumes, which have been battered in recent times due to consistent price hikes.
Conagra's total volumes decreased 1.8 percent in the quarter, less than the 2.9 percent drop in the preceding three-month period. CEO Sean Connolly said the trend for snacks and frozen items was improving. REUTERS

Full text: In 2019, the prince went on air to respond to accusations involving Jeffery Epstein. The drama here is in how the BBC convinced him to do it.
The exposés that brought public attention to Watergate, the predations of Harvey Weinstein and the abuse tolerated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston have all been the subjects of movies. The drama revolved, in part, around the difficulty of getting people to talk.
Now comes the story of how the BBC program "Newsnight" landed its bombshell interview with Prince Andrew in 2019. Over a bizarre 49-minute segment, he unconvincingly addressed his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the financier and convicted sex offender, and repeatedly denied accusations by Virginia Roberts Giuffre that, at 17, she had sex with the prince after being trafficked to him by Epstein. The interview was less world historic than David Frost's conversations with an out-of-office Richard Nixon (themselves the basis for a play-turned-movie), but the fallout was real. Faced with widespread criticism, Prince Andrew resigned from public duties just days later.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
How do you score an interview with a scandal-plagued royal? "Scoop," directed by Philip Martin, chronicles the determined efforts of the producer Sam McAlister (Billie Piper), on whose book, "Scoops," the film is based. Attending meetings at Buckingham Palace may lack the grit of shoe-leather reporting, but there is genuine psychology involved in convincing a famous figure that countering disapproval requires acknowledging it, and that the questions asked will be fair. Sam makes her case over multiple discussions with the prince's personal secretary, Amanda Thirsk (Keeley Hawes), and eventually in a pitch to the prince himself (Rufus Sewell in significant makeup) alongside Emily Maitlis (Gillian Anderson), the journalist who hopes to interrogate him.
The film finds sufficient suspense in these negotiations and in Maitlis's preparations for the encounter, a grilling that, in real life, she skillfully pulled off without ever registering as discourteous. Why Prince Andrew's answers were so tone-deaf -- he was panned for not expressing sympathy for Epstein's victims -- is a mystery that "Scoop" sidesteps. (McAlister and Thirsk exchange ambiguous glances as the taping concludes.)
What "Scoop" offers is the modest pleasure -- to which any journalist is susceptible -- of rooting for a reporting team to get a story. That, and mimicry: exceptional on Anderson's part, less on that of Sewell, who has a raspier voice and a more passably serious manner than the prince displayed on TV.

Paula Weinstein, Hollywood Veteran and Fighter for Women, Dies at 78: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Raised by a McCarthy-era rebel, the producer and journalist Hannah Weinstein, she followed her mother's path into movies and television, advocacy and action.
Paula Weinstein, a movie producer, studio executive and political activist who became a fierce advocate for women in her industry, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78.
Her sister Lisa Weinstein confirmed the death. She said the cause was not yet known.
In the boy's club of Hollywood, Ms. Weinstein was the rare female top executive: Over her long career, she was president of United Artists, a vice president of Warner Bros. and an executive vice president at 20th Century Fox. She was just 33 when she was hired at Fox in 1978, and when she was promoted to vice president a year later, The Los Angeles Times called her "the highest-ranking woman in the motion picture industry."
"A man can be mediocre in almost everything, but a women's got to be perfect," she told Life magazine that year, when she was included in an article about Hollywood's "Young Tycoons."
But Ms. Weinstein, who colleagues said possessed a wicked sense of humor -- her sister described her laugh as an infectious cackle -- and a steely commitment to social justice, was unusual in Hollywood beyond her gender. As Ken Sunshine, the veteran public relations consultant and longtime Democratic activist, put it in a phone interview: "Unlike so many, she didn't play at politics. To her, social and political change was paramount. She was the antithesis of a phony Hollywood activist looking for good P.R. or a career boost. She was unique in a sea of pretenders."
Activism was the family business: Her mother, Hannah Weinstein, was a journalist and speechwriter who in 1950 took her three young daughters to live in Paris and then London, fleeing the grim and punitive politics of the country's McCarthy era. In Britain, where the family lived for more than a decade, Hannah Weinstein produced movies and television series using blacklisted actors and writers like Ring Lardner Jr. and Ian McLellan Hunter. She repeatedly told her daughters, as Lisa recalled, "If you believe in something, you have to be willing to get up off your ass and do something, and if you don't get up off your ass, you really didn't believe in it."
"She was a daunting role model," Lisa Weinstein added.
It was Hannah who steered Paula into the movie business, by way of Jane Fonda.
"Hannah was the first person I ever asked for money as an activist," Ms. Fonda said in an email. "It was to open the G.I. office in D.C. in 1970, where concerns facing soldiers could be brought to Congress. She gave me $ 2,000 -- astonishing in 1970. Some years later, Hannah called me to ask if I could help her daughter, Paula, who had just graduated from Columbia University, get a job in Hollywood. She said I 'owed her one."'
The two women then met for lunch at a Hamburger Hamlet in Los Angeles and were instantly smitten with each other. They were of like mind, both having been involved in the antiwar protests of the 1960s, and both with arrests under their belts -- Ms. Weinstein's for taking part in a protest at Columbia. Soon after, Ms. Weinstein became Ms. Fonda's agent, helping her get the role of Lillian Hellman in "Julia" (1977), based on Ms. Hellman's book "Pentimento."
"It helped that Lillian was Paula's godmother," Ms. Fonda said.
Her next job was at Fox, where she oversaw the production of "9 to 5" (1980), the hit comedy starring Ms. Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton as office workers who revolt against their sexist employer. More recently, she reunited with Ms. Fonda and Ms. Tomlin as an executive producer of the long-running Netflix series "Grace and Frankie."
Ms. Weinstein produced more than 30 films, including "The Perfect Storm" (2000), starring George Clooney as a Massachusetts fishing boat captain -- and co-starring an epic nor'easter -- as well as the comedy "Analyze This" (1999) and its sequel, "Analyze That" (2002), with Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal. She was also a founder, with Ms. Fonda, Barbra Streisand and others, of the Hollywood Women's Political Committee, a fund-raising powerhouse for liberal candidates and causes from 1984 to the late 1990s.
With her husband, Mark Rosenberg, whom she met when they were both members of the national activist organization Students for a Democratic Society, Ms. Weinstein made a number of films, including "The Fabulous Baker Boys" (1989), with Jeff and Beau Bridges and Michelle Pfeiffer, and "Fearless" (1993), also starring Jeff Bridges. They also made "Citizen Cohn" (1992), an HBO movie about Roy Cohn, the lawyer and fixer for Senator Joseph McCarthy -- a topic close to Ms. Weinstein's heart, given her upbringing. Their final production together was "Flesh and Bone" (1993); Mr. Rosenberg died of heart failure at age 44 while working on the set of that film.
Ms. Weinstein continued to make films for Spring Creek Productions, the company she and her husband had formed -- notably another HBO film, "Recount" (2008), a political thriller based on the hairline finish of the 2000 presidential election and Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court case that decided the election in George W. Bush's favor.
"Paula knew how to marry the commercial with the political," said Lucy Fisher, the veteran producer and former vice chair of Sony Pictures, who considered Ms. Weinstein a mentor, "but not in a medicinal way. She invented the format that became HBO's imprimatur, the high-quality but gossipy-behind-the-scenes drama."
Paula Weinstein was born on Nov. 19, 1945, in Manhattan, the youngest of three daughters. Her mother, Hannah (Dorner) Weinstein, met her father, Isidore Weinstein, known as Pete, when they were hired as speechwriters for Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. At the time, Hannah was a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune and Pete was a reporter for The Brooklyn Eagle.
The couple had separated by 1950, and Hannah subsequently left the country with her daughters. They returned to the U.S. in 1962, and Paula enrolled in Columbia soon after.
In addition to her sister Lisa, Ms. Weinstein is survived by another sister, Dina, and her daughter, Hannah Rosenberg.
Since 2013, Ms. Weinstein had been chief content officer for Tribeca Enterprises, which includes the Tribeca Film Festival and Tribeca Studios, where she developed branded content and ran mentorship programs for emerging writers and directors. She left Tribeca last fall to focus on political work.
"I don't want to sit on the sidelines and rail about everything. I really want to jump in, fully, into the campaigns. Both statewide and national campaigns," she told Deadline magazine after her departure. "It just feels very much like a moment ... between the climate, and book banning and everything else that I don't need to go into."
At Ms. Weinstein's death, tributes poured in from her colleagues and friends, including from Debora Cahn, a writer and producer.
"Paula was a force of nature," Ms. Cahn wrote. "She taught me so much about so many things. How to stand up and be the thing. Stand in front. Talk loud. Be outraged and happy."

'X-Men' Is Back, but a Key Member Is Suddenly Missing: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The animated Disney+ revival series "X-Men '97" has faced questions after its showrunner was mysteriously fired just ahead of the premiere.
When the voice actor Alison Sealy-Smith first received an email asking if she'd be interested in reprising her role as Storm, from "X-Men: The Animated Series," she nearly marked the message as spam, shrugging it off as either a joke or a mistake. It had been three decades since she had worked on the action-adventure cartoon, which ran on Fox from 1992 to 1997, and the idea that it would be returning, let alone returning with its original cast, seemed so unlikely that she could hardly entertain it.
"At first, it was strictly disbelief," she said in a video interview. "It can't be true. Disney is doing this again? It didn't make any sense."
Disney was indeed doing it again, and after three years in production, the original "X-Men: The Animated Series" has returned as "X-Men '97," a revival streaming on Disney+ that the studio is treating as a direct continuation of the '90s show. The new series picks up where "The Animated Series" left off with its Season 5 finale in September 1997, with the loss of the X-Men leader Professor X after an attack by the anti-mutant lobbyist Henry Peter Gyrich. It is designed to look and feel, in essence, like Season 6, with the intervening 30-year gap hardly noticeable onscreen.
"That was always the goal," Jake Castorena, a supervising producer and director, said in an interview. "To go straight from the O.G. show to our show, and it feels connected."
The level of fidelity is impressive, and early reviews have been effusive, with one critic describing it as "nostalgia handled perfectly."
But the achievement has been slightly undermined by news that the showrunner, Beau DeMayo, had been fired by Marvel. The move was sudden: On March 11, publicists for Disney, Marvel's corporate owner, canceled DeMayo's planned interview for this article, saying his "scheduling has changed," and the following day The Hollywood Reporter broke the news that he had been fired. Marvel and Disney did not provide an explanation for the move. DeMayo and his representatives did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
DeMayo hasn't publicly addressed his departure, and the lack of information has fueled speculation online about the reasons for his termination. His former co-workers say they're as clueless as anyone about what happened, and why.
"I have absolutely no details whatsoever about what's going on -- that's a paygrade about 50,000 rungs above my head," Sealy-Smith said the morning after the news about DeMayo came out. "But I thoroughly enjoyed working with Beau. I loved his meticulously plotted storytelling."
Brad Winderbaum, an executive producer on "X-Men '97" and the head of TV, streaming and animation at Marvel Studios, acknowledged that beginning the series under the cloud of this controversy has been difficult. He reiterated that "the show speaks for itself."
Winderbaum and the rest of the "X-Men '97" team seemed eager to redirect the focus to the show and to the hard work that went into recreating the original. Emulating the look and feel of a 30-year-old animated series was "much harder than it seems," Winderbaum said.
"It's counterintuitive," he said. "You would think, we've got the template in front of us, so let's just do that. But it's actually like running a controlled experiment."
The original show's hand-drawn animation was constrained by time and budgetary concerns; to achieve that look, the new team had to put technical limitations on itself, restricting the kinds of flourishes that are easy with computers.
"Here we are 30 years later, and we had to create these artificial parameters to inform the style," Winderbaum said.
Getting the look exactly right also involved a lot of experimentation, including working with custom filters that could replicate the aesthetic of old-school VHS broadcasts.
"All of it was all meticulously planned out, frame by frame," Castorena said. "From the color palettes we use to the atmosphere to the noise grain to the chromatic aberration on the sides of the screen just slightly."
Before they even started producing episodes, he explained, they were hard at work tinkering with the style until it looked faithful to the original.
"It was a learning process," he said. "It might look awesome, but not quite right -- too clean, too HD. It was a good challenge to find that sweet spot."
DeMayo was the public face of "X-Men '97" during its production. He was active on social media, frequently posting updates about the series on X and Instagram, and often addressing questions and concerns from interested fans. He also maintained an OnlyFans account, though in a 2022 profile, Out magazine said that he was not "publishing any hardcore X-rated content." (On his personal website, DeMayo described the OnlyFans account as "a place for me to continue growing and pushing my own boundaries when it comes to my body and sexuality.")
Since his firing, the OnlyFans account has been removed, and DeMayo appeared to deactivate all of his social media accounts. His Instagram has since been reactivated, but most of the posts appear to have been deleted or archived.
Castorena, the supervising producer, said that he couldn't speak for DeMayo, who had previously worked on the popular Netflix fantasy drama "The Witcher" and the Disney+ series "Moon Knight."
"What I can say is that I absolutely appreciate and love the work that Beau gave the studio and the show and to the crew," Castorena said. Calling this turn of events "bittersweet," he said he hoped DeMayo's departure wouldn't overshadow the series itself.
"While, yes, this is big news, and while this has some sway for audiences, at the end of the day, the work is still the work," he said. "The writing is still the writing, and the show is still the show."
Winderbaum said that the second season was well on its way to completion, and that a third season was currently in development. When asked if DeMayo's departure would have any impact on the third season's progress, he said that it's "all still on track the same way."
"Being Marvel -- being a popular brand making stuff that hopefully people like -- part of the cost of that is that the behind-the-scenes drama becomes a story as well," he said. "All I can hope is that people are willing to just meet the show where it's at."

Full text: A place at her dinner tables, which sat 75, provided access to networks of money, influence and power across cultural and political divides.
At a private fund-raising reception last year, the president of the United States introduced himself this way: "My name is Joe Biden. I'm a friend of Esther Coopersmith's."
Mrs. Coopersmith's name has been a calling card in Washington for seven decades. As one of the longest-reigning hostesses, best-connected diplomats and top fund-raisers in the nation's capital, she greased the machinery that helped keep political, diplomatic and journalistic circles spinning; a place at her dinner tables, which sat 75, (with room for many more elsewhere and outside) provided access to networks of money, influence and power across cultural and political divides.
Among her many matches, she introduced Bill Clinton, who was then the governor of Arkansas, to Boris Yeltsin on a trip to Moscow. She introduced Jehan Sadat, the wife of President Anwar Sadat of Egypt, to Aliza Begin, the wife of Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel, before the Camp David peace accords. Anatoly F. Dobrynin, the longtime Soviet ambassador to the United States, had his first Thanksgiving at her table.
"People need a place out of the public spotlight to meet and talk," she told The New York Times in 1987.
Mrs. Coopersmith, who had multiple affiliations with the United Nations but who also reveled in her role as a freelancing citizen diplomat, died on Tuesday at her home in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington. She was 94.
The cause was cancer, said Janet Pitt, her longtime chief of staff. Rather than seek treatment that might have only postponed the inevitable and made her miserable, Ms. Pitt said, Mrs. Coopersmith "wanted to live her life."
The last public event Mrs. Coopersmith attended was the Gridiron dinner in mid-March. That annual political roast was one of her favorite outings, Ms. Pitt said, because she could bring dignitaries from other countries and show them "how we could poke fun at our politicians and our government and live to tell about it the next day."
President Biden said in a statement after Mrs. Coopersmith's death that she was one of his "early boosters" when he was 29 and ran for the Senate in 1972. "Her belief in me," he said, "meant the world."
Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, said in a statement, "For all my years in politics, I have been in awe of her." In an obituary published on Legacy.com, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called her "the indomitable doyenne of Washington."
Mrs. Coopersmith grew up on a farm in Wisconsin and caught the politics bug while listening to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats on the radio. She moved to Washington in the early 1950s, landed a lobbying job and quickly parlayed her skills -- personal warmth, self-confidence, smarts about people -- into fund-raising.
Mrs. Coopersmith was fascinated by power and the alchemy that it produced. As she told The Times in 1987:
"I do it because I love the activity, the excitement, I love to mix people up, I love sharing my home. In New York if you have a lot of money you can buy your way into anything. Here it is power that counts -- what your position is or could be. It is wonderful to watch power and how power affects people, how they run with it, how they adjust to it."
While bipartisan in her pursuits, she was a Democrat at heart and over the years raised millions of dollars for the party's candidates. By 1958, she was rubbing shoulders with the likes of former President Harry S. Truman, who scribbled on a photo of the two of them, "Kindest regards to an able and efficient Democrat from one who knows!"
Such mementos accumulated and in time occupied nearly every square inch of space in Mrs. Coopersmith's four-story brick mansion. They included signed photos of decades of Washington players and international personages and a telegram from Mr. Carter thanking her for introducing Mrs. Sadat and Mrs. Begin and helping to get the peace accords off the ground. She later introduced Mrs. Sadat to Richard Berendzen, president of American University, who then hired Mrs. Sadat to teach.
Mrs. Coopersmith donated some of her treasure trove to the newly minted National Museum of American Diplomacy in Washington. To help promote the museum, she held a discussion at her home last year featuring Debora Cahn, the creator and showrunner of the popular Netflix series "The Diplomat," starring Keri Russell, and Elizabeth Jones, a longtime foreign service officer and one of the figures on whom Ms. Russell's character was based.
During the discussion, Ms. Cahn paid homage to the importance of personal relationships in geopolitics: "In a crisis, you can pick up the phone and call somebody who you sat next to at Esther Coopersmith's and didn't think it was a good seating choice in the beginning, but by dessert it seemed like you had a lot in common."
Mrs. Coopersmith was proud of the sometimes unconventional pairings at her dinner table. In 1990, she seated an Israeli diplomat next to an emissary of Saddam Hussein, the president of Iraq; shortly thereafter, Iraq invaded Kuwait and started the Persian Gulf war.
"It's my home, and I can do whatever I want," she told The Jerusalem Post in 1993. "They didn't talk much, but as far as I was concerned, it was a start."
She was born Esther Lipsen on Jan. 18, 1930, in Des Moines. Her family soon moved to the small town of Mazomanie, Wis., which is just northwest of Madison in the southern part of the state and at the time had a population of 891. Esther's father, Morris, who came from Belarus, was a cattle rancher. Her mother, Pauline, who was born in Romania, managed the household of five children. They were the only Jewish family there.
By the age of 8, Esther was hooked on politics, thanks to F.D.R. By 12, she was raising money for the Red Cross.
She attended the University of Denver and later the University of Wisconsin. In 1952, she went to a rally for Senator Estes Kefauver, a Democrat from Tennessee who was running for president. Leaving college behind without graduating, she helped Mr. Kefauver win the Wisconsin primary; after he lost the nomination to Adlai Stevenson, she helped organize for Mr. Stevenson.
She decided that the real power was in Washington and moved there at Mr. Kefauver's suggestion. She refused to learn to type, to avoid being stereotyped as a secretary, and she eventually got a job as a lobbyist for the Federation for Railway Progress.
She married Jack Coopersmith, a real estate developer, in 1954, and they settled in Potomac, Md., where she began hosting dinners, buffets and book signings and organizing events. A decade later, she was staging Texas-style fund-raising barbecues for President Lyndon B. Johnson all over the country.
She soon branched out to philanthropy, raising money for service organizations and helping to save Washington's Union Station from the wrecking ball. She threw an intimate dinner for Barbra Streisand in 2015 the night before Ms. Streisand lobbied on Capitol Hill for the Women's Heart Alliance.
Mr. Coopersmith died at 80 in 1991. Soon thereafter, Mrs. Coopersmith moved to Washington, where she overhauled the Kalorama house, not far from Embassy Row, with the help of a White House decorator.
She is survived by three sons, Jonathan, Jeffrey and Ronald; a daughter, Connie Coopersmith; a sister, Rita Rabinowitz; and eight grandchildren.
Over the years, Mrs. Coopersmith was given several quasi-official roles, most of them involving the United Nations. She served as a public member of the United States delegation to the U.N. under President Carter from 1979 to 1980; the position, also once held by Eleanor Roosevelt and Paul Newman, entails representing the United States on committees, attending debates in the General Assembly and showing up at receptions given by member nations.
President Ronald Reagan sent Mrs. Coopersmith to important U.N. conferences. She received the U.N. Peace Prize in 1984. President Clinton named her as a U.S. observer at UNESCO. In 2009, UNESCO named her a goodwill ambassador.
The posts gave her diplomatic cache, but she especially enjoyed practicing her own brand of soft diplomacy, defined by her own protocol, in the political kaleidoscope that is Washington.
"I don't drink, don't smoke, don't play cards and don't belong to a country club," she told The Times in 1978. "Politics is my vice."

For Disney, Small Shareholders Loom Large in Boardroom Fight

Gavin Doyle used allowance money in 2009, when he was 11, to buy a few shares of Disney stock. They cost $31 apiece.
He now owns a little over 400 shares — barely enough to be a speck of dust in the Disney investor galaxy. But the entertainment company, which has 1.8 billion shares outstanding, has nonetheless barraged him for months with political-style campaign materials (letters, email, social media ads) that urge him to elect certain people to its board.
“I guess every vote matters,” said Doyle, 26, who runs MickeyVisit, a blog unaffiliated with Disney that focuses on theme park vacation planning.
In most cases, global companies pay little attention to individual shareholders. Powerful institutional investors like mutual funds and index funds typically run the show. But Disney finds itself in an atypical situation as it scrambles to thwart Nelson Peltz, an activist investor who is seeking two board seats, including one for himself.
Up to 40% of Disney shares are held by individuals — retail investors, as Wall Street sometimes refers to them, with a hint of derision. On average among public companies, individuals represent closer to 15% of the ownership, according to analysts and academic studies.
“In the retail market, a lot of individuals don’t feel comfortable investing in companies they’ve never heard of,” said David Reibstein, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. “Disney is known: I can relate to it, I have taken my kids there, I’ve seen their movies.”
In other words, the Disney-Peltz proxy battle, expected to be one of the most expensive in history, may be decided by the little people.
Disney’s fight with Peltz will come to a head Wednesday, when the company is scheduled to virtually host its annual shareholder meeting. A smaller activist investor, Blackwells Capital, is also seeking seats on Disney’s board, to the company’s irritation. While Peltz and Blackwells have sharply different views on how Disney should be managed — one wants “Netflix-like margins” of up to 20% in streaming, the other has floated splitting up the company — they have expressed the same basic motivation: Disney’s stock price is not high enough.
Shares are trading at about $122, down from $197 three years ago.
Bob Iger, Disney’s CEO, and the company’s 12-member board have responded to the insurgents like Avengers battling Thanos — that is, with startling force. They say a 13-month-old turnaround plan has taken hold, and point to drastically improved financials, a new strategy for ESPN in the streaming age and a retrenchment at Marvel Studios to improve movie quality, among other initiatives. Yes, Disney’s stock is down from three years ago, but it’s up from $81 six months ago.
Disney executives contend that Peltz’s campaign is rooted in revenge. He is backed by Ike Perlmutter, the disgruntled former chair of Marvel Entertainment, and aligned with Jay Rasulo, a former Disney executive who was passed over for the top job in 2015 and resigned. Elon Musk, who has been throwing elbows at Iger since November, when Disney and other major companies paused spending on X (formerly Twitter), has cheered on Peltz.
At first, Disney seemed poised to easily defeat Peltz. A parade of prominent shareholders (George Lucas, Laurene Powell Jobs), business titans (Jamie Dimon), analysts (Guggenheim, Macquarie), shareholder advisories (Glass Lewis, ValueEdge) and Disney family members (Abigail E. Disney) have advised against giving Peltz seats on the company’s board.
But it has evolved into a much closer contest. Two weeks ago, an influential proxy firm, ISS, partly sided with Peltz, recommending that shareholders elect him to the board and advising against adding Rasulo. ISS largely cited Disney’s botched succession planning. On Tuesday, Peltz won the backing of Egan-Jones, another advisory firm.
Until ISS weighed in, “I was pretty sure that Peltz was kind of cooked,” said Michael Levin, an independent activist investor and adviser who oversees the Activist Investor website. Levin estimated that ISS’ recommendation could influence 5% to 10% of Disney’s vote, with institutional shareholders like Vanguard and BlackRock likely to pay close attention.
Mom-and-pop shareholders are more of a mystery. Retail investors are frequently apathetic, even in the face of a contest, proxy experts say. “You have to find a way to connect with somebody who doesn’t have a requirement to vote, who doesn’t necessarily have it within their routine,” Bruce Goldfarb, the CEO of Okapi Partners, a proxy solicitation firm working with Peltz, said at a recent conference.
Disney and Peltz have each been spending heavily to get out the small-fry vote. Trian Partners, Peltz’s investment firm, said in a securities filing that it expected to spend about $25 million in total on its campaign; it hired Okapi and another firm, D.F. King, to help identify shareholders and encourage them to vote. Disney, which has teamed with the firm Innisfree M&A, among others, has priced its countercampaign at up to $40 million.
In part to appeal to individual shareholders, Disney has deployed characters like Moana and Iron Man to solicit votes. In February, the company released an animated video starring Donald Duck’s uncle, Professor Ludwig Von Drake. “Voting this year is critical no matter how many or how few shares you may own,” a narrator says. “Do not vote for the Trian Group or Blackwells’ nominees.”
Peltz responded with a letter to Disney shareholders that included a cartoon showing bored and haggard board members and a messy bowl of noodles. “Spaghetti on the wall will not feed shareholders starved of returns” was the letter’s headline.
Douglas Chia, the president of Soundboard Governance, which advises on corporate governance, got calls from both sides of the battle. Chia, who says he owns a couple hundred shares of Disney, said he was left unimpressed by the first call on Trian’s behalf. (Chia conceded that his professional background trained him to ask questions a traditional retail investor might not.)
After he posted about it on LinkedIn, he got a follow-up call from Trian directly, underlining just how much each side is paying attention to every vote.
“These were very senior people at Trian who talked to me for about 45 minutes,” Chia said. “And it’s like: The meeting is less than a week away — they could be on the phone with BlackRock.” (Chia said he was not persuaded by Trian’s arguments but appreciated the follow-up call.)
Retail investors tend to side with management in proxy contests. In the case of Disney, many of these shareholders are fans.
Cori Borgstadt has been a Disney stockholder since 2008, when her grandmother gave her a single share for Christmas. She was 3. Borgstadt, who has continued to acquire shares, said she had read a few news articles about the proxy contest but had largely disregarded Trian’s case.
“I admire Bob Iger, and I trust him to know what’s right,” Borgstadt said. “So I voted the white slate.” (Each side has a ballot — white for Disney, blue for Trian.)
Still, experts say there is one big factor in Disney’s fight that may affect the instinct of fans to support Iger. It involves politics.
Disney has become a political punching bag in recent years, partly because it has added openly gay, lesbian and queer characters to its animated movies. The emphasis on diversity in some of Disney’s live-action films, including “The Little Mermaid” and “The Marvels,” has also led to fan complaints. Although Disney has also received positive reactions, the blowback — and poor ticket sales for some of the films in question — has prompted Disney to retrench.
In what some proxy solicitation experts viewed as an appeal to disenfranchised Disney fans, Peltz recently waded into the “woke Disney” debate by commenting about “The Marvels,” which focused on female superheroes, and “Black Panther,” which had an all-Black principal cast.
“Why do I have to have a Marvel that’s all women? Not that I have anything against women, but why do I have to do that?” Peltz told The Financial Times. “Why can’t I have Marvels that are both? Why do I need an all-Black cast?”
The move could “backfire against him — there’s presumably a lot of Disney investors who support diversity in the content,” said Scott Bisang, a partner at Collected Strategies, a communications firm. “But I don’t think he would be doing that unless he thought there was sort of a supportive audience for it.”
Peltz has been victorious in proxy fights with retail investors before. In 2017, he won what was then the most expensive proxy fight in history at Procter & Gamble with a margin of about 0.0016%. (The sides spent about $60 million, or $77 million in today’s money.)
But he lost a hotly contested proxy contest with DuPont in 2015, with studies citing retail investors as one reason.
As Peltz said in a January securities filing detailing some of Trian’s outreach to Disney shareholders, “Every vote counts!”

Full text: This heart-string-tugging Netflix movie about a homeless soccer team, featuring Bill Nighy and Micheal Ward, puts the emphasis on play and uplift.
It's moderately surprising that it's taken filmmakers two decades to concoct a heart-string-tugging underdog story out of the annual coed sport event known as the Homeless World Cup, a weeklong international competition featuring homeless soccer players.
Directed by Thea Sharrock and written by Frank Cottrell Boyce, "The Beautiful Game" is an upbeat, amiable picture that, as its title suggests, puts the sport in front. Which isn't to say the conditions of the players are ignored. Nathan (Callum Scott Howells), a recovering addict, has a particularly tough time. But the emphasis is on play and uplift. The sunny climes of Rome, where the tournament in the movie is set, help sell it.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The great Bill Nighy plays Mal, the coordinator and coach for England's team, who one afternoon spots Vinny (Micheal Ward) giving pointers to some younger players. Vinny's got talent, but Mal seems to recognize more in him. Mal also correctly guesses that Vinny's more or less living out of his car.
The writer, Boyce, is known for more adventurous fare than this (see "Tristram Shandy," from 2006), but this is a more conventional story. Here, Boyce steers around some clichés, but not others. For example, when Ellie (Jessye Romeo), Vinny's ever-disappointed former partner, tells him to admit that he's not going to be able to attend their daughter's school event, rather than prevaricating, Vinny does just that, proudly proclaiming that he'll go to Rome despite his initial resistance to Mal's pitch.
Peppered with funny and inspiring moments, like the charming way the South African team gets a makeup game after being held up at their airport, "The Beautiful Game" is a model of a modern "nice" movie.
The Beautiful Game
Rated PG-13 for language, themes. Running time: 2 hours 5 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

Scorsese to Lead a Religious Series for Fox Nation: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Oscar-winning director is the latest Hollywood name to sign up for the Fox News streaming platform, joining Kevin Costner, Rob Lowe and Dan Aykroyd.
Martin Scorsese has agreed to spearhead a documentary series about Christian saints for Fox Nation, the subscription streaming service run by Fox News Media.
"Martin Scorsese Presents: The Saints," which begins airing in November, will be hosted, narrated and executive produced by Scorsese, the decorated director of classic films like "Taxi Driver" and "The Wolf of Wall Street." Fox Nation is set to formally announce the series on Wednesday.
Since its debut in 2018 as a companion service to Fox News, Fox Nation has expanded into entertainment and general-interest programming as it aspires to become a kind of Netflix for conservative audiences. The streaming network already boasts shows with Hollywood stars like Kevin Costner ("Yellowstone: One-Fifty"), Rob Lowe ("Liberty or Death: Boston Tea Party") and Dan Aykroyd ("History of the World in Six Glasses").
The Scorsese series, created by Matti Leshem, dramatizes the stories of eight saints, including Joan of Arc, John the Baptist, Mary Magdalene, Francis of Assisi and Thomas Becket.
"I've lived with the stories of the saints for most of my life, thinking about their words and actions, imagining the worlds they inhabited, the choices they faced, the examples they set," Scorsese said in a statement. "These are stories of eight very different men and women, each of them living through vastly different periods of history and struggling to follow the way of love revealed to them and to us by Jesus' words in the gospels."
Along with narrating re-enactments of the saints' stories, Scorsese will also host on-camera discussions with experts. Four episodes will stream on Nov. 16, with the concluding quartet of episodes released in May 2025. The series is directed by Elizabeth Chomko and written by Kent Jones.
Christianity is a frequent preoccupation of Scorsese's works, at times to the consternation of conservative audiences. His 1988 film, "The Last Temptation of Christ," was denounced by religious groups for its depiction of Jesus, played by Willem Dafoe, struggling with human urges and frailties and questioning his divinity.
Scorsese, 81, told The Los Angeles Times in January that he has completed a screenplay for a new film about Jesus, based on the book "A Life of Jesus," by the Japanese writer Shusaku Endo. The director said the film would examine Jesus's teachings and be mostly set in the present day.

"Right now, 'religion,' you say that word and everyone is up in arms because it's failed in so many ways," Scorsese told the newspaper. "But that doesn't mean necessarily that the initial impulse was wrong. Let's get back. Let's just think about it. You may reject it. But it might make a difference in how you live your life -- even in rejecting it."
Rick Yorn, Leonardo DiCaprio's manager and a producer on several of Scorsese's previous films, is among the executive producers on "The Saints." Lionsgate Alternative Television is producing.
Scorsese was nominated for the best director prize at this month's Academy Awards for his film "Killers of the Flower Moon"; he lost to Christopher Nolan of "Oppenheimer."

Tech Companies Are Not Remotely Your Friends: Lessons From Roku: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Chen, Brian X

Full text: Roku recently changed its policy to make it even harder for customers to take legal action. It's a reminder of how we need to protect ourselves.
This month, many of the 80 million owners of Roku devices, including streaming sticks, set-top boxes and internet-connected TVs running the company's streaming software, turned on their Rokus to see a block of text. I, the owner of a cheap Roku TV in my bedroom, was among those who got stuck with the screen.
The message gave updated terms of service that made it harder for customers to take legal action against the company. Unless they agreed, users were blocked from access to the Roku menu and apps, essentially bricking their devices. The only way to opt out was to mail a letter to the company.
To Isaac Phillips, a software engineer in Tampa, Fla., this felt unfair. So he came up with a workaround to disconnect his Roku TV from the internet and use it as a normal TV without Roku's apps, which include Netflix, Hulu and other streaming services.
"It should belong to whoever paid for it," Mr. Phillips said. "To lock somebody out of it completely just doesn't seem right. It's pretty unacceptable."
Also this month, Roku announced a security breach involving about 15,000 user accounts. The victims' login credentials had been illegally obtained through a breach of another company's servers and were used to get into Roku accounts to buy streaming subscriptions, according to Roku.
"Like many companies, Roku updates its terms of service from time to time," the company said in a statement, adding that the change was unrelated to the breach.
Roku's no-good month stirred discussions in online forums about what it means when a company can essentially deactivate the device you paid for. That's similar to how companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft can decide to stop issuing software updates for older devices, which gradually degrades their performance.
It's a lesson we have to learn and relearn. Companies, even those that say they strive to delight us and make our lives better, cater to their own interests. In reality, the tech products we buy can evolve to keep protecting those interests -- and the hoops we have to jump through to gain some control are often impractical. Here's a reminder of what to remember.
We don't really own our tech products
More than a decade ago, when we bought a TV it was just that -- a big screen that let you plug into it whatever you wanted. Nowadays, the vast majority of TVs connect to the internet and run the manufacturer's operating system and apps. Even though you bought the TV, the software component, a major part of what makes the product work, remains controlled by the company.
Changes to the product's software interface and data collection practices can happen at any moment. In extreme examples, a device can stop working. In 2020, for instance, Amazon deactivated the Echo Look, a camera that helped people organize their wardrobes. It issued a promotional credit for owners to buy a different Amazon gadget that lacked similar features.
The less extreme, more common situation is when companies stop supporting older products because they need to sell new gadgets. Apple's original Apple Watch from 2015, for example, no longer gets software updates and now barely works.
This issue is not new but has grown more problematic as more of our devices rely on apps and internet connections, said Nathan Proctor, a director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization. With computers, consumers could modify their machines by installing a different operating system. But with many other types of electronics with locked-down software systems, from streaming devices to e-book readers, those modifications are typically not possible.
"When you get to the core of it, do you even own it anymore?" he said.
Consumers lack protection
In a nutshell, Roku's terms of service have long required customers to agree to resolve any legal disputes through a private forum, the process known as mandatory arbitration, which can prevent consumers who share the same complaints from banding together to file lawsuits. The updated terms added language that shields the company from so-called mass arbitrations, where lawyers could file hundreds of thousands of individual arbitration claims, a tactic to fight back against arbitration clauses.
Mandatory arbitration clauses have become an industry standard. The terms of service for companies including Sony PlayStation, Vizio and Hulu include similar language about arbitration, and those companies also require consumers to mail a letter to opt out of those terms.
Roku customers can opt out of the revised terms and continue to use their products, but the process is not intuitive. First, they must hit the "agree" button on the terms of service screen. Then, within 30 days, they must mail a letter asking to opt out of the terms, along with a copy of the receipt for their Roku product, to Roku's general counsel at 1701 Junction Court, Suite 100, San Jose, Calif. 95112.
A Roku spokesman also provided a list of steps for those who wish to use their Roku TVs as normal TVs without an internet connection. It involves pressing a button or pinhole on the back of the TV to reset the software and skipping the step to set up the internet connection.
Why is it harder to opt out than it is to opt in? Because the companies are legally allowed to do this.
I suggest that Roku customers follow those steps to opt out of the new terms and hold on to what little power they have. I, for one, took this opportunity to disconnect my Roku TV from the internet and plug in a different streaming device with less onerous terms, an old Apple TV. As for a letter to opt out, I plan to use the A.I. chatbot ChatGPT to draft a testy note.
Separately, the Roku customers that were especially vulnerable in recent weeks were the 15,000 affected by a cyberattack known as "credential stuffing." Hackers obtained user names and passwords that were leaked elsewhere and reused them to log in to Roku accounts. The lesson here is to create a strong, unique password for every internet account you own and never reuse it for another site.
The fine print: Tech companies are not our friends
Like many tech companies, Roku has marketed itself as a company with consumers' interests at heart. Its website, embellished with wholesome photos of families watching TV, invites you to join the millions of people saving money by cutting the cord. Its streaming devices, including its $ 20 streaming stick and $ 290 55-inch TV, are also relatively inexpensive.
But any successful business exists to make money, not friends, and Roku's aggressive moves this month should make that crystal clear.
With Roku and similarly inexpensive streaming products like Google's $ 30 Chromecast and Amazon's $ 40 Fire TV stick, you are largely subsidizing the purchase of the product by sharing your data with advertisers, said Jen Caltrider, a director at Mozilla who researches companies' privacy policies.
But Roku is a bigger offender, as it collects much more information than it needs to provide a device that runs streaming apps, including information about your employment, education and religious beliefs, she said.
"Their privacy policy is a shining example of a terrible privacy policy for a consumer," Ms. Caltrider said. "They are a data-hoovering company."

Full text: Jenny Slate, Dan Soder, Cara Connors, Tig Notaro, David Cross and Dave Attell stamp these hours with particularly rich sensibilities.
Jenny Slate, 'Seasoned Professional'
(Amazon Prime Video)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Wearing a bow tie, pocket handkerchief, crop top and shorts, Jenny Slate stands on a shiny circular platform on the distressed BAM Harvey theater stage. It's an image of sharp contrasts, the kind you find in her comedy, where commonplace subjects are imbued with manic, absurd charisma. Her version of relatable is asking: "You know that one feeling when you can tell you're going to pass away?"
Whereas her debut special incorporated documentary elements, this hour effectively captures the improvisational eccentricity of her live act. Slate is blessed with a spectacularly nimble comic voice. She's also a deft physical comedian, and her best bits show off both traits. When trying to describe the strangeness of giving birth, she likens it to the discomfort of being invited to audition for Pennywise the evil clown. Rattled, she expresses the shame at being considered for the part by flapping her hands, looking perplexed ("That couldn't be the murdering, kidnapping, balding male clown, right?"), doing a creepy impression of the character as well as the meeting among producers that led to this offer. It's a screeching, sputtering display of kvetching that builds runaway comic momentum.
Dan Soder, 'On the Road'
(YouTube)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
While most specials go too long, this one, at 39 tightly funny minutes, is just right. Punchy, diverting, varied, it's a perfect pick-me-up for your lunch hour. In clothes as casual as his delivery, Dan Soder presents himself as a laid-back people-pleaser, the kind of guy aiming for a specific kind of dumb. As he puts it, he wants to see a trailer for a new "Fast and Furious" movie and be shocked that they found a way to go faster. But make no mistake: His lightness requires heavy effort. And his comedic tool kit is full, featuring sharp impressions (Batman villain, Enrique Iglesias), melancholy notes and clever phrasemaking. In a story illustrating the childhood joy of curse words, he says this line with a genuine (and ridiculous) sense of nostalgia: "I was 8 years old, just out having a cuss."
Cara Connors, 'Straight for Pay'
(Apple TV+)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Cara Connors is a queer millennial comic whose debut hour shifts from her divorce from a man to a very funny description of lesbian breakups (lots of gratitude in both directions). She says she's terrified of waking up, opening her phone and seeing this news: "Elon Musk is bisexual." Her face goes dark. "Now I have to welcome him into the community?" Then she imagines the headline with her hands: "Jeff Bezos, gender-fluid." She erupts in a baritone: "I can't do it." Connors seems to search for reasons to lose her bearings. It's where she is funniest. Bounding around the stage with "the energy of a mom at a wedding who has had too much to drink," she offers some dutiful jokes (like the Standup 101 opening analogy of how she appears to others: "I know I look like if they let Timothée Chalamet start eating again") and a couple that peter out when they should build. But she makes up for the rawness of joke writing with a frenetic charm and a powerhouse voice that shifts from giggly to laid-back to demonic in a flash. It's a promising debut.
Tig Notaro, 'Hello Again'
(Amazon Prime Video)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Tig Notaro ends her latest special by playing the piano even though she has no idea how to play. It's not an original idea. In fact, comics who can't play the piano trotting one out has become an unlikely subgenre. Jim Gaffigan brought one into a special as a sort of prank to raise and dash expectations. Rory Scovel, who has a new special on HBO Max, used to do an impression of a guy who can't play the piano hired to play the piano in a hotel lobby, struggling. Notaro also plays on the comedy of faking it, but as she plunks away at the keys, in the middle of a story of volunteering to perform an Adele song at a party attended by Adele, her version is about the comedy of confidence when you should have none. It suits her gift of soldiering through awkward situations with unflappable deadpan.
In the past, she's used this to take big swings, both experimental and more personal. This special is a more modest effort, and her personal anecdotes can't help but name-drop now that she's better known. Its centerpieces are embarrassing stories like a misunderstanding at a meeting with Reese Witherspoon or an awkward moment with a physical therapist, anecdotes that she beefs up into comic vignettes, which she retells from different angles. There is a pleasing calm to her delivery that stands out in a scene of fidgety hams. But it can also be a little too loose, even underdeveloped. While noodling on the piano, she says, "It kind of sounds like something." If you try hard, you can hear it.
David Cross, 'Worst Daddy in the World'
(YouTube)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In his best stand-up release since his Bush-era albums, David Cross dryly rages against rich kids, American Christians and the Florida laws that prompted a textbook publisher to remove race from a lesson about Rosa Parks. His alternative history of how Florida would teach the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or the Holocaust is superb over-the-top political humor that belongs to the George Carlin tradition of ridiculing euphemism. Cross is a practiced and entertaining hater, baroque, inventive and righteous. You never think he doesn't mean it -- or is doing something for a bit. And he doesn't spare himself from scorn. He happily plays the jerk, calling his spouse "my current wife," and getting defensive when anyone might protest. (It's accurate!)
What also distinguishes Cross from most political comics is his commitment to taking risks with form, toying with convention in his stand-up just as he once did with sketches on "Mr. Show." He has a joke in which he edits out the punchline and another one esoteric enough that he pauses the show to give people a chance to get it. Some won't. But he doesn't seem to mind.
Dave Attell, 'Hot Cross Buns'
(Netflix)
"What does real loneliness look like?" Dave Attell asks in his the famously raspy voice. "I'll tell you," he says, building suspense. "Your own reflection in a microwave door." It's a joke that reminds you that on top of being the quintessential New York club comic, a master of the concise filthy joke, Attell also has the soul of a grizzled emo singer. It's been a decade since he released a standup special, largely telling his honed material in dark basements. If you want to hear a wonderfully melancholic joke about a sandwich-maker working at Subway from the comfort of your own home, you're in luck.

Full text: Onscreen stars have increasingly been going virtual. Jodie Comer and David Harbour are making their video game debuts in a remake of the 1992 horror game Alone in the Dark.
A stream of actors who built their careers in Hollywood are making their digital presence felt in video games, a once stigmatized medium that is increasingly seen as a unique storytelling platform with the ability to reach large audiences.
Some are voice acting, transferring skills they may have honed in animated movies or TV shows, while others are contributing their likenesses through advanced motion-capture technology that can replicate furrowed brows and crinkled cheeks.
Last year, Cameron Monaghan led Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Megan Fox portrayed a character in Mortal Kombat 1, and Idris Elba and Keanu Reeves provided the backbone of Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.
In this month's remake of the 1992 horror game Alone in the Dark, both Jodie Comer, who won an Emmy for "Killing Eve" and a Tony for "Prima Facie," and David Harbour, known for his work on "Stranger Things," are making their video game debuts. They are among the group of actors meeting younger generations where they already are.
"I hope that people are still watching two-hour movies decades from now, but I know they will be playing video games," Harbour said in an email.
In a behind-the-scenes video by the game's publisher, Comer said that working on the movie "Free Guy," set in a fictionalized video game, gave her a newfound appreciation of the industry. "It's so incredible to be able to kind of step out of what you usually do and explore something new, and kind of challenge yourself," she said.
In Alone in the Dark, Comer's character and the private investigator she hires, played by Harbour, explore a psychiatric hospital to uncover the truth behind a recent disappearance. Both are playable characters, with distinct cut scenes and dialogue.
Mikael Hedberg, the game's creative director, said that when the characters reunite after being separated, the player gets immediate relief because of an actual sense of recognition.
"Everyone has some level of parasocial relationship to celebrities where maybe they feel like your friend," Hedberg said.
The migration to video games is happening for several reasons, including leaps in technology that have reduced the disconnect between real-life and digital performances.
Convenience is another factor. Filming a live-action feature like "Dune: Part Two" can require actors to spend weeks in the deserts of Abu Dhabi. Motion-capture sessions for games can often be completed minutes away from an actor's Los Angeles home.
Bringing in known actors also enables studios to engage with people who might not otherwise be interested in their games. The indie game Open Roads, a mother-daughter road trip that releases this month, features the voices of Keri Russell and Kaitlyn Dever.
"If you saw David Harbour and Jodie Comer were starring in a new 'Alone in the Dark' horror film, you'd probably go see it," said Michael Csurics, the game's casting and voice director.
A known presence can drastically increase a game's reach. For big-budget games, screen actors are a small vote of confidence. For indie games, they can be an all-or-nothing bet. "Having a celebrity definitely tilts the scales on a budget," Csurics said.
At last year's Game Awards, one studio revealed its space-faring game Exodus by bringing onstage the Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey, who promised that his first video game character would "have a unique relationship with every player." Later in the ceremony, the real-time strategy game Stormgate was introduced by Simu Liu, fresh off his work in "Barbie."
Hollywood actors have participated in video games before this more noticeable trend. In 2008, Liam Neeson portrayed the protagonist's father in the postapocalyptic Fallout 3. Martin Sheen voiced the Illusive Man, a space paramilitary leader, in 2010's Mass Effect 2 and its 2012 sequel.
Movie and TV actors who have crossed over into video games note the similarities of performing in either medium. Karen Fukuhara joined the cast of The Callisto Protocol, a 2022 horror survival game, a few years after starring as Kimiko in "The Boys," a satirical superhero series.
Fukuhara said that she had "imagined a video game casting to be like, OK, just act like you're in a war zone or act like you're shooting at someone," but that she was surprised how much the experience "felt like a scene."
Ultimately, acting is acting.
"I write down and I build a character in the same way as I would in any role," said Melanie Liburd, who was on "This Is Us" before being cast as a main character in last year's Alan Wake II.
Although it can be exhilarating to see the acting lines blur, it is primarily happening in one direction. On-camera actors are easily slotted into games. But prominent video game actors like Yuri Lowenthal and Troy Baker have struggled to be cast in live-action stories.
"Oh, you were in the, you know, the biggest game that came out last year," said Lowenthal, who has played Spider-Man as well as characters in the Saints Row, Diablo and Prince of Persia series. "But you won't even be seen for a co-star on a TV show."
The shift comes as film studios and streaming services are investing in gaming. Netflix has a free game library built into every subscription, and Annapurna Pictures has published several lauded games, including Kentucky Route Zero and Outer Wilds. The director James Gunn, who is now managing the DC Comics universe for Warner Bros., has stated that he wants to cast actors who can play the same role in TV, film, video games and animation.
"When you try to pigeonhole or overly define art, it is by nature limited and boring," said Monaghan, who was a lead actor on 11 seasons of "Shameless" before wielding lightsabers in two popular Star Wars games.
Actors describe the experience of filming on a motion-capture stage as somewhere between theater and movies. Surrounded by at least a dozen cameras in a blank white room with minimalist sets, actors wear skintight suits covered in dots that help the system pick up their movements. Crew members observe from a distance and often render performances in real time.
Some actors have found the experience liberating, including Shannon Woodward, who was Ellie's girlfriend in the postapocalyptic game The Last of Us Part II.
"I'm not concerned if something is a bad angle for my chin," said Woodward, who built her career on television shows such as "Raising Hope" and "Westworld." "I can fully concentrate on how to represent this story and be present in this moment."
For younger actors, video games are already a part of their everyday lives. Liu said in a video by the studio behind Stormgate that it was exciting to voice a character for developers that once worked on StarCraft and Age of Empires, the real-time strategy games he played in the late 1990s.
Transitioning from video games to movies is considerably harder.
Colleen O'Shaughnessey, who has voiced Tails in Sonic the Hedgehog games for the past decade, was the only actor to reprise her role for the live-action movie in 2020. She said she did not know she was cast for the 2022 sequel until it was publicly announced by the studio.
O'Shaughnessey said she told her agents at the time that playing Tails "would be a huge win for me, but this would be a ginormous win for the entire voice-over community."
Despite the challenge longtime game actors face, many encouraged the recent arrival of more famous on-camera actors. Lowenthal said he would not have had the opportunity to do voice work on the "Afro Samurai" mini-series and movie if Samuel L. Jackson had not been behind the project.
"You can look at it, like, oh, that person took my job," Lowenthal said. "Or you could look at it as that person gave me a job."
Unlike in other mediums, gaming transforms the viewer into an active participant.
Harbour said that video games carried potential for artistry, social commentary and emotional catharsis, and that he joined Alone in the Dark because it "seemed fertile soil for an imaginative retelling and the opportunity to actually take a chance."
Abubakar Salim, who acted in the game Assassin's Creed Origins and the TV show "Raised by Wolves," is now making his own game, Tales of Kenzera: Zau, about a shaman trying to reclaim his father's spirit in a world inspired by Bantu traditions. Salim wants people to go on a journey of grief and beauty.
"The experience that I wanted to deliver had to be a game," he said.

Free Blockbuster Libraries Offer an Alternative to Streaming: [National Desk]

Full text: The neighborhood lending libraries have popped up around North America, offering a nostalgic return to DVDs.
Streaming services have transformed the way we view film and television, leaving us isolated on our couches, subject to the suggestions of an algorithm. But a small group of film buffs with a fondness for physical media are hoping to lure people back into the real world -- one abandoned newspaper box at a time.
The Free Blockbuster project began in 2019, when Brian Morrison, a film and television producer in Los Angeles, and a former Blockbuster employee, painted the company's blue-and-yellow logo onto an old box and filled it with DVDs. For many, the brand evokes memories of the trip to the video store with friends or family to browse the shelves and to pick up a film and a bag of popcorn.
"There's a nostalgia attached to it that is resonant for a whole generation," he said of the nearly obsolete Blockbuster chain, which operated thousands of video rental stores worldwide at its peak in the early 2000s. "It means something to a lot of people."
The Free Blockbuster movement slowly gained traction and eventually, more than 200 other community boxes had opened from Louisiana to Canada and even Britain -- though it is unclear how many remain operational.
"We are social animals; we want to go out into the world and engage with each other," said Mr. Morrison, who keeps a lending library outside his home. He often refills it with DVDs and VHS tapes including TV series, horror movies and, on occasion, signed independent films, and said that it had encouraged interaction with his neighbors.
Andrew Kevin Walker, a Los Angeles-based screenwriter, said he had visited secondhand stores especially to seek out films to leave in the boxes -- including two sealed James Bond box sets and a copy of "Cobra," a 1986 film written by Sylvester Stallone. "It's an opportunity for people to really share their love of cinema, whether it be their favorite guilty pleasure, or their favorite movie of all time," he said.
Viewers with streaming fatigue say they are tired of chasing content that moves around an ever-expanding array of platforms or even disappears altogether, and some long for the physical media that was dominant until streaming took over.
"I think it's great that folks are doing this -- keeping the spirit of DVDs alive, circulating film in and exchanging them," said Joe Pichirallo, a film producer and professor at New York University.
Shortly after Free Blockbuster was launched, a lawyer for DISH Network, which now owns the Blockbuster brand, sent Mr. Morrison a letter asking he stop using the company's logo and name.
A spokeswoman for DISH did not respond to questions about the letter, but said in an email that the company was "aware" of the Free Blockbuster initiative. "DISH continues to explore and evaluate different opportunities that would best fit the iconic brand," she said. Blockbuster opened in Dallas in 1985 and by 2004 had grown to more than 9,000 stores around the world. In 2000, the company turned down an offer to buy Netflix, now worth about $ 265 billion, for $ 50 million.
Last year, Netflix ended its DVD service, and Best Buy recently announced it would stop selling discs. Physical media can still be borrowed from most public libraries.
"Consumers have found it much more convenient to watch something where, when and whenever they want," Professor Pichirallo said.
The award-winning filmmaker Ava DuVernay called the the recently renewed interest in DVDs vital and refreshing. "It is something that I very much embrace," she said in a phone interview.
When it comes to art, "nothing beats holding it in your hand," Ms. DuVernay said.
"That tactile intimacy of touch is something that sounds kind of flighty and unimportant, but touch is a sense," she said. "It is a part of the experience of consuming and experiencing art."
Ms. DuVernay lamented the loss of the director's cuts and commentary that often came with DVDs but are now largely absent from films on streaming services. "That's how I actually learned to make content," she said. "I picked up a camera when I was 32, I listened to directors talk about their films to the picture."
As Free Blockbusters have opened across the country, the last Blockbuster in Bend, Ore., continues to rent out films on DVD and Blu-ray. But Sandi Harding, who has managed the store for the past two decades, doesn't see them in competition: The more people who engage with the Blockbuster brand and physical media the better, she said.
The store, which became the last in the world after franchises in Alaska and Australia closed their doors, now largely draws summer tourists, in addition to some regular customers, said Ms. Harding, noting that about 80 percent of the store's income now comes from merchandise, and the remainder from film rentals. But it became increasingly challenging to scope out new releases on DVD and Blu-ray online, or at local department stores, she said.
"I don't think it'll ever go back to where it was before. But I think it's kind of like vinyl records," which have resurged, she said.
Alfonso Castillo, who co-founded a Free Blockbuster on Long Island with his son, said the lending library sees regular turnover with people both taking and dropping off movies, including older people. "My sense is that for them, it's less of this cool novelty sort of ironic thing and more like, finally, there's a place to get DVDs again," he said.
At a Free Blockbuster in Sun Valley, Calif., customers have included an Amazon driver, passers-by on horseback and those who have ventured from afar after hearing of the lending library on social media, said Alyssa Kollgaard, 37, who opened the library outside her home earlier this year and stocks it with season-specific films, subversive books and free candy. She said she hopes it gives people "the experience of browsing and holding things in your hand."
Farther south, in Hollywood, two other Free Blockbusters appeared empty on a recent Sunday, and the original, outside a grocery store in Los Feliz, has been removed by the city. But the one outside Mr. Morrison's home in the quiet neighborhood of Los Feliz was filled with DVDs, including the film "Pay it Forward," several seasons of the series "Burn Notice" and the 2000s sitcom "How I Met Your Mother."
Two men in their 20s noticed the box as they walked past, but said they didn't realize it had DVDs inside it. Neither watched films on physical media anymore, they said, preferring subscription services or YouTube. "It's just kind of like on the nostalgia factor, for sure," Sevag Halajian, 23, said of the box, recalling how as a child, he used to visit the video store with his friends.
"It was a fun time," he added. "This has inspired me to go back to the old 'Tom and Jerry' DVDs I have and watch them."
The Free Blockbuster project seizes on nostalgia of a generation raised on trips to the video store -- and targets others who have "streaming fatigue." In Sun Valley, Calif., Alyssa Kollgaard, above, stocks her library with season-specific films and candy.

From Westeros to Trying to Save Earth: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Born and raised in Dublin, Liam Cunningham speaks in Joycean streams of consciousness that often have no discernible beginning, middle or end. He talks with his hands and taps his feet, salting his anecdotes with friendly F-bombs, catching his breath only long enough to take a puff of his distinctively scented e-cigarettes. They aren't very popular on the set.
"They smell like if you took the cardboard that comes with a dry cleaned shirt and held it over a burner," said D.B. Weiss, who, with his production partner David Benioff, has given Cunningham choice roles in "Game of Thrones" and now "3 Body Problem." A heady new science-fiction series, based on a trilogy of novels by the Chinese author Liu Cixin, "3 Body Problem" premieres Thursday on Netflix.
In it, Cunningham plays Thomas Wade, the no-nonsense spy master who leads a team of physicists chosen to save the world from a very slow-moving but ominous alien invasion. Unlike Davos Seaworth, the emotionally vulnerable knight Cunningham played in "Thrones," Wade is gruff, bellicose and secretive, an enigmatic authority figure whose back story left even Cunningham with questions.
"So little about him is known, and everybody you talk to that's seen this thing is like, 'What's his story?"' Cunningham said on an Austin hotel patio during the South by Southwest Film Festival, where the series had its world premiere. "He's got the U.N. Secretary General on the end of the phone, and people do what he tells them to, and you go, 'Who's giving him this authority?' And the funny thing is, I never felt the need to talk to the boys" -- Weiss and Benioff, that is -- "they never offered, and I never asked, which probably is not a good thing to say, I should probably say to everybody, 'Oh, I know everything about him, but I'm not telling you."'
Breath. Puff.
Cunningham, 62 with salt-and-pepper hair and bright blue eyes, came to acting relatively late in life. He worked as an electrician until he was 29, spending a chunk of his 20s in Zimbabwe bringing electricity to rural communities. "You know the song 'Wichita Lineman'?" he asks, referring to the '60s country hit by Glen Campbell. "That was me, except I was the Zimbabwe lineman. For an Irish, pale-skinned elf from Dublin, it was mind-blowing." For a time he worked in a national park, "the size of Belgium and with 16,000 elephants."
This was new and exciting, and when he returned to Dublin and resumed driving from job to job in a little yellow van, he found he missed the charge of his life in Africa. Always interested in film and television, he saw a newspaper ad for an acting school and figured he could pick up a new hobby. As he began landing theater roles, it started to feel more like a vocation. He fell in love with the process, and with how it fed his natural sense of curiosity.
"It was the problem solving, the 'How do we get that to work?"' he said. "I just found all of that so fascinating."
Then it was time to break the news to his family. "I love my poor wife," he said. "I told her, 'We may be starving for the rest of our lives: I'm about to say goodbye to a nicely paid, semi-government job where the only way you can get sacked is if you shoot someone.' And I walked away from it."
She gave her blessing. Next he told his father, a practical-minded dockworker. Cunningham said that after he broke the news, his dad, without looking up from his newspaper, uttered just three words: "For [expletive] sake."
Cunningham soon found steady work in film and television, landing roles in movies like Alfonso Cuarón's "A Little Princess" (1995), Michael Winterbottom's "Jude" (1996) and opposite Cillian Murphy in Ken Loach's "The Wind that Shakes the Barley" (2006). Benioff and Weiss fell hard for Cunningham when they saw him in "Hunger" (2008), Steve McQueen's movie about the hunger strike of the Irish Republican Army martyr Bobby Sands. They were particularly taken with a long scene, much of it shot in a continuous take, in which a priest played by Cunningham tries to talk Michael Fassbender's Sands into ending his strike.
"It was just one of the most gripping things that any of us had ever seen," Weiss said, sitting alongside Benioff and their fellow "3 Body Problem" creator, Alexander Woo, in an interview in Austin. Benioff and Weiss cast Cunningham in "Thrones" starting in Season 2, and Davos became a fan favorite.
When the showrunners came back to Cunningham for "3 Body Problem," they almost didn't get him. "We were like Dustin Hoffman at the end of 'The Graduate,"' as Benioff put it, begging Cunningham, who had already committed to a movie, to join their project.
"I got a phone call from Dave and Dan, who had obviously done their intel," Cunningham recalled. "They said, 'You're not going with those guys, you're coming with us.' And I went, 'Yep, OK, thank you.' I hung the phone up, and then the professional side of my brain kicked in, and I thought, 'That was a bit [expletive] stupid, this could be a week's work or a couple of days. I didn't even ask them about the project."'
The way Cunningham's colleagues describe it, hiring the actor doesn't just mean getting a fiercely focused performer when the cameras are rolling. They also get a tireless raconteur for the downtime hours.
"He loves telling a long story," Benioff said. "The other night, we were having a drink and he started telling this story about Thailand. Then, midway through, he stops and looks at us and he goes, 'Where was I going with this?' And we're like, 'We don't know, Liam. Where were you going with it?' He just lost the thread.
"He also does an act with a napkin that Dan and I had to sit through."
A napkin act? This sounded intriguing.
"I'm not doing it," Cunningham said. "It's one of those things where you have to have a few drinks in you. It's appalling, and it takes 15 minutes."
Jess Hong, who plays the physicist Jin Cheng in "3 Body Problem," shares several scenes with Cunningham, as Wade tries to badger Jin into bringing her skills to the fight to save Earth. She said the Cunningham vigor also comes in handy when it's time to get down to business.
"It's incredible to watch him work because as soon as the camera rolls, all of that crazy, almost childlike energy gets focused into the lens," she said in a video call from London, where she was promoting the series. "On the way to the set, he's chatting away in the car about what decisions he might make, and when we rehearse he's chatting away, trying to figure out the best way we can collaborate. Those are always the most creatively fulfilling times, when you have someone really wanting to push the work to its potential."
But Cunningham comes across as more intuitive than systematic, especially when it comes to choosing roles. "I try not to analyze that too much because you put up parameters, and if you analyze it, your parameters get a little bit smaller every time," he said. "You start to find a niche and that involves repetition, and I get bored really, really easily."
One gets the feeling he'd rather talk about something other than acting. For instance, barbecue. He had just been to one of Austin's most popular pit stops, and he was still buzzing over the experience.
"I went down to the room where they cook, and it looks like the engine room of a submarine," he said. "And the pit master, you can tell he loves his work. It was really cool just to watch him and the pride he took and how they were loading it all up; six hours for the pork ribs, eight hours for the beef ribs, 12 hours for the brisket. He went through the whole thing, it was really entertaining. Beautiful smells."
He's going to save the world, but first he'll try the ribs. And, of course, tell you how good they are.

BUSINESS
A headline with an article on Friday about a vote to enable former President Donald J. Trump's social media company to start trading on the stock market misstated the type of transaction involved in taking the company public. The transaction was a merger of Mr. Trump's company with a publicly traded shell company called Digital World Acquisition Corporation; it did not involve an initial public offering.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Netflix sci-fi adaptation has done its physics homework, even if it sometimes falls short on the humanities.
The aliens who menace humankind in Netflix's "3 Body Problem" believe in doing a lot with a little. Specifically, they can unfold a single proton into multiple higher dimensions, enabling them to print computer circuits with the surface area of a planet onto a particle smaller than a pinprick.
"3 Body Problem," the audacious adaptation of a hard-sci-fi trilogy by Liu Cixin, is a comparable feat of engineering and compression. Its first season, arriving Thursday, wrestles Liu's inventions and physics explainers onto the screen with visual grandeur, thrills and wow moments. If one thing holds it back from greatness, it's the characters, who could have used some alien technology to lend them an extra dimension or two. But the series's scale and mind-bending turns may leave you too starry-eyed to notice.
David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, partnering here with Alexander Woo ("The Terror: Infamy"), are best known for translating George R.R. Martin's incomplete "A Song of Ice and Fire" fantasy saga into "Game of Thrones." Whatever your opinions of that series -- and there are plenty -- it laid out the duo's strengths as adapters and their weaknesses as creators of original material.
Beginning with Martin's finished novels, Benioff and Weiss converted the sprawling tomes into heady popcorn TV with epic battles and intimate conversations. Toward the end, working from outlines or less, they rushed to a finish and let visual spectacle overshadow the once-vivid characters.
In "3 Body," however, they and Woo have a complete story to work with, and it's a doozy. It announces its sweep up front, opening with a Chinese scientist's public execution during Mao's Cultural Revolution, then jumping to the present day, when a wave of notable physicists are inexplicably dying by suicide.
The deaths may be related to several strange phenomena. Experiments in particle accelerators around the world suddenly find that the last several decades' worth of research is wrong. Brilliant scientific minds are being sent futuristic headsets of unknown provenance that invite them to join an uncannily realistic virtual-reality game. Oh, also, one night all the stars in the sky start blinking on and off.
It all suggests the working of an advanced power, not of the cuddly E.T. variety. What starts as a detective mystery, pursued by the rumpled intelligence investigator Clarence Da Shi (Benedict Wong), escalates to a looming war of the worlds. What the aliens want and what they might do to get it is unclear at first, but as Clarence intuits, "Usually when people with more advanced technology encounter people with more primitive technology, doesn't work out well for the primitives."
Most of the first season's plot comes straight from Liu's work. The biggest changes are in story structure and location. Liu's trilogy, while wide-ranging, focused largely on Chinese characters and had specifically Chinese historical and political overtones. Benioff, Weiss and Woo have globalized the story, shifting much of the action to London, with a multiethnic cast. (Viewers interested in a more literal rendition of Liu's story can watch last year's stiff but thorough Chinese adaptation on Peacock.)
They've also given Liu's heavy science a dose of the humanities. Liu is a brilliant novelist of speculative ideas, but his characters can read like figures from story problems. In the series, a little playful dialogue goes a long way toward leavening all the Physics 101.
So does casting. Wong puffs life into his generically hard-boiled gumshoe. Liam Cunningham (Davos Seaworth in "Thrones") stands out as Thomas Wade, a sharp-tongued spymaster, as does Rosalind Chao as Ye Wenjie, an astrophysicist whose brutal experience in the Cultural Revolution makes her question her allegiance to humanity. Zine Tseng is also excellent as the young Ye.
More curious, if understandable, is the decision to shuffle and reconfigure characters from throughout Liu's trilogy into a clique of five attractive Oxford-grad prodigies who carry much of the narrative: Jin Cheng (Jess Hong), a dogged physicist with personal ties to the dead-scientists case; Auggie Salazar (Eiza González), an idealistic nanofibers researcher; Saul Durand (Jovan Adepo), a gifted but jaded research assistant; Will Downing (Alex Sharp), a sweet-natured teacher with a crush on Jin; and Jack Rooney (John Bradley of "Thrones"), a scientist turned snack-food entrepreneur and the principal source of comic relief.
The writers manage to bump up Liu's one-dimensional characterizations to two-ish, but the "Oxford Five," with the exception of Jin, don't feel entirely rounded. This is no small thing; in a fantastical series like "Thrones" or "Lost," it is the memorable individuals -- your Arya Starks and your Ben Linuses -- who hold you through the ups and downs of the story.
The plot, however, is dizzying and the world-building immersive, and the reportedly galactic budget looks well and creatively spent on the screen. Take the virtual-reality scenes, through which "3 Body" gradually reveals its stakes and the aliens' motives. Each character who dons the headset finds themselves in an otherworldly version of an ancient kingdom -- China for Jin, England for Jack -- which they are challenged to save from repeating cataclysms caused by the presence of three suns (hence the series's title).
"3 Body" has a streak of techno-optimism even at its bleakest moments, the belief that the physical universe is explicable even when cruel. The universe's inhabitants are another matter. Alongside the race to save humanity is the question of whether humanity is worth saving -- a group of alien sympathizers, led by a billionaire environmentalist (Jonathan Pryce), decides that Earth would benefit from a good cosmic intervention.
All this attaches the show's brainiac spectacle to big humanistic ideas. The threat in "3 Body" is looming rather than imminent -- these are not the kind of aliens who pull up quick and vaporize the White House -- which makes for a parallel to the existential but gradual threat of climate change. Like "Thrones," with its White Walkers lurking beyond the Wall, "3 Body" is in part a collective-action problem.
It is also morally provocative. Liu's novels make an argument that in a cold, indifferent universe, survival can require a hard heart; basing decisions on personal conscience can be a kind of selfishness and folly. The series is a bit more sentimental, emphasizing relationships and individual agency over game theory and determinism. But it's willing to go dark: In a striking midseason episode, the heroes make a morally gray decision in the name of planetary security, and the consequences are depicted in horrifying detail.
Viewers new to the story should find it exciting on its own. (You do not need to have read the books first; you should never need to read the books to watch a TV series.) But the book trilogy does go to some weird, grim -- and presumably challenging to film -- places, and it will be interesting to see if and how future seasons follow.
For now, there's flair, ambition and galaxy-brain twists aplenty. Sure, this kind of story is tough to pull off beginning to end (see, again, "Game of Thrones"). But what's the thrill in creating a headily expanding universe if there's no risk of it collapsing?

Full text: A new reality show with familiar faces comes to Bravo, and NBC airs competitive skating.
For TV viewers like me who still haven't cut the cord, here is a selection of cable and network shows, movies and specials broadcasting Monday through Sunday, March 18-24. Details and times are subject to change.
Monday
AN OPRAH SPECIAL: SHAME, BLAME AND THE WEIGHT LOSS REVOLUTION 8 p.m. on ABC. For the past year, any large grouping of celebrities (think: the Oscars or the Met Gala) has prompted a conversation about Ozempic, a drug that, along with like Wegovy and Mounjaro, was traditionally used to treat diabetes but has now become a weight-loss trend for the glitterati. In this special, Oprah Winfrey sits down with doctors to discuss the benefits of these drugs, particularly in combating the obesity epidemic in the United States, and their potential misuses.
THE BACHELOR: WOMEN TELL ALL 9 p.m. on ABC. Maria Georgas, who didn't receive a rose from Joey Graziadei after he met her family in Ontario, Canada, has quickly become a Bachelor Nation favorite. Though we don't know how the season will end or whom Joey will ultimately choose, I am confident that scene-stealing Maria will continue to make great television.
Tuesday
THE VALLEY 9 p.m. on Bravo. If you were watching the latest season of "Vanderpump Rules" and asked, where the heck are Jax Taylor, Brittany Cartwright and Kristen Doute, I have the answer for you: They left West Hollywood and moved to the Valley. This new Bravo show features the former "Vanderpump Rules" cast members and their new friends as they settle into a more domestic lifestyle in the suburbs. We know that Taylor and Cartwright are currently separated, so it will be interesting to see if this show gives any clues about what went wrong in their relationship.
Wednesday
TOP CHEF 9 p.m. on Bravo. Even if you aren't the best in the kitchen, there is something soothing about watching other people cook delicious-looking meals. For the 21st season of this series, the host Kristen Kish and the judges Tom Colicchio and Gail Simmons head to Wisconsin, where the chefs competing will show off the best food that Milwaukee has to offer -- which I hope includes some deep-fried cheese curds.
Thursday
HOUSE HUNTERS: ALL STARS 8 p.m. on HGTV. We had "Love Island," "The Challenge," and now -- because 2024 is shaping up to be the year of "all star" specials -- we have "House Hunters." This series borrows HGTV celebrities from their usual shows and follows them closing deals on their home turfs. I can't wait to see the former "Selling Sunset" star Heather Rae El Moussa stage a Southern Californian mansion.
Friday
WHEN HARRY MET SALLY (1989) 6:45 p.m. on IFC. Some argue that this is a fall movie or a New Year's Eve movie, but really it's a year-round movie because, with each viewing, you can learn a valuable life lesson, like how to order a restaurant meal exactly as you want it. Come for the cozy '90s outfit inspiration, and stay for the "I'll have what she's having" scene.
PAST LIVES (2023) 8 p.m. on Showtime. Though this movie didn't take home any Oscars, it is still worth a watch; our film critic Manohla Dargis called it "a tale of friendship, love, regret and what it means to truly live here and now," marking it as a critic's pick. The story follows Nora (Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), who first meet as schoolmates in Seoul and then meet up again as adults.
Saturday
WORLD FIGURE SKATING CHAMPIONSHIPS 8 p.m. on NBC. If you binged the Netflix drama "Spinning Out" and wished there were a season two, the biggest competition in the skating world can aid with that TV longing. In Montreal, skaters from more than 50 countries will compete in at least one of the four categories: men, women, pairs and ice dance.
RAMY YOUSSEF: MORE FEELINGS 10 p.m. on HBO. We got to know the comedian Ramy Youssef from his recent role in "Poor Things" and his acclaimed semi-autobiographical series "Ramy." Now he's using this stand-up special to talk more about his experience growing up as a Muslim and Egyptian American as well as touch on the upcoming election and the importance of prayer.
Sunday
SUMMER HOUSE: MARTHA'S VINEYARD 9 p.m. on Bravo. Imagine my delight when I found out there would be two concurrent seasons of "Summer House," the show where a handful of Bravo-lebrities rent a house in the Hamptons, airing at the same time. Now viewers will be able to see the cast of the Martha's Vineyard version head to the Oak Bluffs area to party and argue.

Gabriel García Márquez Wanted His Last Novel to Be Destroyed: [Op-Ed]

Author: Santana-Acuña, Álvaro

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When the writer Gabriel García Márquez, the author of "One Hundred Years of Solitude" and other classic novels, died nearly 10 years ago, he left behind an unfinished novel, "Until August." The novel was published this week, unleashing a backlash from scholars, writers and fans who've taken exception not with the novel itself, but rather with what they see as an act of betrayal that endangers García Márquez's legacy.
Before his death, García Márquez asked his sons, Rodrigo García and Gonzalo García Barcha, to destroy the novel. They did not. They could not. I understand.
The life of a work of art does not end when its creator dies. Artists too rarely leave clear instructions on what to do with their works, especially unfinished ones, which can lead to messy legal battles. Even when the instructions are specific, it can put executors in an impossible position. The heirs inherit the responsibility to preserve and promote the artist's legacy so that it can be appreciated for generations to come.
Imagine being the one to decide whether to destroy the work of an influential artist, who also happens to be your father, and what it's like to live with the knowledge that people will watch and judge what you do today, while those in the future may lament your actions. The truth is that if García Márquez's sons had done as their father asked, they would most likely have been met with criticism, too. Honestly, no matter what heirs do, some people will not be pleased.
We all benefit when works by great artists that are marked for destruction are instead preserved. That's why the way García Márquez's sons have managed their father's legacy, including the publication of "Until August," should be praised and perhaps even studied.
It's likely that by the time García Márquez began working on "Until August" more intensely in 2003, his memory had already begun to fail him. I saw the different versions of the manuscript at the archives. They were disorganized and the writing more hesitant when compared with previous works. Nonetheless, he completed an unpolished full draft the following year. His sons, friends and literary agent tried to help him edit it until his dementia became too advanced. At that point, thinking it was no good, García Márquez asked his sons to destroy it.
It's easy to jump to conclusions after hearing the news that the sons published the novel despite their father's orders. It certainly makes for a catchy headline. Many have rushed to accuse his sons of publishing the novel simply for the money -- similar accusations were raised after the family sold the writer's archives to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, and after selling the rights to adapt "One Hundred Years of Solitude" to Netflix.
But those decisions have made García Márquez's works more publicly and globally available. The Gabriel García Márquez Archive at the Ransom Center, which also holds materials by William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway, is one of the most visited collections both on-site and online.
When I visited the archives, I read his personal correspondence, which gave me a window into how he wrote "One Hundred Years of Solitude," which later formed the basis of my research for my book on the writing of the novel.
Surely, not all heirs act admirably. For decades, María Kodama, the widow of Jorge Luis Borges, sued anybody for what she deemed to be incorrect use of her husband's works. She was often accused of being too protective. She died in 2023 without, incomprehensibly, a will or a designated heir. Now her most direct relatives -- five nieces and nephews with whom she reportedly had little contact -- are the heirs to Borges's works.
Nobody denies that "Until August" is the unpolished work of an aging master. It should be read as such. The heirs of artists must serve their wishes, but also their legacy -- which is sometimes served best by making their works, however imperfect, available to readers for generations to come.
Imperfect works of art are more useful than destroyed ones. Days before he died in 1852, the Russian writer Nikolai Gogol burned several manuscripts, among them, the second part of what would have been the trilogy "Dead Souls." Scholars and fans have lamented their destruction.
When works of art are made available, artists can live on and even perpetuate themselves in the most beautiful of ways: in the works of future artists. Franz Kafka, in his dying days, ordered his friend Max Brod to burn his unfinished works. Brod famously did not. This betrayal changed the history of literature and the life of a young man who, after reading "The Metamorphosis," decided to become a writer. The man was García Márquez.
While "The Metamorphosis" was not one of the books that Kafka wanted to burn, it didn't gain fame and great influence until Kafka received further attention through the works Brod saved. If the publication of "Until August" inspires someone to be a writer, García Márquez's sons would have done literature a great favor, just as Brod did.
Álvaro Santana-Acuña is a sociology professor at Whitman College and Harvard Summer School, and the author of "Ascent to Glory," a study of "One Hundred Years of Solitude."

Those Detailed Views May Be Deceiving: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: Though blockbusters are synonymous with computer imagery, dramas and art-house films rely extensively on tech magic, too. Don't be fooled by the naturalism.
A woman crosses a bustling street at night. Cars pass noisily. A streetcar cruises by. Behind her, we see twinkling streetlights, a cinema marquee, towering neon signs. It rained earlier; the roads are still wet. It's Mexico City in the early 1970s, and it feels vibrantly alive.
This is a scene in "Roma" (2018), Alfonso Cuarón's naturalistic, semi-autobiographical black-and-white drama based on the life of the housekeeper who helped raise him as a child. It's also, less obviously, a dazzling showcase of visual effects.
The huge movie theater in the background is entirely CGI. So is the streetcar, and many of the other vehicles, as well as most of the buildings, signs, facades, lights and pedestrians. Even the reflections visible in the puddles on the road were created on a computer. Though it's been designed to be completely inconspicuous and convincing, Aaron Weintraub, the head of creative operations at the visual effects studio MPC, describes this moment as "one of our flagship shots."
What comes to mind when you think of visual effects, or VFX? For most people, it's fantasy and science fiction: aliens in spaceships, superheroes zooming across imaginary lands. And while it's certainly true that big-budget genre films and summer blockbusters are rife with computer-generated imagery, VFX studios like MPC estimate that about half the work they produce is made to be invisible. For every "Kraven the Hunter" or "Argylle," there's a "Ferrari," "Maestro" or "Killers of the Flower Moon," movies with sophisticated visual effects that the filmmakers hope you'll never realize was an effect at all.
"When people talk about VFX, it's the obvious stuff -- the explosions, the laser beams, the science-fiction stuff," Weintraub said. "But there's a whole world of work being done that's transparent to the audience, and no one is supposed to know." He likened it to the work of film and TV costume designers. What attracts attention and wins Oscars, he said, are "lavish period costumes and fancy superhero suits," but in fact, "you have a costume designer on every film who makes normal clothes that normal people wear, and no one talks about them."
Robert Grasmere, a VFX supervisor with the boutique effects studio Temprimental, takes a certain pride in his work going unnoticed. "Almost every film I've worked on, my friends and family see it, and then say to me, 'You didn't do anything; there were no effects in that movie,"' he said. "I love that."
Invisible VFX work ranges widely in scope, purpose and style. Much of it is a matter of problem solving -- correcting mistakes and oversights on set. Changes have always been made in the editing room, of course, but as VFX have become cheaper and more plentiful, filmmakers are increasingly relying on computer wizardry to fix errors, make adjustments, and otherwise tune things up.
"Everyone tends to underestimate the amount of invisible effects that go into a movie," said Raoul Bolognini, chief executive of Temprimental. "This work takes months and months to do, costs thousands of thousands of dollars, and you'd never think in a million years how much work goes into it because you can't tell it's there."
Visual effects are regularly used to change the color of an actor's shirt, adjust a hairstyle, or alter the look of a set or a backdrop to better suit the director's vision. They can also help eliminate problems that turn up at the 11th hour. "You might be looking at a shot for the thousandth time" and notice a problem with a background extra, said Luke Groves, senior vice president at MPC. Where a gaffe like that might once have wound up in a YouTube supercut, VFX artists are now able to wipe it out before anyone's the wiser.
Many of these effects are remarkably subtle. When an actor is asked to play dead, Groves said, effects artists are there to make it more realistic: "No matter how great a performance is, there are always going to be micromovements. We're constantly taking out breathing or eye movements. We are able to come in and preserve the performance, but present a heightened level of reality."
There's a moment in "Nightmare Alley," Guillermo Del Toro's moody noir from 2021, in which Bradley Cooper's con man, Stanton Carlisle, returns to his hotel room to find showmen from the carnival waiting for him. As it was originally shot, Toni Collette greets him with a quip. But in the finished film, she says nothing -- a change achieved by cutting the audio and digitally replacing the actress's mouth.
It isn't simply that most viewers would never notice this change. It would never occur to them that such a change was even possible -- and changes like this are being made all the time, in films that don't seem to feature VFX.
Performances are often fine-tuned now using effects work. For a dramatic monologue delivered in close-up, VFX artists may be asked to remove an actor's blinking by superimposing a set of open eyes over their eyelids to make the shot more engaging. "We're constantly finding eyes that aren't closed and putting them in over eye blinks," Grasmere explained.
For a comedy set piece, different lines can be stitched together digitally to make sure the film keeps the funniest material from each take. "One guy's line might be funny, but the other guy's response isn't," Grasmere said. "If they touch each other during the shot, we might have to rebuild a hand, or an entire arm. Or we'll repaint the background from one shot, blend two faces from two other moments, or superimpose something into the foreground to match two different performances together. There are a million ways to make it work."
A lot of invisible effects work concentrates on faces. Artists can do replacements on body doubles, either for nude scenes or dangerous stunts. More commonly, there's extensive cosmetic work performed on actors -- removing wrinkles, smoothing out blemishes or otherwise correcting imperfections to make actors look their best. This kind of work is usually referred to as "visual makeup" or vanity VFX, and it's becoming so common that many top stars have this work written into their contracts.
"Cosmetic VFX work is often super complex, but because we have to sign nondisclosure agreements, we can rarely talk about or advertise that work," said Martin Pelletier, a VFX supervisor with Rodeo. "You might do a sequel where an actor returns to a role and has put on a humongous amount of weight, and we have to come in and fix it. Or someone has a triple chin, and we have to make him or her look nice and thin."
"It can be a sensitive question," Pelletier added. "We once had an actress who didn't want to look overweight in a scene surrounded by a bunch of people. We had to shave off about 80 pounds."
One of the most common invisible effects is what's known as "retiming." If a director feels that a shot or a scene is running too short or too long, it can be sped up or slowed down by either removing frames or adding them. This can create visual artifacts or a kind of unnatural distortion, or cause the shot to look "jittery" and "steppy." Visual effects artists make imperceptible adjustments "so that it all moves smoothly," Weintraub said. "It gets tricky, and it's a subliminal thing."
All of this affords filmmakers a level of control over continuity that borders on perfectionism. "Maybe there's a spot on somebody's face in one shot, or someone's hair was slightly off and we have to go in and replace it," Groves said. "On the one hand, it's like, who cares? No one will notice. But at the end of the day, it's these little things that can make a film just that much better."

Full text: Lindsay Lohan plays a book editor whose romantic dream comes true in this Netflix rom-com. But then Ed Speleers shows up in a red sports car.
Lindsay Lohan's well-loved early comedies involve her playing characters pretending to be someone else: think of the chaotic swaps of "The Parent Trap" and "Freaky Friday," or the social climbing of "Mean Girls."
In "Irish Wish," Lohan takes up another character who's role-playing in her own life: Maddie, a diligent book editor who suddenly finds herself in another version of the world, where she's marrying the handsome author she handles.
The story doesn't start that way. The guy, Paul (Alexander Vlahos), originally falls for Maddie's friend Emma (Elizabeth Tan). Paul and Emma prepare to marry at his family's manor in County Mayo, Ireland (cue extremely green touristic panoramas). Attending as a guest, Maddie takes a fateful walk and voices her wish that she were the bride instead. Presto -- thanks to Saint Brigid, apparently -- she wakes up at the manor, engaged to Paul.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The movie (directed by Janeen Damian and written by Kirsten Hansen) skips over Maddie savoring the outcome of her wish, and shifts right into charming comedy around her confusion, including having no memory about how she got engaged. Maybe that's another way of expressing that the match was never going to be a great fit. Paul is a bit of cad, and not even entertainingly awful. But hark, an alternative to this alternate reality appears with James (Ed Speleers of "You"), a photographer she meets by chance who's forthright, sensitive and the owner of a sweet red sports car.
Maddie warms to James's wisdom, and her wedding plans with Paul begin to unravel. There's also a worthy subplot about Maddie's growing independence from her phone-clingy mother (Jane Seymour), but mostly the movie is a determinedly mild addition to the Lindsay Lohan "what-if" universe.

With Lackluster Growth, Dating Apps Are in Need of a Spark: [National Desk]

Full text: As online dating became as easy as swiping a finger across your phone screen, the companies who own apps like Tinder and Bumble became Wall Street darlings. But about a decade later, those platforms are now struggling to live up to expectations, and investors have grown frustrated and eager for something new.
Match Group and Bumble -- which make up nearly the entire industry by market share -- have lost more than $ 40 billion in market value since 2021. Even in an age when the apps are a staple on people's smartphones, the two companies are laying off workers and reporting lackluster revenue growth.
Both companies have recently brought on leaders who have vowed to experiment with new features, hoping to capture the growth investors crave. But they face one critical obstacle: Not enough young people are willing to pay for subscriptions to dating apps -- partly because younger daters are increasingly looking to platforms like Snapchat and TikTok to make connections -- and it's not clear what will change that.
Match Group and Bumble generate the bulk of their revenue -- about $ 4.2 billion for both companies last year -- by selling subscriptions, with smaller income streams from advertising. But they're struggling to grow those sales. Match Group was able to keep revenues steady last year only by raising its prices.
As far as investors are concerned, the businesses need to convince more young users to pay.
"Wall Street loves subscription models because it gives them the comfort of recurring revenues," said Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Securities.
By paying, users can unlock features like unlimited swipes and the ability to see who has swiped on them. But for many people, that's not enough: Unlike other paid subscription services, like Spotify or Netflix, dating apps can't guarantee that you'll find what you're looking for.
"It feels really different to pay for access to people," said Kathryn D. Coduto, a Boston University professor who studies dating apps. "Paying for it makes it feel a little skeezy."
In the United States, 30 percent of adults, and over half of adults under 30, use dating apps, according to a survey by Pew Research Center that was released last year. About a third of dating app users reported paying for them, with men and higher-income adults more likely to pay than others, the survey found.
Millennials, the nation's largest generation, were prime dating age when Tinder first rolled out, but more and more of them have married in recent years, a decision that usually results in people quitting the apps. Now the primary users are from Gen Z, a younger -- and smaller -- demographic with less disposable income. That generational shift poses a challenge for the dating app industry.
Mandy Wang, an 18-year-old student at New York University, said she preferred to meet people in person or through a direct message on platforms like Instagram or Snapchat. Dating apps are for casual use, "like a game," she said.
"People use dating apps, but I don't know anyone who pays for it," Ms. Wang said. In fact, she said that she would consider it an "ick" if she learned somebody was paying for a subscription.
Jess Carbino, a former sociologist for Tinder who is now a consultant and dating coach, said younger people "still feel a desire to use online dating apps, but they're not necessarily experiencing a sense of urgency to find a partner."
"I think what we're seeing is purely a demographic shift," Dr. Carbino said.
Match Group and Bumble declined to comment on their plans to draw in more paying users, pointing to public statements made by their executives.
Bumble's chief executive, Lidiane Jones, told analysts last month that the company would be revamping the app to appeal to more users, particularly younger ones, by adding "personalization and flexibility" to the experience.
Bumble's larger competitor, Match Group, was an early player in the online dating market, starting with Match.com in 1995. The company acquired Tinder in 2017 and Hinge in 2018, kicking off a period of growth that caught investors' attention.
Tinder is the largest brand in Match Group's portfolio and the most popular dating app in the United States. It shook up the industry landscape in 2012 when it introduced a swipe feature, which is now ubiquitous in dating apps. But the swipe's novelty has worn off, and Tinder has lost momentum. The number of paid users on the app was down nearly 10 percent in 2023.
Tinder's struggles, and those of the broader dating app industry, are in part because the format is substantially the same as it has been for more than a decade, said Zach Morrissey, an analyst at Wolfe Research, a financial research firm. But the way people date may have shifted.
"This is a space where product innovation has been relatively muted in recent years," he said.
That's starting to hurt. Bumble, which went public in 2021, initially jumped in value but after a steady slide its stock is now about a quarter of its I.P.O. price. Match Group's stock price reached a high of $ 169 in 2021. It now sits at $ 34, about a fifth of its peak value.
Match Group and Bumble have made some changes recently to convince investors that they can spin things around, but it's unclear what will solve their problems. "There's not an obvious silver bullet that they need to address," Mr. Morrissey said.
Both companies have had some leadership shake-ups: In January, Ms. Jones joined Bumble, and Match Group promoted Faye Iosotaluno, the former chief operating officer of Tinder, to be the app's chief executive.
Bumble announced last month that the company was laying off about a third of its work force in the first half of this year. It also lowered its revenue forecast for the first quarter, below Wall Street expectations.
"The demand for connection and love continues to be really strong -- two billion single people around the globe," Ms. Jones told analysts in February. "Yet the products that are bearing the set of experiences to create those connections are not serving users the way that they want to."
Match Group's chief executive, Bernard Kim, told analysts in a Jan. 31 earnings call that this year Tinder was "adopting a fast-fail mentality, a strategy that prioritizes rapid experimentation and testing." Mr. Kim took over the company in 2022 after previously serving as president of Zynga, the maker of mobile games like Farmville.
He said that the company would attract more paying users through marketing and that it was adjusting its products in various ways, including introducing new à la carte premium features.
Match Group has also expanded its offerings, like a service for L.G.B.T.Q. dating, called Archer, and one marketed toward Latinos, called Chispa. Revenue from those products was down 4 percent in 2023.
Mr. Kim said that Tinder was reimagining the swipe feature altogether and would be rolling out new functions this year. The platform is also pushing for more users to get verified, a move that's aimed at improving safety and helping women feel more comfortable using the app.
The activist investor Elliott Management, which previously led shake-ups at Salesforce and Pinterest, took a $ 1 billion stake in Match Group in January, a sign that Wall Street sees an opportunity for growth.
Elliott declined to comment on its discussions with Match Group. Mr. Kim told analysts that he and the firm had "collaborative dialogue."
Despite the challenges, the dating industry isn't going anywhere, said Ken Gawrelski, an analyst at Wells Fargo.
"Dating, overall, and love, more generally, is a core human behavior," he said. "So it's hard to believe that changes materially. But the way we date, or the way we find matches, is very much an issue in this discussion."

An Actor Finds Glee At the Core Of Villains: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Daniel Ings has built a career playing charming, posh men. His latest role is a chaotic aristocrat in Guy Ritchie's series "The Gentlemen."
In the first episode of Guy Ritchie's new Netflix series "The Gentlemen," a British aristocrat is forced to dress up in a chicken suit and dance on camera at the pleasure of a gangster to whom he owes money. He flaps his arms wildly, thrusts his head forward and crows at the top of his voice, as tears stream down his face.
The man in the costume is Daniel Ings, an actor whose face people might recognize more than his name. He is best known for playing Luke, a lovable womanizer on the sitcom "Lovesick," but he has also appeared in many other television roles that fit a certain archetype: the charming, posh British man, who is a bit of a cad.
In "The Crown," he played a roguish friend of Prince Philip; he was the unreliable father of Dr. Jean Milburn's baby on "Sex Education" and the resentful husband on Lucy Prebble's "I Hate Suzie."
"I probably should show some range at some point," Ings, 38, joked in a recent interview at a London hotel. But he enjoyed playing "the cheeky chappy," he said, as well as the challenge of transforming characters who, on paper, seem quite unlikable into endearing onscreen presences. When Ings reads a script that frames his prospective role as a villain, he said, he thinks, "I bet I can find something childlike, something fun in there."
To play Freddy in "The Gentlemen," Ings brought this approach to what might be his most reprehensible character yet. The arrogant, drug-addled eldest son of a duke, Freddy is passed over in his father's will in favor of his younger brother, Eddie (Theo James), who discovers organized criminals running an enormous weed farm underneath the family estate.
As Eddie tries to safely extract his family from the criminal world, Freddy creates chaos. It was essential to the plot, Ings said, for viewers to feel some of the affection that Eddie has for his "idiot brother," so that they understand when Eddie enters into dodgy deals with gangsters to protect Freddy and pay his debts.
Although Ings has made a career playing upper-class British rogues, his own background is a little different. He went to a private school in England, but his family was lower-middle class, he said, and he learned to play posh by observing his classmates. "It's a thing that I know from watching it, and I can perform it ironically," he said. Though many of his characters are lotharios, Ings has been in a relationship with his wife since they were teenagers.
An Ings performance is a balancing act between careful attention to what he calls "the cadence of dialogue" and physical improvisation, in which he lets loose and makes himself ridiculous. Filming "The Gentlemen" gave Ings the opportunity for both. For a scene in which Freddy learns from his father's will that he won't get the inheritance he expects, Ings said he carefully prepared his lines of furious dialogue. But Ritchie, the episode's director, gave him free rein, take after take, Ings added, to see where the scene could take him. "There was an opportunity to rampage," Ings said, smiling.
Ritchie said in an emailed statement that the opportunity to evolve Eddie and Freddy's story over the course of eight hourlong episodes was "tremendously liberating," compared with the restraints of a 2020 film, also called "The Gentlemen," that he had made featuring a similar plot.
Ings's characters -- including Freddy -- are often loud, verbose and physically expressive. In person, the actor also spoke exuberantly with his hands and swore a lot. "On the one hand, he's very English," said Johnny Flynn, who starred alongside Ings in "Lovesick," "but in terms of his energy, it's more of an American comedy atmosphere."
Ings cited actors like Vince Vaughn and Robin Williams as his heroes. His dream role, he said, would be something similar to Williams on "Mork and Mindy," a sitcom that premiered in the late '70s, in which Williams played an extraterrestrial navigating life on Earth. Williams would "come in and just improvise these insane rants and physical comedy, or go bouncing around the set," Ings said.
Although Ings seemed happy in his posh cad niche, he said if he were to branch out, he would want to do more theater. He hasn't been onstage since 2013, when he provided comic relief as the Porter in a London production of "Macbeth" -- though he wasn't interested in a yearlong, West End run. "I know I would get bored," he said, "and you can't improvise onstage -- unless you're Mark Rylance."
Ultimately, performing "should be fun for the audience, and fun for the community of people who were there on the day doing it," Ings said. "Bring back 'Mork and Mindy,' you know what I mean?"

LOS ANGELES — Four years ago, as a deadly virus began to upend the world, Jessica Jacobs was at home in Los Angeles, in a wooded canyon that has long attracted bohemian types, and like many Americans was binge-watching true crime documentaries on Netflix.
One of them would change her life.
Watching an episode of “The Innocence Files,” about a Los Angeles man who served 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit and the lawyer who freed him, Jacobs sensed she had found a calling. So she reached out to the lawyer, Ellen Eggers, and told her she wanted to help investigate cases like the one on the show.
Eggers, a retired public defender who once worked for Cesar Chavez helping farmworkers become lawyers and now works on innocence cases for no fee, was skeptical of Jacobs’ overture. But she was overburdened with cases, and Jacobs was insistent. Eventually, she told Jacobs about the case of Jofama Coleman, which Eggers had learned about from Coleman’s ex-wife.
At the time, Coleman was confined to a cell in Corcoran, California, a town in the Central Valley with two main industries: farming and prisons. He had spent years in the prison library — learning the law, studying his case and filing motions asserting that he had nothing to do with the drive-by shooting in south-central Los Angeles for which he was convicted of being the getaway driver and sentenced to 25 years to life.
Getting nowhere with the courts and now dealing with a deadly pandemic behind bars, Coleman was losing hope. Out of despair, he shared his story online, hoping someone would read it and want to help him:
“I’m a Black male who grew up in a single parent home with no wealth and platform. As such, the wrongs I suffer are easily swept under the rug. For over 5,890 days I’ve had to maintain my sanity as I fall asleep and wake up behind concrete walls and bars for a crime I did not commit.”
Coleman could not know then that help was on the way.
Working together, Eggers and Jacobs — with help from the students Jacobs teaches — got a key witness to recant and found another witness who claimed to know who the real killer was in the case. Crucially, they found an ally in George Gascón, the district attorney of Los Angeles, who has made reviewing problematic convictions a priority. And a legal motion that Coleman had filed to obtain the complete investigatory file of his case was granted by the California state Supreme Court.
Late last month, a judge in Los Angeles declared Coleman an innocent man, a few weeks after he was paroled. Along the way, Eggers and Jacobs and their student helpers also exonerated Abel Soto, who had been found guilty in the same drive-by shooting and had been sentenced to 72 years to life. Soto, who was accused of being the shooter, was 15 at the time of the killing in 2003.
The story connects a lot of threads that have defined modern Los Angeles life: police failures, gang shootings, racial disparities in the criminal justice system (Coleman is Black; Soto is Latino), New Agey moms, Hollywood. Harriet Ryan, a reporter at the Los Angeles Times who wrote a lengthy narrative about the case, described the story on social media recently as “an only-in-LA tale that like the city, is by turns beautiful and horrifying.”
By the time Coleman heard from Jacobs inside prison, he felt as though he was out of options.
“She’s a firecracker,” he said in a recent interview on the campus of the University of California, Riverside, where, weeks after leaving prison, he was already studying public policy and planning to earn a law degree, and then to work on wrongful convictions. “Knowing that it got to the point to where they were on the case, and they were on it consistently, and I’m hearing from them every day, hearing from them every day, it gave me hope again.”
Jacobs, for her part, said that the experience brought more meaning and excitement to her life and that Coleman, in many ways, “sort of saved me.”
“The thing with Jofama is, he was in prison studying law for 20 years,” she said. “And then I come in, and I want to help him, not because I have a white-savior complex, but I’m just generally interested. Like, it feels like watching a series.”
To adjust to the outside and not get mired in resentment, Coleman said he was trying to reclaim the sense of humor he had as a child, when he was known as a jokester. “The system took my youth,” he said.
As for Netflix, when Coleman was sent to prison, the company was just 10 years old and still primarily a DVD-by-mail operation. “I really didn’t have too much time for TV,” said Coleman, who, when he was not studying law, was working with disabled inmates, wheeling them to appointments, helping them make their beds.
While Coleman, now 41, has been deep in his studies — he was up until almost 4 a.m. the other day writing a paper about police “stop-and-frisk” tactics — Soto, 36, has returned to his childhood home, a few blocks from the scene of the crime that took almost half his life.
He left prison with the clothes on his back and was handed a box of condoms, some Narcan and a $200 prepaid debit card. The other day, he was detailing a 1996 Suburban that his sister gave him, and has been taking his nieces and nephew to school every day. He said he might move to Mexico, where his parents came from.
“One thing that I haven’t gotten comfortable with, and I still have issues with, is a lot of choices,” he said when asked what adjusting to the world outside prison had been like for him. “Just choices, period. You go to eat, and there’s a menu.”
It will take work and time to overcome the trauma of imprisonment and anger over the injustice. “It was like a war zone,” he said. “It wasn’t no place for an 18-year-old kid.”
In rustic Topanga Canyon, not far from Malibu and the Pacific Ocean, Jacobs, who taught in public schools for years, started a nontraditional school called the Ditch School out of her home. The name stands for “Dare to Innovate and Transcend Cultural Hegemony.” Students can study what they wish, and many begin college courses at a young age. There is a yurt for play time.
“The idea of hegemony, that the people that are in power tell the rest of us a story so they stay in power,” she explained. “We are trying to transcend that.”
It was that spirit that spurred her efforts to free innocent people. Yet it would also spell the end of her partnership with Eggers, the former public defender who became the lawyer for both Coleman and Soto. The two women appreciate each other, but their approaches were ultimately at odds.
By her own admission, Jacobs is impulsive and has insisted on doing things Eggers says no legal advocate should do — like the time when she invited the homicide detective on Coleman’s case to give a talk to her students, when her real aim was to ask him pointed questions about the case.
Jacobs, 49, and her students plan to continue to investigate cases, and some of her former students have started their own innocence project called Youth For Innocence. On a recent afternoon at her home, there were transcripts of jailhouse phone calls that needed scanning and photo lineups of potential suspects that needed to be reviewed.
One of the students is Azzurra Avraham, who has been organizing case files into searchable PDFs. She is 12, has been taking college-level classes since she was 10 and plans to become a Supreme Court justice. “When I was younger, my mom told me that I have a very powerful voice or whatever, so I would be a very good judge,” she said.
Working on cases with her is Angelina, her sister, who at 14 is a junior at UCLA and an intern with the California Innocence Advocates, a nonprofit that pursues exonerations.
This being Hollywood, movie producers have already come knocking, Jacobs said. And she and Coleman have begun writing a book together.
“If one of the producers says we can get a book deal and a movie deal at the same time, that would be awesome,” she said.

As online dating became as easy as swiping a finger across your phone screen, the companies who own apps such as Tinder and Bumble became Wall Street darlings. But about a decade later, those platforms are now struggling to live up to expectations, and investors have grown frustrated and eager for something new.
Match Group and Bumble — which make up nearly the entire industry by market share — have lost more than $40 billion in market value since 2021. Even in an age when the apps are a staple on people’s smartphones, the two companies are laying off workers and reporting lackluster revenue growth.
Both companies have recently brought on leaders who have vowed to experiment with new features, hoping to capture the growth investors crave. But they face one critical obstacle: Not enough young people are willing to pay for subscriptions to dating apps — partly because younger daters are increasingly looking to platforms including Snapchat and TikTok to make connections — and it’s not clear what will change that.
Match Group and Bumble generate the bulk of their revenue — about $4.2 billion for both companies last year — by selling subscriptions, with smaller income streams from advertising. But they’re struggling to grow those sales. Match Group was able to keep revenues steady last year only by raising its prices.
As far as investors are concerned, the businesses need to convince more young users to pay.
“Wall Street loves subscription models because it gives them the comfort of recurring revenues,” said Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Securities.
By paying, users can unlock features such as unlimited swipes and the ability to see who has swiped on them. But for many people, that’s not enough: Unlike other paid subscription services, like Spotify or Netflix, dating apps can’t guarantee that you’ll find what you’re looking for.
“It feels really different to pay for access to people,” said Kathryn D. Coduto, a Boston University professor who studies dating apps. “Paying for it makes it feel a little skeezy.”
In the United States, 30% of adults, and more than half of adults younger than 30, use dating apps, according to a survey by Pew Research Center that was released last year. About one-third of dating app users reported paying for them, with men and higher-income adults more likely to pay than others, the survey found.
Millennials, the nation’s largest generation, were prime dating age when Tinder first rolled out, but more and more of them have married in recent years, a decision that usually results in people quitting the apps. Now the primary users are from Gen Z, a younger — and smaller — demographic with less disposable income. That generational shift poses a challenge for the dating app industry.
Mandy Wang, an 18-year-old student at New York University, said she preferred to meet people in person or through a direct message on platforms such as Instagram or Snapchat. Dating apps are for casual use, “like a game,” she said.
“People use dating apps, but I don’t know anyone who pays for it,” Wang said. In fact, she said that she would consider it an “ick” if she learned somebody was paying for a subscription.
Jess Carbino, a former sociologist for Tinder who is now a consultant and dating coach, said younger people “still feel a desire to use online dating apps, but they’re not necessarily experiencing a sense of urgency to find a partner.”
“I think what we’re seeing is purely a demographic shift,” Carbino said.
Match Group and Bumble declined to comment on their plans to draw in more paying users, pointing to public statements made by their executives.
Bumble’s CEO, Lidiane Jones, told analysts last month that the company would be revamping the app to appeal to more users, particularly younger ones, by adding “personalization and flexibility” to the experience.
Bumble’s larger competitor, Match Group, was an early player in the online dating market, starting with Match.com in 1995. The company acquired Tinder in 2017 and Hinge in 2018, kicking off a period of growth that caught investors’ attention.
Tinder is the largest brand in Match Group’s portfolio and the most popular dating app in the United States. It shook up the industry landscape in 2012 when it introduced a swipe feature, which is now ubiquitous in dating apps. But the swipe’s novelty has worn off, and Tinder has lost momentum. The number of paid users on the app was down nearly 10% in 2023.
Tinder’s struggles, and those of the broader dating app industry, are in part because the format is substantially the same as it has been for more than a decade, said Zach Morrissey, an analyst at Wolfe Research, a financial research firm. But the way people date may have shifted.
“This is a space where product innovation has been relatively muted in recent years,” he said.
That’s starting to hurt. Bumble, which went public in 2021, initially jumped in value but after a steady slide its stock is now about a quarter of its initial public offering price. Match Group’s stock price reached a high of $169 in 2021. It now sits at $34, about one-fifth of its peak value.
Match Group and Bumble have made some changes recently to convince investors that they can spin things around, but it’s unclear what will solve their problems. “There’s not an obvious silver bullet that they need to address,” Morrissey said.
Both companies have had some leadership shake-ups: In January, Jones joined Bumble, and Match Group promoted Faye Iosotaluno, the former chief operating officer of Tinder, to be the app’s CEO.
Bumble announced last month that the company was laying off about one-third of its workforce in the first half of this year. It also lowered its revenue forecast for the first quarter, below Wall Street expectations.
“The demand for connection and love continues to be really strong — 2 billion single people around the globe,” Jones told analysts in February. “Yet the products that are bearing the set of experiences to create those connections are not serving users the way that they want to.”
Match Group’s CEO, Bernard Kim, told analysts in a Jan. 31 earnings call that this year Tinder was “adopting a fast-fail mentality, a strategy that prioritizes rapid experimentation and testing.” Kim took over the company in 2022 after previously serving as president of Zynga, the maker of mobile games including Farmville.
He said that the company would attract more paying users through marketing and that it was adjusting its products in various ways, including introducing new a la carte premium features.
Match Group has also expanded its offerings, like a service for LGBTQ+ dating, called Archer, and one marketed toward Latinos, called Chispa. Revenue from those products was down 4% in 2023.
Kim said that Tinder was reimagining the swipe feature altogether and would be rolling out new functions this year. The platform is also pushing for more users to get verified, a move that’s aimed at improving safety and helping women feel more comfortable using the app.
Elliott Management, an activist investor that previously led shake-ups at Salesforce and Pinterest, took a $1 billion stake in Match Group in January, a sign that Wall Street sees an opportunity for growth.
Elliott declined to comment on its discussions with Match Group. Kim told analysts that he and the firm had “collaborative dialogue.”
Despite the challenges, the dating industry isn’t going anywhere, said Ken Gawrelski, an analyst at Wells Fargo.
“Dating, overall, and love, more generally, is a core human behavior,” he said. “So it’s hard to believe that changes materially. But the way we date, or the way we find matches, is very much an issue in this discussion.”

A Vision Has Been Rewarded: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Under Donna Langley's leadership, Universal has managed the rare feat of achieving creative dominance and commercial supremacy at the same time.
"Queen!"
It was a Friday night in January, and Snoop Dogg had just rolled into a cocktail party hosted by Donna Langley, NBCUniversal's chief content officer and studios chairwoman. His shouted greeting, paired with a jaunty deferential dance, seemed to leave her a bit embarrassed. "We're here to celebrate filmmakers and films," Langley told the room a few minutes later. "This is not about me."
For an executive who ardently prefers to stay in the background -- she declined to be interviewed for this article and dispatched a lieutenant to try and kill it -- the 2024 Oscar trail has been an awkward one. Like it or not, this moment in Hollywood history is very much about her.
It was Langley who, in a wild bet on a three-hour period drama about a physicist, gave Christopher Nolan the money to make "Oppenheimer." It won seven Oscars on Sunday, including the ones for director and best picture. Nolan started his acceptance speech for best director by saying, "Donna Langley -- thank you for seeing the potential in this."
Da'Vine Joy Randolph won the supporting actress Oscar for her performance as a grieving mother and boarding school cook in "The Holdovers," which was released by Focus Features, a specialty film studio that Langley also oversees.
In a rare achievement, Universal's creative dominance has coincided with commercial supremacy: The studio was No. 1 at the worldwide box office in 2023, selling nearly $ 5 billion in tickets and ending an eight-year reign by Disney. Moreover, Universal reached audiences the old-fashioned way -- by serving up movies from a mix of genres, with nary a superhero to be found. "The Super Mario Bros. Movie" ( $ 1.4 billion) led the way, followed by "Oppenheimer" ( $ 958 million), "Fast X" ( $ 705 million), "Five Nights at Freddy's" ( $ 291 million) and "Migration" ( $ 279 million).
Other Universal successes included Wes Anderson's "Asteroid City," the comedy "Cocaine Bear" and the horror comedy "M3gan." Over the weekend, "Kung Fu Panda 4" arrived to a stout $ 58.3 million in the United States and Canada. (There have, of course, been misfires, including "The Exorcist: Believer," which bombed in the fall, imperiling a planned trilogy.)
Sometimes your luck runs hot in the casino called Hollywood. But Universal's strength is also a testament to Langley, 56, who has doggedly sought to make her studio the favored home for Hollywood's top filmmakers and producers. With ticket buyers starting to push back on superhero spectacles and cookie-cutter franchise sequels, Universal's first-look deals and partnerships with talents like Jason Blum, James Wan, Jordan Peele, Elizabeth Banks, Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow, Phil Lord and Chris Miller position the studio for continued prosperity.
"Donna is a spectacular studio boss," Steven Spielberg, who returned to Universal in 2015 after a period on his own, said in a phone interview. "The relationship between directors and studios has historically been them versus us. There are exceptions and Donna is one of them. She is with us."
Spielberg added that he showed Langley "a very early cut" of his 2022 cinematic memoir, "The Fabelmans," which was nominated for seven Academy Awards. "Not because I was obligated to do that," Spielberg said. "Not because I was trying to gain approval or fish for compliments. I needed Donna's ideas about how to make the movie better."
Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, whose "Everything Everywhere All at Once" won seven Oscars last year, including the ones for directing and best picture, signed a five-year exclusive deal with Universal in 2022.
"We were immediately taken with Dame Donna Langley and the culture she has fostered at her studio," Kwan and Scheinert wrote in an email. "She is a deeply soulful and creative human who really listens to you when you speak. The first time we had dinner we talked about incorporating gut biome science into criminal justice, climate change, interior design and the hunt for the perfect shade of yellow. We immediately knew we had found our people." (Langley, who grew up on the Isle of Wight, was named a Dame Commander of the British Empire in 2020.)
Talent may feel comfortable with Langley, but she also makes it clear that the studio is her priority. She was one of four executives (the others coming from Disney, Netflix and Warner Bros.) who engaged in bare-knuckled union negotiations with writers and actors last year, resulting in strikes. She recently lost a bidding war with Warner Bros. for a new film from Ryan Coogler ("Black Panther") in part because she refused to concede to a highly unusual deal point: Coogler wanted the copyright to revert to him after a period of time. Warner agreed.
Universal, which will release 19 movies this year, has also benefited from competitor instability.
Disney's movie operation has struggled with quality, leading the company to trim its output; it will release 10 films this year. Warner Bros., which has a dozen movies on its 2024 release calendar, has been tossed between owners, and its corporate parent is widely viewed in Hollywood as a merger candidate. (Potentially with NBCUniversal.) Paramount will release nine movies as its parent company contends with a rapidly decaying cable television business and streaming expenses.
Universal is owned by Comcast, which has been comparatively stable. "Film has always been a priority for Comcast and under Donna's leadership we wanted to make sure she had the resources to invest in talent and creators who would want to call Universal home," Brian L. Roberts, Comcast's chief executive, wrote in an email.
Langley came to Hollywood in 1991 and toiled as an unpaid intern at a literary agency while working at a nightclub on the Sunset Strip. At the club, she met Michael De Luca, then a New Line Cinema executive, and he hired her as his assistant. (De Luca is now co-chairman and chief executive of Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group.) She climbed rungs at New Line until joining Universal in 2001.
"Sometimes there is a feeling of operating scared in our industry -- let me take the path of least resistance, let me do the thing that is the least risky because the environment is tough," said Will Packer, the Universal-based producer of hits like "Girls Trip" and "Ride Along."
"I don't get that feeling from the team at Universal," he continued. "And to the creative community that makes all the difference."

Full text: The 20th season of this medical drama airs on ABC. And CBS hosts the annual awards show honoring excellence in film and television.
For TV viewers like me who still haven't cut the cord, here is a selection of cable and network shows, movies and specials broadcasting Monday through Sunday, March 11-16. Details and times are subject to change.
Monday
LAKEFRONT EMPIRE 10 p.m. on HGTV. This new real estate series takes viewers to Missouri's Lake of the Ozarks, a Midwestern vacation destination made famous by the Netflix show "Ozark." This series follows a group of realtors, including Peggy Albers, who often talks about her remarkable turnaround from serving more than 15 years in federal prison for selling methamphetamine to becoming a successful agent at the lake.
Tuesday
THE LIONHEART 9 p.m. on HBO. Dan Wheldon was best known by his nickname, "The Lionheart," and won the Indianapolis 500 twice. In a tragic accident, he died in a crash in 2011 at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. This documentary blends archival and present-day footage to tell the story of Wheldon's sons, Sebastian and Oliver, who have since followed their father's footsteps and entered the world of racing.
PASSWORD 10 p.m. on NBC. This game show, which originally aired in the 1960s on CBS, is coming back for its second season, with Keke Palmer as host and Jimmy Fallon as a panelist. This season will feature guest stars, including Chance the Rapper, Howie Mandel and Joe Manganiello, playing the game that is a mix between charades and telephone.
Wednesday
THE AMAZING RACE 9:30 p.m. on CBS. It's hard to believe that this reality competition series premiered in 2001, just as iPods and iTunes were introduced. As for 36 seasons now, teams of two will embark on heart-racing challenges around the world for a cash prize of $ 1 million.
FEUD: CAPOTE VS. THE SWANS 10 p.m. on FX. This story about the writer Truman Capote and the high-society women of 1960s Manhattan, from producer Ryan Murphy, is wrapping up this week. Throughout the limited series, we have seen Capote let air out of the women's glitz and glam when he publishes their secrets in Esquire magazine. As the show follows these revelations, it has also been documenting Capote's downfall, including stints in and out of rehab.
Thursday
GREY'S ANATOMY 9 p.m. on ABC. This premiere marks the 20th season of the medical drama, which will feature the tense relationships and near-death moments the show is known for. And while she's no longer a series regular, Ellen Pompeo will return to Grey Sloan Memorial this season for at least four episodes.
MARRIED TO REAL ESTATE 9 p.m. on HGTV. If you aren't familiar with this particular HGTV show, it features the husband-and-wife duo Mike Jackson and Egypt Sherrod, who find and transform homes for their clients in the Atlanta area. Now in its third season, the show gives a peek into the couple's family life inside their house as they try to balance running businesses with raising their children.
Friday
PRETTY WOMAN (1990) 7 p.m. on Bravo. If you are looking for a romantic comedy, you are in luck: This modern classic stars Julia Roberts as a Hollywood escort and Richard Gere as a businessman who hires her for a week -- just enough time to fall in love. Come for the famous shopping scene when Roberts's Vivian Ward is turned away from a high-end boutique based on what she is wearing. "Ms. Roberts, as noted, is a complete knockout, and this performance will make her a major star," Janet Maslin wrote in her New York Times review of the film.
NINE TO FIVE (1980) 7 p.m. on TCM. Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton kidnap their male chauvinist boss in this office satire that tackles sexism and other indignities at the workplace. After a rewatch, queue up the revamp of Parton's catchy song in Pitbull's "Powerful Women."
Saturday
55th N.A.A.C.P. IMAGE AWARDS 8 p.m. on CBS. This annual awards show celebrates outstanding performances on TV, in film and in music by people of color. Colman Domingo leads the nominations in the film categories for his role in "Rustin," while Ayo Edebiri has the most nominations in the television and streaming categories with two for "Abbott Elementary" and "The Bear." Frankie Beverly will be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award.
Sunday
CALL THE MIDWIFE 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Adapted from Heidi Thomas's best-selling memoirs, this long-running show is back on the small screen. The series follows a group of nurses who live and work in the East End of London in the 1950s and '60s.

Power-Hungry Data Centers: [Correction]

Author: Sisson, Patrick

Publication info: Sisson, Patrick.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: West Texas, from the oil rigs of the Permian Basin to the wind turbines twirling above the High Plains, has long been a magnet for companies seeking fortunes in energy.
Now, those arid ranch lands are offering a new moneymaking opportunity: data centers.
Lancium, an energy and data center management firm setting up shop in Fort Stockton and Abilene, is one of many companies around the country betting that building data centers close to generating sites will allow them to tap into underused clean power.
"It's a land grab," said Lancium's president, Ali Fenn.
In the past, companies built data centers close to internet users, to better meet consumer requests, like streaming a show on Netflix or playing a video game hosted in the cloud. But the growth of artificial intelligence requires huge data centers to train the evolving large-language models, making proximity to users less necessary.
But as more of these sites start to pop up across the United States, there are new questions on whether they can meet the demand while still operating sustainably. The carbon footprint from the construction of the centers and the racks of expensive computer equipment is substantial in itself, and their power needs have grown considerably.
Just a decade ago, data centers drew 10 megawatts of power, but 100 megawatts is common today. The Uptime Institute, an industry advisory group, has identified 10 supersize cloud computing campuses across North America with an average size of 621 megawatts.
This growth in electricity demand comes as manufacturing in the United States is the highest in the past half-century, and the power grid is becoming increasingly strained.
The Uptime Institute predicted in a recent report that the sector's myriad net-zero goals, which are self-imposed benchmarks, would become much harder to meet in the face of this demand and that backtracking could become common.
"This is not just about data centers," said Mark Dyson, a managing director at RMI, a nonprofit organization focused on sustainability. "Data centers are a practice round for a much bigger wave of load growth that we are already seeing and are going to continue seeing in this country coming from electrification of industry, vehicles and buildings."
The data center industry has embraced more sustainable solutions in recent years, becoming a significant investor in renewable power at the corporate level. Sites that leased wind and solar capacity jumped 50 percent year over year as of early 2023, to more than 40 gigawatts, capacity that continues to grow. Still, demand outpaces those investments. And the need for more processing power is backing up the interconnection queue and creating stopgap solutions.
Power-hungry data centers in full force further complicate the balance. Data centers in the construction pipeline would, when complete, use as much power annually as the San Francisco metro area, according to a report released on Wednesday by the real estate services company JLL. Most sites coming online this year are already leased; in popular markets, significant space will not open up for at least two years.
"You have to get as many gigawatts live as you possibly can, as fast as you can," Ms. Fenn of Lancium said. "People are going to cobble that together in whatever way they can."
That has quickly expanded development beyond the established first- and second-tier markets, such as Northern Virginia, Dallas and Silicon Valley.
Competition is growing in parts of the country offering cheap land and available power. Amazon, for instance, announced last month that it was planning a $ 10 billion project in Mississippi, the state's largest economic development project, which includes data centers and solar generating sites.
"Anybody who has any significant source of power has now become a new data center market," said Jim Kerrigan, managing principal of North American Data Centers, an industry consultancy.
A.I. is only a small percentage of the global data center footprint. The Uptime Institute predicts A.I. will skyrocket to 10 percent of the sector's global power use by 2025, from 2 percent today.
"They have been building at a breakneck pace with so many other kinds of drivers for demand," said Andy Lawrence, executive director of research at the institute. "A.I.'s kind of the froth on top."
Last year, construction of data centers was up 25 percent, according to the real estate firm CBRE. And Nvidia, which supplies most of the high-tech chips powering this technology, last week reported record profit in data center sales, with 2023 revenue hitting $ 47.5 billion, a 217 percent jump from the year before.
The nation's energy grids cannot handle that kind of demand, said Christopher Wellise, vice president of sustainability at Equinix, a global data center operator. "Technology is moving faster than our infrastructure has evolved," he said.
On top of that, the transition toward electrification and renewable power has created new challenges. Orders for the large transformers needed to deliver power have a three-year backlog, and even the diesel generators that provide backup power can take nearly two years to arrive.
Developers are focusing on squeezing additional efficiency out of their operations. Meta has teamed up with a Texas battery storage provider to better use the state's wind and solar resources. Google signed a deal with Fervo, a company developing utility-scale geothermal resources.
Equinix, which operates 260 data centers across the globe, installed fuel cells from Bloom Energy to help provide backup power to many of its data centers. The company is also reducing emissions by bringing more renewable energy to the grid, such as through power purchase agreements, and has squeezed 5 percent more efficiency out of its operations in the past year, Mr. Wellise said. Design firms like Gensler have been experimenting with new designs that feature mass timber to cut down on the embodied carbon of data centers.
And A.I. itself can help: At a data center in Frankfurt, Equinix has used the technology to moderate cooling loads and adjust energy use in concert with changing weather, making a data center 9 percent more efficient.
Niklas Sundberg, a sustainable IT expert and chief digital officer at Kuehne + Nagel, a transport and logistics company based in Switzerland, said the industry would need to focus on investing in renewable generating capacity.
Some sites have sought to install on-site gas power plants to make up for shortfalls in the grid. It may be cleaner than existing power, but it adds to the industry's substantial carbon footprint.
And lawmakers have proposed more transparency and action. The Senate introduced a proposal in early February to assess A.I.'s environmental impact. Lawmakers in Northern Virginia, which is known as Data Center Alley, have pushed to mandate sustainability goals for data centers.
Suhas Subramanyam, a Virginia state senator, proposed a number of rules, including one that would require data centers to get at least 90 percent of their power from renewable sources to qualify for subsidies. "I don't want to stick my kids in a situation where, in 20 years, they have to pay some of the bills for things that we thought were a good idea and turned out not to be," he said.

SUNDAY BUSINESS
An article last Sunday about the current tax season misstated the timing of required minimum with­drawals from tax­-advantaged retire­ment accounts for people who turned 73 in 2023. Their first with­drawal was due April 1, 2023 -- and the second by Dec. 31, 2023; the deadline for their first withdrawal is not April 1, 2024.
ARTS & LEISURE
An article on Page 4 this weekend about the actress Dominique Blanc and her one-woman play "La Douleur" refers incorrectly to the play's initially planned New York premiere. It was in the early 2010s, not the early 2000s.
REAL ESTATE
The On the Market feature last Sunday misspelled the surname of the listing broker of 16 Fonda Road, Rockville Centre, N.Y. She is Sheilah Hassenbein, not Hassenbeim. Also, the feature mis­stated what the seller of 67 West 107th Street, No. 1, is willing to concede to a buyer. The seller will pay six months of common charges and property taxes, not closing costs and six months of prop­erty taxes. And the floor plan at 2500 Johnson Avenue, No. 16NP was described incorrectly. It has one bedroom with an en suite full bathroom and another with an en suite half bathroom, not two bedrooms with en suite half bathrooms.
SPECIAL SECTION: DESIGN
An article on Page 2 about a new show of work by Humberto Campana misstates the location of Instituto Campana, the design archive of Humberto and Fernando Campana. It is in Brotas, Brazil, not in the brothers' studio in São Paulo.
MAGAZINE
An article on Page 30 this weekend about the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis misstates the name of an organization that urged Netflix to reclassify its "Ancient Apocalypse" series as science fiction. It is the Society for American Archaeology, not the Society for American Archaeologists. And the article misspells the surname of a scientist at the University Paris Cité. She is Tiffany Morisseau, not Morriseau.
An article on March 3 about pants misstated Samuel Hine's role at GQ. He is a fashion writer, not a fashion editor.
BOOK REVIEW
A review on Feb. 18 about Kristin Han­nah's novel "The Women" misstated the timing of Frankie McGrath's enlistment in the Army. Frankie, the book's protago­nist, enlists before she learns her brother has been killed in the Vietnam War, not after.

Full text: I'm the Asia business correspondent for The New York Times based in Seoul. I live in South Korea and I write mostly about China. When it comes to my content consumption, I feel a constant tug of war between wanting to understand the place where I live and the place that I write about frequently. Here are five things I've been watching, reading and listening to.
My Mister
The story of an unlikely friendship between a troubled woman and a sad, seemingly successful man, this show is also a celebration of male friend groups and sibling loyalty. I was told "My Mister" is a favorite among middle-aged Korean men, and I can see why, but not for the reasons I initially thought.
The Three-Body Problem
I started reading the English translation of this Liu Cixin novel because of the upcoming Netflix series, a big-budget Western adaptation with a largely international cast. The book is classic sci-fi, with a plot centered on an alien invasion of Earth, and it grabs you right away with the political violence and horrors of China's Cultural Revolution.
The Black Skirts
For me, after a certain age, it became hard work to find new music. So I was excited to discover the Black Skirts, a Korean indie rocker now in my Spotify rotation. I am especially fond of his album "Teen Troubles" because the lyrics often mention his New Jersey upbringing -- something I can relate to as a fellow Jersey-ite.
Alex Neptune
As a father to two young children, I am subject to a LOT of bad television and books. But I loved the first two installments of this series by David Owen. Both books are about a brave young boy and his friends fighting off a villainous character trying to steal the power of the ocean. A joy to read.
Rates & Barrels
I'm a junkie for fantasy baseball, or fake baseball as my wife calls it. And as we approach early spring, I will pore over statistics to prepare to draft my fake team. But that's not enough! I also listen to podcasts like Rates & Barrels from The Athletic (owned by The Times). It takes itself very seriously.

Movies That Defy the Expected: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: As Netflix pours more of its resources into original content, Amazon Prime Video is picking up the slack, adding new movies for its subscribers each month. Its catalog has grown so impressive, in fact, that it's a bit overwhelming. Here are some of our favorites you can stream right now.
'Kicking and Screaming' (1995)
The "Marriage Story" and "Frances Ha" director Noah Baumbach made his feature debut with this wry and witty 1995 indie comedy. He tells a story of 20-something ennui, as four university pals (played with verve by Chris Eigeman, Josh Hamilton, Carlos Jacott and Jason Wiles) knock around their college town in the year after graduation, not quite sure what to do with themselves. Baumbach's dialogue is crisp and quotable, and the relationships are uncommonly rich, thanks in no small part to the performances of Olivia d'Abo, Parker Posey and Cara Buono as the endlessly patient women in their lives.
'Get Out' (2017)
When Jordan Peele's crossover to feature filmmaking was announced, many who were familiar only with his work as half of the sketch comedy team Key & Peele presumed he would continue to work in that wild comic style. No one could have predicted that he would turn the entire horror genre upside down, but that's exactly what he did with this nail-biting combination of social commentary and scary movie. What begins as a "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" riff -- a wealthy young white woman (Allison Williams) bringing her Black boyfriend (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her parents -- turns into something far more sinister and unpredictable; Peele's directorial instincts are striking from the first frame onward.
'The Dead Zone' (1983)
The director David Cronenberg rarely made traditional horror films, and his adaptation of the best seller by Stephen King is no exception. It's as much science-fiction as horror, focusing on a regular Joe (Christopher Walken, muted and effective) who comes out of a coma with the ability to see the futures of those he touches. This thoughtful and tricky picture is as interested in moral dilemmas and historical ramifications as it is in thrills and chills; our critic found it "unsettling" and "quietly forceful."
Clerks' (1994)
In 1994, a scrappy, movie-crazy kid brought his chatty, low-budget debut to Sundance and took the town by storm, winning a filmmakers' trophy for dramatic features. But Kevin Smith wasn't trying to impress anyone with the slickness of his debut feature; he embraced the low budget, shooting his grainy movie during late nights at the convenience store and video shop where he worked (and which inspired the events of the film). Ultimately, its surveillance-camera aesthetic was to the picture's benefit; it captured a particular kind of pop-culture-obsessed slacker, and became a defining ode to Generation X. (Smith's "Chasing Amy" is also on Prime.)
'I Am Not Your Negro' (2017)
This stunning documentary concerns the life and writings of James Baldwin, but it's less focused on tracing the arc of its subject's life than on the potency of his words. Director Raoul Peck uses as his framework the notes of Baldwin's unfinished book "Remember This House," in which Baldwin was attempting to reckon with the legacies of Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Medgar Evers; guided by Baldwin's passages, Peck constructs an urgent and audacious essay about our past and our present. Our critic called it "a concise, roughly 90-minute movie with the scope and impact of a 10-hour mini-series." (Prime is also streaming the bio-documentary "John Lewis: Good Trouble.")
'Young Adult' (2011)
We've seen countless stories of nasty, selfish people who go on a voyage of self-discovery and come out the other side as better, wiser souls. This acidic comedy-drama asks: What if that journey didn't take? Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron, in take-no-prisoners mode), a bitter young-adult author who returns to her hometown in hopes of reuniting with her high-school boyfriend, his picture-perfect married life be damned. A film that zigs when you're certain it will zag, "Young Adult" tells a satisfying story that is also a sly critique of the conventions of modern moviemaking. Our critic praised its "brilliant, brave and breathtakingly cynical heart."

Start-Up Ads From China Are Flooding Apps in U.S.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Wakabayashi, Daisuke; Isaac, Mike

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The trade relationship between China and the United States has plenty of friction. But at least one area is booming: Chinese start-ups looking to establish a presence in the West are spending billions of dollars for advertisements on services owned by some of Silicon Valley's biggest technology companies.
Temu, the international arm of the Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, is flooding Google with ads for absurdly inexpensive goods. With an initial public offering looming, the fast-fashion merchant Shein is inundating Instagram with ads for clothes and accessories at rock-bottom prices. Developers of China's video streaming and gaming apps are dumping marketing dollars into Facebook, X and YouTube to entice potential users.
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said on a call with analysts that Chinese-based advertisers accounted for 10 percent of its revenue, almost double over two years ago. In the last year, Temu has placed about 1.4 million ads globally across Google services, and at least 26,000 different versions of ads on Meta, according to Meta's Ad Library.
"What companies like Temu have done is really just open a fire hose of money that it is pouring into ads," said Sky Canaves, senior analyst for retail at eMarketer. "You can't escape their ads across Facebook, Instagram and Google Search."
The surge in spending shows how interconnected China and the United States remain, despite vigorous efforts by each country to be more self-reliant. The Chinese companies are gaining access to vast audiences of consumers, and the Silicon Valley companies are making money off a market they are otherwise not doing business in.
The marketing blitz is fueled by the global ambitions of Chinese start-ups. At home, the economy is no longer growing by leaps and bounds as it had for years, and companies are subject to a thicket of government rules that have quashed their growth.
The crackdown on firms like the e-commerce giant Alibaba and the once high-flying ride share provider Didi underscored the message that a company, no matter how successful, can be brought to its knees if it runs afoul of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping.
"There's a limit on the degree that a company can grow in China," said Andrew Collier, founder of Orient Capital, an economic research firm in Hong Kong. "Xi Jinping is perfectly happy for Chinese companies to make money overseas as long as they toe the line within China."
But going global comes at a cost. It's hard to garner significant amounts of digital attention without paying Google's parent company, Alphabet, and Meta. Together, the two companies sell a majority of all internet advertising largely through their online properties like Google Search, YouTube, the Google Play App Store, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.
For the most part, Alphabet's and Meta's products are not available in China. Efforts to offer their services in China meant abiding by Chinese government censors, which caused employee protests at both companies.
Alphabet and Meta have such significant reach in the rest of the world that Chinese firms are now going to them.
The rush of spending by Temu and Shein has "single-handedly" driven up the cost of digital advertising, Josh Silverman, chief executive of Etsy, said on a call with analysts in November.
Discount Chinese e-commerce companies have grabbed increasing attention in the United States over the past few years, tempting buyers with low-cost goods when inflation was driving up prices.
Temu opened its U.S. site in September 2022. It sold things like a garlic press for $ 2 or a cotton swab dispenser for $ 1.50. Temu is now available in 50 countries.
With the slogan "Shop Like a Billionaire," Temu has been a voracious buyer of all forms of advertising, from low-cost Facebook ads to pricey spots during the Super Bowl. Temu has the deep pockets of PDD Holdings, which operates Pinduoduo.
Bernstein Research estimates that Temu spent $ 3 billion on marketing last year. In a lawsuit filed against Shein in December, Temu said it served about 30 million daily users in the United States. Temu's app is the most downloaded on both Apple's and Google's app stores, according to Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm.
Shein, which entered the U.S. market about seven years ago, is also continuing to spend aggressively on marketing. It does not sell products in China, although it was founded in Nanjing and relies heavily on Chinese sellers and the country's supply chain.
It has run about 80,000 ads across Google in the past year alone, including product advertisements that appear next to search results. On Meta, Shein has more than 7,000 advertisements active, according to Meta's Ad Library.
For Temu and Shein, spending heavily on Facebook will not guarantee success. Nearly a decade ago, Wish, another buzzy e-commerce app focused on low-cost goods sourced from China, spent hundreds of millions of dollars on Facebook ads. But the retail app failed to sustain the interest of shoppers. Last month, Wish was sold to Singapore's Qoo10, another e-commerce platform, for $ 173 million, one-hundredth of its public offering valuation in 2020.
Shein and Temu allow third-party sellers to upload product images directly to Meta's advertising systems, and feature those products inside their ads on Instagram and Facebook. Those ads, which are targeted to users' interests based on Meta's vast troves of data, are generally more effective at luring shoppers.
The ad spending is not limited to retailers. In recent months, Instagram has become inundated with previews of short addictive dramas -- soap operas for users with limited attention spans. Each episode is usually a minute long, with the series running about 80 to 100 episodes.
The shows tend to be overly dramatic, with grabby titles like "The Double Life of My Billionaire Husband" or "30 Days Till I Marry My Husband's Nemesis."
These short dramas are popular in China, and a handful of companies -- apps like Reelshort, DramaBox and FlexTV -- are competing to export this form of entertainment. Instead of selling monthly subscriptions like, say, Netflix, the short-content apps use a model similar to online games, requiring users to purchase what are known as coins that can be used to pay for episodes. A viewer can also earn coins by watching commercials.
Similar to games, these apps require a steady stream of users to get hooked on samples of the programs and feel compelled to keep spending to see how the show ends. On Meta, DramaBox is running more than 1,000 active ads, according to Meta's Ad Library, while Reelshort and Flex TV are running hundreds of ads.
Another major Chinese advertiser on Meta is a Hong Kong-based game developer called First.Fun. The developer seems to be blanketing Facebook, Instagram and even X with ads to promote its flagship game, Last War: Survival, with hundreds of paid previews.
The previews have enticed players to download the app. It is the fifth-most-downloaded app on Google Play and 12th on Apple's App Store.
Sensor Tower estimated that the game generated $ 22 million in revenue last month.
Marketing on platforms like Meta has given the game developers a lifeline to customers outside the country as the Chinese government has made it harder to do business. The most recent example was in December when Chinese regulators announced plans to limit how much money people could spend on online video games. The agency drafting the plans backed off its initial proposals in the face of protests, but Beijing has been adopting an increasingly tougher stance against the game industry.
The message has not been lost on game developers. On its website, Beijing Yuanqu Entertainment, First.Fun's parent company, said it was focused purely on overseas markets, because it "firmly believes that China's internet industry will continue to internationalize."

Full text: The Oscars slate this year is packed with films rooted in historical events and biographies. How much influence should the subjects have?
When Walter Naegle was first approached over a decade ago by producers who wanted to make a feature about his late partner, the civil rights leader Bayard Rustin, Naegle needed to be talked into it.
Rustin, who had been the main organizer of the 1963 March on Washington -- and an openly gay public figure at a time when few were -- had already been the subject of the nonfiction "Brother Outsider" (2003). Naegle remembers saying to the producers, "What do I need you guys for? We have a very good documentary."
But Naegle was persuaded, in part by knowing that a vast audience could be reached with a fictionalized feature, and he gave his blessing, starting a yearslong process of consultation with filmmakers that culminated in "Rustin," directed by George C. Wolfe and starring Colman Domingo, who has been nominated for an Oscar for his performance.
When Naegle saw the film for the first time, he felt overwhelming relief. "Colman's performance had really captured this person who I cared about," he said.
At Sunday's Academy Awards, Rustin is one of several historical figures who are the focus of nominated films. Other real-life subjects include the father of the atomic bomb, a lauded American conductor and the victims and perpetrators of the Reign of Terror in the Osage Nation in 1920s Oklahoma.
Historical or biographical conceits have long been fodder for the Oscars, lending an air of significance and gravity to film projects, and a tantalizing challenge to actors. But adapting real stories comes with real people, presenting filmmakers with a delicate choice: How much should they involve their subjects -- or their subjects' families -- in the productions?
"Nyad," the biopic about the long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad, was made in close collaboration with the woman herself and her friend and coach, Bonnie Stoll. (Annette Bening, who portrays Nyad, and Jodie Foster, who plays Stoll, are both up for Oscars.)
Following Nyad's efforts to swim from Cuba to Florida in her 60s, the movie was adapted from Nyad's memoir, and she read every draft of the script, said Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, who directed the movie with her husband, Jimmy Chin.
"The thing that really is my north star with making films about real people is that their life in the film becomes real," Vasarhelyi said. "I'm always acutely aware that it really matters for the real person."
Vasarhelyi recalled that Nyad, who is portrayed as a bullheaded athlete with a penchant for exaggeration, at one point told the filmmakers, "I'm more likable than this."
Despite the filmmakers' eagerness to work closely with Nyad and Stoll, they saw importance in setting boundaries. At a certain point, Vasarhelyi said, they closed the script for feedback, and arranged for Nyad and Stoll to visit the set only on the final day of shooting in the water tank. When Nyad suggested that she perform her own swimming stunts, the answer was, "Thank you, but no thank you."
"There's the story and the writer to protect, and our movie to protect, but then it's also about respecting the process of your actors," Vasarhelyi said.
Much of the time, when filmmakers agree to consult with a subject or family members, the process is entirely voluntary.
Legally, any publicly known or newsworthy person or story -- like Nyad and her swim to Florida or J. Robert Oppenheimer and his work developing the atomic bomb -- is fair game for a film adaptation. Biopics are also often adapted from books, as is the case with the much-nominated "Oppenheimer," which the writer-director Christopher Nolan made without formally engaging the physicist's family members as consultants.
But one clear benefit of collaboration is that it tends to stave off public criticism, which can cast something of a pall over a movie after its release, as happened with "May December," the Todd Haynes-directed drama that is nominated for best original screenplay.
The film is loosely inspired by the case of Mary Kay Letourneau, a teacher who pleaded guilty to second-degree child rape in 1997 for a sexual relationship with one of her sixth-grade students, Vili Fualaau, and then married him after she was released from prison, when he was 22.
There are numerous differences between "May December" and the real-life Letourneau story -- including the circumstances of their meeting -- but the fictionalizations were not enough to prevent objections from Fualaau, who in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter criticized the filmmakers for not contacting him. (Letourneau died in 2020.)
Disputes over the portrayal of real people date to the beginning of the film industry. According to an article published last year in the UC Davis Law Review, one of the earliest legal skirmishes over the issue, which reached New York's highest court in 1913, centered on a telegraph operator named John R. Binns who was unhappy that a short film had used an actor to portray his role in the rescue effort after a steamship collision.
The specter of lawsuits like that one, which successfully halted distribution of the film, have helped fuel the now common practice in Hollywood of acquiring "life rights," said Jorge L. Contreras, a transactional law scholar and one of the article's authors. With such deals, Contreras said, there is no actual legal guarantee of exclusive access to someone's story, but the agreements do serve to prevent defamation lawsuits over fictionalized accounts and stave off competition from other filmmakers.
For "Maestro," the biopic about Leonard Bernstein's career and marriage that received seven Oscar nominations, there was something tangible at stake when the movie's star and director, Bradley Cooper, approached Bernstein's three children: the rights to Bernstein's music.
"Once he had permission from us to make this film, he had the option of never talking to us again -- it was his movie," said Jamie Bernstein, the composer's oldest daughter.
But Cooper went the opposite direction, she said, sending frequent questions about their parents and their upbringing, texting the siblings in a WhatsApp group, sharing iterations of the script and showing them edited footage in a screening room at his home. One limitation, Bernstein said, was that the family never visited the production during filming, describing it as a "closed set."
The blessing of Bernstein's children also provided a layer of protection when Cooper, who is not Jewish, was criticized for using a prosthetic nose to portray Bernstein, who is Jewish. "Bradley chose to use makeup to amplify his resemblance, and we're perfectly fine with that," the Bernsteins said in a statement before the film's premiere, which seemed to put much of the criticism to rest.
That level of protection was not universally viewed as a benefit: In his review of "Maestro" for The New Yorker, Richard Brody criticized the film for what he called a "scrupulous avoidance of controversy," raising the estate's cooperation as one potential factor.
Of course, with consultation also comes the risk that the subject or family members will raise issues. After reading the "Rustin" script, Naegle objected to the focus on a fictional affair between Rustin and a married pastor named Elias Taylor. "There was so much drama in Bayard's life -- you don't have to make things up," he said, noting that the minister's role in the final version of the film seemed reduced from what it had once been, though he was unsure if his feedback had an effect.
The filmmakers' calculus tends to be affected by whether traumatic events are at stake and whether the movie could be viewed as exploitative.
Before filming began on "Killers of the Flower Moon," the epic about white men's murderous plot to steal Osage oil rights, descendants of the victims asked the director, Martin Scorsese, to visit them in Oklahoma. That meeting led him to more deeply engage Osage people in the production and to shift the story's focus more toward the experiences of their relatives.
And in making "Society of the Snow," which chronicles the Uruguayan plane crash in 1972 that resulted in the deaths of 29 people and left 16 stranded in the Andes for more than two months, the director J.A. Bayona interviewed all remaining survivors extensively, putting the actors in contact with them and with the families of the dead.
The in-depth consultation process for the movie -- which is nominated in the international feature category -- took years, but Bayona drew the line at sharing the script with survivors and family members, recognizing that it would open the door for opinions from hundreds of people on the minutiae of the film.
"We wanted the freedom to tell the story," Bayona said.
Gustavo Zerbino, one of the survivors, worked closely with Bayona, even going with him to ask for the blessing of one of the mothers of the dead to make the movie. But after spending so much time together, there came a point when Zerbino said he was able to let go and let the director work. "We believed in you," he said.

Full text: With the release of Adam Sandler's odd, middling and expensive new Netflix film, a look at space movie misfires of the past and how history repeats itself.
Not long into "Spaceman," Adam Sandler's new somber sci-fi space movie on Netflix, it becomes quite clear that it's struggling to channel something greater, something better, something already respected.
Sandler's character, a Czech cosmonaut named Jakub, has spent many months alone in a ship investigating a mysterious purple cloud -- alone except for an alien arachnid called Hanus (voiced by Paul Dano). Hanus speaks to Jakub -- about fear, guilt, pain and the origins of the universe -- in a soothing yet stilted tone, evoking the voice of HAL 9000, the conflicted A.I. entity in Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey," from 1968.
The central themes in "Spaceman," loneliness and disconnection, are fundamental in many cerebral space movies including "2001," but perhaps more so in Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 Soviet space drama, "Solaris," about a small crew of scientists who come mentally undone.
"Spaceman" also has some "Gravity," some "Interstellar," some "First Man," some "Ad Astra," the New York Times film critic Alissa Wilkinson wrote in her review.
Many middling sci-fi space movies have faced such fates: measured not by what they are but by what they wished they were. Often these films have the potential to be brilliant. "Spaceman" was directed by Johan Renck, who won two Emmys in 2019 for his work on the HBO mini-series "Chernobyl"; Sandler, while a comedian, has soared in complex dramatic roles, notably in "Uncut Gems" and "Punch-Drunk Love"; Jakub's wife is played by Carey Mulligan, who is up for a best actress Oscar this month for "Maestro."
What is toughest to forgive, though, is that "Spaceman" commits the biggest movie no-no of all: It's boring. "It is not fun-bad," Wilkinson writes. "It is maudlin-bad, belabored-bad and also pretty boring-bad."
Here's a look at three common ways that big-budget, star-studded sci-fi space dramas go wrong.
Deep Space, Deep Thoughts
Where better than outer space to excavate our terrestrial anxieties, unfurl dystopian yarns, scrutinize the existence of god or alien life, and bemoan the dark side of technological progress. And there are few sci-fi space movies that don't at least dabble in life's bigger questions.
"2001: A Space Odyssey," a visually eye-popping quest into the unruly potential of the human brain from before the dawn of humanity to the edges of infinity, has long been the standard by which all others are measured. Movies like Christopher Nolan's "Interstellar," from 2014 ("a sweeping, futuristic adventure driven by grief, dread and regret"), and Robert Zemeckis's "Contact," from 1997 ("the most visually intoxicating 'trip' movie ever made"), have succeeded in capturing some of its magic while pushing into different corners of existential thought.
But countless other films have tried in earnest to do the same, to underwhelming results, including "Spaceman," with its obvious, uninspired dialogue; "2010: The Year We Make Contact," Peter Hyams's 1984 sequel to "2001"; and Claire Denis's "High Life," from 2019. "Event Horizon," from Paul W.S. Anderson, was largely panned by viewers and critics when it was released in 1997, but has since been re-evaluated and gained a cult following.
"Moon" -- Duncan Jones's low-budget 2009 mediation on claustrophobia and loneliness, starring Sam Rockwell as a man wrapping up three years on a remote mining station with only a computer companion as company -- also channels "2001" and is an apt comparison for "Spaceman."
But where "Moon" succeeds, "Spaceman" flounders -- as did "Oblivion," Joseph Kosinski's ambitious film from 2013 starring Tom Cruise. As our chief film critic, Manohla Dargis, put it, "Oblivion" was "stitched together from bits and pieces that evoke numerous other, far better far-out tales and ideas, conceits and characters," including "Moon," which she called "elegant, elegiac."
Despite its best efforts, Dargis writes, "Oblivion" "never transcends its inspirations to become anything other than a thin copy."
Computer-Generated Missteps
It doesn't take much to derail an audience's suspension of disbelief, snapping them out of a film's fantasy, and that shift is often the result of overreliance on C.G.I.
In "Spaceman," Sandler glides convincingly through the craft, which looks as realistic as any onscreen. But Hanus may have generated more empathy from and connected more authentically with audiences -- and with Sandler, who in reality acted opposite a tennis ball -- if he had been a puppet. There have been many unforgettable movie creatures, ones that were filmed alongside actors, brought to life in this way: in "Labyrinth," "E.T.," "The NeverEnding Story," "Little Shop of Horrors" and, the gold standard of sci-fi space outings, Ridley Scott's "Alien," from 1979, in which the chestburster alien and the android reveal were both created through puppetry.
By "Alien: Covenant," in 2017 -- the third in the franchise to be directed by Scott -- he opted for C.G.I. in place of the novel practical effects that helped to make the previous installments sci-fi canon; while grand, the resulting visuals were flat, unnatural and not as scary.
Hanus seemed primed for the puppet treatment, with his humble movements, many searching eyeballs and lanky, reaching legs. Worsening the issue is that the arachnid has an artificial sheen somewhat reminiscent of 1998's intergalactic adventure "Lost in Space," which had many alien spiders and some of the worst C.G.I. in the genre, exacerbated by a lighting issue that made it obvious the creatures were awkwardly inserted in postproduction.
In her review for The Times, Janet Maslin suggested that "Lost in Space" was trying to copy "Alien" and "Star Wars," and called it ambitious for including 750 special effects; but she wrote that the technology was dispensed frenetically and "not yet capable of creating lovebird chemistry between William Hurt and Mimi Rogers." Ouch.
Romance, We Have a Problem
Grappling with earthly love and heartbreak, romantic and familial, from the cosmos is well-trod thematic territory. But there's a fine line between thoughtful exploration of intimacy and a cringe fest. When done effectively, and with restraint, it has the capacity to resonate and enlighten, like in "Solaris" and "Interstellar." Pixar's 2008 animated film "WALL-E" might be among the few that manages to introduce courtship and love effectively, though between robots, not humans. The critic A.O. Scott called it a "disarmingly sweet and simple love story."
In "Spaceman," Jakub's wife is miserable, pregnant and ready to leave him. We see their relationship in real time and in flashbacks. With the help of Hanus, Jakub comes to terms with his role in ruining their relationship. "In short," Wilkinson writes, "this is a movie about a guy realizing he's been terrible and vowing to change, thanks to a spider-therapist."
While worth a hefty sigh, it's not as bad as perhaps the biggest miss of this kind in recent years: Morten Tyldum's 2016 intergalactic romance, "Passengers," starring Jennifer Lawrence as a journalist aboard a commercial spacecraft on a 120-year voyage to a faraway pioneer colony, and Chris Pratt, a mechanical engineer who, ultimately out of selfishness, wakes her up far too early.
It's "a love story whose attempt to be an interstellar 'Titanic' eventually falls flat," Stephen Holden wrote, calling it "a banal, formulaic pastiche of dozens of other like-minded space operas."

From Hysteria to Gaudy Murder: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: The Disney-owned Hulu streaming service is a repository for new TV shows. But savvy viewers can also find a rotating library of movies, both recent releases and classics, rivaling the collections of many of its competitors -- if they know where to look. We're here to help.
'Call Me By Your Name' (2017)
Sometimes a movie can seem to mosey and meander, running on vibes and nostalgia, and then snap itself together with emotional force in its closing passages. That's what happens in Luca Guadagnino's adaptation of this André Aciman's novel (with a screenplay by the great James Ivory, of Merchant-Ivory productions). Timothée Chalamet is remarkable in the leading role of Elio, a withdrawn 17-year-old who falls in love for the first time with a visiting graduate student (Armie Hammer). The rural Italian locations are gorgeous -- a "ravishment of the senses," per our Manohla Dargis -- and the supporting players are charming (particularly Michael Stuhlbarg as Elio's understanding father). But most important, and impressive, is Guadagnino's skill at capturing the sheer intoxication of one's first flush of love and playful lust.
'Hysteria' (2012)
You've probably seen plenty of Victorian-era serio-comic dramas, many featuring much of this prestige cast, which includes Hugh Dancy, Rupert Everett, Felicity Jones, Gemma Jones and Jonathan Pryce. But this is no starchy tale of class conflict or simmering romance; no, this is the story of how Dr. Mortimer Granville (Dancy), while pursuing treatments for "hysteria" (a onetime catchall medical term for troubles that affected women), invented the vibrator. The director Tanya Wexler and her stiff-upper-lip cast clearly get a kick out of their randy subject matter and adjust their playing accordingly, while Maggie Gyllenhaal delights as a proto-feminist who seizes on this development and the power it contains.
'Gentlemen Prefer Blondes' (1953)
This funny, snazzy musical treat is a classic Hollywood film that really does have it all: a witty screenplay, uproarious comic set pieces, scantily clad male dancers, memorable songs and sparkling leading turns from Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell. It also features one of the most iconic musical numbers in all of cinema: Monroe, in her pink dress, purring "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" to an army of jewel-waving suitors. Our critic praised the "inherent magnetism" and "luxurious coquetry" of its stars.
'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' (1970-1977)
You can find the DNA of this sophisticated, influential seven-season classic in everything from "30 Rock" to "The Office" to "Sex and the City." Moore sparkles as a newly single working woman making her way in the big city of Minneapolis, where she spends her days in a bustling TV newsroom and her nights trying to reassemble her personal life. Midway through its run, our critic wrote, "Consistently tight writing and good acting have made this situation comedy the best of its kind in the history of American television." He wasn't wrong. (Co-star Betty White's classic "The Golden Girls" is also on Hulu.)
'Bernie' (2012)
The true story of how a beloved East Texas mortician murdered a wealthy widow could've made for a probing character study (or, perhaps, a tacky Netflix true-crime docuseries). Instead, the director and co-writer Richard Linklater achieves a delicate and precise mixture of dark comedy and small-town portraiture, thanks in no small part to a cast that includes Jack Black (Linklater's "School of Rock" star) as the mortician, Matthew McConaughey (Linklater's "Dazed and Confused" star) as the district attorney who prosecutes him and the great Shirley MacLaine as the victim, a characterization she puts somewhere between Ouiser from "Steel Magnolias" and Beelzebub. Our critic called it "gaudily vibrant." ("The Guard" is a similarly shambling comedy-drama.)

Glamour and Pettiness on the Racetrack: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: The new season of "Formula 1: Drive to Survive," which has spawned a legion of imitators, is available now on Netflix.
Season 6 of "Formula 1: Drive to Survive," is now on Netflix, and in many ways it remains as fun and juicy as ever -- full of petty immaturity, glamorous lifestyles and alluring European impishness. In the show's hands, a race for 10th place is as compelling and high-stakes as the one for first -- partly because that's how the sport can work but also because Max Verstappen, the driver who came in first in 19 of the 22 races, didn't participate in the show this season.
The enormous success of "Drive to Survive" spawned, and continues to spawn, an entire league of imitators. "Tour de France: Unchained" and "Make or Break," about surfing, come the closest to "Drive" in capturing athletic intensity, general charisma and dazzling locations. The raw brutality of cycling and the sanguine individuality of surfing are fascinating in their own rights, but the glitz factor, a pillar of "Drive," is largely absent.
"Break Point," about tennis, is plenty exciting but more diffuse; because it includes both male and female pros and because of the nature of tennis tournaments, its athletes are not all in competition with one another. "Full Swing," about golf, is an unlovable spectacle of cowardice and greed. "Six Nations: Full Contact," about rugby, has plenty of scrappy charm, moment to moment, but doesn't gel overall. The drivers on "NASCAR: Full Speed" all blend together.
Series that follow a sport for a whole season are the clearest descendants of "Drive." But other access shows like "Quarterback," "Under Pressure: The U.S. Women's World Cup Team," "Angel City" and "Race: Bubba Wallace" are adjacent, too. All claim to offer an insider perspective but are too superficial and uncritical to have any real purchase -- and they don't compensate for that superficiality with sheer volume of story lines the way "Drive" does.
"Drive" will not reign forever, particularly because it continues to list toward reality show. And not a nutritious reality show; a Bravo one. A big episode this season centers on Lewis Hamilton re-signing a contract with Mercedes, and it plays out as a tale of commitment and integrity for all parties. He would never race for Ferrari, we're told. But the first few seasons of "Drive" got me motor-pilled enough that now I follow the sport's comings and goings, and I know that Hamilton has indeed signed with Ferrari for the 2025 season, much in the way "Vanderpump Rules" fans all knew the ins and outs of Scandoval eons before it made its way into the show.
"Drive" already has to contend with the fact that, like all sports shows, it is straightforwardly spoilable, so additional contrivances just add more drag. Luckily there's still plenty of easy pleasure within the series, at least another few seasons of gas in its tank.

Full text: Adam Sandler and Carey Mulligan star in a baffling Netflix misfire about a man in, well, space.
When was the last time you looked at the exquisite list of synonyms for the word "baffled"? They may be among the best in the English language: puzzled, nonplused, discombobulated, flummoxed, stumped, fogged, wildered, buffaloed. They're delicious, delightful, full of consonants, evocative of a very particular feeling: you're presented with something that seems as though it should be clear, but you can't make it make sense.
The occasion for my bout of word nerdery is the Adam Sandler movie "Spaceman," and for that I thank the film. It is not a particularly confusing movie on its own, in part because we've seen its likes before: a spaceman, alone in the inky blackness, goes a little nuts, and also gains clarity on his life back on earth. What's flummoxing about "Spaceman" isn't what it is, but why it is.
Some bad movies were never going to be good ("Argylle"). Other bad movies never even tried ("Madame Web"). But "Spaceman" is that exquisite rare third thing -- an awful movie, a very bad movie indeed, whose lousiness was almost certainly not apparent while it was in production.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Every sign points toward, if not a masterpiece, at least a pretty interesting genre experiment. The film has Sandler, whose acting chops are often underrated, in a dramatic role as the titular spaceman, whose name is Jakub. It has the great Carey Mulligan, who is currently up for a best actress Oscar, playing his estranged, pregnant wife Lenka. It is scored by the ubiquitous Max Richter. Its director, Johan Renck, also directed the outstanding mini-series "Chernobyl," among the best television made in the past decade. And though it's the screenwriter Colby Day's first major feature, it's based on Jaroslav Kalfar's novel "Spaceman of Bohemia," which won praise from science fiction critics.
I haven't read Kalfar's book, but a critic at The Guardian called it "'Solaris' with laughs," which gives me a clue as to what may have gone awry. There's some "Solaris" swimming around inside "Spaceman," and also some "Gravity," some "Interstellar," some "First Man," some "Ad Astra." What there aren't are laughs.
You might think I'm complaining because Sandler should equal laughs, but -- look, here's the thing. There's no way to say more without spoiling the movie, so if that bothers you, look away. (Are you still looking? Go away.)
OK. So. Jakub, commander of this ship and its only passenger, spends most of the movie rattling around in his janky spacemobile, getting mad about the broken toilet and talking to a giant, mellifluous space spider voiced by Paul Dano. This cosmo-rachnid has two big, soulful eyes with a row of four little ones above them. It has many arms (I think I counted 10, which is biologically wrong, but I'm not going to tell outer space how to make a spider). It is full of philosophical ruminations on the meaning of existence. And it keeps addressing Sandler -- sorry, Jakub -- as "skinny human," lingering on the opening sibilant. Sssssskinny human.
This stuff really should be allowed to be funny because it inarguably is. Imagine Adam Sandler, big earnest eyes, drawn and haggard face from nearly 200 days in space, sitting down to converse with a massive spider. That, my friends, is funny.
Yet almost the whole movie is Jakub dourly remembering his life on earth -- notably his wife, Lenka (Mulligan), who is down there on the planet pregnant and miserable and planning to leave him -- in aphoristic realizations, helped along by his possibly-imaginary friend. Jakub has been a lousy husband, and the space spider, whom he dubs Hanus, helps him understand why. In short, this is a movie about a guy realizing he's been terrible and vowing to change, thanks to a spider-therapist.
Furthermore, Jakub is up there with the space spider because a giant purple cloud has been in the sky above the earth for four years. Jakub has been sent on a mission to find out why -- on a ship named for Jan Hus, the famous Czech theologian, reformer and martyr -- by the Euro Space Program, headed up by Commissioner Tuma (Isabella Rossellini, who seems to be enjoying a vibrant career in weird movie bit parts lately). Jakub is Czech, as is Lenka -- both Sandler and Mulligan try for lightly eastern European accents, with middling results -- and has a troubled past thanks to his father's politics. It's unclear what year it is, but for some reason, the only other space program that's rushing toward the purple cloud is from South Korea (the movie emphasizes the South part many times, for reasons I assume the studio knows better than I). None of this is explained and, indeed, seems to be beyond the point.
Perhaps this sounds fun-bad to you. It is not fun-bad. It is maudlin-bad, belabored-bad and also pretty boring-bad. If it's fun-bad ruminations on troubled parentage and spider beings you're after, please go see "Madame Web." For me, the best part of watching it -- other than getting the giggles when Hanus once again said "sssskinny human" in a clearly serious moment -- was imagining how many people are going to click on it when it pops up on their Netflix page and wonder whether that doorjamb they'd accidentally knocked into yesterday had in fact given them a concussion.
"Spaceman" is neither particularly astute about human nature nor discernibly interested in the politics embedded in it, and it is not even meme-ably bad, which is a shame. So much wasted potential. With some room to breathe, to acknowledge the goofiness of its own premise, a layer of solemnity might have been dusted off without sacrificing heart and contemplation. A movie doesn't have to be deadpan or serious to dip into the human condition. But "Spaceman" proves itself as inscrutable as a purple cloud in a sky, far beyond the reach of even the most thoughtful spider-therapist.
Spaceman
Rated R for some scary space stuff, language and a slaughtered pig. Running time: 1 hour 47 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

The Best Bakeries Embrace Sweet and Savory: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Think: everything spice focaccia with cream cheese and smoked salmon, and mortadella in puff pastry with a poached egg.
Much to my dentist's dismay, I love sweets. A meal simply doesn't feel complete without something sugary at the end, and many a 3 p.m. slump has been avoided with a well-timed cookie. A few weeks ago, a waiter called my group her favorite table after we ordered the entire dessert menu.
But I understand that not everyone is about the sweet(s) life. This makes the case for compromise: Where can a person who loves dessert and someone who prefers salty and savory bites meet in the middle without either feeling underrepresented? Well, I've got a few recommendations. ...
Triple chocolate croissants and butter corn cakes
A lot of the city's best bakeries start with feverish word-of-mouth. That's how I discovered Radio Bakery in Greenpoint, which began its life as a roving pop-up from the pastry chef Kelly Mencin before finally settling into a permanent home on India Street.
The brick-and-mortar bakery can only be described as the pop-up on steroids. They don't just serve croissants, they serve triple chocolate croissants made with cocoa powder and Valrhona chocolate, and a danish-inspired take on the croissant filled with seasonal ingredients like apples from New York orchards or satsuma oranges. There's also non-croissant options like gluten-free brown-butter corn cake, chewy chocolate chunk cookies and Earl Grey morning buns.
If you don't like starting your morning off on a sugar high, there's a tight but well-considered breakfast menu of sandwiches served on housemade focaccia. I recommend going for the dill-y smoked salmon tucked inside a slice of everything spice focaccia. After 11 a.m., there are hearty sandwiches that would do nicely at a springtime picnic in Transmitter Park -- just 26 days to go! -- including a roast beef and radicchio sandwich on focaccia, and a Brie and caramelized onion sandwich on baguette-like walnut and sour cherry stirato.
A king oyster sandwich and a museum stroll
Speaking of spring, once we start getting some consistently warm days, I'm going to reinstate my morning walks to Otway Bakery in Clinton Hill. My go-to order is a whole milk latte, a sticky-sweet kouign-amann sprinkled with black and white sesame seeds to eat on the walk back home, and a classic croissant for later. But if I were forced to compromise with someone who prefers a savory start to the day, I'd just go to the original Otway, a few doors down. There you can find a small selection of the bakery goods (croissants, coffee cake, morning buns, cardamom buns), along with avocado toast, Gruyère omelets and a spicy fried chicken sandwich.
Or I would simply ask this hypothetical sweets-hater to meet me at the months-old Frenchette Bakery at the Whitney Museum. If we met there any time after 10:30 a.m. -- perhaps for a power lunch or a well-earned personal day -- I would order the croustillant filled with biting lemon curd or the breakfast cookie with almond butter and dried cherries, which proves my point that cookies are a 24/7 food. Those sweets alongside the flower-shaped mortadella planted in a bed of puff pastry with a poached egg center, or the king oyster sandwich with broccoli rabe and ricotta, would be perfection. (There are also pizz'ettes, pastas and full-bodied entrees if you want something more substantial.)
And if you time your visit just right, you could spent the afternoon taking in the 2024 Whitney Biennial (March 20 through fall 2024) and bask in other, decidedly nonedible works of art.
What I'm into right now
Since 2005, I've been obsessed with the animated epic, "Avatar: The Last Airbender." Was I in high school when it premiered on Nickelodeon? Sure. But the balance of humor, action and fantasy with explorations of grief, death and regret always made "Avatar" feel more grown-up. Perhaps you'll join me in watching the new live action adaptation of the show, which premieres on Netflix today.

Longtime Disney Movie Executive Steps Down: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He had hits with live-action versions of "Aladdin" and "The Lion King," but Disney has been on a box office cold streak more recently.
Sean Bailey, the longtime president of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture Production, resigned Monday amid a leadership shuffling at Disney's film division, which has been under attack by some investors for disappointing results at the box office.
"The time is right for a new chapter," Mr. Bailey said in a statement.
Disney named David Greenbaum, a co-president of Disney's art film division, Searchlight Pictures, as Mr. Bailey's successor. Mr. Greenbaum, however, was given a bigger job, overseeing both Mr. Bailey's slate of live-action remakes of animated classics and 20th Century Studios, a Disney film division that manages the "Avatar" and "Planet of the Apes" franchises.
Mr. Greenbaum joined Searchlight in 2010. He previously worked at Miramax when it was making films like "There Will Be Blood" and "No Country for Old Men." He recently helped Disney win the streaming rights for "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour."
"David has an incredible sensibility and eye for film," Alan Bergman, co-chairman of Disney Entertainment, said in a statement.
Matthew Greenfield, who was named co-president of Searchlight with Mr. Greenbaum in 2021, was given sole oversight of that division, which is known for Oscar-winning prestige films like "12 Years a Slave" and "Nomadland." Searchlight's current Oscar contender, "Poor Things," has collected nearly $ 100 million worldwide; it cost $ 35 million, not including marketing.
Mr. Bailey was a production president at Disney for 14 years -- an eternity in Hollywood, where film chiefs are often jettisoned every few years. Over that time, Disney was roiled by executive firings, restructuring efforts and shifting strategies for film distribution. The steady-handed Mr. Bailey, who is popular with stars and their agents, helped provide stability.
His hits included the live-action "Aladdin," which collected $ 1.1 billion at the box office. A photorealistic "The Lion King" took in $ 1.7 billion. A live-action "Beauty and the Beast" delivered $ 1.3 billion.
More recently, Mr. Bailey's division struggled -- along with other Disney studios, including Marvel -- to find new blockbusters. His remake of "The Little Mermaid," which cost an estimated $ 375 million to make and market, collected about $ 570 million worldwide after its release last spring; Disney had hoped for closer to $ 1 billion. (Theaters and studios split ticket sales roughly 50-50.) "The Haunted Mansion," overseen by Mr. Bailey, fell flat in July.
Mr. Bailey was a vocal supporter of diversity at Disney. A live-action "Snow White," set for release next year, stars the Latina actress Rachel Zegler as the princess known as "the fairest of them all." Halle Bailey, who is Black, played the title role in "The Little Mermaid."
That worldview -- and business strategy -- increasingly put Disney and Mr. Bailey, a low-profile and self-effacing executive, in the middle of a very loud, very unpolite cultural fight. For every person who applauds Disney, there seems to be a counterpart who complains about being force-fed "wokeness."
Mr. Bailey had shown signs of restlessness. In recent weeks, he talked to Netflix leaders about a senior movie position. Last year, he held similar conversations with Amazon. Three years ago, when he most recently renewed his contract with Disney, he made it clear that he it was likely his last.
"I know he'll continue to do great things," Mr. Bergman said of Mr. Bailey, who, at least in the near term, will become a producer on the Disney lot.
He will produce "Tron: Ares," a follow-up to "Tron: Legacy," a 2010 movie that he also produced -- catching the eye of Disney leaders, who recruited him as an executive.

A Landmark Movie Palace Is Bought by Star Directors: [Correction]

Full text: Concerned about the future of moviegoing in the filmmaking capital, Jason Reitman and a group of distinguished directors purchased the historic Village Theater in Westwood.
With the moviegoing experience under threat from streaming services and ever-improving home entertainment options, a group with a passionate interest in its preservation -- three dozen filmmakers who create their works for the big screen, to be enjoyed in the company of large audiences -- has decided to do something about it.
The group of directors, led by Jason Reitman -- whose films include "Juno," "Up in the Air" and "Ghostbusters: Afterlife" -- announced Wednesday that it had bought the Village Theater in the Westwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, which was put up for sale last summer to the concern of film buffs. The group, which also includes Christopher Nolan, Steven Spielberg, Lulu Wang and Alfonso Cuarón, among others, plans to restore the 93-year-old movie palace, which features one of the largest screens in Los Angeles.
"I think every director dreams of owning a movie theater," Reitman said in an interview. "And in this case, I saw an opportunity to not only save one of the greatest movie palaces in the world, but also assembled some of my favorite directors to join in on the coolest AV club of all time."
The announcement of the directors group buying the Village Theater, which has long been a favorite venue for premieres, follows on the heels of Quentin Tarantino's recent purchase of the Vista Theater in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Los Feliz.
Once renovated, the Village Theater will showcase a mixture of first-run films and repertory programming curated by the group. The collective also intends to keep the theater open while plans for a restaurant, bar and gallery are finalized. Reitman said that the group was in talks with existing exhibitors about management of the day-to-day operations of the theater, but did not reveal who.
The Village Theater was put up for sale last summer for $ 12 million, and the filmmakers -- many of whom are alumni of nearby U.C.L.A. -- were fearful it would be torn down and turned into condominiums or a space for retail. The existential threat about the future of theatrical moviegoing also loomed over this endeavor.
"We're at a crossroads moment, and streaming has brought so much ease to home entertainment that I think we often forget how fun it is to go to the movies," Reitman said. "I think what this group of directors is dedicated to is giving audiences not only the best picture and sound but the perfect night out and a reminder of how much we just love going into movies and seeing films collectively."
Rian Johnson and Guillermo Del Toro were the first people to say yes, he said. Nolan wanted to know if they were going to keep the theater's 70-millimeter projector.
All 36 directors, which also include Bradley Cooper, Gina Prince-Bythewood and Justin Lin, have a financial stake in the theater. Many plan to showcase artifacts from their personal collections. Chris Columbus, the director of the first two Harry Potter films and "Mrs. Doubtfire," intends to share his extensive collection of 16-millimeter film prints.
The purchase of the theater is the latest in a series of new openings and renovations of movie theaters around Los Angeles. In addition to Tarantino's Vista Theater, which reopened in November, the 101-year-old Egyptian Theater was bought by Netflix in partnership with the nonprofit American Cinematheque and refurbished last year. A popular video rental store, Vidiots, bought and restored the Eagle Theatre.
"All across L.A. we're seeing neighborhoods embrace theaters that offer fresh programming, real personality and a sense of community," Johnson, the director of the "Knives Out" franchise, said in a statement. "That's where the moviegoing experience is flourishing."

'The Dynasty' Cracks Open The New England Patriots: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: For an Apple TV+ docuseries, the tight-lipped sports franchise provided insight into six Super Bowl victories as well as darker moments.
The New England Patriots, a modern N.F.L. juggernaut with six Super Bowl wins and two cheating scandals, are the perfect subject for a docuseries. They are also one of the most secretive franchises in professional sports.
But the filmmakers behind "The Dynasty: New England Patriots," an Apple TV+ docuseries premiering on Friday, convinced more than 25 players, coaches and executives to open up on camera. Among those interviewed are Robert Kraft, the team's longtime owner; Bill Belichick, who has the most playoff wins of any N.F.L. coach; and Tom Brady, a three-time league M.V.P. who is widely considered the greatest quarterback ever.
In an opening montage for the behind-the-scenes look into the rise and fall of the Patriots, Brady's voice cracks and he appears to hold back tears while reminiscing on his New England career, which had a tense ending.
"The Dynasty" largely focuses on the Patriots' inner power dynamics and the team's football mystique -- Brady unleashes a comical, profanity-laced defense of a favorable but controversial play in 2002 -- but the series devotes three of its 10 episodes to darker moments. Those include the murder conviction of Aaron Hernandez and league punishments for spying on an opponent and playing with deflated footballs. (Hernandez killed himself in prison in 2017.)
"I can't overstate how impressed I was with the honesty that people demonstrated with really difficult content," said Jeff Benedict, who wrote a book about the Patriots before pitching the docuseries. "Some of the things that we were asking people to talk about were not pleasant."
The Patriots were one of the league's most tight-lipped teams under Belichick, who left the organization last month after a 4-13 season. His weekly news conferences often consisted of short, unrevealing answers; the team's "Do Your Job" mantra referred to both on-field assignments and limiting distractions.
Devin McCourty, a former Patriots defensive back and three-time Super Bowl champion, said that Belichick's intent was to focus on football. "It was always just the thought of if you say the wrong thing, you never knew how Bill was going to crush you in meetings the next day," he said in an interview.
After drafting Brady in the sixth round in 2000, the Patriots made 13 conference championship games and nine Super Bowls. But as Brady's stardom grew, he clashed with Belichick's draconian coaching style, forcing Kraft to play mediator. In the documentary, Kraft describes a 2018 meeting with Brady and the supermodel Gisele Bündchen, who was then Brady's wife, in which she complained about how Belichick treated her husband.
Brady ultimately left the team via free agency in 2020. He went on to win a record seventh Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Since his departure, the Patriots have recorded one winning season.
"People always ask, 'Why did it end?"' Benedict said. "The question I'm asking is, 'How did it last so long?"'
There have been other Patriots-related projects from NFL Films, the league's entertainment arm, and Religion of Sports, Brady's production company. But Apple, which drew from more than 40,000 hours of archival footage, strove to distinguish "The Dynasty" through its level of access.
In addition to interviews with players like Rob Gronkowski, Randy Moss and Tedy Bruschi, the filmmakers spoke with members of Brady's family (although not Bündchen), law enforcement, celebrities, journalists and Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner.
NFL Films was affiliated with the docuseries but had no editorial control -- notable because the league is making an aggressive push to create content for streaming platforms. In many ways, "The Dynasty" is the football version of "The Last Dance," the docuseries about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls that reached millions of viewers on ESPN and Netflix in 2020.
NFL Films declined to comment.
"I think everybody wanted to have a voice, let's just put it that way," said Brian Grazer, an executive producer of the series and a founder of Imagine Entertainment. He added, "You had to work with and balance a lot of personalities."
Benedict, who has written books about violence by collegiate and professional athletes, started his project on the Patriots by writing a letter to Kraft in 2018. The owner responded six months later, eventually granting Benedict access to the organization. The relationships he forged with Kraft and other team insiders when he was writing his book on the Patriots helped propel the on-camera interviews.
While a camera crew for "The Dynasty" was filming during a barbecue at Kraft's house, Kraft said that McCourty would make a good interview. McCourty said his conversation lasted about six hours across two sessions.
Kraft, Brady and Belichick's public comments are always calculated, and McCourty said he understood why they participated in the project.
"I think everyone realizes when you're a part of something like that, the way for it to last forever is to do something like this and to talk about it," McCourty said.
In true Patriots fashion, Kraft and Brady declined to comment. A representative for Belichick did not respond to a request for comment.

Full text: The Netflix documentary revels in nostalgia. But the heart of the film spotlights the relationships between the pop superstars who recorded "We Are the World."
The title of Netflix's new documentary "The Greatest Night in Pop," which chronicles the recording of "We Are the World," is a little mystifying. Pop music needs a big audience, but what happened inside A&M Studios in Los Angeles, in the vampire hours between 10 p.m. on Jan. 28, 1985, and 8 a.m. the next day, was seen by only 60 to 70 people in attendance, from Michael Jackson to a small film crew. The song that resulted in this frantic, logistically improbable session is stirring but callow, with a gospel-style chord progression that gives false weight to the platitudinous lyrics.
Prince, who declined repeated entreaties to join the ensemble, sat it out because he thought the song was "horrible," according to the guitarist Wendy Melvoin. It sold over 20 million copies, with some fans reportedly buying multiples less out of enthusiasm for the music, it seems, than a desire to donate money toward feeding Ethiopians, who were in the midst of a famine that reportedly killed as many as 700,000 people. The song won four Grammys, including song of the year, but almost 40 years later, it has all but vanished from view.
But now, "We Are the World" and the private machinations that went into writing and recording it are up for reconsideration, thanks to the documentary, which was viewed 11.9 million times in its first week of release last month, topping Netflix's list of English-language films. "The Greatest Night in Pop" earns its swaggering title in two ways. Until someone invents a time machine, it's the greatest way to see what the mid-1980s were about, thanks to a parade of stylistic and technological hallmarks, and even anachronisms: big hair, cassette tapes, primary colors, satin baseball jackets, leather pants, leotards, fur coats, perms, walkie talkies, even a Rolodex. (Cassettes, unlike perms, have made a comeback.)
It's also a wonderful illustration of the old maxim that show business is about relationships. The "We Are the World" session brought together most of the singers who made 1984 "pop music's greatest year," as many have called it, and benefited from an unrepeatable set of variables. The chain of action that preceded that night was, the film shows, all about calling friends, calling in favors and cannily casting the song with a broad demographic appeal. Here's a look at how a few accomplished musicians and one relentless manager organized a gala event in only four weeks.
Harry Belafonte and Ken Kragen
Harry Belafonte, the singer, actor and civil rights activist, wanted to draw attention to the famine in Africa, and he approached Ken Kragen, one of the industry's most high-powered artist managers. Belafonte had seen how much money the Irish singer Bob Geldof was raising for famine relief with the "Do They Know It's Christmas?" single, and proposed a benefit concert. Kragen had a different idea: "I said, 'Harry, let's just take the idea Bob already gave us. Let's do it, but let's get the greatest stars in America to do it,"' he recalls in one of the documentary's archival interviews. (Kragen died in 2021.)
Kragen managed Lionel Richie, then riding a huge string of hits, and the singer quickly signed on. When he spoke to Richie, Belafonte mentioned the success of "Do They Know It's Christmas?" "Harry said, 'We have white folks saving Black folks, but we don't have Black folks saving Black folks,"' Richie, a producer on the film, explains. Belafonte was 57, an eminence grise in entertainment, and his participation motivated lots of artists who admired him.
Lionel Richie, Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson
One of Richie's first moves was to enlist the producer Quincy Jones, who was on a hot streak thanks to his work with Michael Jackson, Donna Summer and James Ingram. "I wanted Quincy involved because he's the master orchestrator," Richie said. Jones was a virtuoso arranger, which is one sense of the word "orchestrator," but he was also adept at smoothly navigating artists' egos, which is an equally important sense of the word.
Jackson was worried about overexposure, following his "Thriller" run of hits, so he opted out of the recording session. Jones, one of the few people with the standing and credentials to forcefully push back against Jackson, talked him into it.
"The Greatest Night in Pop" is full of details about Jackson's idiosyncrasies, including his fear of driving on freeways and his insistence that visitors to his home hold Bubbles, his pet chimp. Richie said in the film that they modeled their song, rather improbably, on "Rule Britannia," the British patriotic anthem.
Lionel Richie and Stevie Wonder
Once Richie and Kragen decided to plan the recording session for the January night when lots of stars would be in Los Angeles for the American Music Awards, the singer had about four weeks to write a song worthy of the talent. He called Stevie Wonder, the master of universal humanist ballads; the two had been at Motown Records together in the 1970s, when Richie was in the Commodores. But Wonder notoriously functions on his own peculiar schedule, and relationships aside, he didn't get back to Richie. Instead, Jones recommended another former Motown star: Michael Jackson. (Wonder later responded, eager to help write a song, well after Richie and Jackson had already finished it.)
Cyndi Lauper or Madonna?
Madonna is not one of the "We Are the World" singers, even though she was a presenter at the American Music Awards earlier that night, and the film is vague about her absence. Harriet Sternberg, the head of creative services at Kragen's company, says she wanted to book Madonna, "but Ken wanted Cyndi. We had a fight about that."
The implication is that it had to be one or the other, not both. Some fans and lots of publications falsely posited the two dominant female pop stars as opposites, with Lauper as an offbeat, authentic singer and feminist, and Madonna as a sex object who made manufactured Top 40 music. The film doesn't put an end to decades of speculation about why Madonna wasn't there.
Ken Kragen and Bruce Springsteen
To maximize the attention and airplay the song would get (and therefore the income it would generate), Kragen wanted white singers included in the session. He invited Bruce Springsteen, the biggest rock star of the day and a guy who maintains careful control over the music he makes. "I normally wouldn't have done it, but it looked important," Springsteen said in the documentary. When Springsteen signed on, Kragen could confidently go after Bob Dylan, Billy Joel and others.
Relationship Gaps
The song's brain trust didn't book any rappers or hair metal acts, though both were increasingly pertinent genres and would have broadened the demographic appeal. Alabama, then country music's biggest group, is also absent. Instead, Kragen booked Kenny Rogers (his client), Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings, who walked out of the recording session in frustration.
Stevie Wonder and Bob Dylan
When it was his turn to sing a solo line, Dylan, who was dressed like he'd just left his job at the lumber yard, froze as if the song were in a foreign language -- which, for the least pop singer in the room, it was. Wonder, who'd recorded Dylan's "Mr. Tambourine Man" and "Blowin' in the Wind" in 1966, guided him through the line while unveiling an all-time great Dylan impersonation.
Quincy Jones and Tom Bahler
The overlooked hero of "We Are the World" is Tom Bahler, an unsurpassed vocal arranger (and longtime collaborator with Jones) who assigned solo lines to specific singers and paired artists together based on their styles. He orchestrated the dramatic flow and harmonic dynamics, which are the best part of the song. "'We Are the World,' man, with all those singers -- it goes right on through me," Miles Davis said a few months after the song's attention-grabbing release.

Full text: This month's picks include a decades-spanning Chinese drama, a thriller about a teenage immigrant in Canada, an absurdist French crime comedy and more.
'So Long, My Son'
Stream it on Mubi.
The scenes that open this ravishing drama by Wang Xiaoshuai feel like pieces of a cryptic puzzle, gesturing evocatively at a whole that remains out of view. A pair of boys play beside a lake, a death is seen from a distance, and years later, in some other place, a grieving couple struggle to raise a wayward son. Slowly, these fragments swirl together into a decades-spanning epic about two couples in China, brought together in the 1980s by their factory jobs and then torn apart by a series of losses, including those inflicted by the country's one-child policy.
With its nonlinear stitching, the movie demands patience, and rewards it handsomely. Each scene trembles with emotion, conjured at the precise intersection of performance, cinematography and carefully rendered political context. In one sequence, the central couple, Liyun (Yong Mei) and Yaojun (Wang Jingchun), receive news of layoffs in a companywide meeting. As the crowd of workers erupts in rage, the camera settles on Liyun's face, streaked by a single tear: A personal tragedy is etched in the canvas of a historical one. The two will suffer many more crises, but in relaying them non-chronologically, the film allows for plenty of grace and resilience, capturing life not as an arc but as a collection of moments -- sometimes good, sometimes bad, always fleeting.
'Antigone'
Stream it on Tubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A Greek tragedy is reimagined as a bristling tale of rage against injustice in this French Canadian thriller from the director Sophie Deraspe. If the names of the movie's characters seem out of place at first -- the protagonist is Antigone (Nahéma Ricci), an Algerian immigrant and high school student in Montreal, and her siblings are Polynice, Étéocle, and Ismène -- the epic dimensions of their lives become quickly apparent. They arrived in Quebec with their grandmother when Antigone was only three, having lost both their parents; the two brothers now provide for their meager household -- through aboveboard as well as illicit means involving gangs.
When an incident of brazen police brutality kills Étéocle and sends Polynice to prison, Antigone takes it upon herself to free her brother through an audacious plan that puts her own life in danger. This modern twist on the Greek heroine's self-sacrifice generates a number of timely ripples; social media becomes a key tool in Antigone's battle against the state. Anchored in a riveting performance by Ricci, "Antigone" is a portrait of immigrant disenfranchisement, adolescent rage and familial duty that feels both eternal and strikingly contemporary.
'Three of Us'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Along the western coast of India lies a breeze-swept stretch of land called the Konkan, dotted with trees and ancient forts, and boasting a unique language and cuisine. In 2014, the filmmaker Avinash Arun unfurled "Killa," a gentle coming-of-age tale, in the meditative heart of Konkan, the area's unhurried pace and natural beauty offering an ideal setting for the young protagonist's newfound grief. In his new feature, "Three of Us," Arun returns to the region to draw out his character's internal battles -- although this time, his focus is on a middle-aged couple confronting mortality.
When she discovers that she has dementia, Shailaja (Shefali Shah), who lives and works in Mumbai, decides that she wants to revisit the Konkan village where she spent formative years of her childhood. Her husband, Dipankar (Swanand Kirkire), goes along, bemused but supportive. There, in the long shadows of palm trees, Shailaja reconnects with Pradeep (Jaideep Ahlawat), a childhood friend who seems to unfasten something deep inside her.
The strength of "Three of Us" lies precisely in its reluctance to name or detail things. Instead, the film simply observes the three wonderful lead actors as they move about the beautiful landscape, dramas of yearning, sadness and joy all playing out in their gestures, evoking essential truths of life.
'The Green Perfume'
Stream it on Mubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
French comedies don't get much sillier -- or more entertaining -- than this caper by the director Nicolas Pariser, which tangles together a thespian accused of an onstage murder, a cartoonist running from her nagging mother and a host of international criminals and detectives. Vincent Lacoste plays the poor straight man, Martin, unwillingly caught up in these high jinks. An actor in the Comédie-Française, he is in the wings when a colleague drops dead during a climactic monologue. A parting whisper from the victim puts the target on Marin's back, and he embarks on a journey across Europe evading both the cops and the killers, while Claire (Sandrine Kiberlain), the cartoonist, follows along, for no discernible reason other than to avoid dinner with her family. Not much of it makes sense, per se, but that's kind of the point: "The Green Perfume" takes the tropes of convoluted crime thrillers and reimagines them with tongue-in-cheek irony.
'Norma'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In this Argentine comedy from Santiago Giralt, the life of a rich woman in her 60s, Norma (Mercedes Morán), begins to fall apart. One day, she comes home to find that her housekeeper has found a better job, and is leaving her. That snagged thread slowly unravels the whole fabric of Norma's life, as she realizes the ways in which daily routines and comforts have numbed her to her discontents. Her marriage is stuck, her relationships with her mother and sister are broken and her panic attacks are debilitating.
Morán, who wrote the script with Giralt, brings a gentle, effortless authenticity to even the more trite or cutesy parts of the film -- like Norma's newfound weed habit, or her budding, sisterly friendship with a new neighbor, a red-haired therapist, who helps Norma loosen up. Her aging doldrums may be familiar, but Norma embodies a fullness -- she's spoiled, vulnerable, impulsive and deeply empathetic -- that we rarely see in older women onscreen. This is a midlife-crisis movie that thrums with the energy and optimism of a coming-of-age film.

Full text: I'm the Los Angeles bureau chief for The New York Times. My free moments are all about frivolity, maybe a bit of learning. I'm also a sucker for anything that highlights my marvelous and crazy city. Here are five things I've recently watched and heard.
The Mitchells vs. the Machines
With a wholesome story line, witty dialogue and creative animation, this movie is all about family (oh, and also about robots taking over the world). It makes me laugh every single time I watch it, which is maybe once a month. And Maya Rudolph is always a gift.
I Will Teach You to Be Rich
Don't mind the title -- the fascination here is listening to couples work through the psychology behind their curious money choices. I was never taught personal finance, so I am learning (and, of course, judging) as I listen. The related TV show, "How to Get Rich," is also fun.
My Octopus Teacher
I flipped this on randomly one day and was entranced. Turns out, a tale about a brilliant octopus is weirdly intriguing and makes you feel smarter because -- hey, look at you so interested in science! Even those who avoid documentaries will be hooked by the gorgeous cinematography and surprising reveals.
Selling Sunset
Welcome to a ridiculous version of Los Angeles where your real estate agent shows up in stilettos and a bustier. Yes, the business attire is absurd, the mansion price tags are grossly exorbitant, the fights are ultra-petty ... and, yes, I will binge-watch every season that drops until the end of time.
Prince
If you know, you know.

For Tobias Menzies, Acting Is All About Less Being More: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The British actor excels at playing reserve, and what roils beneath, on "The Crown." And now he brings that stoicism to "The Hunt," onstage in Brooklyn.
On a morning in early February, the actor Tobias Menzies walked the Brooklyn Heights Promenade in the relative anonymity he prefers. Menzies wasn't hiding. He wore no sunglasses, no cap, just Blundstones, jeans, a shearling coat. He didn't duck when people came his way. But the past few years, including multi-season stints on "The Crown" and "Outlander," have brought him a new visibility, which still makes him uneasy.
"I'm not that confident about my life or what it is to be able to put it out in the public," he said, shoulders hunched against the breeze. "I'm just bumbling along as best I can."
Menzies, 49, had come to Brooklyn, to rehearse "The Hunt," a theatrical adaptation of the Thomas Vinterberg movie that begin performances at St. Ann's Warehouse on Friday. Back in 2019, Menzies had originated the stage role of Lucas, a preschool teacher falsely accused of exposing himself to a child, in a London production. A member of a local hunting club, Lucas now finds himself targeted by the community that once embraced him.
In the years since "The Hunt" premiered, Menzies has won an Emmy, for playing Prince Philip on the Netflix hit "The Crown," and a fan base for his dual roles of Frank Randall and his sadistic ancestor Black Jack Randall on the Starz series "Outlander." He also played somewhat against type as an anxious therapist in Nicole Holofcener's acerbic comedy "You Hurt My Feelings."
Five years ago, the role made perfect sense for Menzies, who specializes in wounded masculinity. The play, adapted by David Farr, is caustic and cerebral, and it reunited him with a frequent collaborator, the director Rupert Goold. And Lucas is a type that Menzies has often gravitated toward, a man unable, whether by upbringing, temperament or circumstance, to show his feelings. Lucas benefits from both Menzies' natural reserve and his ability to show what roils beneath that stoicism, a game of emotive hide-and-seek.
"I find less-is-more interesting to watch, characters that you have to lean toward and work out, because they don't just reveal everything," he said. "The world can be hard, it can be bruising," he said. And those bruises don't always show up in the obvious places.
Goold, speaking by telephone, recognized Menzies's attraction to these seemingly reserved characters. "He does have an innate remoteness," he said of his colleague. "That's something he's developed as he's got older, a kind of distance. I don't think he as a man is like that, but he does bring that for audiences."
As a man he is actually somewhat like that. He described himself as "naturally quite a private person," and even a thorough online search discloses only the barest details of early life and actor training (elementary education at an alternative school, subsequent studies at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art). "My instinct has always been to talk about the work and not myself," he said. "too much biography gets in the way."
On the stroll, he manifested what an oversharing New Yorker might identify as typical British reserve. He does in fact have a personal life, even if he chooses not to talk about it. "The reason I don't answer those questions is not that I don't have any friends. Just to be clear," he reassured me. He paused often, swallowing his words or letting the wind lift them away. Conversation flowed more easily walking side by side rather than speaking face to face. (That face has a courtly handsomeness, complicated by long vertical creases down each cheek. "They're not ritual scars," he said, "just an anomaly of how my face has grown.") Entwined with that reserve is a fierce charisma and a mordant sense of humor. At one turn, his path was blocked by a large boulder, a hunk of sedimentary rock.
"Just to remind us where we're all headed," he said darkly. It was a gorgeous winter morning, but his thoughts were dust to dust.
Always a supporting player, at least onscreen, he has suddenly become a leading man. Just as "The Hunt" wraps its run, AppleTV+ will release "Manhunt," in which Menzies stars as Edwin Stanton, the U.S. Secretary of War charged with capturing John Wilkes Booth, Abraham Lincoln's assassin. Which means that Menzies has gone from hunted to hunter and back. Is returning to the role of a man ostracized by his community, for reasons both false and true, the canniest career choice?
Probably not, but Menzies had committed to the transfer to St. Ann's before the pandemic, and he would honor it. Besides it's the work that has always driven him and not what that work might mean for his career, his profile. "I find that stuff very uncomfortable," he said.
Recognizing that discomfort, it would be easy to assume that Menzies is a technical actor, an analytical one, someone who doesn't let his own emotional life seep into a character. But for Menzies, acting is a deeply personal endeavor. If he is private in his public life, he is far more open onstage.
"I certainly use a lot of myself in my work," he said. "That's the quickest way to make it as real as possible. If you're using memories of your own or experiences of your own, you're right there. So, yeah, theater has always been quite personal for me."
Asked what memories and experiences he had used for "The Hunt," he became understandably warier. "Being outside, trying to get in," he said, finally. Then, on the south end of the promenade, looking out toward the Statue of Liberty, he elaborated. "I guess on the spectrum, I'm probably something of an isolate; sometimes I can be that person. So that's been relatively straightforward to access."
Celebrity, of course, can provide its own isolation, particularly for those like Menzies who mistrust it. It's uncomfortable to find yourself becoming this visible, this spotlit. And that seems to have enhanced this version of "The Hunt." "In dealing with celebrity and the way that can be toxic or even ostracizing at times, his performances is even richer now," Goold said. "To be an outsider in a more profound way is what I perceive Tobias's work is now."
After "The Hunt," Menzies will finishing shooting a Formula 1 movie, opposite Brad Pitt and Javier Bardem, delayed by the writers' and actors' strikes. And if that sounds fairly commercial and maybe even fun ("Essentially it's the action film," he said, "these pirouettes of character, and then it's more driving"), he will follow it up with a new production of the Greek tragedy "Antigone" at the National Theater, in London.
"I'm not the most strategic of actors, clearly," he admitted. He'd made a loop of the promenade and was heading down the slope back toward St. Ann's. "I very much orient to if the work good enough, it will lead me to where I need to be."

Full text: The actress stars as a clairvoyant in the latest entry to the Spider-Man franchise, using her charm to rise above this flat, predictable movie.
The only real bummer about "Madame Web," the latest installment in the Spider-Man chronicles, isn't that it's bad, but that it never achieves memorably terrible status. The story is absurd, the dialogue snort-out-loud risible, the fights uninspired. Even so, there are glimmers of wit and competency. And then there's its star, Dakota Johnson, who has a fascinating, seemingly natural ability to appear wholly detached from the nonsense swirling around her. Most actors at least try to sell the shoddy goods; Johnson serenely floats above it all.
A misterioso clairvoyant, Madame Web is a secondary Spider-Man character who met the web-weaver in the comics in 1980 while regally parked on a life-support system shaped like a round-bottom flask. Blind and plagued by a debilitating autoimmune disease, she had a standard super-type get-up -- a black unitard veined with lines that converge in a web -- that was offset by a white-and-black hairdo that suggested she shared a stylist with Peter Parker's editor J. Jonah Jameson. She entered with "a smell of ozone and disinfectant and age," the classy intro explained, and with "a voice that crackles like ancient parchment."
Johnson's Cassandra Webb -- Cassie for short -- is far younger and seems more like a patchouli and cannabis kind of gal, despite the frenetic wheel skills she displays in her job as a New York paramedic. Her powers haven't yet emerged when, after a preamble in the Peruvian Amazon, she is speeding through the city in 2003. As with many superheroes, Cassie has a tragic back story and so on, a generic burden that Johnson's palpably awkward charm humanizes. If the actress at times seems understandably baffled by the movie she's in, it's because she hasn't been smoothed into plastic perfection by the star-making machinery. Johnson seems too real for the phoniness thrown at her, which is her own super power.
The British director S.J. Clarkson has multiple TV credits on her résumé, including a few episodes of the Netflix series "Jessica Jones," about the hard boozing, fighting and fornicating superhero. Johnson's Cassie is sadder and more naturally offbeat than Jones, and like most big-screen superheroes, Cassie doesn't seem to be getting any noncombative action. Yet she too doesn't fit easily in Normal World. One of the better scenes in "Madame Web" happens at a baby shower, where Cassie inadvertently wipes the smiles off the faces of a roomful of women by talking about her dead mother. It's squirmy, funny filler: the guest of honor is Mary Parker (Emma Roberts), Spidey's soon-to-be mom, who chats with his future uncle, Ben (Adam Scott).
Clarkson shares screenwriter credit with Claire Parker as well as with the writing team of Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, whose collaborations include a string of critically maligned box-office fantasies: "Dracula Untold," "Gods of Egypt," "The Last Witch Hunter" and "Morbius." (That's entertainment!)
"Madame Web" hits the prerequisite genre marks, more or less, as Cassie starts developing her second-sight skills and begins shuffling into the near future and back. One of the character's more attractive attributes is that her powers are mental rather than physical, which seems to have flummoxed the filmmakers. The movie never coheres narratively, tonally or, really, any way; one problem is the people behind it don't know what to do with a woman who thinks her way out of trouble.

Nearly as annoying, the movie saddles Cassie with surrogate mom duties after she rescues three teens -- played by Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor and Sydney Sweeney -- a cute trio with absent parents, peekaboo midriffs and (surprise) special talents. Given the cultural conservatism of comic-book movies, it's no surprise that Cassie only briefly evades gender duties, and at least Johnson makes Cassie's flustering protective bit bearable. The teens are onboard to expand the Spider-world and presumably help seduce a new generation of true believers; yet while the performers are fine, these characters are as formulaic as the villain, Ezekiel Sims (a brutally miscast Tahar Rahim), who soon overstays his welcome.
Spider-Man has been a monster hitmaker for Sony, so it's obvious why it keeps squeezing the character for new material. (It bought the film rights to Spider-Man from Marvel in 1999.) That it's releasing "Madame Web" in the wake of last year's imaginatively animated "Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse" isn't surprising; when a company throws every desperate idea at the wall, failure is inevitable. The most interesting thing about this particular one is that Johnson's performance lightly complicates the oft-repeated belief that when it comes to superhero movies, the intellectual property matters more than any star (Tobey Maguire, etc.). "Madame Web" is a dud, but it's one that Johnson transcends long before the final credits roll.

‘The Vince Staples Show’ Is Part Art House, Part ‘Home Improvement’

Vince Staples is not someone you would describe as “excitable.” During a recent conversation about his new Netflix sitcom, “The Vince Staples Show,” his deliberate drawl remained steady throughout. But his clear pride in the series, out Thursday, broke through his placid exterior a few times, such as when he talked about the cameo by the high-living rapper Rick Ross or the show’s Swedish film influences. He also knows that the mere fact of its existence is exceptional.
“I don’t think there are many people who have been able to write and produce and star in their first television show, on a network that’s this big, that comes from where I come from,” Staples, 30, said in a video interview from his home in Los Angeles.
Staples said he had ambitions to make his own show since he released his debut album, “Summertime ’06,” in 2015. On that LP and the four that followed, Staples wove stories about his upbringing in Long Beach with a sardonic delivery — a perspective that proved to be his through line between multiple mediums. His interviews and social media posts, in which he casts off irreverent one-liners and blunt social critique, have generated enough material for greatest hits collections.
Staples made his acting debut in 2015 playing an inept sidekick in the comic coming-of-age film “Dope”; he has since starred in other movies, including the 2023 “White Men Can’t Jump” reboot, and in series like “Lazor Wulf,” an animated comedy on Adult Swim. He’s been able to incorporate some of his wit and other aspects of his personality in more recent roles, like the deadpan but well-meaning romantic interest he plays in “Abbott Elementary,” opposite the show’s creator Quinta Brunson.
“The Vince Staples Show,” which counts Staples and Kenya Barris (“black-ish”) among its executive producers, is a more idiosyncratic kind of sitcom. In the world of the series, in which Staples plays a fictionalized version of himself wiggling through day-in-the-life predicaments, a trip to the amusement park becomes a treacherous sojourn and gun-culture satire runs alongside physical comedy. It’s part art house, but Staples insists it’s also just him.
“I’m very detail-oriented,” Staples said. “So the things that I say sometimes might seem like I’m trying to make this grand statement, but it’s really just simple.”
In an interview, Staples discussed the lessons he learned from “Abbott Elementary,” his other sitcom influences and whether acting matters more to him than his music. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: Tonally and otherwise, “The Vince Staples Show” is reminiscent of other auteurist comedies like “Atlanta” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” What were some of your influences?
A: A lot of influences, the strongest one being the editing style of animation. There’s “King of the Hill.” “Pulp Fiction” with our shot selection. We don’t really have influences that people would assume. But having comparisons to such strong, proven things is an honor.
Q: Before your appearance on “Abbott Elementary,” you and Brunson co-starred in “Lazor Wulf.” Did she give you any advice about creating your own show?
A: She has a lot of information and is very thoughtful. Just sending her scripts and telling her about the show, she has given me a lot of advice, a lot of help on how to navigate the space and how to make sure that your vision is getting executed properly. It largely falls on you and your willingness to work and complete tasks. Anything I’ve ever asked for, she’s given me the response that I needed.
Q: You’ve been open about your lack of interest in many aspects of hip-hop culture , like its occasionally extreme competitiveness. Have you maintained that distance in TV?
A: I’m not the most competitive person. I find the creation of the thing is kind of what I appreciate the most, the work that goes into it. So I’m not there to measure myself up against other people. I’m just here to create what I can create, and I try to be the best that I can be at whatever I’m trying to execute. Everyone’s story matters and everyone’s work matters, to a certain extent. We’re all trying to just get our voices heard and tell our stories.
Q: The show employs distinctive cinematography. For example, in a bank robbery scene in the second episode there was a shot in which you were dead center, the robber is in the upper left and nervous customers on the bottom right. Were there some specific reference points you drew from?
A: We take a lot of inspiration in Roy Andersson, one of my favorite filmmakers. In his film “A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence,” he has this shot in this restaurant or a cafeteria, where a lot of the people are separated by the pillars and just entering and exiting a frame. Things that are happening in the distance and things that are happening closer to camera, everything matters in the shot, especially when you stay within a wide. So I think operating within a wide sometimes allows you to bring subtle details and nuances to the shot, and the disposition of the people within the bank can speak to their relationships, speak to their experience.
Q: Was there an idea behind the Rick Ross appearance? You guys do seem to have different lifestyles outside of the show.
A: A lot of the time there are certain levels to success, and there are levels to class, and certain levels to the assumption of what goes behind being a creative or, you know, a Black male. We tackle a lot of those things. The thing about Rick Ross and Vince Staples being viewed in a somewhat similar light even though they’re drastically different, as you’ve just stated — to someone who would be working in a bank or who would be in charge of that kind of financial freedom that we’re both looking for, I think we’re in the same fishbowl.
Q: Is it fair to say that TV was more of an influence on you than hip-hop when you were growing up?
A: Yeah. I have older parents, older grandparents. We didn’t really have access to music and cable as much as other people did. So “The Andy Griffith Show,” “M-A-S-H,” “Married With Children,” “Home Improvement,” “The Simpsons,” “King of the Hill” — I saw those a lot more than I heard albums. I can’t even honestly remember hearing or even seeing a CD of my own until I got to probably eighth, ninth grade.
Q: What did you learn about TV from something like “Home Improvement”?
A: I don’t know how they would categorize it, but I think Tim Allen playing the straight man on that show but still being composed. Of course, Wilson is the straightest man because he doesn’t have a face damn near for the whole show. But I think that performance was really memorable, balancing family and work. The showcasing of the way that people are processing stress or family, that translated differently with “Home Improvement” than it did with “Married With Children.” That’s translated different in “That ’70s Show.” That’s translated different in “Fresh Prince” or “Martin.” Just seeing how people play their roles is important.
Q: Is Vince Staples the actor something you’d rather see long term than Vince Staples the rapper?
A: I’m just Vince Staples the person. So long as I’m breathing, I’ll continue to try different means and different things and find different ways of expression. But this is definitely something that I think is interesting. I study a lot, and I try to find my lane within all these things. It’s just the beginning of that.

An English City Gave Soccer to the World. Now It Wants Credit.: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: As far as the man in the food truck is concerned, the patch of land he occupies in Sheffield, England, is about as humdrum as they come. To him, the spot -- in the drab parking lot of a sprawling home improvement superstore, its facade plastered in lurid orange -- is not exactly a place where history comes alive.
John Wilson, an academic at the University of Sheffield's management school, looks at the same site and can barely contain his excitement. This, he said, is one of the places where the world's most popular sport was born. He does not see a parking lot. He can see the history: the verdant grass, the sweating players, the cheering crowds.
His passion is sincere, absolute and shared by a small band of amateur historians and volunteer detectives devoted to restoring Sheffield -- best known for steel, coal and as the setting for the film "The Full Monty" -- to its rightful place as the undisputed birthplace of codified, organized, recognizable soccer.
For now, their attempts have mustered a walking tour of the city, conducted through a homemade app, and a few slightly weathered plaques. But Dr. Wilson and his compatriots have a bold vision of what their efforts might produce: a "digital museum" of Sheffield's soccer history, a sculpture trail and -- more than anything -- a clear and prestigious identity for a city that has, in recent times, struggled just a little to define itself.
As they look to use the city's past to shape its future, though, they do -- Dr. Wilson warned -- have a bit of a "tendency to go off on tangents."
He is not wrong. In the half-hour walk to the parking lot, Dr. Wilson, 65, and two of his fellow enthusiasts, John Stocks, a 65-year-old retired English teacher and author, and John Clarke, a retired computer engineer who is 63, touched on a range of subjects that included -- but was not limited to -- social migration patterns in Victorian England, the Netflix series "The English Game" and the practice of topping walls with crozzle, a waste product from iron furnaces.
They discussed each digression with glee, eagerly diving every rabbit hole. Like many ardent hobbyists, they reveled in the detail as much as the sweep.
The picture they have in their minds, though, is clear.
"In the 1850s and 60s, there were hundreds of teams, playing each other in competitive games, on pitches all over the city," Mr. Stocks said. In studying Sheffield's soccer legacy, he said, the past they have unearthed reveals the city as "the home of the first real football culture anywhere in the world." That, they believe, might also be the key to its future.
But the title "Home of Football" -- always capitalized and, in flagrant disregard of New York Times style, never "soccer" -- is a contested one.
It is semiofficially applied to Wembley, the stadium in the endless gray expanse of northwest London that is the headquarters of both the English national team and the Football Association, the game's governing body in England.
Visit England, the country's tourist board, backs another contender. It describes Manchester as the "Home of Football," on the grounds that it hosts two heavyweights of the Premier League and the National Football Museum. Manchester is also where the Football League -- the sport's first professional competition -- was formed.
In comparison, Sheffield's candidacy for the title is distinctly homespun. There is a brief précis of the city's role in the game's formation on the website of its tourist board, and an archive is on display in the "local studies" section of the city's library.
"We've not been very good at promoting ourselves," said Richard Caborn, a former lawmaker from the city and the minister for sport under Tony Blair's Labour government. "We've never really positioned ourselves to exploit it."
Sheffield Home of Football, an educational charity established by Dr. Wilson and his fellow travelers, has stepped into that void.
"We've been through the history and we have the documentation," Mr. Caborn said. "This isn't a claim. It's evidence-based."
Sheffield's case is compelling. Sheffield F.C., the world's oldest club, was founded here. So, too, was Hallam F.C., the world's second-oldest. Hallam's home, Sandygate, has been hosting soccer since 1860, longer than anywhere else. It was in Sheffield, too, that the rules of the game that would become soccer were first written down.
Mr. Stocks and his fellow "obsessives" -- his word -- draw the greatest satisfaction in finding the supporting evidence. It is painstaking work, trawling through both digital and physical archives, but worth it, he said.
"There are some of us who will stay up all night chasing down a lead they've found," he said. "I'm not quite as bad as that, but I do devote quite a lot of time to it. I have quite a few other projects I'm supposed to be getting on with, but the reality is that most of the time, I'm doing this."
Because of their work, Sheffield can now, with a reasonable degree of confidence, claim to be home to the first derby match in world soccer -- the meeting of city rivals Sheffield F.C. and Hallam on the site of the home improvement store's parking lot -- as well as the first corner kick, the first use of the crossbar and the first match report.
Mr. Stocks has also tracked down a suggestion that passing was invented in Sheffield -- not in Scotland, as is widely believed. There are accounts of what sounds an awful lot like professionalism. "We think there's a chance the first German team was founded here, too," Dr. Wilson said.
Part of the thrill, they admit, is correcting some of the inaccuracies in what they call soccer's "folk history." Their driving force, though, is the sense that their discoveries can define not only what Sheffield was, but what it might yet be.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Sheffield was hit hard by the decline of Britain's heavy industries; even harder than much of the rest of northern England, Dr. Wilson said.
Built on steel and coal, the city was run for years by a left-leaning council that was a gleeful thorn in the side of successive British governments. "They called it the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire," he said. As the factories and mines shuttered, Sheffield struggled both for investment and identity.
The various modern conceptions of Sheffield have not yielded a new one. The backdrop for the film "Brassed Off," as well as "The Full Monty," and home to Pulp and the Arctic Monkeys, two of the defining British bands of the last quarter-century, the city also developed a reputation for advanced manufacturing. It is where, every year, the world snooker championship is held.
Nothing, though, has ever quite settled. "The council are leaning into music quite heavily now," Mr. Stocks said. "But it won't stick. We're not Liverpool. We're not London. We're not Glasgow."
Soccer, though, is different. To him and the others, Sheffield's role in shaping the most popular sport in the world should be its calling card, its claim to fame -- not to attract tourists necessarily, but so it can find its place in the world, can define its sense of self.
"Most people here only have a vague awareness of some of it," Dr. Wilson said. "They don't know we have this unique identity, that this is something we gave to the world. No other city can say that."

Examination of the history of Sheffield, England, John Stocks said, shows that the city was "the home of the first real football culture anywhere in the world."; From left, the amateur historians Mr. Stocks, John Wilson and John Clarke.

Full text: Not everything sold by Fashion Brand Company is weird or playful or erotic. Occasionally the inventory is mellowed out by the addition of plain trousers or a ribbed tank top.
But it is the more imaginative pieces that have seduced the brand's customer base: minidresses with 10 cartoonish arms sticking out from both sides; sunglasses with a realistic set of upper teeth embedded into each arm; halter gowns with necklines that make the wearer look as if she is being eaten by a fish or choked by an alien. Even a plain summer frock may have a freaky name, like the "breeze on my genitals dress."
The clothes are jokes. The woman telling them is Penelope Gazin, a 34-year-old artist who lives in Altadena, Calif. Yet the brand, founded in 2018 in her old apartment, where she boxed and shipped orders herself, should not be mistaken for either a joke or an art project.
In 2023, sales exceeded $ 7 million, according to Kate Giambra, the vice president and chief operating officer of Fashion Brand Company. Its headquarters is now a former martial arts academy in Glendale, where the ex-tenants left behind several karate trophies. In addition to its roughly 13 stateside employees, the company has 32 full-time-with-benefits garment workers in Guangdong, China.
This ethical factory, as the company calls it, opened in 2021. Ms. Gazin needed patternmakers and sewers who understood how her mind worked, and who wouldn't, for example, question making a 12-foot-tall version of a jacket to install inside the office. ("The idea came to me on ketamine," she said.)
"When Penelope would explain what she was trying to do, they would always be like, 'Are you sure people want to buy this?"' Ms. Giambra, 35, said.
For its first two years, Fashion Brand Company was like a part-time project, Ms. Gazin said. "But then it got to a bit of a manic place when I was diagnosed with cancer."
She was sitting in a bulbous caramel leather armchair in her homey living room, with its terra-cotta tile and 1970s-style wood paneling. Tapestries and paintings of monsters and nude women hung on the adobe brick walls. A throw pillow read "Sex House," iterating on one of Ms. Gazin's first designs, a sweater.
In 2021, after she gave birth to her son, Skip, Ms. Gazin was told she had a rare type of cervical cancer. It was aggressive but operable, she said, though it took more than a year following the removal of her cervix for doctors to declare her cancer free. A few days before that surgery, Ms. Gazin married Skip's father, Max Baumgarten, an actor and professional clown who once surprised her with a puppet striptease show while she waited for an M.R.I.
During this time, Ms. Gazin made some death preparations, including designing a collection, hidden on the back end of her e-commerce platform, that she hoped would keep the business running for years to come.
The thought can still provoke Ms. Giambra to tears; she and Ms. Gazin are best friends as well as business partners. Not so funny for a brand built on being funny -- on "irony, stupidness, silliness," as Ms. Gazin described her sensibility.
Then again, Ms. Gazin doesn't overly identify with the typical Fashion Brand Company customer -- someone who might be attracted to attracting attention. Sometimes, particularly after having a baby and having cancer, she wants to dress "sexy and cheaply," as if in costume. More often, she said, she wants "quiet pieces" -- well-made day care pickup outfits. At home, for this interview, she wore casual striped pants covered in illustrations of soccer players.
"It's not for shy people," Ms. Gazin said of her line. And yet she can be surprisingly shy. At least for someone who once embedded her own pubic hair into a pair of sunglasses, pricing them at $ 666.
'Lady Business'
By the time she started Fashion Brand Company, Ms. Gazin already had a reputation for mixing business and humor.
In 2015, she and Ms. Giambra founded Witchsy, an online artist's marketplace to rival Etsy. (The name was a reference to Etsy's ban of spells and other occult offerings.) Ms. Gazin had grown tired of her popular enamel pins being censored by Etsy. On Witchsy, nipples could be expressed freely.
In 2017, Witchsy made headlines when Ms. Gazin and Ms. Giambra revealed that they had invented a fictional third co-founder, Keith Mann, to communicate with outside parties. The women had found that when emailing with people in the tech or startup worlds, pretending to be a man could elicit more respect and cooperation.
In 2019, their story was reported to be in development as a Netflix film called "Lady Business," starring Brie Larson.
"We just went with the person who offered us the most money," said Ms. Gazin, who invested some of the lump sum into Fashion Brand Company.
Ms. Gazin has been working for most of her life, starting as a teenager in Connecticut selling vintage clothes on eBay. The idea of not having enough money -- of feeling trapped financially -- always made her anxious. She enrolled in the California Institute of the Arts in Santa Clarita to study animation, but the prestigious program was expensive, and she dropped out to work in animation instead. Then she realized she just wanted to make art.
"I don't like working on other people's vision," said Ms. Gazin, whose grandfather was the author and artist Barnaby Conrad.
Ms. Gazin began building a following on Instagram, where her identity has evolved over the years: artist, dancer, comedian, drummer in a band called Slut Island, fashion designer. She has an idea for an animated TV show and is considering self-funding a pilot. Someday she may self-publish a graphic novel, "Sex House," that she worked on in 2020.
But none of these plans means stepping back from Fashion Brand Company. Ms. Giambra sees the company's next phase as "building out more of the FBC universe" with more weird art, videos and projects. "I'm going to make a robot Penelope in the next couple of months," Ms. Giambra said.
A sense of rebellion underlies the brand. Last year, after Fashion Brand Company began selling a dress bedazzled with the speech from Nicole Kidman's viral AMC Theatres ad ("We come to this place for magic"), AMC sent a cease-and-desist letter. She and Ms. Giambra pulled the design from the website and agreed to pay AMC the amount they made from the dresses sold.
Ms. Gazin then designed a new dress similarly bedazzled, but this time with a parody of the speech: "We arrive at this location for sorcery," it begins.
The Coven
In early February, Nimay Ndolo, an actress and influencer in New York, released two tops made in collaboration with Fashion Brand Company. Over the last year, she has worn the brand to industry parties and in TikTok videos with her mother, who liked the teeth sunglasses so much that she replaced the lenses with her own prescription.
"They have a tank that just says 'Soup,"' said Ms. Ndolo, 29. "Where's the logic? Where's the sense? But we don't want logic and sense. We want psychosis."
Wearing a Fashion Brand Company piece in public is a kind of siren call to fellow fashion weirdos. Ms. Ndolo referred to the fan base as a "disjointed coven" of people who are "welcoming and don't take themselves too seriously," she said. "It creates conversation, it creates community, it creates camaraderie."
Humor has been in fashion for at least a century -- Elsa Schiaparelli, who opened her atelier in 1927, became well known for her surrealist "little jokes," like gloves with claws on the fingertips, or a hat shaped like a lamb chop.
Today's celebrated jester-clothiers include men like Demna of Balenciaga, who designs handbags that look like Ikea totes, trash bags and cheap souvenirs, or Jonathan Anderson of Loewe, who adorns shoes with deflated balloons, patches of fake grass and heels shaped like bars of soap. But these designers operate within fashion's upper echelon, charging between $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 for their little jokes.
Ms. Gazin is more of a comedian for the everywoman, writhing around her dojo, indifferent to the mainstream fashion industry's seasonal schedule and show circuit. A tote bag resembling an old-timey bank robber's sack sells for $ 69; a shirtdress covered in long gloves, layered like fringe, is $ 448. The sizes are inclusive, offered up to 6X in some designs.
"It's hard to find silly, fun, joyful clothes that are plus size," said Carlee Rhodaback, 30, an office manager from Albany, Ore., who wears the color green every day. She owns about 20 pieces from Fashion Brand Company, including a busty milkmaid minidress made from an unusually thick cotton that, she said, "could stand up to a nuclear bomb."
Sara Camposarcone, a Toronto content creator with an acidic-maximalist sense of style, owns a beige sweater covered in pink nipples and yellow "Swiss cheese" pants punched with holes. She concedes that her outfits are not considered, by most people, realistic for everyday dressing. But these Fashion Brand Company pieces are among the most "wearable" in her closet, she said.
"You can wear those cheese pants with a button-down and a black boot," said Ms. Camposarcone, 27. "You can totally wear that to the office."

SHEFFIELD, England — As far as the man in the food truck is concerned, the patch of land he occupies in Sheffield, England, is about as humdrum as they come. To him, the spot — in the drab parking lot of a sprawling home improvement superstore, its facade plastered in lurid orange — is not exactly a place where history comes alive.
John Wilson, an academic at the University of Sheffield’s management school, looks at the same site and can barely contain his excitement. This, he said, is one of the places where the world’s most popular sport was born. He does not see a parking lot. He can see the history: the verdant grass, the sweating players, the cheering crowds.
His passion is sincere, absolute and shared by a small band of amateur historians and volunteer detectives devoted to restoring Sheffield — best known for steel, coal and as the setting for the film “The Full Monty” — to its rightful place as the undisputed birthplace of codified, organized, recognizable soccer.
For now, their attempts have mustered a walking tour of the city, conducted through a homemade app, and a few slightly weathered plaques. But Wilson and his compatriots have a bold vision of what their efforts might produce: a “digital museum” of Sheffield’s soccer history, a sculpture trail and — more than anything — a clear and prestigious identity for a city that has, in recent times, struggled just a little to define itself.
As they look to use the city’s past to shape its future, though, they do — Wilson warned — have a bit of a “tendency to go off on tangents.”
He is not wrong. In the half-hour walk to the parking lot, Wilson, 65, and two of his fellow enthusiasts, John Stocks, a 65-year-old retired English teacher and author, and John Clarke, a retired computer engineer who is 63, touched on a range of subjects that included — but was not limited to — social migration patterns in Victorian England, the Netflix series “The English Game” and the practice of topping walls with crozzle, a waste product from iron furnaces.
They discussed each digression with glee, eagerly diving every rabbit hole. Like many ardent hobbyists, they reveled in the detail as much as the sweep.
The picture they have in their minds, though, is clear.
“In the 1850s and ’60s, there were hundreds of teams, playing each other in competitive games, on pitches all over the city,” Stocks said. In studying Sheffield’s soccer legacy, he said, the past they have unearthed reveals the city as “the home of the first real football culture anywhere in the world.” That, they believe, might also be the key to its future.
But the title “Home of Football” — always capitalized and never “soccer” — is a contested one.
It is semiofficially applied to Wembley, the stadium in the endless gray expanse of northwest London that is the headquarters of both the English national team and the Football Association, the game’s governing body in England.
Visit England, the country’s tourist board, backs another contender. It describes Manchester as the “Home of Football,” on the grounds that it hosts two heavyweights of the Premier League and the National Football Museum. Manchester is also where the Football League — the sport’s first professional competition — was formed.
In comparison, Sheffield’s candidacy for the title is distinctly homespun. There is a brief précis of the city’s role in the game’s formation on the website of its tourist board, and an archive is on display in the “local studies” section of the city’s library.
“We’ve not been very good at promoting ourselves,” said Richard Caborn, a former lawmaker from the city and the minister for sport under Tony Blair’s Labour government. “We’ve never really positioned ourselves to exploit it.”
Sheffield Home of Football, an educational charity established by Wilson and his fellow travelers, has stepped into that void.
“We’ve been through the history and we have the documentation,” Caborn said. “This isn’t a claim. It’s evidence-based.”
Sheffield’s case is compelling. Sheffield FC, the world’s oldest club, was founded here. So, too, was Hallam FC, the world’s second-oldest. Hallam’s home, Sandygate, has been hosting soccer since 1860, longer than anywhere else. It was in Sheffield, too, that the rules of the game that would become soccer were first written down.
Stocks and his fellow “obsessives” — his word — draw the greatest satisfaction in finding the supporting evidence. It is painstaking work, trawling through both digital and physical archives, but worth it, he said.
“There are some of us who will stay up all night chasing down a lead they’ve found,” he said. “I’m not quite as bad as that, but I do devote quite a lot of time to it. I have quite a few other projects I’m supposed to be getting on with, but the reality is that most of the time, I’m doing this.”
Because of their work, Sheffield can now, with a reasonable degree of confidence, claim to be home to the first derby match in world soccer — the meeting of city rivals Sheffield FC and Hallam on the site of the home improvement store’s parking lot — as well as the first corner kick, the first use of the crossbar and the first match report.
Stocks has also tracked down a suggestion that passing was invented in Sheffield — not in Scotland, as is widely believed. There are accounts of what sounds an awful lot like professionalism. “We think there’s a chance the first German team was founded here, too,” Wilson said.
Part of the thrill, they admit, is correcting some of the inaccuracies in what they call soccer’s “folk history.” Their driving force, though, is the sense that their discoveries can define not only what Sheffield was, but what it might yet be.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Sheffield was hit hard by the decline of Britain’s heavy industries; even harder than much of the rest of northern England, Wilson said.
Built on steel and coal, the city was run for years by a left-leaning council that was a gleeful thorn in the side of successive British governments. “They called it the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire,” he said. As the factories and mines shuttered, Sheffield struggled both for investment and identity.
The various modern conceptions of Sheffield have not yielded a new one. The backdrop for the film “Brassed Off,” as well as “The Full Monty,” and home to Pulp and the Arctic Monkeys, two of the defining British bands of the last quarter-century, the city also developed a reputation for advanced manufacturing. It is where, every year, the world snooker championship is held.
Nothing, though, has ever quite settled. “The council are leaning into music quite heavily now,” Stocks said. “But it won’t stick. We’re not Liverpool. We’re not London. We’re not Glasgow.”
Soccer, though, is different. To him and the others, Sheffield’s role in shaping the most popular sport in the world should be its calling card, its claim to fame — not to attract tourists necessarily, but so it can find its place in the world, can define its sense of self.
“Most people here only have a vague awareness of some of it,” Wilson said. “They don’t know we have this unique identity, that this is something we gave to the world. No other city can say that.”

Paramount Lays Off Hundreds Of Workers in Pivot From TV: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The company, which is moving away from traditional TV, lost more than $ 1 billion last year at its streaming division.
Paramount, the owner of TV networks like Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central, is laying off hundreds of employees, cutting costs as it continues its painful transition away from traditional television.
About 3 percent of the company's roughly 24,500 employees will be affected by the layoffs, according to a person familiar with the cuts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive corporate information.
Bob Bakish, Paramount's chief executive, said in a memo to employees that the cuts were part of a bid to "return the company to earnings growth."
"While I realize these changes are in no way easy, as I said last month, I am confident this is the right decision for our future," Mr. Bakish wrote. "These adjustments will help enable us to build on our momentum and execute our strategic vision for the year ahead -- and I firmly believe we have much to be excited about."
Paramount is at a crossroads. The company's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, is considering selling her stake in the company, a deal that could bring decades of family ownership to an end. Skydance, the media company that helped produce Paramount franchises like "Top Gun" and "Mission: Impossible," has expressed interest, but no deal has yet materialized.
Like all its peers in traditional media, Paramount has struggled to keep pace with Netflix as streaming services supplant traditional TV and moviegoing. The company's biggest streaming service, Paramount+, has not yet become profitable, putting a drag on the company's profits. Paramount's streaming division, which also includes the ad-supported service Pluto TV, lost more than $ 1 billion last year.
Though viewership of Paramount's cable networks is in decline, parts of its TV business remain resilient. Paramount's CBS network, which broadcast the Super Bowl on Sunday, generated record ratings for the game, which saw the Kansas City Chiefs defeat the San Francisco 49ers in overtime. About 123.4 million people watched the game, according to Nielsen, up from 115.1 million the year before.

Smoke Fades, but a Nudge Endures: [Style Desk]

Full text: Thoughts on the coolest boy in Ontario.
Our elementary school was set deep in the rural Ontario countryside, nestled in the forest beside the local dump. In the late 1990s, when I was in sixth grade, the school had a drug bust in which more than 20 kids were suspended and charged with possession of marijuana, magic mushrooms and ecstasy. I was not one of those kids.
I was a shy, self-conscious, straight-A student who had never been in anything resembling trouble. At recess, a year later, I didn't make the choice to get into trouble that day, either. My fearless, if inconsiderate, friend Ashley did that for us both.
She had been invited to smoke cigarettes in the trees on the far side of the running track. The invitation came from Kyle, a charming ringleader who looked like Justin Timberlake and dressed like Kurt Cobain. He was effortlessly the coolest boy in school. Kyle had also been one of the drug-bust kids, but somehow teachers still loved him. His cool factor worked on them, too.
Ashley was stoked but didn't want to show up alone. So she recruited me -- a loyal follower -- without letting me in on the full plan. She was right to lie. I would have certainly wussed out if she had told me we were going to smoke (!) on school property (!) with Kyle (?!). Insanity.
Recess came. Ashley and I made our way across the track, toward the forest. We heard a voice calling out to us and quickly ducked into the trees.
We found Kyle leaning against a tree, lighting a cigarette. Beside him was another boy -- Jimmy -- a rough kid from a poor family who had recently been embraced by the cool crowd, if momentarily. He had also been part of the drug bust, but teachers didn't afford him the same grace that they did Kyle.
I knew Jimmy because he was on my bus, not that we had much of a relationship. I'd mostly seen him launch spitballs and gladly punch whoever was willing to fight back. We awkwardly greeted each other, and I tried to hide the heart attack I was having at the whole situation.
Kyle offered us a cigarette. Without a moment's hesitation, Ashley took it and casually inhaled. This was her first cigarette, too, but she was built for moments like this.
She passed it to me. I tried to steady my shaking hand. Kyle winked at me, saying: "Just try it. Maybe you'll like it."
I took the world's tiniest puff. Not bad, I thought. Then I got cocky and took a real drag. It was like I had sucked an entire smoke bomb into my mouth through a straw. Immediately, I succumbed to a cartoonish coughing fit.
They all laughed, and my embarrassment was interrupted by a worse horror: The teacher monitoring recess had spotted us in the trees and was yelling for us to come out.
The boys took off in one direction and Ashley pulled me in another. We ran as fast as we could, clear around the building, into the school's back entrance and down the hallway into the girls' washroom.
I frantically tried to wash the cigarette stench off my hands, positive I reeked of smoke and guilt. Ashley was ecstatic: "Wasn't that awesome?"
We went back to class ... and nothing happened. Just as I allowed myself to think we had gotten away with it and started wondering why I haven't done more bad things, the school PA system came on. All four of us were called to the principal's office.
I had my second heart attack and resolved never to speak to Ashley again. As the four of us made our way down the hall, Jimmy looked at me coldly. "Don't tell them nothing," he said.
At the office, we were separated.
"What were you doing in the trees?" the vice principal asked me.
Terrified, I answered, "Nothing!"
Waiting to hear what the punishment would be, I contemplated throwing everyone else under the bus. But then the principal ducked her head into the room and told me I could go. Why? Because Kyle had taken the fall. He said he had called us into the trees -- it was all his fault -- and so the rest of us were free to go.
Thankfully, they hadn't figured out that we had been smoking on school property, just that we were hanging out where we weren't supposed to be. So Kyle wasn't suspended. His punishment was to miss the next day's dance.
Our school dances took place every few months during the school day and featured a mix of requests and songs that were clearly the favorites of the D.J., a substitute teacher, Mr. Grant. "Cotton Eye Joe" would segue into the "Macarena," followed by "Smells Like Teen Spirit." Then it was time for my favorite part, the "snowball" slow dance, during which we were supposed to switch partners every 30 seconds.
Before the dance, I would write in my diary a list of at least 10 boys I wanted to dance with during the snowball. The next day, I would meticulously recap each boy I had danced with and use that as crush fuel until the next time. The fact that none of these boys reciprocated my feelings was entirely irrelevant.
For this year's slow dance, Bon Jovi's "Always," a six-minute power ballad, was blasting out of the speakers. Ashley ignored the change-partners rule and stayed with Jimmy for the whole song. I think it might have been the happiest six minutes of his life.
The only person I wanted to slow-dance with wasn't there. I went by the office and waved to Kyle from the hall as "Always" echoed from the gym. He winked and waved back.
After that, I went back to being a rule follower. Ashley dated Jimmy for a while, before dumping him for another boy, also named Jimmy. After eighth grade, the original Jimmy dropped out, and neither of us saw him again.
Kyle continued to date the prettiest girls in school. He became the frontman of a local rock band. At 18, he died in a car accident when his girlfriend lost control of her S.U.V. on a winter night.
I don't know why Kyle took the fall for us. Maybe he thought he had the least to lose -- which strikes me now as a horrible irony. But I've come to realize he was a very rare combination of cool and kind, someone who thought everyone deserved to be as popular as he was.
I never smoked another cigarette, but I've broken my share of rules since then. In those moments I often think of Kyle's gentle push to a shy girl who needed one: "Just try it. Maybe you'll like it."

CBS Faces Challenges As It Awaits Super Bowl: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The storied network is facing a wave of change, including new leadership, the possible sale of its parent company and the continued challenge of streaming.
On the one hand, Sunday will be a joyous occasion for CBS Sports. The sports division will broadcast its 22nd Super Bowl, the most of any network. The game is guaranteed to be the most-watched event in television this year, and it will generate hundreds of millions in advertising revenue and provide a huge promotional platform for CBS and its parent company, Paramount.
On the other hand, there's everything else.
The storied CBS Sports division, the broadcasting home of marquee events like the Masters and March Madness, is confronting a wave of change. Its longtime chairman, Sean McManus, is departing in April. The division has lost the rights to one of its signature properties, Southeastern Conference college football games. Deep-pocketed tech giants are getting aggressive about live sports programming, with companies like Amazon (N.F.L. football on Thursday nights) and Netflix (W.W.E. wrestling) entering the field. And Paramount is widely considered an acquisition target, with a number of suitors circling the company.
It all leaves CBS Sports facing a number of challenges -- which company leaders say they can handle by sticking to what they know.
"No matter what happens in the future to the company, sports will increasingly be more important each and every year," Mr. McManus said.
CBS Sports has long been one of the elite players in American broadcasting. Its understated coverage, narrated over the decades by broadcast booth legends like Pat Summerall, John Madden, Verne Lundquist and Jim Nantz, has stood in stark contrast to rowdier competitors like ESPN and Fox. CBS has televised golf's Masters tournament with limited commercial interruption and stately hushed tones going back to the 1950s.
And CBS has plenty of major sporting events in its foreseeable future. The network's N.F.L. rights are locked up through 2033, for about $ 2 billion a year. The rights to the men's college basketball tournament are tied up for another eight years, for around $ 750 million a year. And many PGA Tour events are signed through 2030 for hundreds of millions annually.
That's because even as traditional television ratings are plummeting and more people migrate to streaming, live sporting events still thrive on broadcast networks. Recent N.F.L. playoff games on CBS set ratings records.
"No matter how many changes are taking place, or are on the horizon, football on broadcast television, and especially the N.F.L., is the one entity that exists above and beyond all that," said Bob Costas, the sports broadcasting eminence.
Even if the network sports divisions have to make adjustments, "not much of it has to do with the N.F.L.," Mr. Costas said. "All they have to do is keep ponying up the money for the rights."
Still, nearly every media company is confronting soaring sports rights fees while trying to juggle challenges. Those include cord cutting, diminishing advertising revenue and streaming businesses that are bleeding cash. Three companies -- Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox -- announced on Tuesday that they would jointly begin a new sports streaming service this year, to better control their fate in a changing world. Paramount, however, will not be part of that service.
Like other media companies, Paramount, which also owns cable networks like Nickelodeon and MTV, has been hurt by cable television's decline. According to financial filings, Paramount has committed to more than $ 30 billion in future payments, the vast majority for sports rights. That is more than what the stock market says Paramount is worth. The company's streaming service, Paramount+, lost hundreds of millions of dollars last year, and several analysts are skeptical whether it will even exist in its present form in a few years.
A number of suitors -- including Skydance and Warner Bros. Discovery -- have expressed interest in Paramount's media business.
Over the last 18 months, a number of senior executives have departed the company. Mr. McManus, the leader of the sports division for 27 years, will be replaced by a longtime lieutenant, David Berson, after his retirement in April.
Both men described the transition as smooth (CBS's president, George Cheeks, referred to it as "a master class in succession planning"), and emphasized that the division would stick with what it did best: acquiring desirable sports rights, and producing strong broadcasts.
"The relationships that we have with these various leagues are deep and storied, and there's a tremendous comfort level and trust factor there that we will put on the best presentation," Mr. Berson said.
Yet CBS has faced some challenges even on that front. For more than two decades, CBS aired SEC college football games on Saturdays, regularly a top-rated event. CBS had been paying $ 55 million a year for the rights.
But this year, ESPN will take over the broadcasts of SEC games, paying $ 300 million a year to do so. To make up for the loss, CBS acquired the rights for Big Ten games, but for a steeper price (around $ 350 million a year) and for a league that has been weaker overall in recent years, though it has added several prominent sports-rich universities from the West Coast.
"I think there's a good chance that there's going to be enormous growth in the Big Ten, both on the field and in the television universe," Mr. McManus said.
Mr. Berson underscored the division's ability to innovate with sports productions. He pointed to the fact that the Super Bowl would be simulcast on Nickelodeon in a broadcast tailored to children and families.
"We really do believe that it's cultivating a next generation of fans and doing it in a really fun way that is additive to the audience," he said.
Though CBS has locked up major deals into the early 2030s, tech companies like Amazon, Netflix and Apple have begun their march into streaming live sporting events. Amazon now streams "Thursday Night Football," Netflix has picked up the rights to W.W.E.'s weekly flagship "Raw" broadcast for $ 5 billion over the next 10 years, and Apple bought the rights to show Major League Soccer around the world. A longtime rival, NBC Sports, also recently successfully streamed an N.F.L. playoff game on Peacock.
It all adds up to a vastly changing sports media landscape.
"They may indeed be competitors in the future," Mr. McManus said of the tech companies. "Our deals are, generally speaking, throughout this decade, if not longer. We'll look at them and do our research. And if they become competitors, so far we've been successful in keeping the properties we wanted to.
"So, you know, tough to predict the future, but I feel good about our position."

Hollywood Made 14% Fewer Shows in 2023, Signaling the End of Peak TV: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The decline is the most definitive evidence of a slowdown in new programming that has been predicted for at least a year.
It's official: Peak TV has peaked.
Last year, 516 scripted television series aired or streamed in the United States, a 14 percent decline from 2022, the FX cable network said on Friday. That was only the second drop in at least 15 years, and the biggest, according to FX's research.
The total is the most definitive evidence of a slowdown that executives have been predicting for at least a year. Television's rise -- in both the number of shows and the quality of programming -- brought it to the forefront of American culture over the last decade.
But orders for shows by the major studios started to drop precipitously in the middle of 2022, around the time that Wall Street soured on entertainment companies' spend-at-any-cost strategy to make new series.
Last year's strikes by screenwriters and actors -- the first time both unions walked out at the same time since 1960, effectively shutting down scripted production for months -- also slowed down the release of new shows. The strikes wiped out the entire fall lineup for scripted network TV, and the fallout is likely to be felt throughout 2024.
The 516 total was the lowest since a decline in 2020, when the pandemic disrupted productions and television lineups globally. Still, even with the decline, last year's figure ranked as the fourth highest since FX started keeping records (2022, 2021 and 2019 had more), providing viewers with plenty of options but continuing to potentially overwhelm them as well.
In 2009, all of 210 scripted shows aired on network and cable television in the United States, a small increase from years at the beginning of the decade, according to FX.
That number steadily rose over the next few years, and then sharply after Netflix began making original series in 2012. By 2015, there were 422 scripted shows. That prompted John Landgraf, an FX executive, to coin the term "Peak TV," which industry insiders quickly adopted to describe the streaming television era.
In 2022, there were 600 scripted shows (an increase from an earlier estimate of 599), which is expected to be the high-water mark.
In addition to the fact that virtually every studio has slowed investment in making new television shows, several media companies do not invest in scripted series anymore. Quibi came and went. Google and Facebook aggressively invested in traditional scripted television about five years ago, but both have effectively stopped. The broadcast networks are making fewer scripted shows, as are many cable networks like USA, TBS and Comedy Central.
Executives believe that the number of shows will continue to decline this year.

Between Friends, an Endless Barrage of Jokes: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Delivering a deluge of hard jokes, this double act aims directly for the nostalgic pleasure centers of their fans.
To hear them tell it, the origin story of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, one of our greatest comedy duos, hinges on a moment in 1994 on tour with Second City in Waco, Texas, when they met an Australian woman wearing a sling who spoke "lovingly" about the return of the dead cult leader David Koresh.
The comedians turned to each other and mouthed in unison: "Let's get out of here," in coarser language.
"I knew I had a partner for life," Poehler said with feeling on their new Restless Leg Tour, which has set up shop at the Beacon Theater in New York through Feb 18. "And I knew," Fey added in a drier, deeper register, "that we would be very evenly matched work friends."
The comedy double act has been making a comeback. Chris Rock and Kevin Hart just released a documentary about touring together, which ends with them onstage riffing off each other. Jim Gaffigan and Jerry Seinfeld have joined forces. But it was Steve Martin and Martin Short who kicked off this trend, with a long-running live show in which their love for each other comes through in bruising insult comedy.
Poehler and Fey mount a similarly punchy, warmly hilarious variety act that aims directly for the nostalgic pleasure centers of their fans. When Fey asks if there are dads in the crowd who had either of the comics as hall passes two decades ago, many hands shoot up. If the phrase "mom jeans" makes you instantly crack up, you will love this show. Whereas Short and Martin built a roasting antagonistic relationship, this is a more affectionate and fleshed-out portrait of friendship, a study in contrasts (the musical "Wicked" is referenced more than once). Fey is all sharp edges and slashing wit, her deadpan unshakable, keeping the audience and her partner at a distance. Poehler is more vulnerable, even a bit fragile, discussing kids, trauma or aging. "My memory is like a cat: It will not come when called."
The show itself is a throw-everything-at-the-wall mess, a visually indifferent collection of parts, some that probably would have been cut or honed by a ruthless director. The stars begin in gowns and end in pajamas; they perform sharp, award show-style monologues, a freewheeling question-and-answer session and some disappointing improv, which is swallowed up in the vast theater.
It almost feels like a callback to one of the funniest lines of the night. "What long-form improv and short-form improv have in common," Fey says in a pedagogical cadence, "is that no one cares. Like jazz or sneezing, it's a lot more fun to do than to watch."
It's a great joke, unsentimental, concise, its misdirection established with the patience of a pro. But what truly makes it a Tina Fey production is including "sneezing." No one could see that coming, and the more you think on it, the funnier it is.
It's one of many moments that will remind fans how much they have missed seeing these two -- not just as producers or writers, but also as complementary performers who played off each other brilliantly on "Saturday Night Live," in the original "Mean Girls" and most relevant to this live show, while hosting the Golden Globes, which set a standard for awards ceremonies that hasn't been beaten.
The heart of this variety act, what glues all the pieces together even more than their dynamic, is the deluge of hard jokes. As you would expect from the creator of "30 Rock" (Fey) and an executive producer of "Difficult People" (Poehler), the punchlines arrive at a steady clip.
There are sex jokes and mom jokes, jokes written the day of the show about President Biden making an appearance on the Upper West Side ("The traffic hasn't been this bad since the opening scene of 'Fame"') and others that are evergreen. There are subtle and broad ones, some delivered in deadpan, others sung.
There's an OK Donald Trump joke that receives a big response and a strong O.C.D. punchline that doesn't. There were jokes that only New Yorkers will get ("I took the 4 train and I didn't even have a doctor's appointment") and a jab at their former employer that might make some people queasy. "This really feels just like S.N.L.," Fey said. "Except that we will be in bed by 10. And I don't have to go to a weird Tuesday night dinner with Lorne Michaels and Rudy Giuliani."
They even reboot "Weekend Update," with a special guest (When I saw it, it was Fred Armisen, doing the "accents across America" conceit from his last Netflix special) and a spectacular physical bit on video by John Lutz that could be called a sequel to Chris Farley's Chippendales audition sketch opposite Patrick Swayze.
In front of images of "Barbie," Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, Poehler dryly comments: "Well, it's official: Women have money and go to things." Poking fun at the absurdity of the controversy over the Oscars snubs involving "Barbie," she adds: "When asked to comment, Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig said they couldn't hear 'under a giant pile of money."'
Perhaps the most revealing segment is when they say they are trying stand-up comedy for the first time. It may seem the same as their work as mock news anchors or award-show style hosts, but each mode has its own rhythm, and stand-up at least offers the opportunity to speak in a way that's closer to your own voice.
Fey chooses to do so by spoofing others in an explosively funny set about, among other things, her history of menstruation as if she were a macho, stage-prowling comic. She makes "transvaginal ultrasound" seem dirty. Poehler's jokes are more hit and miss, with some bland ones about generational differences. (You believe her when she says she is spending a lot of time on TikTok.) And yet, whereas Fey is cagey, hiding behind satire, Poehler's best material is closer to the bone. She takes the assignment seriously, trying to be real and open.
This contrast continues in the final section when they answer questions from the audience. Fey keeps it light, while Poehler can be quick on her feet as she digs into the pain of trying to get your teenage son to talk to you. In a poignant and funny riff, she likens that effort to ingratiating herself on dates by pretending not to know obvious things. She says she acted surprised, for example, when her son told her Led Zeppelin has some great songs.
Their interests tend to clash. Fey loves Halloween while Poehler has no use for it. Poehler says they have very different taste in men though they agree on young John Travolta and Johnny Knoxville. And when it comes to whom they would want as celebrity parents, Fey says she has a controversial and topical answer and picks Martin Short and Meryl Streep. (They are rumored to be dating, but Short has said they are just friends.)
Poehler picks Barbra Streisand and Patti LuPone. "I feel like I would be so mothered and bossed around," she says. "My dream."

Lover, Stalker, Killer: [Review]

Full text: This documentary directed by Sam Hobkinson focuses on a jump back into the dating pool that soon turns horrific.
True-crime doc watchers who are in committed relationships may see "Lover, Stalker, Killer," a bracing account of a lurid series of misdeeds directed by Sam Hobkinson, and breathe a sigh of relief over being out of the dating pool.
It begins in 2012, when Dave Kroupa, an auto mechanic in Omaha, was rebounding from a breakup. He finds himself at 35, single and ready to mingle. On a dating app he meets Liz Golyar (likes bowling, enjoys giving the finger to video cameras, as per the archival footage) and then, believing their relationship to be nonexclusive, also takes up with one Cari Farver.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Soon into the liaison, Farver starts freaking out. Dave is pelted with nasty texts and emails -- the screen fills with vulgar words and threats and the soundtrack becomes awash in digital glitches. The violence soon escapes the virtual: Golyar's house burns down.
As the litany of harassment unfolds, Farver has yet to be seen. The puzzle here might have been solved by the application of Occam's razor, had all the variables been known at the time. Even so, the twists include a few that even the keenest of armchair sleuths would not have guessed.
The filmmakers indulge in some legerdemain, having the real-life participants recount the events as if certain facts were not already in the open at the time of the interviews. The movie also contains staged footage, including arguably cheesy Midwest-law-enforcement world building: Two detectives who help break the case are introduced while killing time in a pool hall. By now these are accepted conventions, so there's little point in complaining, especially when the end result is so brisk, in a tight 90 minutes.
Lover, Stalker, Killer
Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

After Super Bowl, Still Luring Viewers: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The TV network that airs the N.F.L. title game wants to retain as many viewers as possible. There are various strategies, with CBS choosing to debut the crime drama "Tracker."
Some of the most precious television real estate comes immediately after the National Football League's season finale, one of the few programs to still corral a giant audience.
The network that airs the Super Bowl wants to retain as many of those viewers -- 115 million people last year -- as possible with the postgame slot. It has been a powerful tool to debut new shows, as CBS will do on Sunday with "Tracker," a crime drama about the hunt for missing people that stars Justin Hartley, and it has also showcased already popular ones, such as NBC did in 1996 with "Friends."
Either strategy can prove effective.
"It's really a year-by-year basis when you have the Super Bowl and to think, 'What are the different weapons you have to deploy?"' said Amy Reisenbach, the president of CBS Entertainment.
New Shows
For nearly two decades, the Super Bowl has cycled among Fox, NBC and CBS. (In 2027, ABC will air its first Super Bowl since 2006.) "There isn't really any other platform like it on TV," Reisenbach said, adding, "It's a huge opportunity to get eyeballs."
Networks plan out the postgame slot about a year ahead of time, said Dan Harrison, the executive vice president of program planning and content strategy at Fox Entertainment.
CBS chose "Tracker" in May, Reisenbach said, after executives viewed the pilot episode and felt it could appeal across demographics because of Hartley's popularity with both men and women. The decision to debut a new show follows the strategy CBS used for "Undercover Boss" (2010) and for its two most recent Super Bowl lead-outs, "The World's Best" (2019) and "The Equalizer" (2021).
The results varied. "The World's Best" garnered 22.2 million viewers and was not renewed for a second season. "Undercover Boss" amassed nearly 39 million viewers and ran for 11 seasons.
Returning Shows
Fox has more recently used its post-Super Bowl slot to highlight shows that have a built-in audience. Last year, it debuted the second season of the Gordon Ramsay cooking show "Next Level Chef"; in 2020 it opened the third season of "The Masked Singer."
"You want to make sure that you're comfortable serving viewers something that they already know that they like and something that advertisers want to be in," said Harrison, who previously worked for CBS and NBC. "That single episode will be the highest-rated entertainment telecast of the year."
Even though the first episode of "The Equalizer" drew 20.4 million viewers after the Super Bowl in 2021, CBS still chose to use this year's spot for "Tracker." The network will debut the fourth season of "The Equalizer," along with much of its returning lineup, in the week after the game.
CBS kicked off new seasons of the reality show "Survivor" in 2001 and 2004, and NBC aired a special one-hour episode of the hit sitcom "The Office" in 2009.
But NBC's placement of "Friends" after the Super Bowl in 1996 is perhaps the most successful use of this strategy. The network elongated that episode to an hour and packed it with major guest stars like Julia Roberts and Brooke Shields. Almost 53 million viewers tuned in, the highest-rated post-Super Bowl show ever.
"They made an event of a show that was already big, which was amazing and it just supercharged it," said Andrew Goldman, an adjunct instructor at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and a former HBO executive.
NBC declined to comment.
Nontraditional Programs
While networks typically want to capture as broad of an audience as possible after the Super Bowl, sometimes they take risks.
In 1999, Fox debuted the adult animation show "Family Guy," which was canceled after its third season for poor ratings before being rejuvenated on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming, and then bouncing back to Fox, where its run continues.
In 2022, an overlap of global sporting events allowed NBC to air the Winter Olympics in Beijing directly after the Super Bowl. That Olympics broadcast received 21.2 million viewers, but Goldman thinks that decision was unwise.
"When there's an opportunity to introduce people to a new creative, you should do it to create a collective zeitgeist," Goldman said. "People the next day will talk about, 'Hey did you see the Super Bowl,' and then, 'Hey, did you see that new show?"'
Even platforms without N.F.L. television rights have tried to capitalize on the interest around the Super Bowl. In 2018, Netflix aired an ad during the game for the previously unannounced science fiction film "The Cloverfield Paradox," which it released for streaming after the Lombardi Trophy was lifted.

Full text: The typical star biography avoids warts. But there are films that combine critical takes with a better understanding of their subjects' cultural import.
Pop open the "documentaries" section of your friendly local streaming service, and a bevy of movies about celebrities will greet you. Rockers, politicians, artists, authors, athletes -- increasingly everyone you've heard of has a documentary, and probably served as a producer on it, too. The appeal of such films is obvious: If you like someone already, you get to hear them talk about themselves. If you know you should like someone, then you've got a quick introduction to set you on your way to fandom.
That's the appeal of two documentaries released this week, "The Greatest Night in Pop" (Netflix) and "Dario Argento Panico" (Shudder). The first is a lighthearted look at the recording of "We Are the World," full of archival footage from the actual recording in 1985 and reminiscences by figures like Bruce Springsteen and Lionel Richie. The movie sidesteps any real contemplation of the song itself or its cultural import, but if you want to hear famous people talk about a real weird night, then you won't be disappointed. (Here's our critic's review.) Similarly, "Dario Argento Panico" functions best as a primer on the Italian horror master (director, most famously, of "Suspiria"), supplemented by commentary from figures like the director Guillermo del Toro; it's not breaking any ground, but you'll learn a thing or two. (Here's our review.)
Watching these films got me thinking about celebrity-focused documentaries that go above and beyond the usual fare. The best of these movies tend to do more than tell us about the subject -- they tell us what the subject means, in a cultural sense. Celebrities, after all, are not just people. They're products, packaged for us to consume in some manner, and their stories say something about the world writ large.
There are plenty of examples in the history of nonfiction film, but as celebrities, and their teams of publicists and managers, have increased control over their images, it's rarer and rarer to find a documentary that feels as if it's more revealing than concealing. One enjoyable recent example is "Judy Blume Forever" (Prime Video), which locates the YA author's importance in, among other things, her fearless attitude toward censorship and book banning.
One of the best recent films in this genre is "Listening to Kenny G" (Max), which weaves together interviews with the smooth jazz saxophonist and discussions with fans, haters and critics to consider what his popularity really means -- and, more broadly, why we like art in the first place.
And then there's the Oscar-winning "Summer of Soul" (Hulu, Disney+ and major platforms), a real banger of a concert film that uses archival footage and commentary not only to revisit a series of epochal Harlem concerts from 1969, but also to examine their wide-ranging importance to the story of race in America.
With these movies, you get more than a recounting of events or a person's life -- you get a broader perspective on the world around you. And that's one of the best tasks movies like these can accomplish.

Platoonmates Killed in Jordan Saw Army Service as a Life Ladder

At a dusty military base in northeastern Jordan, Spc. Kennedy Sanders drove bulldozers and road graders. When she had free time, she liked to spend it knitting or feeding her sneaker-head habit by shopping online for rare pairs of Nike Dunks that she would make her mother unbox for her over FaceTime.
She spent a lot of hours joking and hanging out with her friend and platoonmate in their Army Reserve engineer unit, Spc. Breonna Moffett, who slept in a nearby rack and was hoping to celebrate returning home this summer by attending a Nicki Minaj concert.
The two were killed Sunday, along with another soldier in their unit, Sgt. William Jerome Rivers, in what the Pentagon said was a drone attack by an Iranian-backed militia.
Both specialists were heavy-equipment operators doing a tough job in a hostile region. They were also young Black women from Georgia who loved hip-hop, laughing with friends and the Army. And they were representative of the type of Americans who increasingly serve in the military these days.
Black women account for about 36% of all enlisted women in the Army, compared with just 14% of the civilian female population, and they have an outsize presence in the highest enlisted ranks: More than half of the Army’s female sergeant majors are Black.
“You think of the military, most people think of men, but in fact African American women are heavily overrepresented,” said Brenda Moore, a professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Buffalo who has studied the trend for decades.
The reasons are simple, she said. The Army was one of the first large employers to strip structural racism from its organization. Though other forms of racism persisted, the military in the civil rights era was one of the few places where Black women could find open doors and equal opportunity. Military service comes with benefits that can be rare in civilian blue-collar jobs, and recruits do not need to know someone or have a degree to be hired.
“The Army was seen as a good deal,” Moore said. “You could make something of yourself, provide for your family and do something honorable.”
Today, women like Sanders and Moffett fill the often overlooked ranks of supply, logistics and medical jobs that support combat units.
Moffett, 23, of Savannah, Georgia, enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2019 right after high school and was soon learning to drive construction equipment like bulldozers and road graders. She was the second woman in her family to join the Army. Her mother served, too.
It’s “basically a family tradition,” said Dereima Weaver, a friend since middle school.
Weaver said her friend was happy to have joined up. “She loved the adventure, and she loved the service,” she said.
In between her Army Reserve commitments, Moffett worked as a civilian home care provider for people with disabilities. The Savannah regional director of United Cerebral Palsy of Georgia, Sharon Mitchell, described Moffett in a statement as “a deeply passionate advocate for the people we support.”
Her platoonmate Sanders, 24, came from Waycross, a town in the southeastern part of the state where the median household income is half the national average. Her longtime friend Bre Etheridge said in an interview that it was the kind of place where “some people get stuck and they can’t leave.”
“Others, if they’re motivated and want to do big things with their lives, like Kennedy, they go to college or join the service,” she said.
Sanders grew up on a street full of boys and with several brothers, and learned fast to keep up while playing football and basketball. In high school, she lettered in three sports. She tried college but didn’t finish; back in Waycross again, she worked at a series of low-paying jobs, including as an assistant at the pharmacy in the city’s small downtown.
One of her best friends had joined the Marines and was learning to be a radiology technician; after talking to her, Sanders decided to enlist in the Army. Soon she had health care coverage, retirement benefits and a marketable skill, and was earning education benefits to pay for another try at college.
“It was an adventure for her, too,” her mother, Oneida Oliver-Sanders, said in an interview.
“She was making lifelong friends, getting promoted. She loved it.”
Sanders was so proud of her service that she went in uniform to visit schools and talk to students in Waycross.
“It meant a lot to her,” her mother said. “She wanted the kids to see that they had this opportunity, too.”
She said her daughter had found a kindred spirit in Moffett. Neither of them, Oliver-Sanders said, gave much thought to ending up in harm’s way.
When they deployed in August, they initially were told they might go to Syria, where the United States has about 900 troops. Sanders was apprehensive. But they learned they would be sent instead to Tower 22, a small base in Jordan near the Syrian border, which sounded safer.
At the base, Oliver-Sanders said, her daughter’s life seemed routine and quiet. A few attempted drone attacks on the base came up in phone conversations, she said, but mostly they talked about their favorite shows on Netflix or the latest pair of sneakers to add to Sanders’ collection.
Her enlistment was almost up, and she was thinking about her future. Deploying to a remote patch of desert with occasional drone strikes might have turned some people off. But Saturday, when her mother last spoke to her, Sanders said she had decided to reenlist in the Army.

Apple's Vision Pro May Blow Your Mind, and Your Budget: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The new headset teaches a valuable lesson about the cost of tech products: The upsells and add-ons will get you.
When Apple unveiled the Vision Pro virtual reality goggles last year at a technology conference, many in the audience gasped at the price: $ 3,500. That's more than quadruple the cost of a new iPhone and 14 times the cost of a competing headset from Meta.
The headset, which Apple has marketed as a computer, movie player and gaming machine, will arrive in stores on Friday. Ahead of its release, the discussion has focused on its price: Many have wondered why people would pay so much to do what they could already do with their computers, TVs and game consoles.
Yet the true cost of owning the Vision Pro is probably even higher. Try $ 4,600. That's because the price shoots up with the add-ons and accessories that many people would want to buy, including:
Apple's $ 200 carrying case to protect the Vision Pro on the go.
A pair of earphones, such as Apple's $ 180 AirPods, to listen to music privately.
A spare $ 200 battery pack to get more use from the headset (because with only two hours of battery life, the headset won't last long enough to play a feature-length movie).
$ 100 prescription lens inserts for those who use glasses.
A spare $ 200 cushion to make the goggles fit another member of the family.
An additional $ 200 for the larger data storage option (512 gigabytes instead of the 256 gigs on the base model) to hold more videos and apps on the device.
And those are just the extras that many consider must-haves. Other options, including Apple's $ 500 extended warranty coverage, a $ 70 video game controller and a very uncool $ 50 battery holder to clip onto your pants, could drive the price well above $ 5,000 -- before tax.
While I have your attention with these breathtaking numbers, we can all learn a valuable lesson from the Vision Pro about "phantom costs," the add-ons that significantly inflate the amount we spend. For electronics, including smartphones, computers and virtual reality headsets, they can include cases and charging gadgets.
A clear grasp of the true cost of tech ownership is crucial for any consumers trying to stay in control of their budget, said Ramit Sethi, a personal finance adviser. He said he had learned about phantom costs when he bought a Honda Accord about 20 years ago. He initially thought he was spending $ 350 a month on the car, to pay off his loan. The true cost ended up $ 1,000 a month after he added up maintenance, insurance, gas, parking and tolls.
"Companies count on you not being able to run the math," said Mr. Sethi, who hosts a podcast on money psychology. "The bigger the purchase, the more money you invisibly spend."
These lessons apply to any tech products we regularly use, not just Apple hardware. Let's run through the phantom costs of a Windows computer and a Samsung phone.
Windows Computer
Microsoft sells its Surface Laptop 5 at a starting retail price of $ 1,000. But after some extras are added in the Microsoft store, it's more realistically a $ 1,950 laptop -- nearly double the sticker price.
The extras include:
$ 500 for more memory.
A pair of earphones, such as Microsoft's $ 250 headphones.
$ 200 for the Microsoft dock that charges the laptop and connects it to an external display.
Here, the biggest phantom cost is memory, which is important for helping the computer smoothly run multiple apps at the same time. Typically, computer makers sell their base models with a modest amount of memory that isn't likely to be enough to keep the computer running fast for many years, so it's wise to buy the model with extra memory.
The $ 1,000 base model of the Surface Laptop 5 comes with only eight gigabytes of memory, but most people are likely to need double that to smoothly run the latest Windows operating system and new apps and games. The model that includes 16 gigabytes costs an extra $ 500.
Samsung Phone
Samsung's new high-end smartphone, the Galaxy S24 Ultra, has a starting price of $ 1,300. But it's more realistically a $ 1,540 phone.
In the last five years, many smartphone makers, including Apple, Google and Samsung, stopped shipping phones with basic accessories like earphones and charging bricks, a shift that increased their profit margins. And in an echo of the way computer makers upsell memory, the base model of a smartphone typically includes a modest amount of data storage that isn't likely to be enough to hold your photos, videos and apps for the long haul.
First, a quick aside on storage. An average photo takes up five megabytes, according to Samsung. So shooting 3,000 photos would take up roughly 15 gigabytes. Popular mobile games like Fortnite and Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis gobble up dozens of gigabytes. On Netflix, each hour of video downloaded for offline viewing takes up about a gigabyte. Long story short, data storage can run out fast, so why get 256 gigabytes when you could spend about $ 100 more for double that?
Unless you already own accessories to work with your new phone, you'll have to tack on these extras:
$ 30 for the Samsung charging brick.
$ 40 for a Samsung protective case.
$ 50 for the Samsung wireless earbuds.
An extra $ 120 to get 512 gigabytes to hold more photos and apps. (As of this writing, this data upgrade is free for a limited-time promotion.)
That's not including the cost of using the phone with a modest wireless phone plan for, say, $ 70 a month. With wireless service included, the cost of owning this Samsung phone over three years is about $ 112.77 a month, or $ 4,060 total.
Bottom Line
The point is not to shame people about buying tech, but to raise awareness of what we're actually spending on new gadgets, which is a lot more than we think, Mr. Sethi said. That's why the best practice for most people buying tech products is to hold on to them for as long as they can. This way they maximize the value they get not just from the devices but from the many extras they bought for them along the way.
For comparison purposes, the examples above showed the costs of extras like headphones and cases if you bought them directly from the device makers. A simple method to save money would be to shop around for cheaper third-party alternatives, but the purchases would still nonetheless be phantom costs that drove up the overall price of your tech.
This all brings us to the biggest phantom cost of regularly buying products like new phones and Apple's Vision Pro: the price you pay for being an early adopter.
"The more you buy a new phone, the more the people around you expect you to have the newest thing, and the more you create an identity that you always have the newest thing," Mr. Sethi said. "That's the biggest phantom cost of all."

A Buzzword in Wellness Enters Home Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Communities certified as "blue zones," a concept that promotes healthy living and longevity, are multiplying, but some wonder if the movement is just another gimmick.
As the director of online sales for the builder CC Homes, Lorraine Sanchez encourages prospective buyers to go see the company's houses in Ave Maria, a town in southwest Florida.
Since last year, she has had a new marketing tool: Ave Maria is "certified" as a blue zone, a place geared to helping people live healthy, active lives.
"It's a great selling point," Ms. Sanchez said.
The term "blue zone" was coined two decades ago when Dan Buettner, an explorer for National Geographic, was investigating places around the world where people regularly lived to 100 and beyond. He deduced that residents of these mostly small, remote locales had such long, healthy lives because they stayed active, ate plant-based meals and formed lasting social ties, among other practices.
The concept has become the latest wellness buzzword: Blue Zones, the company that sprang from Mr. Buettner's research, has put its trademark on books, canned beans, bottled tea, frozen burrito bowls and even a series on Netflix.
Now the real estate industry has jumped into the game. Blue Zones runs initiatives that certify towns and cities that meet healthy lifestyle criteria, and they help others remake themselves to promote longevity. The initiatives -- often funded by health care systems and insurance companies with a vested interest in a hale and hearty population -- promote solutions like smoking bans, biking paths and group activities that foster a sense of belonging.
Eighty places in the United States -- from Bakersfield, Calif., to Corry, Pa. -- have adopted these initiatives, called Blue Zone Projects. Some developers take inspiration from Blue Zones even if they are not seeking official certification.
But in some cases, it appears to be more a marketing strategy than anything else, joining a flurry of real estate certification programs and having little to do with the modest way of life that Blue Zones is meant to reflect.
A luxury hotel and condominium project in Miami is using the Blue Zones moniker for a medical facility on the premises that will offer plastic surgery. And there has been pushback in some quarters, including a part of Phoenix with a large minority population. Some nonprofit groups there wrote a letter criticizing an effort to organize a Blue Zones initiative, saying it would compete with plans already in progress, draining resources and funding.
"This is like Lifestyle Medicine 101," said Janelle Applequist, an associate professor in the Zimmerman School of Advertising & Mass Communications at the University of South Florida. "This is stuff we've known forever. They're just repackaging it."
Mr. Buettner defended his company's approach, saying it was based on exhaustive research and that instead of trying to convince individuals to change their behavior, as other wellness programs do, it focuses on changing the environment to make healthy choices easier.
"On the surface it might look like what's been done before," he said. "But every single component of what we do is underpinned with evidence."
The Blue Zones phenomenon started when Mr. Buettner learned that the Japanese island of Okinawa produced the oldest people in the world, and in 1999 he set out to learn why.
Within a decade, he and other researchers had identified four more blue zones: small communities in Italy, Costa Rica and Greece as well as Loma Linda, Calif., which had a high proportion of Seventh-day Adventists, many of them vegetarians. (The "blue" in blue zones came from the ink marks made on maps pinpointing places where centenarians were concentrated.)
Mr. Buettner distilled what residents of the blue zones had in common and set out to spread the gospel in books, articles and talks. He founded Blue Zones to manage all these activities and is now chairman.
"I never set out to be a longevity guru," Mr. Buettner says at the outset of his Netflix series.
Some questioned his claims and data. And since his initial investigations, some of the original blue zones have lost their longevity edge as processed foods supplanted meals made with homegrown ingredients and the sedentary ways of modern life took hold.
But Mr. Buettner recently anointed a sixth blue zone: Singapore. The Southeast Asian island was different from the earlier five, which had grown organically, because its governmental policies nudged people to make healthier choices.
Mr. Buettner had tested the idea of tweaking people's surroundings to encourage healthy living with a project in a small Minnesota city, Albert Lea, in 2009. Changes spurred by the project -- which included adding sidewalks so people could walk to shops -- resulted in gains in life expectancy and a more vibrant downtown, Blue Zones proponents say. Property values rose, too.
Today Adventist Health, a faith-based health care system, owns Blue Zones. And Sharecare, a digital health company, has been running many of the Blue Zone Projects, paying licensing and royalty fees to use the name and tenets. Localities, in turn, pay $ 3 million to more than $ 40 million for the initiatives.
The NCH Healthcare System initiated a Blue Zone Project in southwest Florida in 2015, starting in Naples, a city on the Gulf of Mexico. The project now covers 2,000 square miles encompassing smaller inland towns like Ave Maria.
Ave Maria was started in 2005 by Tom Monaghan, founder of Domino's Pizza and a backer of Roman Catholic causes. He teamed up with the Barron Collier Companies, a developer that had long owned the land on which Ave Maria sits.
Being Catholic is not a requirement for residency, but the town's name and its big church certainly hold appeal for Catholic home buyers.
Blue Zones certification for the community is "kind of like getting the Good Housekeeping seal of approval," said Victor Acquista, a retired primary care doctor and Ave Maria resident. He volunteers on a Blue Zones committee that has organized activities like a 30-day walking challenge and 30-day gratitude challenge.
It is perhaps less obvious what Blue Zones principles -- some gleaned from the daily lives of shepherds and people who grew their own food -- have to do with a 50-story, $ 600 million luxury tower being developed in Miami by Royal Palm Companies that will have glass elevators and a roof deck with an infinity pool.
The development, called Legacy Hotel & Residences and expected to open in 2026, will also have a Blue Zones Center, said Dan Kodsi, Royal Palm's chief executive, describing it as "like a mall of the best longevity and wellness groups in the world." A joint venture with Adventist Health was formed to operate the center.
Mr. Kodsi said his project would cater to the boom in medical tourism. "We're envisioning that you come in and learn about the Blue Zone lifestyle" before proceeding to a practitioner for a treatment or surgery, he said.
It is a far cry from the original blue zone concept, but Mr. Kodsi may have hit on a winning formula for his project: He said that all 310 condos in the building had been sold and that so many practitioners had expressed interest in being part of the medical center that Royal Palm bought a nearby property to make room for everyone.
Despite the growing popularity of blue zones, some organizers are finding resistance.
Equality Health Foundation, a nonprofit spinoff of the Equality Health primary care platform, has been working to organize a Blue Zones Project in South Phoenix, an area with a mostly Black and Hispanic population that has lower incomes and lower life expectancy than predominantly white areas nearby.
Tomás León, president of the foundation, said he was seeking to raise $ 10.5 million for the initiative.
But some local groups have expressed concern that Blue Zones will duplicate efforts they already have underway and that the fund-raising drive will siphon off money that otherwise might go to their projects.
For example, the Cihuapactli Collective, an advocacy group for Indigenous families, has plans for a wellness center that would require raising about $ 25 million, said Enjolie Lafaurie, co-executive director of operations and development. "It feels like robbing Peter to pay Paul," she added.
The groups also pointed out in a letter that similar projects lacked roots in the community and that efforts to organize a Blue Zones initiative had "a white savior complex."
Mr. León said he was sensitive to the concerns of the groups that signed the protest letter and was increasing his fund-raising so funds could be directed to them.
Mr. Buettner said Blue Zone Projects could be challenging to execute, requiring a coordinated effort by people in all corners of a community.
"There's a lot of discipline and headaches and correcting course to make things work," he added.
Photograph Ave Maria, part of a Blue Zone Project in southwest Florida, was started in 2005. Being Roman Catholic is not a residency requirement, but the town's name and its big church, top, certainly hold appeal for Catholic home buyers. The town organizes healthy activities like 30-day walking challenges for residents. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY GESI SCHILLING FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) This article appeared in print on page B7.

Full text: Two of the American troops killed on Sunday were, like many young Black women, drawn to the military for the opportunities and level playing field it offered.
At a dusty military base in northeastern Jordan, Specialist Kennedy Sanders drove bulldozers and road graders. When she had free time, she liked to spend it knitting, or feeding her sneaker-head habit by shopping online for rare pairs of Nike Dunks that she would make her mother unbox for her over FaceTime.
She spent a lot of hours joking and hanging out with her friend and platoonmate in their Army Reserve engineer unit, Specialist Breonna Moffett, who slept in a nearby rack and was hoping to celebrate returning home this summer by attending a Nicki Minaj concert.
The two were killed on Sunday, along with another soldier in their unit, Sgt. William Jerome Rivers, in what the Pentagon said was a drone attack by an Iranian-backed militia.
Both specialists were heavy-equipment operators doing a tough job in a hostile region. They were also young Black women from Georgia who loved hip-hop, laughing with friends and the Army. And they were representative of the type of Americans who increasingly serve in the military these days.
Black women account for about 36 percent of all enlisted women in the Army, compared with just 14 percent of the civilian female population, and they have an outsize presence in the highest enlisted ranks: More than half of the Army's female sergeant majors are Black.
"You think of the military, most people think of men, but in fact African American women are heavily overrepresented," said Brenda Moore, a professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Buffalo who has studied the trend for decades.
The reasons are simple, she said. The Army was one of the first large employers to strip structural racism from its organization. Though other forms of racism persisted, the military in the Civil Rights era was one of the few places where Black women could find open doors and equal opportunity. Military service comes with benefits that can be rare in civilian blue-collar jobs, and recruits do not need to know someone or have a degree to be hired.
"The Army was seen as a good deal," Ms. Moore said. "You could make something of yourself, provide for your family and do something honorable."
Today, women like Specialist Sanders and Specialist Moffett fill the often overlooked ranks of supply, logistics and medical jobs that support combat units.
Specialist Moffett, 23, of Savannah, Ga., enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2019 right after high school, and was soon learning to drive construction equipment like bulldozers and road graders. She was the second woman in her family to join the Army. Her mother served, too.
It's "basically a family tradition," said Dereima Weaver, a friend since middle school.
Ms. Weaver said her friend was happy to have joined up. "She loved the adventure, and she loved the service," she said.
In between her Army Reserve commitments, Specialist Moffett worked as a civilian home care provider for people with disabilities. The Savannah regional director of United Cerebral Palsy of Georgia, Sharon Mitchell, described Specialist Moffett in a statement as "a deeply passionate advocate for the people we support."
Her platoonmate Specialist Sanders, 24, came from Waycross, a town in the southeastern part of the state where the median household income is half the national average. Her longtime friend Bre Etheridge said in an interview that it was the kind of place where "some people get stuck and they can't leave."
"Others, if they're motivated and want to do big things with their lives, like Kennedy, they go to college or join the service," she said.
Specialist Sanders grew up on a street full of boys and with several brothers, and learned fast to keep up while playing football and basketball. In high school, she lettered in three sports. She tried college, but didn't finish; back in Waycross again, she worked at a series of low-paying jobs, including as an assistant at the pharmacy in the city's small downtown.
One of her best friends had joined the Marines and was learning to be a radiology technician; after talking to her, Specialist Sanders decided to enlist in the Army. Soon she had health care coverage, retirement benefits and a marketable skill, and was earning education benefits to pay for another try at college.
"It was an adventure for her, too," her mother, Oneida Oliver-Sanders, said in an interview. "She was making lifelong friends, getting promoted. She loved it."
Specialist Sanders was so proud of her service that she went in uniform to visit schools and talk to students in Waycross.
"It meant a lot to her," her mother said. "She wanted the kids to see that they had this opportunity, too."
She said her daughter had found a kindred spirit in Specialist Moffett. Neither of them, Ms. Oliver-Sanders said, gave much thought to ending up in harm's way.
When they deployed in August, they initially were told they might go to Syria, where the United States has about 900 troops. Specialist Sanders was apprehensive. But they learned they would be sent instead to Tower 22, a small base in Jordan near the Syrian border, which sounded safer.
At the base, Ms. Oliver-Sanders said, her daughter's life seemed routine and quiet. A few attempted drone attacks on the base came up in phone conversations, she said, but mostly they talked about their favorite shows on Netflix or the latest pair of sneakers to add to Specialist Sanders's collection.
Her enlistment was almost up, and she was thinking about her future. Deploying to a remote patch of desert with occasional drone strikes might have turned some people off. But on Saturday, when her mother last spoke to her, Specialist Sanders said she had decided to re-enlist in the Army.

Incompetent Heroes, and Life on the Edge: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: This month's picks include a French comedic swashbuckling adventure, Indian spy games and more.
'All-Time High'
Stream it on Netflix.
Youssef (Nassim Lyes) is a habitual liar, a down-on-his-luck gambler and a hustler of fake luxury handbags. He is working these cons to impress his wealthy girlfriend -- she thinks he has a regular office job. When Youssef reveals the truth, including his bald head underneath his wig, she leaves him. Soon Youssef has a new girlfriend, Stephanie (Zoé Marchal), a card shark with a crypto fortune. But his gambling catches up to him, and a few goons are sent to track him down.
The French writer-director Julien Hollande's "All-Time High" is a comedic swashbuckling adventure: Youssef and Stephanie are the kind of couple whose vapid arguments always end in raunchy sex. The pair fight their way through an underground card game, captured by a sweeping camera, and are involved in a thrilling motorcycle chase that sees them ineptly firing shots at their pursuers. It's a reminder that sometimes the incompetent action heroes are the most entertaining.
'Deadland'
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The director Lance Larson's "Deadland," a border narrative that fittingly crosses the boundaries between slow burn, thriller, horror and action, isn't totally a bust-em-up, shoot-em-up affair. It works on a subtler psychological level when Angel Waters (Roberto Urbina), a border patrol agent, brings to base a nameless, near-dead migrant (Luis Chávez) he found floating in the water. When Waters's colleague, Cruz (Julieth Restrepo) tries to help the victim, a trigger-happy officer named Ray Hitchcock (McCaul Lombardi) shoots and kills him.
"Deadland" is an angsty film, capturing the police officers' disintegrating alliances through well-calibrated jump scares, loaded standoffs and unhinged nightmare sequences. Though these officers bury the dead man's body, they can't cover up their crime. He continues to haunt them, leading to an arresting finale that sears the wounds felt by a ghost who never found the easier life he desired.
'Khufiya'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Vishal Bhardwaj's "Khufiya" opens with a bang: Heena Papon Rehman (Azmeri Haque Badhon), code name Octopus, arrives at a lavish party with plans to assassinate Brig. Saqlain Mirza (Shataf Figar). Though the ravishing Rehman puts up a charm offensive, she doesn't fool Mirza; he stabs her to death. Clearly, there is a mole in her ranks. Krishna Mehra (Tabu), her boss and lover, begins investigating. It doesn't take long before a suspect emerges: an intelligence agent named Ravi (Ali Fazal).
"Khufiya," based on Amar Bhushan's novel "Escape to Nowhere," is a scintillating piece of spycraft. Ulterior motives, competing geopolitical desires between India and the United States and a series of flashbacks, which recount how Rehman came into Mirza's orbit, are the finely tuned mechanics that give this picture propulsion. The film is also adept at granting a sense of living on the edge of life and death; the quick, unflinching assassinations -- including unsuspecting civilians hit by cars and targets poisoned by food -- are the thrills Bhardwaj effortlessly delivers.
'Malbatt: Misi Bakara'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
If you've seen Ridley Scott's "Black Hawk Down," then you're probably familiar with the real-life story of the rescued Black Hawk crew that was trapped in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1993. Adrian Teh's frenzied war film, "Malbatt: Misi Bakara," tells the same story, except from the perspective of the 19th Battalion Royal Malay Regiment that was dispatched to assist in the mission.
Despite volunteering for the dangerous assignment, this group of Malaysian soldiers isn't respected by its American counterparts, who see the Malaysians only as their transport, not as their fellow soldiers.
The Malaysians, however, prove their mettle once they enter Mogadishu and when insurgents use machine guns and rocket launchers against their convoy. Teh devises major set pieces, employing an army of extras, as the streets are rendered as one large kill box where death lurks around every corner and on every rooftop. By the end, these soldiers not only win the day, but they also win respect from their American peers.
'Your Lucky Day'
Rent or buy it on most major platforms.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Sterling (Angus Cloud), a small-time drug dealer, is flipping through a magazine at a convenience store when he overhears a wealthy customer celebrating winning the $ 156 million Mega Ball jackpot. Sterling quickly tears a page from the magazine, tapes it around his head to disguise himself, pulls out a gun and sticks up the customer. When a police officer appears, a shootout ensues, leading to the deaths of the officer and the customer. It's a messy robbery that requires an inspired solution: Sterling offers everyone in the store, including the owner and a young couple, a piece of the jackpot if they help him cover up the crime.
While "Your Lucky Day" ends up being more complicated as the story unfolds, what really stands out is Cloud, who died last year. In one of his final roles, he's a ball of uncertainty and vulnerability, giving Sterling a humanism that makes him easy to get behind, even when the bullets start flying.

Humanity's Dark Side, Up Close and Personal: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Not long ago, true crime storytellers had little in the way of first-person footage captured in real time to rely on. Now, as much of our daily lives are documented, the genre is transforming.
There's a moment near the end of the 2017 documentary "Mommy Dead and Dearest" where Gypsy Rose Blanchard is filming her boyfriend at the time, Nicholas Godejohn, as he lies nude in a hotel room bed. A day earlier, Godejohn had stabbed to death Gypsy's mother, Dee Dee Blanchard. The killing was part of a plot the couple hatched to free Gypsy, who was then 23, from her mother's grip so they could be together. In the short video, we hear Gypsy make a playful sexual comment amid her copious, distinctive giggling.
Dee Dee Blanchard had abused and controlled her daughter, mentally and physically, for decades. It was believed by many to be a case of Munchausen syndrome by proxy -- a form of child abuse in which a caregiver might induce illness to draw public sympathy, care, concern and material gifts -- and the saga captured the collective interest.
The snippet is the first time we see it unfolding through Gypsy's eyes, and the point of view serves as a glimmer of what would become one of the biggest shifts in true crime storytelling.
Stories like these were once conveyed through re-enactments, dramatizations and interviews with police officers, journalists, medical professionals, family and friends. If there were primary sources, those were typically scans of photos of happy families or of grisly crime scenes underpinned by voice-over narration, exemplified on shows like "20/20," "Dateline," "Snapped," "Forensic Files" and "48 hours." Home video cameras, which became popular in the 1980s, certainly changed the true crime landscape, but those recordings were generally sparse and supplemental. In rare instances, viewers might hear directly from the perpetrators or victims in interviews often conducted years after the fact.
Now we have reams of first-person digital footage, which means that viewers, more than ever, are privy to the perspectives of those directly involved, often during the period in which the crimes took place, closing the distance and making the intermediaries less essential. The case of Gypsy Rose Blanchard encapsulates the trajectory of this phenomenon. Her saga, for example, received the scripted treatment with "The Act," a 2019 limited series on Hulu, for which Patricia Arquette won an Emmy. But those looking for a definitive, unvarnished, visceral take on the events now have options and direct channels, rendering that series as almost an afterthought.
The rise of social media has, of course, accelerated this dynamic. Blanchard and Godejohn's relationship was almost exclusively online before the murder, and Facebook posts and text messages between them were used in court by prosecutors to incriminate them. Godejohn was sentenced to life in prison; Gypsy received 10 years, of which she served about seven.
She was released on Dec. 28, 2023, and the following day she posted a selfie to Instagram with the caption "First selfie of freedom," which has gotten more than 6.5 million likes. Online, she's been promoting her new Lifetime series, "The Prison Confessions of Gypsy Rose Blanchard." "This docuseries chronicles my quest to expose the hidden parts of my life that have never been revealed until now," we hear her say from prison.
She has quickly become a social media celebrity, with more than eight million Instagram followers and nearly 10 million on TikTok. Since her release, she has shared lighthearted videos like one with her husband, Ryan Anderson (they married in 2022 while she was in prison), at "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child" on Broadway and more serious ones, like a video in which she explains Munchausen syndrome by proxy.
Technology's influence on modern criminal investigations has become foundational in many documentaries from recent years.
In the two-part HBO documentary "I Love You, Now Die: The Commonwealth v. Michelle Carter" (2019), the story is largely told through the thousands of text messages exchanged between two teenagers, Michelle Carter and Conrad Roy III, from 2012 to 2014. The text messages led up to the exact moment of Roy's suicide. Selfie videos that Roy had posted online are also shown. Carter spent about a year in prison for her role in his death. The documentary (by Erin Lee Carr, who also directed "Mommy Dead and Dearest") left me "spinning in circles, turning over thoughts about accountability, coercion and the nebulous boundaries of technology," as I wrote last year.
One of the highest profile murder trials in the United States in recent years -- that of the disgraced lawyer Alex Murdaugh, who shot and killed his wife, Maggie, and son Paul in 2021 -- ultimately rested on a staggering recording captured moments before the murders. That video, on Paul's phone, placed the patriarch at the scene of the crime, sealing his fate: two consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole.
The use of that footage, along with abundant smartphone video that brought viewers into the world of the Murdaughs, in documentaries like Netflix's two-season "Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal," would have been unimaginable not long ago.
But perhaps no recent offering illustrates this shift like HBO's docuseries "Love Has Won: The Cult of Mother God." Members of the group Love Has Won live-streamed their days and nights; they filmed and posted untold hours of preachments and online manifestoes to YouTube and Instagram Live. Much of the three-episode series comprises this footage, and in turn viewers watch Amy Carlson, who called herself "Mother God," slowly deteriorate over the course of months from the perspective of the people who were worshiping her.
It's a vantage point so unnerving and haunting, it dissolves the line between storytelling and voyeurism. When the group films her corpse, which they cart across numerous state lines, camping with it along the way, we see all that, too, through the eyes of the devotees. Several of the followers continue to promote her teachings online.
It was clear this month in the comments on Blanchard's Instagram that many were uncomfortable with her re-emerging as a social media presence. Some found it odd that she would participate so heavily and publicly immediately after her release. Others thought it was in bad taste for her to celebrate her freedom while Godejohn serves a life sentence.
The greatest criticism of the true crime genre is that horrors are being repackaged as guilty-pleasure entertainment, allowing viewers to get close -- but not too close -- to terrible things. And perhaps the best defense of true crime is that it allows viewers to process the scary underbelly of our world safely. It is a strange dance between knowledge, observation and entertainment.
Either way, the fourth wall is cracking, and perhaps the discomfort this might cause has been a long time coming.

Taking the African Diaspora Hard to the Hoop: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: "I've always been passionate about storytelling," said the N.B.A. star, whose production studio will create a documentary about Memphis Depay's success on the Dutch soccer team.
Joel Embiid knew as early as his rookie season in the National Basketball Association that he eventually wanted to enter the media industry.
Seven years later, he is now at the pinnacle of the sport -- the league's reigning most valuable player, Embiid set a Philadelphia 76ers record last week by scoring 70 points in a game -- and is ready to take on that new challenge.
Embiid, 29, who moved from Cameroon to the United States as a teenager, has created a production studio, Miniature Géant, that he hopes will amplify the culture of his home continent. The studio intends to profile athletes and entertainment figures of African descent, with an initial goal of selling content to streaming services.
"We're dabbling in a lot of different spaces, but the common denominator is Africa and the joys and the quest of African people and the African diaspora," said Sarah Kazadi-Ndoye, who is the studio's lead creative executive and was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Miniature Géant's first documentary will explore themes of race and identity as it follows Memphis Depay, a Dutch soccer player who was born to a white mother from the Netherlands and a Ghanaian father. The studio is also having exploratory conversations with the Cameroonian mixed martial arts fighter Francis Ngannou, a former Ultimate Fighting Championship heavyweight champion. In addition to coverage of athletes, the studio hopes to also explore the entertainment world.
Embiid is one of several athletes to enter the world of content creation. The basketball player Giannis Antetokounmpo recently announced the start of a production company with the ESPN analyst Jay Williams. The retired National Football League quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning created similar organizations and have released projects with ESPN and Netflix.
But by focusing on a defined African niche, Embiid said he thinks Miniature Géant (French for "Giant") will be distinctive. Kazadi-Ndoye, a former producer for ESPN and CBS Sports who was hired in November, will help the studio generate ideas and filter pitches.
"I think a lot of people a lot of the time just want to do stuff because that's a way to make money," Embiid said. "But I've always been passionate about storytelling."
Nearly a year before announcing the creation of Miniature Géant in June, Embiid discussed his aspirations during a lunch with Maverick Carter, the longtime friend and business partner of LeBron James. In 2020, Carter and James founded SpringHill Company, which houses athlete podcasts and digital series and produced a new version of the movie "Space Jam."
The conversation became the impetus for Miniature Géant, SpringHill's second incubated studio after a partnership with the tennis star Naomi Osaka.
Carter said SpringHill would provide Embiid's studio with development funding, administrative support and Hollywood relationships.
"Very simply put, he's the visionary and we have to help him execute," Carter said. "Joel is dead set on telling the stories that matter to him and we want that to be the case."
Mahen Bonetti, the founder of the African Film Festival in New York, said there was not a shortage of African stories being produced, citing the robust Nigerian filmmaking business known as Nollywood as one example. But Embiid's status as a global celebrity, she said, could help elevate them to an even broader audience.
"What someone like him can do is to help facilitate growth of the filmmaking industry on the continent by investing in meaningful stories that represent Africa and uplift the spirit of the people there," Bonetti said.
Miniature Géant's first project will follow Depay, the second-leading scorer in Dutch national team history, as he trains for and competes in the UEFA European Championship this summer. Depay said he had been searching for a business partner and quickly became comfortable with Embiid's studio.
"I'm showing a lot to the world, so it's only right that somebody like him comes and is involved," Depay said.
Embiid and Kazadi-Ndoye also hope to develop a project about Ngannou, who was raised in poverty in Cameroon. Since departing the U.F.C. last year amid a high-profile contract dispute, Ngannou has signed with the Professional Fighters League, a rival mixed martial arts promotion, and become a prizefighting boxer.
"I think his story is so inspiring and it has to be told the right way," Embiid said. "Obviously being from the same country, you want to be a part of what he's been able to accomplish."

Black Hole Gets Another Look From Astronomers: [Science Desk]

Full text: Repeated studies of the supermassive black hole in the galaxy Messier 87 confirm that it continues to act as Einstein's theory predicted it would.
Hello darkness, our old friend, we've come to stare at you again.
At the center of Messier 87, a giant galaxy 55 million light-years from Earth, is a darkness 24 billion miles across and as massive as 6.5 billion suns -- a trapdoor to infinity called a black hole.
In 2017, a group of astronomers operating the Event Horizon Telescope, a world-spanning network of radio telescopes, produced an image of the black hole in Messier 87, or M87, the first image of any black hole ever. It revealed a fiery, slightly lopsided doughnut of hot gas circling a dark emptiness like water circling a drain, precisely as Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity had predicted in 1915. When the resulting picture was revealed in 2019, it made the front page of news outlets around the world. It is now in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
The same team of scientists have done it again, this time even better. In 2018, a year after capturing the first image, the astronomers stared again into M87's darkness with a slightly enlarged network that provided higher resolution. The result, published last week in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics, shows the same lumpy doughnut and the same central hole in even tastier detail, suggesting that the astronomers had done things right the first time around.
"The first image of a black hole looked so similar to the mathematical predictions that it almost seemed like a fluke," Dominic Chang, a physics Ph.D. candidate at Harvard who works on the Event Horizon team, said in a news release issued by the Center for Astrophysics/Harvard & Smithsonian in Cambridge, Mass., where the project is based.
"Getting the opportunity to make new tests using new data, with a new telescope, and seeing the same structure, is a crucial confirmation of our most significant conclusions," he said.
There was one change to the ring around M87's black hole. Its brightest lump had shifted roughly 30 degrees counterclockwise around the ring relative to where it had been a year earlier. The astronomers said they had predicted that the hot spot would move.
"While general relativity says the ring size should stay pretty fixed, the emission from the turbulent, messy accretion disk around the black hole will cause the brightest part of the ring to wobble around a common center," Britt Jeter, a postdoctoral fellow at Academia Sinica Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Taiwan, said in the news release. "The amount of wobble we see over time is something we can use to test our theories for the magnetic field and plasma environment around the black hole."
Sheperd Doeleman, a researcher at the Center for Astrophysics and the founding director of the Event Horizon collaboration, added in an email: "In other words, M87's supermassive black hole is behaving just as we thought it would."
To Einstein, black holes were one of many troublesome predictions to emerge from general relativity, which attributed what we call gravity to warps in the geometry of space-time. One was that the universe was expanding. Another was that if too much matter or energy was concentrated within a certain radius -- now called the event horizon -- it would collapse forever into a hole in space-time from which not even light could escape.
Einstein agreed with the math but thought that nature would somehow have better sense than to give form to such weirdness. But scientists now know that the universe is full of black holes; experiments like the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, have heard them bang together, and the Event Horizon Telescope has brought them to visceral reality. Many black holes are dead stars that collapsed when they ran out of thermonuclear fuel, but a giant black hole millions or billions of times as massive as an ordinary star seems to lie at the center of most galaxies. Astronomers still don't know how they came to be.
Thanks to a quirk of nature, two of these supermassive holes -- in M87 and at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy -- are big enough in the sky to be resolved and studied by the Event Horizon Telescope. An image of our own black hole, called Sgr A*, which sits 27,000 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, made its debut in 2022.
We can expect more of these portraits of doom. Dr. Doeleman and his team plan to continue adding to their network and to eventually create a black hole movie. Eat your heart out, Netflix.

At Sundance, A Broad Mix Of Nonfiction: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Author: Wilkinson, Alissa

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Festival documentaries ranged across the genre map, but several explored the lengths we'll go to communicate with lost loved ones.
Everyone from the academy to streaming services splits cinema into two buckets: movies (comedy, romance, horror, whatever) and documentaries, lumped into one unholy pile. Besides being obviously reductive, the division is false: Nonfiction movies can be comedies or romances or horror or any other genre, and they can create new indescribable genres, too. But American audiences still tend to be fed documentaries of only a few types: true crime stories, cult exposés, hagiographies, and educational disquisitions full of talking heads.
There's more than that to nonfiction. And though plenty of star-driven, lightweight biographies show up at Sundance -- famous folk on the carpet create much-needed social-media attention -- there's a lot of other nonfiction on offer, some of which will make its way to theaters and streaming services over the next year or two. A couple of lucky films may even eventually make their way into Oscar contention.
Documentaries at this year's Sundance, which concluded Sunday, ranged across the genre map, often playfully mixing up conventions. But it was striking how often a particular thread kept popping up: the human longing to communicate with the dead, and the lengths -- technological and otherwise -- to which we'll go to make it happen.
That was the theme of "Love Machina" and "Eternal You," which feel picked by the programmers to complement one another. "Love Machina" (directed by Peter Sillen) is a romance looking at the efforts of the married couple Martine and Bina Rothblatt to create a robotic replica of Bina, powered by artificial intelligence and an extensive database of her thoughts, speech and emotions, that can communicate with her descendants when she is gone. "Eternal You" (directed by Hans Block and Moritz Riesewieck) takes a broader, more analytical look at the burgeoning market for "afterlife technology" designed to do what the Rothblatts hope to accomplish: let people communicate with their loved ones after death using A.I. If that sounds like a "Black Mirror" episode, you're right -- and some "Eternal You" participants note the humanity-altering danger in this quest.
Yet, as the eminent sociologist Sherry Turkle points out onscreen, what we see in these efforts is A.I. offering what religion once did: a sense of an afterlife, a quest for meaning, the feeling of connecting to transcendence. One of the festival's best documentaries, the sociological portrait "Look Into My Eyes," taps into this same longing from a more mystical direction. Directed by Lana Wilson, the film drops audiences into the lives of several New York City psychics. The clients are hoping to communicate with the beloved dead through a literal rather than technological medium. (One participant helps people communicate with their pets, some of whom are still living.) But the focus is on the psychics themselves, the reasons they've come to their work, and what they believe they're actually doing in their sessions -- and the film is marvelously nuanced and fascinating in its examination. Is this performance? Is it "real"? And if it brings peace to the living, does it matter?
Other documentaries centered on people trying to connect with one another across social barriers, like the much-loved "Will & Harper," featuring Will Ferrell. There was the astounding, rebellious "Union," directed by Brett Story and Stephen Maing, about the Amazon Labor Union's organizing work at the JFK8 fulfillment center on Staten Island. It's a radically observational documentary, capturing years of the effort amid the complex dynamics of solidarity, with working-class New Yorkers putting in the time alongside young organizers who take jobs at the center explicitly to lead the unionization campaign. And it's brilliant.
"Sugarcane," a sobering community portrait directed by Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie, tracks the fallout from the Roman Catholic Church's residential school for Indigenous children in Canada by tracing generational trauma. Instead of preaching about the topic, the directors let their subjects slowly fill in the outlines while reminding us that these same stories have been replicated across North America, and have only barely begun to be investigated. On the flip side, Shiori Ito's memoirlike "Black Box Diaries" chronicles the director's bold and brutal investigation of her own sexual assault at the hands of a prominent Japanese journalist. The ways the investigation is thwarted by the powerful are a damning statement about why, and how, it's so difficult for such cases to be resolved. (Ito won her case, but the problems are much bigger than Japan.)
And I can't stop thinking about the remarkable "Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat" (by Johan Grimonprez), a sprawling film that's a well-researched essay about the 1960 regime change in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the part the United States, particularly the C.I.A., played -- especially in harnessing the cultural cachet of jazz musicians, often without their knowledge, to promote America's image abroad.
All of these movies are worth seeking out as soon as they're available. But I'll tell you the truth: The documentary that feels most destined to live in my memory is the first one I saw this year at Sundance, a genre-defying project by any definition. "Ibelin," directed by Benjamin Ree, is about Mats Steen, a Norwegian who died in 2014, at age 25, from a rare, degenerative genetic condition. He left behind a blog and a password, and when his parents logged on to post about his death, they discovered something amazing: He had a rich community and life in his World of Warcraft guild, where he played as a character named Ibelin.
Ree employed animators to recreate scenes from Steen's World of Warcraft life, drawing on a huge archive of transcripts detailing his conversations and activities. Ree also visits some of Steen's friends in real life, who range across Europe and have immensely moving stories to tell. An excellent pairing with the 2022 Sundance premiere "We Met in Virtual Reality," "Ibelin" is a poignant counterexample to the technodoomerism that often accompanies relationships formed in virtual spaces.
It can be hard to track down some documentaries after their festival runs, since they rarely get the marketing dollars and push that their fiction cousins do. Luckily, Netflix bought "Ibelin." Which means you'll be able to connect with Steen's story, too -- through the ubiquitous technology of your very own screen.

Slowly Opening, South Korea Drew In an Editor: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: An editor recalls moving to Seoul during the coronavirus pandemic and watching The Times open a digital newsroom in the city.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
There was no telling what I would find when I arrived in Seoul.
I knew the greatest hits of South Korean pop culture -- BTS, "Oldboy," Psy, "Parasite," Blackpink -- but I had never visited the Korean Peninsula. North Korea, though the subject of endless fascination among both beltway pundits and TMZ aficionados, seemed eerily unknowable.
And yet, as a new editor on the International desk at The New York Times, I was tasked with running coverage of the Koreas. Not only that, I would be based in Seoul, not Hong Kong, as was originally planned. (More on that later.)
Little did I know that the unexpected change in my Asia itinerary would lead to three of the most thrilling years of my career as a journalist.
In the fall of 2020, before the United States presidential election, the world was still in the thick of the coronavirus pandemic. South Korea had introduced robust measures to mitigate the spread of infection. There were limits on gatherings. You needed a QR code to enter public spaces. Masks were required everywhere.
When I arrived that October, government alerts chimed on my phone every time a new infection was found in the city. Visitors -- including my husband, who had moved to Seoul with me -- were subject to a two-week quarantine. Covid cases were lower than in the United States, but as a result of its efforts, the country felt especially closed off to a new resident like myself, adjusting to a new city, job and country.
People mostly stayed at home, which led to a surge in delivery orders that proved deadly for some couriers. Traveling outside the country required exit permits, putting the kibosh on my grand plan to spend weekends gallivanting around Asia. Unable to easily travel outside South Korea, I hopped on the bullet train and visited cities around the country to arm myself with the knowledge I needed to do my job well.
Though I remember feeling especially claustrophobic, I look back at that time fondly for what it was -- an opportunity to take a closer look at Korean traditions, history and geography, topics that The Times examined in its articles. One focused on kimjang, the process of preparing kimchi. Another followed yakult ajummas, women who sell a drinkable yogurt. A third dived into the legacy of the Korean War, which keeps the peninsula divided.
Two auspicious things were happening simultaneously: The Times was setting up its first digital newsroom in Seoul after relocating from Hong Kong, where China had stepped up its effort to subdue the freewheeling territory, and I was digging deeper into the ways in which South Korea had spent decades expanding its global reach.
The pandemic could have dimmed those ambitions, but it did not. Instead, the country gave us "Squid Game," a mega-hit for Netflix about death, violence, wealth and poverty in South Korea. Its commentary on the country's growing class divide felt particularly poignant against the backdrop of the real-life housing crisis I was beginning to observe.
I also began to notice a growing disenchantment among young people. The awful night in October 2022 when more than 150 people where killed in Seoul during a crowd crush seemed especially devastating knowing that so many young South Koreans had grown disillusioned by the country's bleak economic outlook.
But I was moved to see those same young people become a powerful voting bloc in the last presidential election, with both leading candidates appealing to young voters and their frustrations. Yoon Suk Yeol, the conservative, won a narrow victory after promising to reaffirm his country's alliance with the United States.
As pandemic restrictions lifted over time, I noticed a new rhythm in the city. The way pedestrians scurried along to make a traffic light. The smell of street vendors selling tteokbokki, or rice cakes, and hotteok, a type of fried pancake. Though I had lamented not being able to travel in the early days of my time in South Korea, I found myself soaking up all that the country, back open, had to show me.
As I end my tour of South Korea this year and head back to New York, another United States presidential election is fast approaching, the early days of the pandemic feel like a distant memory and The Times's digital newsroom in Seoul is fully up and running.
What I will remember most about my time in South Korea is the gift of watching a city like Seoul, so cold and lonely during the pandemic, transform into a buzzing Asian metropolis, its streets filled with nine million people proud of their heritage and culture.
Though Korea was once referred to as the hermit kingdom, I found the opposite to be true. South Korea has its arms wide open today. I didn't know what I would find in Seoul. But after three years of living in the city, I know that there will always be more for me to discover.

Joe Locke Has a Soft Spot for 'The Goonies': [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Author: Bahr, Sarah

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "It's the peak coming-of-age adventure film," said the actor, who is set to make his Broadway debut in "Sweeney Todd."
Joe Locke was so moved when he saw "Next to Normal" at the Donmar Warehouse in London last fall that he called his agent with a request.
"I was like, 'I want to do a musical so bad,"' said Locke, 20, who for two seasons has played the sensitive teenager Charlie Spring in Netflix's L.G.B.T.Q. coming-of-age drama "Heartstopper."
Soon after, his agent said he'd gotten an email from the casting team of Broadway's "Sweeney Todd," and the show was looking for a new Tobias Ragg, an urchin taken in by the scheming pie-maker, Mrs. Lovett.
"The easiest way to play him is that he's a bit simple -- he's not a full egg, as the Irish would say," Locke said in a phone conversation in early January from his Manhattan apartment, before one of his first rehearsals. "But I think he's a very street-smart character who's survived in a world where people like him shouldn't survive."
Locke made his professional stage debut in the Donmar Warehouse's production of Dawn King's climate crisis drama "The Trials" in 2022, and he has a big year coming up: In the fall, he's slated to appear alongside Kathryn Hahn, Aubrey Plaza and Patti LuPone in the new Marvel series "Agatha: Darkhold Diaries," based on the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness, on Disney+.
It being Marvel, "I can say absolutely nothing," he said. "But I think it's going to be an amazing show. It shows a different side of Marvel. It pushes the boundary of what a superhero show is."
Locke, who will make his Broadway debut in "Sweeney" on Jan. 31, shared 10 of his cultural essentials, including Cynthia Erivo, "The Goonies" and walks on the Isle of Man, the island in the Irish Sea where he grew up. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Carole King's 'Tapestry'
This time last year, one of my best friends sent me the song "So Far Away," and I started listening to the whole album. It's just such a beautifully constructed piece of art. There's a real sense of vulnerability to her music. My favorite song is probably "It's Too Late," though it changes every time I listen.
Cynthia Erivo Singing 'Alfie'
I've watched the video like 45 times in the last week. She has the most incredible tone. I can't stop listening to it.
Games-Intensive Morning Routines
I get coffee and do the Crossword, then Wordle, then the new one, Connections -- those three are part of my morning routine. It makes me feel like an old man, but I kind of love it.
Beach Walks on the Isle of Man
When I go back for a visit with my family, it's like nothing's changed; I can just slip back into the fold. There's a spot called Glen Maye, which has a huge waterfall and then you down this glen to the beach. That's my favorite place.
Stephen Sondheim
In one of the songs that my character in "Sweeney Todd" sings, Sondheim rhymes the word "buy" with three different spellings -- buying something, saying goodbye and "by," like b-y. It's in the same harmony, but [a bunch of] people singing different parts, using the same word but meaning different things. I don't think anyone else would ever think to do that.
Atlanta
It's the greenest city I've ever been to. There are so many trees. On my days off when I was there shooting "Agatha" last year, I'd get brunch at Bread & Butterfly and then go walk the BeltLine or meet friends for coffee. Atlanta has the most incredible food -- Banshee in the East Atlanta Village has this amazing mushroom toast. It's the best thing I've ever eaten, and I don't even like mushrooms.
The Victoria and Albert Museum, London
There's a room with lots of old sculptures, and you walk up a little stairway and look above them. I remember 10-year-old me thinking it was the coolest thing ever. They have amazing guest exhibitions as well; the "Diva" one they have at the moment is so cool.
Oat-Milk Flat Whites
It's my go-to order; I have two or three a day. That's one reason I feel very lucky to be in New York -- you have amazing coffee shops! I feel very at home.
'The Goonies'
It's the peak coming-of-age adventure film. Growing up in a small town, a lot of the caves they'd go exploring in, that spoke a lot to me. But it also spoke to me as I got older and realized I wanted to go into filmmaking. I remember always thinking, "The feeling I get from 'The Goonies' is the kind of thing I want to make."
London in the Summer
London is my favorite city in the world. In the summer, it comes alive. I don't think people think of it as a warm place, but it gets quite hot. I spent pretty much my entire summer sitting in an outdoor bar with my friends drinking Aperol spritz, laughing and having a great time.

Full text: As Netflix pours more of its resources into original content, Amazon Prime Video is picking up the slack, adding new movies for its subscribers each month. Its catalog has grown so impressive, in fact, that it's a bit overwhelming. Here are some of our favorites you can stream right now.
'A Thousand and One' (2023)
The writer and director A.V. Rockwell begins this wrenching character drama in New York City circa 1994, nicely recapturing the look and feel of Gotham indies of that era. But that's not just window dressing. While ostensibly telling the story of a young woman trying to raise her son after a stint at Rikers Island, Rockwell adroitly incorporates relevant reminders of the city's history into her characters and their ongoing struggle, reminding us that "quality of life" policing and the dirty business of gentrification are never purely policy issues. Yet it's more than just a polemic; Teyana Taylor is shattering as the mother in question, Josiah Cross is charismatic and sympathetic as her son as an older teenager, and the revelations of the closing scenes are wrenching and powerful. (If you like atmospheric dramas, try "Monster's Ball" and "Eve's Bayou.")
'Return to Seoul' (2022)
The French artist Park Ji-Min makes an astonishing film debut in the leading role of this "startling and uneasy wonder" from the writer and director Davy Chou. She stars as Freddie, born in South Korea but adopted and raised in Paris, who (cue the title) returns to Seoul for reasons unclear. She claims she has no interest in tracking down her birth parents but does so anyway, setting into motion a chain of events that significantly change who she is and what she wants. Chou's direction is blissfully confident -- even when you're not sure where he's going, his command of mood and tone carry the picture through -- and Park is a real find, an actor who is able to convey seemingly contradictory emotions simultaneously. (Admirers of this one may also enjoy the similarly emotional and thought-provoking "One Fine Morning.")
'Us' (2019)
Jordan Peele followed up the massive critical and commercial success of "Get Out," his Oscar-winning feature debut from 2017, with this similarly potent brew of horror, social commentary and bleak comedy. Lupita Nyong'o and Winston Duke star as upper-class parents whose family vacation is disrupted by the appearance of silent but terrifying visitors. Are they home invaders? Common criminals? Supernatural doppelgängers? Or something even more sinister? As with "Get Out" before it and "Nope" (also on Prime) after, Peele has as much fun building dread and atmosphere as he does delivering shock thrills, slyly threading in pop-culture shout-outs and obscure historical references to keep audiences equally puzzled and frightened. (For more spooky stuff, try "Bird With the Crystal Plumage.")
'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' (1978)
The original 1956 version (also streaming on Prime), in which alien invaders implant themselves in humans and take on their form, was widely seen as an allegory for the Red Scare. This "dazzling remake," as our critic described it, is updated and released from that context, but it found another in post-hippie, health-obsessed San Francisco. The stakes are lower, but the remake has a self-aware sense of humor and a decent proportion of gross-outs and jump-scares, as well as an ending that's just as creepy as the original's.
'High Noon' (1952)
This classic Western from the director Fred Zinnemann is best remembered for its innovative construction, in which a small-town marshal's looming standoff with a revenge-seeking outlaw is dramatized in real time. The film was widely read as an allegory for the film industr0y blacklists of the era -- the screenwriter Carl Foreman was deemed an "uncooperative witness" by the House Un-American Activities Committee. But "High Noon" also cleared an important path for the future of the Western, replacing the usual genre high jinks with thoughtful explorations of masculinity and violence; our critic called it "a rare and exciting achievement." (If you like Westerns, try "Stagecoach," "Breakheart Pass" or "One-Eyed Jacks.")
'The Taking of Pelham One Two Three' (1974)
One of the greatest of all "gritty Gotham" movies -- our critic called it "a movie that really catches the mood of New York and New Yorkers" -- this darkly funny, white-knuckle thriller from the director Joseph Sargent concerns four armed men who take a subway car hostage, demanding a million-dollar ransom for the lives of the passengers. Robert Shaw is coolly ruthless as the leader of the gang while Walter Matthau is at his hangdog best as the cynical transit cop hot on their trail. (Matthau's Oscar-winning turn in "The Fortune Cookie" is also on Prime.)

A Stirring Road Trip For Lovers Of Movies: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A documentary about Will Ferrell and his friend Harper Steele brought the house down. It was just one of several discoveries at this year's festival.
On Tuesday, after days of tramping around Park City, Utah, griping about the movies and the logistical headaches this mountain resort town presents, I was transported into the Sundance Film Festival that I always hope for, the one in which a movie surprises and moves and maybe delights me, and so successfully makes good on its promise that, after the lights come up, the crowd delivers the festival version of hallelujah with a floor-shaking standing ovation. I admit, I wasn't expecting that to happen when I walked into the new Will Ferrell joint.
That would be "Will & Harper," a documentary by Josh Greenbaum in which Ferrell and his longtime friend Harper Steele, a trans woman, set off on a momentous cross-country journey of discovery. Former colleagues at "Saturday Night Live," where Steele was a head writer, they have collaborated on other Ferrell vehicles, including the Spanish-language comedy "Casa de Mi Padre." Here, prompted by love and interest -- Steele yearns to feel more at ease in public, Ferrell wants to support and understand his friend's transition -- they deepen their friendship while traveling through a predictably divided country.
Like many, if not most, of the movies on this year's slate, "Will & Harper" will probably make its way into theaters and onto streaming. I hope that's the case for another movie about trans identity: Jules Rosskam's "Desire Lines," a low-budget documentary that doesn't have star power, just heart and intelligence.
It deserves more attention than, say, "It's What's Inside," Greg Jardin's gimmicky, ugly-looking and unscary horror movie, which Netflix bought for an eye-popping $ 17 million. Splashy festival deals like this one generate a lot of noise but there's always much behind-the-scenes haggling, so I'm hopeful that "Desire Lines" and some of the other lower-radar selections will reach a larger audience.
Movie love is why tens of thousands of attendees continue to gather at Sundance, which ends on Sunday. With 91 features on the slate, the program was somewhat more streamlined this year than in recent editions; in 2023, it presented 110 features. The smaller lineup and reduced number of Park City theaters suggested that the rumors about the festival having some serious money issues were true. It also made me wonder if this time the festival really was going to leave Park City. When I asked Eugene Hernandez, the festival's director, whether the event was moving, he answered, "Park City is our home, Utah is our home."
In that case, I will keep on traveling to Utah to slip on the ice and sit in the dark because in January Sundance is the place to be for film lovers. Since it was founded in 1985, the festival has weathered a lot of gossip, drama and changes, including in its identities as a cultural brand, a symbol of artistic independence and a player in the cinematic ecosystem.
This year the event celebrated its 40th anniversary, a milestone the organizers marked with screenings of restorations of eight hits -- among them Rose Troche's "Go Fish" (1994), Jared Hess's "Napoleon Dynamite" (2004) and Dee Rees's "Pariah" (2011) -- that together offer a snapshot of Sundance's commitment to diversity, inclusion and, yes, entertainment.
Missing from this sampling was "Sex, Lies & Videotape," the film from a 26-year-old Steven Soderbergh in 1989 that put the festival on the proverbial map, reshaping the American cinema scene. "Sex, Lies" went on to international acclaim (it won top honors at Cannes) and became an astonishingly lucrative global hit; it also helped turn its American distributor, Miramax Films, into a major player.
What happened next was weird, sometimes great and sometimes completely nuts. The festival blew up, the mainstream invaded, stars descended, the paparazzi swarmed, and the major studios formed (and later shuttered) a number of specialty divisions. Indiewood became a thing, for better and occasionally worse. Sundance didn't invent independent cinema, which has always existed and often struggled in the shadow of the mainstream. What the festival did was give a type of market-ready independent movie a cohesive, media-exploitable, commercially friendly identity that worked both for audiences and Hollywood.
Given Soderbergh's history with Sundance it was fitting that he was back this year with "Presence," one of the strongest, most formally audacious selections in the program. Once again, he has teamed up with the screenwriter David Koepp for a smart, playful and pleasurable nail-biter that -- much like their last joint effort, "Kimi" (2022) -- makes witty use of a restricted physical space. This new collaboration, set entirely inside a rambling family home, is at once an involving domestic melodrama and a chilling -- emotionally and otherwise -- haunted-house story.
The director Rose Glass ("Saint Maud") clearly had a rollicking good time making "Love Lies Bleeding," an expressionistic thriller with pooling shadows and blood. In yet another American dead end, a classic nowheresville with a looming force of evil (a hilariously bewigged Ed Harris) and conveniently deserted streets (which makes moving corpses easy), a gym worker (Kristen Stewart) and a bodybuilder (Katy O'Brian) hook up and spiral into disaster. The story riffs on a familiar setup in which beautiful love-struck outsiders can't do right because they must do diverting wrong. To quote the tagline for one infinitely better precursor, "Bonnie and Clyde": "They're young ... they're in love ... and they kill people."
There were all manner of emanations at this year's festival, but I was more struck by the cascades of tears generated by male characters, including in "Rob Peace" and "Exhibiting Forgiveness." Written and directed by the British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor (who adapted it from a book by Jeff Hobbs), "Rob Peace" dramatizes the harrowing, infuriatingly unfair life story of its titular character (a very moving Jay Will), a brilliant New Jersey kid who charted a course from a poor neighborhood to a prep school and Yale. Filled with richly inhabited performances, especially from its young cast, the movie is a take on the classic American striver, though one haunted by family (Ejiofor plays the father) and profound generational trauma.
André Holland stars in "Exhibiting Forgiveness," another drama about the ties that can bind and nearly destroy sons and fathers, which was written and directed by the visual artist Titus Kaphar. The story kicks in after Holland's character, a successful painter named Tarrell, receives an unwanted, psyche-rocking visit from his long-estranged abusive father (John Earl Jelks).
As the characters circle each other warily and angrily, Kaphar explores what it means to survive great personal hardship in an equally brutal country. Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor is wasted as Tarrell's mother and there are awkward passages (and ungainly writing), but Holland and Jelks are lovely, and they flatten you emotionally.
A few other movies did a number on my tear ducts, including "Between the Temples," Nathan Silver's wistful, often very funny comedy about a widowed cantor (Jason Schwartzman) whose crisis of faith is derailed when a former teacher (a peerless Carol Kane) re-enters his life. A prime example of what I think of as the comedy of Jewish discomfort à la Albert Brooks, the movie explores identity with humor and not an ounce of sentimentality.
It would make a fitting double bill with "A Real Pain," a touching, beautifully acted, laugh-laced drama about two cousins -- played by a brilliant Kieran Culkin and Jesse Eisenberg, who also wrote and directed -- on a trip to Poland. An exploration of family, faith, loss and the enduring trauma of the Holocaust, the movie is a knockout -- I can't wait to see it again.

Some Like It Hot, but Others Love to Burn: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Our TV critic recommends a wild and wide-ranging documentary series about the world of hot pepper enthusiasts.
Documentaries about niche subcultures abound: dog dancing, science fairs, yo-yos. Few if any include as much on-screen vomiting as the Hulu series "Superhot: The Spicy World of Pepper People," but then, few cover quite as much ground.
"Pepper" follows the overlapping pursuits of a handful of pepper enthusiasts, whose interests lie in the hottest of the hots, peppers that induce sweating, crying and retching within minutes. Some of the featured subjects are more into the horticultural side, while others are more into online public masochism. Many acknowledge the overlap between drug use and pepper-eating, that the thrill of spiciness has replaced more dangerous and illicit substances in their lives, that once they found peppers, capsaicin became their drug of choice.
The try-hard glibness of a lot of the narration (voiced by Ben Schwartz) undercuts the show's more intriguing ideas, as if "Pepper" didn't always know what it has. This is, deeply, a show about social media, about being famous to 15 people, about the rush and reality of online connections. It is also about the ways in which consuming too much internet narrows your vision and imagination, until you forget that posting is not the same thing as existing. It's a big world out there, filled almost entirely with people who have never heard of any of your heroes and never will.
Much like the featured growers who combine strains to cultivate extreme heat, "Pepper" combines documentary and reality formats to keep its 10 episodes moving. Early on, the show's most endearing heroine, a Chicago nurse, "comes out" to her co-worker pals about her pepper and hot sauce hobby. It's a scene straight out of "Queer Eye" or any number of real estate shows, an awkward party where a teary sweetheart receives support. Another episode is knockoff "Top Chef," with people vying for a chance to develop a hot sauce for a food chain. (I'm genuinely surprised this was not developed as its own stand-alone show.)
The segments about competitive pepper-eating mirror every sport documentary, with sage champions eventually compensating for their relentlessness by turning to Buddhist philosophy to help with "managing desire." When some growers become extra suspicious about thievery and back-stabbing, "Pepper" apes Netflix's true crime aesthetics.
"Pepper" opts for breadth instead of depth, and what it lacks in insight it makes up for in volume of people calling each other "brother." This is a series with experts who joke about putting toilet paper in the freezer, so maybe it isn't reasonable to expect some mention that humans have been fascinated by altered states and ritualized body mortification throughout history. Fair enough. There's still more than enough heat here for a fun, edifying ride. (Again, though: lots and lots of throwing up.)

Big Oscar Surprises And Snubs: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: It was a strong year for female directors overall, though the academy still seems to frown on younger male actors.
Though "Oppenheimer" made an explosive showing when the Oscar nominations were announced on Tuesday morning, plenty of other would-be contenders failed to launch. As your Projectionist, here's my analysis of the morning's biggest surprises and omissions.
Greta Gerwig misses a directing nomination.
With her billion-dollar blockbuster, "Barbie," Greta Gerwig set a Hollywood record for the highest-grossing movie ever directed by a woman. Still, even that major milestone wasn't enough to earn her a spot in the Oscars' best director lineup: Though "Barbie" managed eight nominations, including best picture, Gerwig was snubbed by the directors branch that nominated her six years ago for "Lady Bird." It was a mixed showing overall for the hit comedy, which missed some other hoped-for nominations for cinematography, editing and best actress for Margot Robbie. But it did at least pull off a dark-horse supporting actress nod for America Ferrera alongside an expected supporting-actor nomination for Ryan Gosling.
An otherwise strong showing for female filmmakers.
For the first time in Oscar history, three of the best-picture nominees were directed by women: "Barbie," Celine Song's "Past Lives" and Justine Triet's "Anatomy of a Fall." Still, that landmark moment could have been lost in the furor if the directors branch had put forth a lineup made up entirely of men, as many pundits feared it might. Though Gerwig and Song were both snubbed for best director, at least the category found room for Triet, who'd previously won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for her twisty legal drama.
Young male actors still can't break through.
The academy has never had a problem nominating young actresses: In fact, seven of the 10 actresses recognized this year are 40 or under. That same interest in ingénues does not apply to the male categories, however. Despite worthy contenders in the mix like Charles Melton ("May December") and Dominic Sessa ("The Holdovers"), all 10 of the actors nominated were over 40, further proof that the Oscars prefer their men more grizzled if they're meant to be taken seriously.
Nobody pulled a Riseborough.
Last year, the actress Andrea Riseborough employed a new kind of Oscar bid: Instead of waging a costly, monthslong awards campaign for her performance in the microbudget indie "To Leslie," her team waited until the weeklong Oscar-voting window opened, then leveraged a group of famous friends that included Edward Norton, Gwyneth Paltrow and Sarah Paulson to tout the movie en masse on social media. It worked, earning Riseborough a surprise best actress nomination, and though she sought to pay it forward last week by throwing her muscle behind Ava DuVernay's underseen "Origin," the film was snubbed by the academy, while all 20 acting slots went to performers who had campaigned the old-fashioned way.
Romance was in the air.
Hey, was this Oscar-nomination morning or Valentine's Day? At least six couples scored his-and-hers nominations today, including the "Oppenheimer" director Christopher Nolan and his producer wife, Emma Thomas; the "Anatomy of a Fall" director Justine Triet and her partner and co-writer, Arthur Harari; the "May December" co-writers Samy Burch and Alex Mechanik; and Jared and Jerusha Hess, the directors of the animated short "Ninety-Five Senses." "Barbie" was responsible for the other two pairs of lovebirds, with Gerwig and her husband, Noah Baumbach, nominated in the adapted-screenplay category and Margot Robbie and her husband, Tom Ackerley, earning nominations as the film's producers.
Leonardo DiCaprio gets snubbed
As the nominations were read, "Killers of the Flower Moon" waxed and waned: Martin Scorsese's period drama earned key nods for picture, director, actress (Lily Gladstone) and supporting actor (Robert De Niro), but missed an expected nomination for adapted screenplay and extended a continuing snub of lead actor Leonardo DiCaprio that began with the Screen Actors Guild. Still, the film did make Oscar history in several categories, as Gladstone became the first Native American nominated for best actress and Scorsese's 10th directing nomination helped him pull ahead of Steven Spielberg as the most-nominated living director of all time.
Wes Anderson in, Pedro Almodóvar out.
Members of the short-film branch can often be hostile to directors they perceive as dilettantes, doling out snubs in recent years to big names like Taylor Swift (for "All Too Well: The Short Film") and Pedro Almodóvar (for his Tilda Swinton short "The Human Voice") in favor of lesser-known filmmakers struggling to break through. This year, voters from other branches were allowed to volunteer their services to nominate films for best live-action short, and this expanded group allowed in Wes Anderson, whose miniature "The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar" bowed on Netflix in the fall. Almodóvar was not so lucky, snubbed once again for his western "Strange Way of Life," starring Pedro Pascal and Ethan Hawke.
A last dance for 'Barbie.'
"Barbie" might have scored one more nomination if it weren't for a rule change introduced in 2008 that forbade any film from placing more than two nominees in the original-song category. Though three of the tunes from "Barbie" qualified for the original-song shortlist announced in December -- Dua Lipa's disco-infused "Dance the Night," the Ryan Gosling-sung "I'm Just Ken" and Billie Eilish's ballad "What Was I Made For?" -- only the latter two made it in. At least Lipa can console herself with the tune's recent Grammy nomination for song of the year.
Godzilla stomps into visual effects
The visual-effects category is typically dominated by mega-budget Hollywood productions, but the hit Japanese import "Godzilla Minus One" made it into the race this year alongside big-studio fare like "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3," "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One" and "Napoleon." Not bad for a foreign-language film with a budget rumored to be under $ 15 million. When Godzilla roars, even the academy has to listen.

'Oppenheimer' Leads With 13 Oscar Nods: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Oscar voters lined up behind a classic studio blockbuster on Tuesday, giving 13 nominations to Christopher Nolan's "Oppenheimer," the most of any movie, and setting up the long-awaited coronation of Nolan as Hollywood's leading filmmaker. It was a shift from recent years, when the academy fixated on unconventional art films unseen by most Americans.
No film by Nolan has ever been named best picture and, despite five previous nominations, he has never personally won an Oscar. Nolan received his second nomination for directing on Tuesday, the first coming in 2018 for his complex "Dunkirk." He was also nominated for his "Oppenheimer" screenplay.
The recognition for "Oppenheimer" (Universal Pictures) had been expected. But the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences threw surprises into all of the other major categories.
"Barbie" broke two heels, failing to score a directing nomination for Greta Gerwig or a best actress berth for Margot Robbie. On the upside, "Barbie" (Warner Bros.) figured somewhat unexpectedly into the supporting actress category, with America Ferrera receiving her first nomination for playing a harried mother in the film. The film received eight nominations overall, including for best picture and for the adapted screenplay by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach.
Voters recognized Colman Domingo's lead performance as a brilliant yet flawed political organizer in "Rustin," while excluding Leonardo DiCaprio ("Killers of the Flower Moon"), a seven-time nominee and one-time winner, from the best actor race. In the supporting actor field, Sterling K. Brown received his first nomination for his performance as a chaos-inducing cosmetic surgeon in "American Fiction," while Willem Dafoe ("Poor Things") was denied a nomination.
Here's what else you need to know:
"Poor Things," a twist on the Frankenstein story from Searchlight Pictures, received the second-largest number of nominations -- 11 -- including one for best picture.
Joining in the best picture category were smaller, character-driven films like "American Fiction," a satire about a writer who puts together a novel that turns on racial stereotypes; "Anatomy of a Fall," a legal drama set in the French Alps and partly filmed in French; "The Holdovers," a bittersweet period comedy set at an American prep school; "Maestro," a divisive black-and-white examination of the conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein's personal life; "Past Lives," a romance filmed partly in Korean; and "The Zone of Interest," set in the shadow of Auschwitz during the Holocaust.
"Barbie" and "Killers of the Flower Moon," which collected $ 156 million worldwide, rounded out the category.
Joining Domingo as best actor contenders were Bradley Cooper ("Maestro"), Paul Giamatti ("The Holdovers"), Cillian Murphy ("Oppenheimer") and Jeffrey Wright ("American Fiction").
Annette Bening ("Nyad"), Lily Gladstone ("Killers of the Flower Moon"), Sandra Hüller ("Anatomy of a Fall"), Carey Mulligan ("Maestro") and Emma Stone ("Poor Things") were nominated for best actress. That meant that Greta Lee ("Past Lives"), Fantasia Barrino ("The Color Purple") and, most notably, Robbie were left off the list in a year that was quite strong in terms of roles for women over all. Gladstone became the first Native American performer to receive an acting nomination.
Along with Brown, the best supporting actor nominees were Robert De Niro ("Killers of the Flower Moon"), Ryan Gosling ("Barbie"), Mark Ruffalo ("Poor Things") and Robert Downey Jr. ("Oppenheimer"), who is considered the front-runner.
Rounding out the best supporting actress nominees were Emily Blunt ("Oppenheimer"), Danielle Brooks ("The Color Purple"), Jodie Foster ("Nyad") and Da'Vine Joy Randolph ("The Holdovers"), who is seen as the favorite.
The increasingly international academy gave a best director nomination to the French filmmaker Justine Triet, who directed and co-wrote "Anatomy of a Fall," a did-she-or-didn't-she legal thriller. Joining Triet and Nolan in the category were Jonathan Glazer ("Zone of Interest"), Yorgos Lanthimos ("Poor Things") and Martin Scorsese ("Killers of the Flower Moon"), who passed Steven Spielberg to become the most-nominated living director, with 10 nods.
Through its various divisions, Disney racked up 20 nominations, the most of any company. All told, however, technology companies dominated. Netflix received a total of 18, including honors for short films and a lone nomination for "May December" in the original screenplay race. Apple TV+ received 13 nods, with "Killers of the Flower Moon" receiving 10 and "Napoleon" earning three. Amazon's MGM division received five.
After a year that found the movie industry hobbled for months by dual strikes by writers and actors, ballots were cast from more than 90 countries, academy officials said. ABC will broadcast the 96th Academy Awards on March 10.
Viewership totals for the Oscars telecast perked up last year, reaching about 19 million. Only 10.4 million people watched the pared-down pandemic edition of the Oscars in 2021, setting off alarm bells within ABC and the entire entertainment industry. ABC and the academy are hoping that the popularity of "Oppenheimer," which collected $ 953 million worldwide, and "Barbie," with $ 1.4 billion in ticket sales, will give this year's telecast an added viewership boost.
Domingo subhead here
Domingo joined a rarefied club on Tuesday: With his nomination for his performance as the civil rights activist Bayard Rustin, he became only the second openly gay man to be nominated for playing a gay character. Ian McKellen was the first, in 1999, for "Gods and Monsters" and his portrayal of James Whale, the real-life director of the iconic 1930s horror films "Frankenstein" and "Bride of Frankenstein."
Andrew Scott was also considered a potential nominee for his heart-wrenching role as a gay screenwriter in "All of Us Strangers," but he was not recognized.
Over the decades, many straight male actors have earned Oscar nominations for playing L.G.B.T.Q. characters, and quite a few of them won a statuette: William Hurt won in 1986 for portraying a transgender woman in "Kiss of the Spider Woman"; Tom Hanks in 1994 for his role as a lawyer dying of AIDS in "Philadelphia"; Sean Penn in 2009 for playing Harvey Milk in "Milk"; Jared Leto in 2014 for playing a transgender woman in "Dallas Buyers Club"; Rami Malek in 2019 for his turn as Freddie Mercury in "Bohemian Rhapsody"; and last year, Brendan Fraser for playing a 600-pound gay man in "The Whale" -- to name a few.
On Tuesday, that list also grew longer with the nomination of Cooper for his role as the storied American conductor Leonard Bernstein in "Maestro." Bernstein had relationships with both men and women, and the film focuses primarily on Bernstein's personal life.
Gladstone subhead here
Gladstone's nomination for "Killers of the Flower Moon" makes her the first Native American person to contend for a competitive acting Academy Award. In the film, she plays Mollie Burkhart, an Osage woman whose white husband is part of a murderous conspiracy.
Gladstone, 37, who has Blackfeet and Nez Percé heritage, isn't the first Indigenous artist to earn a best actress nomination -- Keisha Castle-Hughes ("Whale Rider," 2003) and Yalitza Aparicio ("Roma," 2018) were also nominated in the same category -- but she is the first from the United States. The folk singer Buffy Sainte-Marie is considered the first Indigenous person to win an Oscar (for best song, "Up Where We Belong" from "An Officer and a Gentleman," in 1983), but her heritage has recently been disputed. And in 2019, Wes Studi, who is Cherokee American, was given an honorary Oscar for "his indelible film portrayals and for his steadfast support of the Native American community."
Gladstone has had a busy first month of 2024: On Jan. 7, she became the first Indigenous person to win a Golden Globe for best actress, delivering a powerful speech in which she spoke a few lines in the Blackfeet language. She also picked up a best actress win from the New York Film Critics Circle, as well as nominations from the Critics Choice Awards and the Screen Actors Guild.

Broadway Is on Horizon For 'Patriots': [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The play, by Peter Morgan of "The Crown," will star Michael Stuhlbarg and is scheduled to open in April.
"Patriots," a well-received British play about a Russian oligarch's ill-fated role in the rise of Vladimir V. Putin, will transfer to Broadway in April, adding a dose of international intrigue to a packed spring season.
The drama, which the critic Matt Wolf called "gripping" and "coolly unnerving" in a 2022 review of a London production for The New York Times, was written by Peter Morgan, the creator and primary writer of "The Crown," the Emmy-winning six-season Netflix show. Morgan has written two other plays that made it to Broadway, "The Audience," about Queen Elizabeth II, and "Frost/Nixon," about the journalist David Frost's famous interviews of former President Richard M. Nixon.
The Broadway production of "Patriots" will star Michael Stuhlbarg, who last appeared on Broadway in 2005, when he received a Tony nomination for starring in Martin McDonagh's "The Pillowman." Stuhlbarg has numerous stage credits, but most recently has worked in film ("A Serious Man") and television ("Boardwalk Empire"). Stuhlbarg will play Boris A. Berezovsky, a Russian business tycoon who helped Putin rise to power but then fell out with him and later died in exile. The role was played in London by Tom Hollander.
Stuhlbarg will star alongside Will Keen, who will play Putin, now the president of Russia; Keen also played that role in London, and for that performance won last year's Olivier Award for best supporting actor in a play. Luke Thallon will also reprise the role he played in London, as another Russian oligarch, Roman Abramovich.
The production is scheduled to begin previews April 1 and to open April 22 at the Barrymore Theater.
The play is directed by Rupert Goold, a British director who has twice been nominated for Tony Awards, for "Ink" and "King Charles III," and who will also be directing "The Hunt" at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn early this year. "Patriots" was staged in 2022 at the nonprofit Almeida Theater in London, where Goold is the artistic director, and last year it had a profitable commercial run in London's West End.
The lead producer of the Broadway production will be Sonia Friedman, who is a major force in both the West End and on Broadway.
The play will open in the final days of a Broadway season that is proving to be quite challenging for producers and investors because production costs are higher and ticket sales are lower than they were before the coronavirus pandemic. The economics have been especially hard for musicals. On Sunday evening, the producers of "How to Dance in Ohio," a musical about a group of young autistic adults, announced that show would close on Feb. 11, after 99 performances. And last week, the producers of "Harmony," a musical about a German singing group that ran afoul of the Nazis, announced that show would close on Feb. 4.

Proper Grammar, Punctuated With a Long-Awaited Kiss: [Society Desk]

Full text: After Molly Hunt matched with Harry Rimalower on Bumble, they went out to a bar -- Mr. Rimalower's first date since his separation.
Harry Tomás Rimalower was riding out a perfect storm on Dec. 18, 2022, when he matched with Margaret Anne Hunt on the dating app Bumble.
"I was getting a divorce, a new job and a new apartment," said Mr. Rimalower, 36, a lawyer at the Los Angeles office of Hanson Bridgett. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in visual and environmental studies from Harvard, and received a law degree from the University of Chicago.
That evening, when he received a notification that they had matched, he was watching a Netflix show with his parents at their condo in Beverly Hills, where he was staying while on the hunt for a new apartment. (He found one a week later.)
"Hi" is all Dr. Hunt, 38, a psychologist who goes by Molly, messaged him on the app, which requires women to make the first move.
[Click here to binge read this week's featured couples.]
Dr. Hunt is a co-director of Santa Monica Psychology Group in Santa Monica, Calif. She graduated with a bachelor's in human biology from Stanford, and received a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of California, Los Angeles.
She had gone on around 100 dates, as many as five in one weekend, since her separation from her husband in 2021. She would be Mr. Rimalower's first date since he separated from his wife a few weeks earlier.
"His profile screamed newly single," Dr. Hunt said with a laugh. The tip-off: goofy photos, including one of Mr. Rimalower in a T-shirt that said, "Who needs mistletoe when you're this handsome?"
"Brb -- trying to think up a witty pickup line," Mr. Rimalower replied to her in the app. He skimmed her dating profile, which mentioned that she liked men who cared about their mental health and used proper grammar.
"My first thought is, think up how many ways I can use 'your' and 'you're' incorrectly in a sentence," he joked.
After they messaged back and forth for an hour, he plucked up the courage to ask her out for a drink.
Her prerequisite, though, was a video chat.
"I was a ball of nervous energy," he said, while she was so jaded by video chatting that she showed up with her hair still wet from a shower.
He was relieved to learn that she was divorced after he told her he was getting one. He then tried to address another elephant in the room.
"I awkwardly asked, 'What are you looking for?"' he said, to which she replied, "I'm on the fast track to marriage and kids." So was he.
That Friday, they met at Melrose Umbrella Company, a bar in West Hollywood, where she had a holiday eggnog drink and he had a gingery Melrose mule.
"She walked in just as beautiful in person as her photos," Mr. Rimalower said.
Later, to keep the conversation going, they first stopped by her apartment nearby. There, Dr. Hunt changed into comfortable shoes and Mr. Rimalower met her Golden British shorthair kitten, Twyla.
"He was smart and funny and easy to be with," said Dr. Hunt, who took an Uber home after walking him to his parents' condo. "He had an extra level of attunement. He seemed insightful about people."
A week later, they went to Toku Unagi & Sushi, a Japanese restaurant specializing in eel -- a fish Dr. Hunt likes so much that Mr. Rimalower found a restaurant specializing in it. During dinner, she mentioned that she "really liked Ralph Fiennes," the actor.
"Have you seen the absurd rom-com with him in the lead opposite Jennifer Lopez?" he asked her, referring to the movie "Maid in Manhattan."
Dr. Hunt had not. So they watched it at her apartment.
"I'm feeling pressure to make a move," Mr. Rimalower, who said he's "no Lothario," recalled thinking during the film. "This would be a challenge even if it wasn't a first kiss in seven years."
His dilemma was solved when they decided to bet on the year the movie came out: If he guessed right, he would kiss her. If she did, well, then she would kiss him. (He guessed right: 2002).
"I was pleasantly surprised at how much chemistry we had," she said.
After they each spent a rainy New Year's Eve with friends the next evening, she stopped by his new apartment in Hancock Park to celebrate with Champagne. They soon began dating exclusively.
"How much time would you like to spend together?" she asked a few weeks later. His reply: "As much as possible," to which she said, "How about every night?"
So they broke their leases and moved into a three-bedroom apartment in West Hollywood together in late April.
"It made our relationship better and stronger," he said.
On Dec. 1, 2023, he proposed at Dante, an Italian Mediterranean restaurant with a view of the Hollywood Hills.
"December, it's the most romantic month," he said, so nervous that he then forgot to ask, "Will you marry me?" But she got the message after he pulled out a ring and said yes.
On Jan. 6, Lucy Rimalower, the groom's sister, who became a Universal Life minister for the occasion, officiated before 32 guests at A.O.C., a restaurant in Los Angeles, where the groom stepped on a glass in keeping with the Jewish tradition. The bride, who is taking the groom's name, had placed her maternal great-grandmother's gold flower pearl pin onto the ribbon of her wedding bouquet.
"Sustaining a marriage takes work and compromise," he said over the phone during their honeymoon in Punta Mita, Mexico, as a coati with a long, striped tail tried to enter their suite through the sliding glass terrace door. "We are fundamentally on the same page."

Spelman Gets a Record $100 Million Donation: [National Desk]

Full text: The donation to the private school in Atlanta is believed to be the largest ever to an H.B.C.U.
Spelman College, the women's school in Atlanta, announced on Thursday that it had received a $ 100 million donation, which its officials called the largest-ever single gift to a historically Black college.
The gift comes from Ronda E. Stryker, a trustee of Spelman, and her husband, William D. Johnston, chairman of the wealth management company Greenleaf Trust. Ms. Stryker serves as director of the medical equipment company Stryker Corporation, which was founded by her grandfather.
In an announcement, Spelman College said that $ 75 million of the gift had been earmarked for scholarships, and that the remaining money would go toward improving student housing and developing an academic focus on public policy and democracy.
In a statement, Spelman's president, Helene Gayle, said the college was "invigorated and inspired" by the couple's generosity, adding, "This gift is a critical step in our school's mission to eliminate financial barriers to starting and finishing a Spelman education."
Billionaires known for their education philanthropy, Ms. Stryker and her husband had previously donated $ 30 million to the college.
Along with her husband, Ms. Stryker, a former special education teacher in Kalamazoo, Mich., also endowed a medical school at Western Michigan University, a school that the couple attended, and made a major gift to Harvard. Ms. Stryker has served as a trustee of Spelman College since 1997.
Ms. Stryker could not be reached for comment. But in a statement, she said: "It's important to me that all women be provided an opportunity to explore their talents, challenge their self-doubts and realize the power of achieving individual success."
Spelman is one of only two all women, historically Black colleges and universities.
Philanthropists have increasingly focused on H.B.C.U.s and other Black nonprofit organizations after the murder of George Floyd in 2020, which ignited a national reckoning on race.
Last week, the United Negro College Fund announced that it had received a $ 100 million grant from the Lilly Endowment that would be used to fund 37 Black colleges, including Spelman and its companion men's school, Morehouse College.
The two colleges were also among those that had received major gifts from the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who has donated more than $ 500 million to H.B.C.U.s in recent years. In 2020, Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix, and his wife, Patty Quillin, also donated $ 120 million to Spelman, Morehouse and the United Negro College Fund.
Spelman and Morehouse are among the better-known and most prestigious of the about 100 American colleges regarded as historically Black, a designation meaning that the schools were formed to educate Black students before the Civil Rights Act of 1964, when many colleges and universities barred their admission.

The Roys Put a Price on Everything. So Did Their Fans.: [Style Desk]

Full text: Bidding on memorabilia from the Emmy-winning drama ended on Saturday, drawing over $ 600,000 in total sales. A viciously mocked tote bag was among the auction's most expensive items.
An auction house in Dallas that is usually stocked with fine art and rare baseball cards now holds a six-foot dog mascot suit last seen in Episode 1 of the HBO drama "Succession." Audiences may recall a nauseated Cousin Greg (Nicholas Braun) putting on the costume and puking through its eyeballs.
The item has been thoroughly cleansed of prop vomit, according to auction staff members, and is now among 236 lots of memorabilia from the show that were sold on the Heritage Auctions website on Saturday. The furry mascot fetched just over $ 7,800.
"Even the eyeholes are mostly clean," said Robert Wilonsky, a spokesman for the auction house.
"Succession," the story of ultrawealthy siblings jockeying for control of their father's media empire, ended its four-season run in May and is up for 27 Emmys on Monday -- the most of any series. Fans and collectors wanting to own a piece of the show were able to bid on luxury suits worn by the show's cast or the vape pen puffed by its Season 4 antagonist, Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgard). Fear not: It comes with a charger.
The auction's most coveted item may have been a boxy Burberry tote ridiculed by Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen) when it is carried to a family event by an interloper. "She's brought a ludicrously capacious bag," he says. "What's even in there, huh? Flat shoes for the subway?"
The bag was viciously memed. On Saturday, it was among the auction's most expensive items, and sold for $ 18,750.
Other instruments of humiliation include the Vitamix blender used to douse Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) in Season 4 and the prop sausages from a hazing ritual in Season 2 called "boar on the floor." Taxidermy boars from the same scene could not be put up for auction because they are "kind of hard to store," said Monica Jacobs, a prop master for the show.
Even the most mundane props could take weeks to create, Ms. Jacobs said. Credit cards were fabricated specifically for the show -- don't get your hopes up, none of them work -- and handwritten speeches for a funeral scene were scrawled by a member of the show's art department. (Mr. Strong requested to write his own, she added.)
HBO has previously auctioned off props from the shows "Insecure" and "Watchmen," joining A24 and Netflix in a crowded field of Hollywood memorabilia auctions that can generate buzz -- and profits -- long after filming has wrapped.
Sales from the auction totaled $ 627,825, according to Heritage Auctions, and will be shared between HBO and the auction house.
Items for the auction were selected while Season 4 was being filmed in the early months of 2023, said Jax Strobel, a managing director in entertainment for Heritage Auctions. He was invited by HBO to snoop around sets in New York and earmark items -- say, the bayonet sword hanging on the wall of Logan Roy's office -- that should be set aside.
"What will a fan remember or recognize?" he said. "The things that show up often, or that have a special moment or memory attached."
Also up for auction were several of the costumes that helped spawn a frenzy over "stealth wealth" -- the subtle flexing of understated pieces that are in fact quite expensive. See: the brown Brunello Cucinelli blazer worn by Kendall in Season 2, which sold for $ 1,875.
The show's characters "stand for money," Michelle Matland, the costume designer, said in an interview last year. "They stand for affluence. They stand for position and posture."
Ms. Matland dressed them accordingly, beginning with their shoes, which she called "the most important article of clothing on a person's body." Her selections from brands including Prada, Saint Laurent and Lanvin appeared in the auction at various levels of wear and tear.
Some fans of the show grumbled on social media about the markup on a blue children's T-shirt from Walmart worn by Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin) in the series finale. The shirt and a corresponding pair of salmon shorts from Old Navy sold for $ 1,875.
Ms. Jacobs, the prop master, is encouraged that the show's carefully selected signifiers of wealth, status, self-absorption and poor taste are still being appreciated by fans.
Some of them were headaches to procure. She ordered around 20 dried scorpions for the paperweight that Tom gives to Shiv Roy (Sarah Snook) in Season 4, and reshaped their tails into "attack mode." She dried the scorpions in the oven of her apartment before one, cast in resin, enjoyed just a few seconds as a guest star on prestige TV.
The paperweight sold for $ 10,000. "My kitchen smelled terrible for a couple weeks," Ms. Jacobs said, "but it was worth it."

Full text: Here are the winners from the 75th Emmy Awards, which took place Monday night.
[ See all of our Emmys night coverage here. ]
With multiple awards each, "The Bear," "Succession" and "Beef" were the night's big winners at the 75th Emmy Awards, which was held at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Monday. Some notable first-time winners included Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri ("The Bear") and Steven Yeun and Ali Wong ("Beef"). And Elton John joined the EGOT club -- he now has an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony -- when he won the Emmy outstanding variety special for "Elton John Live: Farewell From Dodger Stadium."
The nostalgia-fueled ceremony, which was hosted by the "black-ish" star Anthony Anderson, was broadcast live on Fox and will be available to watch on Hulu beginning Tuesday. It was originally scheduled for September but was postponed because of the simultaneous Hollywood writers' and actors' strikes, one of the longest labor crises in the history of the entertainment industry. In September, the Writers Guild of America reached a deal with entertainment companies; and in November, SAG-AFTRA, the union representing tens of thousands of actors, followed suit -- agreements that allowed the awards show to go on.
These are this year's Emmy winners.

Emmys Left Eerie Feeling That Peak TV Is Passing Prime Time: [National Desk]

Full text: The Emmys on Monday night felt in many ways like a bookend to one of the defining features of the streaming era: a never-ending supply of new programming.
As "Succession" cast members marched up to the Emmy stage on Monday night to grab their statues for the show's final season, they used it as one last opportunity to say goodbye.
Kieran Culkin, after kissing his co-star Brian Cox on the lips, gave a tearful speech while accepting the award for best actor in a drama. Matthew Macfadyen and Sarah Snook, who each won acting awards as well, gave loving tributes to fellow cast members. And Jesse Armstrong, the creator of "Succession," capped off the night by accepting the best-drama award for the third and final time and noting: "We can now depart the stage."
It all punctuated an end-of-era feeling at the Emmy Awards on Monday night. "Succession" was one of many nominated shows that had farewell seasons, joined by a list that included "Ted Lasso," "Better Call Saul," "Barry," "Atlanta" and "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel."
But that was not the only reason that there was an elegiac theme to Monday night. The ceremony felt in many ways like a bookend to the so-called Peak TV era itself.
Nearly every year from 2010 through 2023, the number of TV programs rose in the United States, reaching 599 scripted television shows last year.
It may never hit those heights again.
For more than a year now, studios and networks -- including streaming giants like Netflix, cable stalwarts like HBO and FX, and the broadcast channels -- have hit the brakes on ordering new series. Executives, worried about hemorrhaging cash from their streaming services, customers cutting the cable cord and a soft advertising market, have instead placed more emphasis on profitability. The monthslong screenwriter and actor strikes last year also contributed to the slowdown.
With a more frugal approach, there is widespread fear throughout the industry about the fallout from a contraction.
The Emmy nomination submission list gives a snapshot. The number of dramas that the networks and studios submitted for Emmy consideration dropped 5 percent, according to the Television Academy, which organizes the awards. Entries for limited series fell by 16 percent, and comedies by 19 percent.
At after-parties on Monday night, there was considerable angst at just how much thinner the lineup would probably be for the next Emmys.
Some television genres seem to be in some degree of peril. Limited series -- six to 10 episodes shows that became a sensation over the past decade, particularly after the 2014 debut of "True Detective," the 2016 premiere of "American Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. Simpson" and the 2017 start of "Big Little Lies" -- have been a hallmark of the Peak TV era. The shows stood out in part because of the big stars and lavish budgets involved.
At the 2021 Emmys, the statue for best limited series was the final award presented. This had long been a designation for best drama, and it signaled an admission by organizers that the category had become television's most prestigious prize.
Not anymore.
As part of programming budget cuts, executives now see significantly less benefit to deploying lavish resources to a show that ends after a matter of weeks.
Once again, investing in series with lots of seasons is a much bigger priority. And there is a good chance that television may start to look a lot like television from a couple of decades ago.
Executives at Max, the Warner Bros. Discovery streaming service formerly known as HBO Max, are looking for a medical drama. "Suits," a 2010s legal procedural from the USA Network, became an unexpected streaming hit last summer, after millions of people began watching reruns of the show on Netflix. "Next year, you'll probably see a bunch of lawyer shows," Netflix's co-chief executive, Ted Sarandos, said at an investor conference last month.
To wit, Hulu recently ordered a project from the star producer Ryan Murphy that will chronicle an all-female divorce legal firm.
Of course, Peak TV-era quality television is not going away. "The Bear," the best-comedy winner and already the runaway favorite for the next Emmys, will return. Also coming back are "Abbott Elementary," the beloved ABC sitcom, and "The Last of Us," HBO's hit adaptation of a video game, which won a haul of Emmys.
Even the origin story of "Succession" seems tailor-made for the new television era. When HBO executives ordered the series, they wanted to put their spin on a classic television genre -- a family drama -- but had low expectations. The show did not command "Game of Thrones" or "Stranger Things" budgets. It was light on stars. Armstrong was not a brand name yet. And yet, it became a hit.
Less than an hour after the Emmys ceremony ended, when Armstrong was asked at a news conference what he would turn to next, he demurred.
Instead, he reflected on the past.
"This group of people, I don't expect to ever be repeated," he said, of "Succession." "I hope I do interesting work the rest of my life. But I'm quite comfortable with the feeling that I might not ever be involved with something quite as good."

Exploring the Surreal in a Mix of Dark Topics: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This month's picks include a bizarre Mexican-Spanish thriller, a Canadian drama about immigrants, a documentary set in a Parisian dance school and more.
'I Don't Expect Anyone to Believe Me'
Stream it on Netflix.
Hard-core pornography, international drug mafias and a doctoral candidate's literary explorations of critical gender theory: True to its title, this dark comedy, adapted from a novel by Juan Pablo Villalobos, involves such a bizarre mishmash of references and tones that it stretches plausibility -- albeit to wonderfully entertaining ends.
The madness begins when Juan Pablo, a student in Mexico, is accepted into a Ph.D. program in Barcelona. After an unexpected call from his troublesome cousin, things take a shocking and bloody turn. Juan Pablo is still on the path to a Ph.D., but now at the mercy of a murderous gangster. He is made to follow a series of strange instructions -- including changing thesis topics and attempting an affair with a lesbian classmate -- whose rationale remains a mystery to our unfortunate hero (and to the viewers) until the very end.
A modern, noir-infused twist on Surrealist literature and cinema, "I Don't Expect Anyone to Believe Me" makes less sense as a narrative than as a string of expertly constructed moments with their own internal logic. Every self-contained scene or bit -- be it Juan Pablo's mother's recurring voice messages, full of insults veiled as love, or the friendship his girlfriend develops with an Italian vagabond -- is densely packed with references, gags and deadpan performances, keeping the film balanced on the razor's edge of irony and pathos. It all adds up to a melancholy allegory about the unpredictability of life and writers' futile ambitions to lend it order and meaning.
'So Much Tenderness'
Stream it on the Criterion Channel.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This gorgeous drama by Lina Rodriguez begins with two quiet, stark bits of exposition. A dark-haired woman gets into the trunk of a car, and a couple, with two toddlers in tow, drives the vehicle across a border checkpoint. Next, we see the woman, Aurora (Noëlle Schönwald), at an interview with an officer, explaining the violent circumstances that led her to flee Colombia and seek asylum in Canada, leaving her daughter temporarily behind.
After that point, "So Much Tenderness" never concerns itself with the how of Aurora and her daughter Lucia's circumstances. The film unfolds as a series of vignettes that drop us into different points in the duo's lives: Aurora teaches Spanish at a language class; Lucia stocks grocery items at a supermarket; they each go on dates with different men. The knotty bureaucracy of immigration -- hearings, permits, the process of assimilation -- is elided; instead, we are suspended in these recent immigrants' quotidian experiences. Yet a tension is always palpable -- not just in the brief flashbacks of Aurora's memories or the mysterious figure from her past she spots around town, but also in that unspoken feeling of unsettlement that sticks like lint to the characters' uprooted lives.
'Rookies'
Stream it on Ovid.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In a high school in France, teenage dancers -- many of them from the banlieues -- make politics and poetry with their bodies. From the very first set piece in "Rookies," a documentary about the dance troupe at the Turgot school in Paris, the kineticism of its diverse class is palpable. The camera captures a hip-hop battle as a rush of close-ups of limbs, popping and locking and swaying energetically. But what lends gravity to these scenes of movement is the commentary from the students that the directors, Thierry Demaizière and Alban Teurlai, weave throughout.
Turgot has removed geographical zoning restrictions for this course, meaning that kids from all over the city, from various economic and racial backgrounds, mingle together. Talking-head interviews and intimate exchanges between teachers and students bring to the fore all the meanings these young people infuse into dancing. For some, moving their bodies with confidence is a feminist awakening; for others, the classes form a utopian bubble in a deeply divided world; and for yet others, it's outright salvation.
'Chithha'
Rent or buy it on Amazon Prime Video.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Be warned before you read any further that this Tamil-language thriller is best watched with minimal context; its pleasures lie in its myriad surprises and twists, deployed with precision by the director, S.U. Arun Kumar. But if you need more persuasion, here's a tease.
In a small town in Southern India, a young man, Eeswaran (Siddharth), lives with his sister and raises his 8-year-old niece, Sundari (Sahasra Sree), with tender -- and often overprotective -- paternal care. The first half of "Chithha" is a sweet portrait of this uncle-niece relationship, with sparkling performances by both actors. But every now and then, smatterings of menace and suspense interrupt these charming goings-on and scramble our bearings. There's the woman from Eeswaran's past who has re-emerged in town, and with whom he exchanges resentful glares; there's also a specter of sordid sexual violence that eventually takes over the narrative.
If "Chithha" offers the satisfactions of the classic revenge thriller, driven by the nobly enraged hero, its strength lies in how it also undercuts these tropes to offer a sharp critique of male saviorism. Come for the chills and kills, but stay for the sobering lesson on the reality of a woman's life in a man's world.
'Phases of Matter'
Stream it on Mubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Documentaries about hospitals -- those strange, liminal spaces poised between life and death -- are having a moment. Just last year, Claire Simon's "Our Body" and Véréna Paravel and Lucien Castaing-Taylor's "De Humani Corporis Fabrica" offered two distinct but equally riveting portraits of medical institutions, and how they bring together the most bureaucratic and existential aspects of human life. The director Deniz Tortum adds to that oeuvre with "Phases of Matter," an eerie portrait of a state-run hospital in Turkey.
Throughout the film, the curious camera takes several vantage points. Positioned outside the hospital, it gazes at a corridor with large glass windows that reveal moments of contemplation -- like a man staring wistfully at the sky -- among the harried traffic of staff and patients. Inside, it peers over the shoulders of surgeons in operating rooms as they cut open bodies, or hovers in the lunchroom, where doctors chat casually about matters of disease and mortality. In one incredible sequence, the lens careens out of an OT in crisis, and makes its way into the sinister, deserted basement, which houses the morgue. Within the four walls of the hospital, Tortum captures the entire drama of life, in all its urgency and banality.

Breaking Free From the 'User Experience': [Review]

Full text: An experiment in digital disengagement prompts Kyle Chayka to consider how technology has narrowed our choices and dulled the culture.
FILTERWORLD: How Algorithms Flattened Culture, by Kyle Chayka
This dispatch began from an uptown location of Dig (formerly Dig Inn), a small chain of "fast casual" restaurants headquartered in New York City. The walls are white-painted brick, the tables are marble and the cardboard bowls are packed with colorful, healthy foodstuffs. Only the insipid pop music that blares through the speakers discourages lingering.
After reading Kyle Chayka's new book, "Filterworld," I understood more thoroughly and ruefully why I had chosen, or thought I'd chosen, to go there -- and not, say, to the more idiosyncratic, local Eli's down the street, with its delicious if overpriced turkey chili, absence of Wi-Fi, and eccentric neighborhood dowagers rustling the cellophane.
No shade to Dig (no shade would be possible anyway given all those gold-stemmed hanging lamps) but everything about the place, including lopping the cute pun from its name, has been optimized for the phone: this device that most of us have given up trying to resist or relinquish for something less powerful and just tiredly accept as an extension of our brains and bodies. Dig's food, our "feeds"; their appetizers, our apps -- they are all of a piece.
Chayka has visited a lot of establishments with a similar aesthetic, which he has dubbed AirSpace, like a Nike sneaker, for its geographically neutral comfort. His previous book was about minimalism as a response to the world's chaos; along with considering artists, composers and entrepreneurs, his research included visiting rock gardens in Kyoto and floating in a sensory deprivation tank for an hour.
Here he has tried something more radical: an "algorithm cleanse," during which he cut himself off entirely from Twitter, Instagram, Spotify et al. for a few months. "FOMO was too light of a phrase," Chayka writes of his anticipatory dread. "I feared, against all evidence to the contrary, that not to be on social media in the constant way I had been, always participating in the communal feed, would be not to exist."
Spoiler alert: He survived. And has joined Threads now as well. (Hey, a writer's gotta make a living. The medium is the metrics.)
But even to type "spoiler alert" is an example of the language degradation, the slang and cliché, that social media has so dramatically accelerated. "Filterworld," which itself sounds like it could be an AirSpace cafe, is Chayka's term for how Big Tech shapes and limits our interests, corralling the chaos of the world into a pleasant "user experience." Amazon, Netflix and their ilk gather data from us semi-witting Acceptors of All Cookies, then chew it up and, like gigantic hovering mother birds, feed back more of what they calculate we'll like. Crumbs, mush: making our lives perhaps easier, but incalculably worse.
Trying to quiet "algorithmic anxiety" and 24-7 digital overwhelm, Chayka posits, we tend to take refuge in the average. "Our natural reaction is to seek out culture that embraces nothingness, that blankets and soothes rather than challenges or surprises, as powerful artwork is meant to do." His book urges us to throw off the blanket -- not easy when it's a $ 300 weighted Bearaby some influencer has convinced us is a necessity.
As an algorithm alternative, I can offer that if you liked Nicholas Carr's "The Shallows" and Jenny Odell's "How to Do Nothing," you'll probably be interested in "Filterworld" as well. Chayka distinguishes himself with his focus on the old-fashioned idea of taste, revisiting among many other works Pierre Bourdieu's "Distinction," the coppery-covered classic of sociology that many a college semiotician toted around ostentatiously in the '80s and '90s.
He wants to restore value to the act of curation, another word, with etymological origins in "caretaking," that has become increasingly cheapened. And so he walks through MoMA "like a medieval peasant traveling to a cathedral," but now with a professional curator; and meets with a beloved radio D.J. whose voice reminds him of "the green felt on a pool table": small acts of resistance, like me and my laptop migrating from Dig to the underfunded public library, against the online slide shows and playlists that dominate our days.
America has let the algorithm run amok -- as with sunscreen and child care, it seems, Europe is doing a better job regulating this -- so, Chayka suggests, we have to choose more conscionable platforms.
Unlike the cascade of content from strangers on the internet, "Filterworld," as a proper book will, evokes less transient impulses than genuine, lingering feelings: depression about our big-box corporate dystopia; admiration for Chayka's curiosity and clear writing style; dismay about the electrical engineering graduate -- electrical engineering! -- who can't get astrology out of her timeline and regrets being influenced to buy a pair of leg warmers. ("I just want to know if what I like is what I actually like," she tells him, plaintively.)
But it also made me feel old. Or -- let's put that another way -- acutely conscious of generational divides. Chayka, a millennial, is nostalgic for the binder of CDs he had as a teenager; the images he once shared on Tumblr; an earlier, jankier World Wide Web of illegal file-sharing, blogs and massive multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) forums. He first heard "My Favorite Things" not in "The Sound of Music" but the John Coltrane version, listening to an indie station as he wended his way back from a friend's house in the suburbs in the early '00s.
Boomers and Gen X, with more years logged algorithm-free, might find "Filterworld" unduly bleak; Zoomers, hopelessly naïve. Or, as they say on the internet, YMMV.

True Crime Repackages Trauma as Entertainment: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the 1990s you would have been hard-pressed to find someone who didn't know the name of my sister Polly Klaas. I was 6 years old when a stranger abducted 12-year-old Polly from our bedroom on the evening of Oct. 1, 1993. Her face quickly became a fixture on nightly news, her name featured prominently in headlines alongside fearmongering about crime rates. News crews broadcast from our living room and remained camped in front of our house during the two-month search before her body was found.
Though the media frenzy should have ended there, it only intensified, fueling a political climate primed for reactionary reprisal. Polly's kidnapping from our middle-class, white, suburban community triggered a national outcry for punishment and retribution.
In the next few years, true crime began to morph into the media obsession it is today. Last year, The Hollywood Reporter alerted its readers to "30 True-Crime Series to Binge Right Now." As I write this, nearly half of Apple's top 20 podcasts in the United States are devoted to true crime, and the internet is saturated with recommendations for the best new true crime books to read.
One might argue that this genre honors victims and those who solved or sought to solve the cases. However, as a survivor whose tragedy continues to be exploited by creators of true crime stories, I know the personal pain of this appropriation, as well as how coverage of these high-profile cases can contribute to broader injustices. The exploitation of victims' stories often carries a steep cost for their families as their tragedies are commodified and their privacy repeatedly violated for mass consumption.
In 2022, for instance, the release of "Dahmer -- Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story" on Netflix caused profound distress among many family members of Dahmer's victims, who felt that the show was profiting from their pain, misrepresenting actual events and retraumatizing those who had lived through the horror of Dahmer's crimes.
On top of those harms, the stories that don't fit with true crime's cultural emphasis on white female victimhood too often go untold.
Before my sister's murder, a version of what has become known as the three-strikes law was proposed in California. The measure called for a sentence of 25 years to life for almost any crime, no matter how minor, if the defendant had two prior convictions for crimes the law designated as serious or violent. The measure was initially seen as so unjustifiably harsh that it was swiftly rejected by the State Assembly's Public Safety Committee.
But Polly's case changed things in California. In the wake of our highly publicized tragedy and the murder of the 18-year-old Kimber Reynolds the previous year, politicians were able to leverage the grief of some victims' family members to revive their proposal, swiftly passing one of the harshest sentencing laws of the past century.
Since the law was enacted, over half the people sentenced under it were imprisoned for nonviolent crimes, and the law is applied disproportionately to people of color and people with mental illnesses and physical disabilities. Though the law was modified -- it now requires the third offense to be a serious or violent felony -- the law continues to glaringly amplify the institutional discrimination that targets communities of color and other marginalized groups.
It was difficult for me to feel a sense of justice in the years after Polly's death. Although her killer was caught and convicted, I grew up watching the brief beauty of my sister's life eclipsed by a political narrative that weaponized her innocence to propel an era of mass incarceration and true crime obsession.
Those early experiences showed me how sensationalist stories in the media about high-profile crimes not only erode the dignity of victims but also can inflate public perception of national crime rates, which have been in decline for decades. Misguided policies like three-strikes laws aren't merely unfortunate side effects of inflammatory discourse; they are the direct result of moral outrage curated by hyperbolic headlines and the pervasiveness of true crime's grisly method of storytelling.
True crime's narratives often concern themselves more with exacting vengeance than understanding what survivors need to heal and recover from unthinkable harm. They can animate our appetite for revenge and conflate justice with punishment when victims need and deserve so much more support than vengeance or punishment can offer. And yet a majority of survivors do not receive any victim compensation or referrals from the justice system to support services that are essential to trauma recovery.
Additionally, true crime stories frequently center on white female victims who were harmed by strangers. This overshadows the reality that Black Americans are more likely to be victims of homicide and that in cases in which a perpetrator is identified, a vast majority of homicides are committed by people known to the victims. The exploitation and erasure that slant true crime's bias toward sensational violence undermine our ability to address the systemic root causes of harm while estranging us from our empathy toward marginalized victims most affected by crime.
Although none of the content creators who went on to dramatize my sister's murder have ever asked me for consent, a few have reached out in recent years to ask me for my memories. In so doing, they often excitedly bombarded me with details about the case I didn't want to know, causing an onslaught of post-traumatic stress. I can recall the subsequent weeks that I spent lying awake at night, trying to quell the panic in my nervous system. How could I explain to these writers and producers that my memories of Polly are the only things I have left of her that haven't been exploited or extracted for public consumption? How could I convey the traumatic upheaval these books and shows could set off in my life and the lives of my loved ones? Would our pain matter to these people who claimed to care so much about justice and the welfare of victims?
An unfortunate result is that packaging trauma as entertainment ignores the diverse needs of victims. Whereas some true crime audiences may view victims and their families as a monolith crusading for punitive sentencing, a 2022 report by Alliance for Safety and Justice, an organization I work with, reveals that most of the survivors it surveyed favored rehabilitation and prevention over punishment. To truly dismantle cycles of harm, it is imperative to amplify survivors' stories on their own terms and earnestly embrace the safety solutions they are pioneering in their communities.
On our path to healing, my sister Jess Nichol and I started "A New Legacy" in memory of Polly, a podcast of conversations with community organizers and people harmed by three-strikes laws to explore how we can replace systems of punishment with systems of care. I also am a producer for the "Crime Survivors Speak" podcast, on which we amplify the insights and experiences of members of Crime Survivors for Safety and Justice, a survivor organization with nearly 190,000 members, to reduce incarceration and increase investments in crime prevention, trauma recovery and rehabilitation. Through this work, I've learned that when you truly listen to survivors, your heart rate should never be speeding up; it should be slowing down. This is how new dimensions of justice and healing become imaginable.

'A Lifelong Nightmare' in India's Archaic Courts: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: With 50 million criminal and civil cases pending, it would take 300 years to clear the country's judicial backlog.
When the armed men stormed into the village of lower-caste Indians, fanning out through its dirt lanes and flinging open the doors of its mud homes, Binod Paswan jumped into a grain silo and peered out in horror.
Within hours, witnesses say, upper-caste landlords massacred 58 Dalits, people once known as "untouchables," most of them farmworkers in the eastern state of Bihar who had been agitating for higher wages. Seven of them were members of Mr. Paswan's family.
The next day, he lodged a police complaint, and investigators soon filed charges. That was 26 years ago. He is still waiting -- after conflicting verdicts and hundreds of court hearings, with some witnesses now dead or impaired by fading eyesight -- for a resolution.
"A cry for justice turned into a lifelong nightmare for us," said Mr. Paswan, 45.
In a vast nation with no shortage of intractable problems, it is one of the longest-running and most far-reaching: India's staggeringly overburdened judicial system.
The country's economy is growing rapidly, technology is reshaping more than a billion lives and national leaders are striving for global power, but India seems to have few answers for the ever-deepening court backlogs that deprive citizens of their rights and hamper business activity.
More than 50 million cases are pending across the country, according to the National Judicial Data Grid -- a pileup that has doubled over the past two decades. At the current pace, it would take more than 300 years to clear India's docket.
There are many reasons for the backlogs. India has one of the world's lowest ratios of judges to population, with just 21 per million people, compared with about 150 in the United States. For decades, India's leaders and courts have set a target of 50 judges per million people. But there have been no sizable funding increases to hire more judges, improve court facilities and digitize procedures, as officials deem other priorities more important.
A rigid system with archaic rules inherited from the British also slows the process. Lawyers make endless oral arguments and produce lengthy written submissions. Little has changed even as government committees have recommended an end to the writing of testimonies by hand and to time-consuming procedures in examining witnesses.
Delays are endemic in both criminal and civil cases. About 77 percent of prisoners in India are awaiting trial, compared with one in three worldwide. Of the more than 11 million pending civil cases, most of which involve disputes over land or other property, nearly a quarter are at least five years old.
The country's longest-running legal dispute -- a bank liquidation case -- was settled last January after 72 years. In June, a 90-year-old man was given life in prison for his involvement in a 42-year-old case.
"What are we doing about resolving the issue? Frankly, nothing," Madan Lokur, a former Supreme Court judge, said in a recent interview.
"How long will it take to get a decision in your case?" he added. "If you're fortunate, maybe in your lifetime."
Judges churn through scores of cases every day, many of them nuisance filings by the government or citizens. Quick hearings lead to adjournments -- and the backlog grows.
India's government would seem to have a direct interest in easing the delays: It is the country's biggest litigant, accounting for nearly 50 percent of pending cases.
But successive administrations have used the courts' vulnerability as a political weapon. Fights between the judiciary and the executive branch over judicial appointments have reached new heights under the country's current leader, Narendra Modi, who critics say has largely cowed the courts as he consolidates power across India's institutions.
The Supreme Court remains a last resort for justice, but its judges are often bogged down by less-consequential matters like marriage or property disputes. When they do rule, the judges are increasingly seen as favoring the government, which has showered retirement perks on jurists who appear to toe the line, experts say.
And while opposition politicians and activists accused of crimes often languish for years in legal limbo, government supporters facing the same have an easier time getting bail.
The glacial pace of India's judiciary was evident one recent morning in Mathura, a town in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
Hundreds of plaintiffs and defendants wandered aimlessly through the court complex's crowded corridors, while lawyers holding papers under their arms took sips of hot milk and ginger tea.
In one corner, a lawyer and police officers joked with a milkman who had been accused more than a decade ago of selling adulterated products. The inspector who filed the case never appeared in court and was transferred from the town. The milkman, Mahender, who uses one name, has appeared at dozens of hearings anyway. The judge calls his name, the accused raises his hand, the inspector and a witness are absent, and another court date is assigned.
Even lawyers who become plaintiffs can struggle to navigate the system.
In 1999, an Indian Railways ticketing officer overcharged Tungnath Chaturvedi, a lawyer at the Mathura court, by 25 cents. Mr. Chaturvedi, 67, said he filed a case not because of the money, but because of the agent's attitude.
It took him 120 hearings over 23 years to get a verdict. Last year, a consumer court ordered the railway to pay a fine of about $ 188, as well as the outstanding amount of 25 cents, plus 12 percent interest. Still, Indian Railways went to the highest court in Uttar Pradesh, and it reduced the fine to $ 80.
"When I filed the case, I used to go up and down the five stories of the court every day to attend court hearings," Mr. Chaturvedi said. "When the judge delivered the verdict in my case, I was not able to walk from my home to the court because of arthritis. And I had already retired from work. That is the story of the Indian judiciary."
Many cases are far more serious than a small overcharge, and the toll on those waiting for justice is much greater.
In June 1997, Neelam Krishnamoorthy lost her two children, ages 17 and 13, in a fire at a New Delhi movie theater that killed 59 people.
Her struggle to get justice inspired a Netflix series and countless newspaper articles. Her activism led to improved fire safety measures in shopping malls and theaters.
Ten years after the fire, 16 men, including the cinema's owners and staff members and safety inspectors, were found guilty of negligence. Four of the men were already dead.
The two brothers who owned the theater, both powerful real estate barons, were given two years in prison, a sentence that Ms. Krishnamoorthy appealed to the Supreme Court. It did not rule until 2015, waiving the sentence and instead fining the brothers; Ms. Krishnamoorthy appealed again.
She continues to make the court rounds, now accusing the brothers of tampering with evidence.
"Had I known it would take more than two decades to even get bare minimum justice, I don't think I would have gone to court," Ms. Krishnamoorthy said. "I would have picked up a gun and shot the perpetrators; at least I would have got the sense of justice."
Justice has also been elusive for the victims of the 1997 village massacre in Bihar. In 2010, a court found 26 people guilty, giving 16 of them death sentences and the others life imprisonment. The men challenged the verdict in a higher court, and two years later, citing a lack of evidence, it acquitted all 26 defendants.
Mr. Paswan and a few other eyewitnesses filed an appeal at the Supreme Court in 2014. The case has come before the judges nine times, but Mr. Paswan has no idea what is going on.
Days after the massacre, Dalit leaders erected a red brick memorial just outside his home. The names and ages of the 58 people who died are inscribed in Hindi. Twenty-seven women -- eight of them pregnant -- and 16 children were among the dead.
"When I look at this memorial, I can hear cries of people for help," Mr. Paswan said. "It also serves as a constant reminder of injustice done to lower-caste people by the courts of this country."

Bracing for a Wave Of Ambivalence: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: In September, the night before the comic Taylor Tomlinson made her Radio City Music Hall debut, she called one of her three siblings in tears, asking: "Why do I feel like it's not enough?"
This emotional moment had long passed when she strode onstage the next day wearing a stylish black suit, sleeves rolled up, and commanded the cavernous room with an hour of cheerful, intricately woven jokes delivered at a fast clip. One theme was how professional success does not necessarily translate into personal happiness. She killed. The following afternoon, sitting outside at a Manhattan coffee shop near her hotel, Tomlinson described dispassionately how she cried before the career highlight of selling out Radio City. "There have been times when I thought I'm only good to people 40 feet away," she said.
Tomlinson, 30, who undertook her first theater tour just two years ago, has emerged as one of the most acclaimed, in-demand superstars in comedy, the rare young stand-up with mass appeal in the current fragmented landscape. After two Netflix specials produced in her 20s (and a third premiering next month), she became the only woman to make the top 10 grossing comic tours of 2023. She performed 130 shows, more than anyone else on that list, including Kevin Hart, who topped the list. And to follow that up, she is taking over the late-night TV slot vacated by James Corden on CBS, debuting Jan. 16 as the host of the comedy show "After Midnight."
I followed Tomlinson for 10 months, tracking the development of her new special, periodically seeing shows and debriefing her afterward. What I saw up close is that spending the year in and out of hotels is isolating, but so is being a rapidly ascendant comic at her level of success. "There sometimes feels like there isn't anyone my age to talk to," Tomlinson told me.
"IF YOU WANT to make yourself feel sad, compare your career to Taylor's," Dustin Nickerson, her good friend and the opening comic throughout her recent global tour, told me, before comparing her to a five-tool player in baseball who has all the skills to be great. "Watching her this past year has been watching someone become a celebrity."
The actor and comedian Hannah Einbinder described Tomlinson as "the voice of her, of our generation," before calling her the Taylor Swift of comedy. "She talks about universal experiences -- relationships, love -- but in a new way. She's the most evolved comic out there. She's for everyone." Einbinder paused, adding: "It's hard to be for everyone."
Tomlinson is too modest (and a die-hard Swiftie) to accept the comparison to the pop star, but it's a useful one. Just as Swift established herself in country music, Tomlinson, another blond, wholesome-seeming prodigy, began in a conservative niche: the church circuit. Both Taylors are prolific artists whose work resonates with broad swaths of people through personal stories, sometimes about ex-boyfriends.
Tomlinson began working on her new hour focusing on comedy about being single after many years of serial monogamy. Then she started seeing someone, so she incorporated him until they broke up, which she told me was inevitable because she was working on new material and Swift was putting out an album. "All the signs were there," she joked. "Those are my horsemen of the apocalypse."
After the split, an uncomfortable thought immediately occurred to her: This will be good for my career, bad for my life.
Around the time of the Radio City performance, she was interviewing for "After Midnight," a show built on a rotating cast of comics joking about memes or viral stories. She got the job in November, becoming one of the few comedians hosting a nightly show on network television, the kind of plum gig that has long been a Holy Grail for entertainers. Yet when the show's producers asked her in an interview why she wanted the job, Tomlinson said she responded: "I'm kind of lonely."
She has been open in her comedy about mental health issues, including a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and she has a joke where she says every one of her emotions "demands a parade." Onstage, you might say she often leads the marching band, which, incidentally, she performed in during high school. Mixing goofy act-outs with punch-line-dense jokes filled with surprising pivots, Tomlinson makes even the heaviest subjects seem spikily funny. Her sets never go long without a laugh.
Offstage, she has a more patient and coolly professional manner, impeccably grateful, remarkably free of kvetching and trash talk. She enjoys analyzing the mechanics of comedy and is at her most expansive there, in the details. But there is a certain haunted quality that periodically emerges, a past hovering over her present, one that she has been excavating in therapy.
"I stopped talking to my father last year," she said in a club in 2022, then noticed something shift in the crowd: "People get really sad when you say you don't talk to your parents anymore because they wish they had the balls to do it."
When I first met her, backstage at a February show in Boston, that bit was gone and she said she missed some of the heavier subject matter she used to include in her set, without being more specific. Some of that would creep back in, on the margins. One funny bit refers to taking a boyfriend to meet her parents as visiting "the scene of the crime."
Raised in a conservative Methodist family north of San Diego, she has talked about the scars left by her mother's death from cancer when Tomlinson was 8. It bonded her to her siblings, all of whom remain close. Brinn, two years younger than Taylor, the oldest, told me by phone that Taylor took the role of "surrogate parent."
Many comics come off as the reckless kid looking for attention, but part of what makes Tomlinson's comic persona different is that she projects the image of a responsible young adult who can't help but reveal the insecurities and bubbling emotions beneath. In the weeks before taping her special, she lost her voice, and only a few days before, her doctor told her she had mono. She took a steroid and did the show, brushing aside any possibility of postponing. "A lot of people have pushed through far worse," she told me not long after. "Maggie Smith had cancer when she filmed 'Harry Potter.' Like, I'm fine."
Her father has lately been a more remote figure in her comedy specials than her mother. He was, however, critical to her stand-up origin story. He not only drove her to a comedy class that got her started on this path. He also took the class with her when she was 16. In the show at the end of the course, with an audience of 40 at a hole-in-the-wall church, she got the closing spot. When asked why her father didn't, she said matter-of-factly: "'Cause I was better." Sensing how this might come off, she added: "Look, he can sing and I can't."
SINCE SHE WAS YOUNG, Tomlinson has known she wanted to do something creative, be an actor, a writer. But that first show was when, as she described it, the "real me" came out. Her best friend, Courtney Lem, was one of the audience members sitting on folding chairs that day and described the show as a revelation. "She was someone else, not nervous or shy," Lem told me. "It was like seeing real magic for the first time."
One of the jokes Tomlinson told eventually made its way into her first late-night set on "Conan." Its premise was that being abstinent was hard for a religious kid because "every time I miss a period, I'm like, 'Oh no, I'm carrying the messiah."'
When her mother died, her father remarried 10 months later. At the time, Tomlinson didn't think that was too soon, but as she got older, her mind-set shifted. "I've said to him as an adult: I wished you waited longer for us. He did not agree with me."
She described her childhood relationship with her father as rocky but felt on more solid ground after doing stand-up. "When I could do this trick, when I was a good performer, he was interested. And he was impressed. And I was somebody worth paying attention to."
In her telling, her father was a performer, a singer, who chose having a family and stable career as a teacher over pursuing his dreams. She was on the same path, she said, explaining that her entire family got married between the ages of 18 and 22. That was her plan, too. In college, she imagined marrying her religious boyfriend, having children and doing standup on the side. When her future husband broke up with her, he told her that she should keep doing comedy. It's a conversation she describes as formative, but not as much as her next boyfriend, a comic, saying she was funny but didn't work hard enough. "He's very funny and talented and I have a lot of jokes about him," she said. "Got a lot of closers out of that guy."
Her career took off soon after she left school for the college stand-up circuit, which led to a stint on "Last Comic Standing." At 23, she was booked on "Conan" and received a network development deal. Tensions between her past and future emerged. She lost a church gig over this tweet: "I'm a wild animal in bed, way more afraid of you than you of me." She eventually quit Twitter and stopped doing church gigs.
Her first exposure on Netflix, a 15-minute set in the 2018 series "The Comedy Lineup," was a turning point for her career and her relationship with her father and stepmother. "They liked the success but they didn't like what I was saying," she said. "They loved when I was clean. And when I did the 15 minutes, they were disappointed."
Over the past year, she's examined this part of her life in therapy and locates a lot of her trouble here. "There were times when I felt my self-worth is so tied up in this job and what I could do and why is that?" she said, then added, referring to her father, "A big part of it is I felt it impressed."
Paradoxically, Tomlinson is an introvert, uncomfortable in groups of people. Dustin Nickerson said she's the kind of person who wants to get invited to the party but won't attend. When asked when she's happiest, he mulled it over before saying: when she is making a connection with one person.
And yet her work has often resonated most when she digs into her own personal mess. She describes herself not as a topical or political comic, but as one who finds humor that other people can relate to by drilling down into her own life. Before putting out her second special, which dealt with mental illness and her mother's death, she showed it to her friend Lem, who was in town to help her move stuff out of a boyfriend's place after a breakup. Lem was amazed that she could be so open, asking, "How could you talk about this stuff?" Tomlinson recalled telling her, "I can't really help it."
She's trying to pick her spots more now. She describes her new special as "lighter" than her last one, though it's vulnerable in subtle ways, like how much it ingratiates or refuses to. She said she had been more sparing about what she reveals in podcasts and interviews. And the late-night show will, she hoped, provide a stabilizing force, a home base, a community where she will once again be a parental figure of sorts. Her sibling Brinn, who just recently left the restaurant business to work for their sister, describes it as a game-changer in giving her balance, saying: "I have never seen her happier to be doing something that is social."
After she got the late-night show, Tomlinson said she heard from a lot of people, including friends and family. Asked if that included her father, she paused for several long seconds, considering her next move. Then she very politely thanked me for the question but said she would rather not talk about it.
Tomlinson knows she can't appeal to everyone, but her goal is to appeal to as many people as possible -- and that makes her alert to what resonates. For a comic who cares about being relatable, success can be tricky to navigate. What will not change is how she prioritizes stand-up above all else. She agreed to take the late-night job only after being assured she would just need to shoot the show three days a week, allowing her to tour over the weekend.
Ever since watching and studying comics like Kathleen Madigan and Maria Bamford in high school, she has not only connected with standup but leaned on it. She said that she first lost some religious faith when her mother died ("They told me praying would work. That shook me.") but just as important, she said, was entering stand-up. "I was raised in this environment where if you're not Christian, you're probably a bad person because no one's holding you accountable," she said. "In clubs, I found a lot of these people are more empathetic and kinder and open-minded than people I've been around. Far less judgmental in the stand-up world."
Even as a late-night host, what Tomlinson sounds most excited about is the community of stand-ups. And she thinks, rightly, that the show will provide a valuable new platform for young comics. She said she wished she was more social earlier in her career. When asked if Taylor Swift's trajectory holds any lessons, she pointed to how the musician had evolved but didn't completely reinvent herself and cited the musician's Eras Tour charting her different phases: "She's still her but saying, 'This is the place I am at right now."'
You could say that Tomlinson is now entering her late-night era. She said that when she was younger, she used to dream of being a legend; she talked about that with Lem, her friend. They saw Swift in concert together last year in Los Angeles.
A few eras into the show, Tomlinson said, she turned to Lem and said, "I changed my mind. I want to be a legend." Tomlinson cracked up reflecting on this moment, then added: "Two eras later, I was like: 'Looks too hard. Think of the amount of stalkers."'

Full text: A new show in Paris by Maëlle Poésy tells the story of the Mercury 13 space program, with choreographed movement and acrobatic sequences.
Early on in "Cosmos," a new production by the French theater director Maëlle Poésy, three performers walk slowly onstage, their bodies hidden in full spacesuits. There are plenty of clues in the playbill. After all, "Cosmos" was inspired by the Mercury 13, a group of American women who took part in a '60s program that proved their fitness for space travel, but who never blasted off.
Yet when they took their helmets off to reveal three women, I caught myself feeling surprised. Subconsciously, I realized, I still expected astronauts to be men.
"Cosmos," presented at the Théâtre Gérard Philipe, in Saint-Denis, a Paris suburb, brightly deconstructs this stereotype. The production belongs to an increasingly prominent theater genre: plays that center women's stories as a form of historical or artistic redress, with the explicit aim of challenging conventional narratives.
It's a tricky exercise for writers and directors, as overly didactic productions quickly feel heavy-handed. Not here. Poésy and her co-writer, Kevin Keiss, delve into the space dream that fueled three of the Mercury 13 -- Jerrie Cobb, Jane Briggs Hart and Wally Funk -- in imaginative ways. There is upbeat dialogue and a few verbatim recreations of their public speeches, but "Cosmos" also makes use of movement to show the women striving toward the freedoms of space. The cast of five break open the large white wall that frames the action, and use dance and acrobatic sequences to express the intensity of Mercury 13's training program and frustration at gender inequality.
This allows Poésy to explore their trajectories without getting bogged down in the (eye-popping) details. As we learn, Cobb was just 18 when she got her commercial pilot's license; later, she inaugurated new air routes across some of the most dangerous South American landscapes and flew humanitarian supplies on the continen for decades. Briggs Hart was a World War II veteran, the wife of Senator Philip A. Hart, a long-serving Michigan Democrat, and a mother of eight when she successfully passed the Mercury 13 tests.
"Cosmos" isn't the first attempt to reclaim the women's place in the history of space travel. In 2018, Netflix released a documentary about this pioneering group and the sexist attitudes that ultimately shut down the test program, "Mercury 13"; the Apple TV show "For All Mankind" also imagined what might have happened if women had been selected for a moon landing. Books, articles and an American play, Laurel Ollstein's "They Promised Her the Moon," have been written about Cobb and her peers. Yet few will have heard of them in Europe.
The Mercury 13's program, privately funded and hidden from public view, was an initiative of William Randolph Lovelace II, a NASA physician. Lovelace had heard whispers that the Soviet Union was considering sending a woman into space (in 1963, it did: Valentina Tereshkova). But Lovelace doesn't appear in "Cosmos," which focuses on Cobb, Briggs Hart and Funk as they learn that they have been selected for the project.
As they detail the medical and physical tests that followed -- think frozen water injected into ears, extreme sports and isolation tanks -- the cast of five women begins to perform staccato movements choreographed by Leïla Ka, a rising French dance-maker. They kneel, crouch, lie down, get up again.
Later, when they learn via telegram that the program has been canceled, despite the fact that they outperformed men on a number of metrics, they return to dance -- this time frantically. In '60s-style dresses, they pretend to apply lipstick, and touch their faces and torsos, as if trapped by expectations of femininity. Caroline Arrouas is especially striking as Briggs Hart, at one point taking off her high heels and banging them against a portion of the wall until it collapses.
The women's disappointment, and subsequent attempts to get Congress and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson to allow women into NASA's space program, are interspersed with stories of women born after them. Dominique Joannon, playing an astrophysicist from Chile, talks movingly about a childhood fascination with the stars; and Elphège Kongombé Yamale, as an astrobiologist, explores what the 1969 moon landing meant to women in the Central African Republic.
Space and flight are metaphors throughout. Two performers -- Liza Lapert, who plays Funk, and Joannon -- are experienced acrobats, and at one point they climb the wall, opening little traps to let warm orange light through. Joannon delivers a galactic monologue while hanging from a bar high above the stage.
In the final scene, Lapert climbs a rope center stage. As she hovers above the cast, she talks about Cobb's and Briggs Hart's deaths, then explains that Funk's dream finally came true in 2021, when she became the oldest person to go into space, at 82, on a Blue Origin flight.
"When the rocket left the ground, I took you with me," she tells the others below, before resuming her climb, all the way to the lights hanging above the stage. The symbolism was obvious, yet neat: Finally, one of the Mercury 13 had completed their mission.

Full text: This poorly written action vehicle pits Kevin Hart as a hero against an eco-terrorist villain.
Kevin Hart plays Cyrus, a master thief, in the undercooked heist flick, "Lift," directed by F. Gary Gray. Written by Daniel Kunka, the film consists of luxurious locations like Tuscany and Venice and elaborate set pieces including a speedboat chase in the opening scene, but they are not infused with any sense of suspense or danger.
The film relies on a cartoonish villain, the eco-terrorist Lars Jorgensen (Jean Reno), who wants to game the stock market by paying some shadowy hackers half a billion dollars in gold bars to disrupt the world's water supply. Beyond the windfall Jorgensen will get from shorting water utility stocks, it's unclear what he gains from this elaborate ruse.
An Interpol agent, Abby (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), enlists Cyrus to steal the passenger plane carrying the gold bars before any damage can be done. Although Abby and Cyrus are old flames, the film doesn't pick up any romantic steam, either, thanks to what passes for banter. "I was looking at the questions that weren't being asked," Cyrus tells Abby. "Too cool for school, huh?" she says.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Though he tries to play Cyrus in the mold of Tom Cruise in "Mission: Impossible" or Robert Redford in "Sneakers" (two similarly framed heist films), as a leading man, Hart is stuck in neutral. You never understand why Abby would fall for him or why his team, composed of broad characters who seem to function solely as the source of creaky quips, are so steadfast. Hart possesses neither the charisma of Cruise nor the charm of Redford necessary to shoulder these action movie mechanics, a failure that demonstrates what happens when character actors are told they're movie stars.
Lift
Rated PG-13 for cheap violence and sexless romance. Running time: 1 hour 44 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

Democracy Takes the Stage Loudly and Proudly: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Huang Chen-yu strode onto an outdoor stage in a southern Taiwanese county, whooping and hollering as she roused the crowd of 20,000 into a joyous frenzy -- to welcome a succession of politicians in matching jackets.
Taiwan is in the final days of its presidential election contest, and the big campaign rallies, with M.C.s like Ms. Huang, are boisterous, flashy spectacles -- as if a variety show and a disco crashed into a candidate's town hall meeting.
At the high point of the rally, the Democratic Progressive Party's presidential candidate, Lai Ching-te, was introduced to the crowd in Chiayi, a county in southern Taiwan. Ms. Huang roared in Taiwanese, "Frozen garlic!"
The phrase "dongsuan" sounds like "get elected" and, yes, also like "frozen garlic." Ms. Huang and another M.C. led the crowd of supporters, now on their feet, in a rapid-fire, call-and-response chant: "Lai Ching-te! Frozen garlic! Lai Ching-te! Frozen garlic!" Then they sped up: "Lai Ching-te! Lai Ching-te! Lai Ching-te! Frozen garlic! Frozen garlic! Frozen garlic!"
For Ms. Huang, the event, days before Taiwan's election on Saturday, was one of at least 15 rallies she would have led by the end of this campaign season.
The rallies, and their chants of "frozen garlic," are a central ritual in Taiwan's democracy. The rival parties display their candidates and policies under flashing stage lights, accompanied by banners, chants, singers and celebrities. Some feature dancers with tight outfits and flirty moves not often seen onstage in American presidential campaigning.
The job of the M.C.s like Ms. Huang, who are usually politicians or activists with strong voices and a melodramatic delivery, is to fire up their parties' otherwise bland presentation of candidates, almost always wearing their campaign jackets: green for the Democratic Progressives, white and blue for the Nationalists.
Ms. Huang, just over five feet tall, is such a skilled -- and, frankly, loud -- master of the art that she coaches other Democratic Progressive Party activists in hosting rallies.
"My job is to draw out the emotion and passion of the crowd," Ms. Huang, who runs a farmers' association when she's not on the campaign trail, said in an interview. Warming up the crowd for the star candidate is crucial, she said. "When the time comes for the big entrance, you don't want everyone just sitting there flapping their flags; you have to light a fire in their hearts."
She had some advice for preserving vocal cords through as many as three rallies in a day: "If you don't use your abdominal strength, you will be ruined after one show."
During Taiwan's elections, bands of musicians, dancers, singers, and technicians support the rallies, which in the final week of campaigning are held nightly.
At a Nationalist Party rally in Tainan, a city in southern Taiwan, Wang Chien-kang gazed up from the side of the stage, stroking and striking his keyboard to create the right soundtrack for the politicians. A drumroll when a candidate was introduced. Ominous electro-orchestra at the mention of the opposition. A clash of cymbals to mark the punchline of a joke.
"You have to pay attention to the emotions they're showing up on the stage," said Mr. Wang, who in his dark cardigan resembled a music school professor who had stumbled into the hullabaloo. "Then you have to think up the right background for it. It's no use in doing homework beforehand. You draw on your experience."
Some performers and technicians work to support their party; others, including Mr. Wang, do it for whichever side pays.
"Whoever likes us and is willing to sign us up; we don't pick between political positions and like to go and put on a show for everyone," said Gao Ying-jhe, a performer whose troupe had just warmed up the Tainan rally with a somewhat edgy electro-dance routine.
The dance helped put the attendees in the right mood, he said. "At the start, people don't know each other, but because they have this more relaxed downtime, they'll do things that they don't normally do."
The rallies have grown in Taiwan as multiparty democracy replaced decades of martial law and authoritarian rule under the Nationalists, starting in the 1990s. The Democratic Progressive Party, which helped hasten the democratic transition, has made the gatherings, also called "wave making rallies," part of its brand.
"At the start, the Democratic Progressive Party had this image of violent resistance, so I think that they softened their image" with these rallies, said Chien Li-ying, one of the scriptwriters for a Taiwanese Netflix drama about party campaign strategists. Taiwanese voters expect their candidates to show a "human touch," Ms. Chien said.
"Whether you can show up and mix with the people is very important," she added.
The rallies help to "solidify the commitment of supporters," Ho Hsin-Chun, a Democratic Progressive lawmaker in central Taiwan, said in an interview. The people who turn up are mostly committed supporters, she said, but they come away with the feeling that they matter: "You really have to energetically draw in votes for me, energetically encourage everyone you know to commit to voting."
For the candidates, election season also means visits to temples, where they bow at altars and burn incense for local deities, such as Mazu, the Goddess of the Sea. It also means "street sweeps," when candidates and their supporters walk briskly through neighborhoods, knocking on doors, shaking hands, and urging residents to vote for them. Campaigning politicians sometimes also drop in on weddings and funerals.
The two leading presidential candidates -- Mr. Lai from the Democratic Progressives and Hou Yu-ih from the opposition Nationalist Party -- have spent a good part of the past month pounding the pavement and attending rallies.
Some attendees show up spontaneously and file into the waiting seats and standing areas. Others are invited or cajoled to come along by local party organizers who usher them to their assigned seats, banners ready.
Some Taiwanese politicians wince in embarrassment when asked about the rallies. Mature democracies should not need such time-consuming, expensive spectacles, some would say privately. But Taiwan's enthusiasm for the rites of democracy stands out at a time when many Western democracies suffer a surfeit of citizen disillusionment.
"You, of course, also find plenty of Taiwanese people who are very cynical about their politics," said Mark Harrison, a senior lecturer at the University of Tasmania in Australia who studies Taiwan's political culture, "but at the end of the day what brings out 50,000 people at a rally is a belief in their democracy, and right now, especially, that commitment has something to teach the rest of the world."
Still, age is catching up on the rallies. They have long attracted mostly older supporters, and the crowds look even grayer these days, when younger Taiwanese tend to be less attached to traditional parties and politics. (Ko Wen-je, a candidate from the new, insurgent Taiwan People's Party, is an exception who has drawn plenty of young supporters to his rallies.)
"Most of my friends are not that keen on talking about politics," said Lin Yi-hsien, 23, one of the few younger faces at the rally in Chiayi. "I come here because I like the lively vibe and the Taiwanese values that it displays."
Jacky Liu, a 66-year-old musician attending the Nationalist Party event in Tainan, said that he generally disliked such mass gatherings, and was coaxed into going by his wife and friends. Even so, he seemed to be having a fine time, swaying and chanting in his bright, flower-ringed hat.
"Sure, I was pushed to come along," he said. "But nobody can push around my mind."

Two Titans of 2023 Lead Screen Actors Guild Nominations: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: The summer blockbusters each garnered four nominations. Notable snubs included Leonardo DiCaprio of "Killers of the Flower Moon."
Box office behemoths "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" led this year's nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Awards, which were announced Wednesday morning. Each film picked up four nominations, including ones for the guild's top ensemble prize.
In addition to that nomination, "Barbie" earned additional nods for lead actress Margot Robbie and supporting actor Ryan Gosling, as well as for its stunt ensemble. The other three nominations for "Oppenheimer" were for lead actor Cillian Murphy and the supporting performers Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt. Both Murphy and Downey prevailed in their categories during Sunday's Golden Globes.
Other nominees for the top award included "American Fiction," "The Color Purple" and "Killers of the Flower Moon." Still, the latter movie was dealt one of the morning's biggest snubs when star Leonardo DiCaprio failed to crack the best-actor lineup. "May December" received the coldest shoulder, going zero for three with contenders Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore and Charles Melton.
Rarely do actors win the Oscar without first scoring a nomination from their own guild. Last year, the entire quartet of SAG winners went on to repeat at the Oscars, while the SAG ensemble winner, "Everything Everywhere All at Once," also took the Oscars' best picture prize.
But there is still some wiggle room in each category for a SAG-snubbed actor to earn an Oscar nomination, as the likes of Paul Mescal ("Aftersun"), Michelle Williams ("The Fabelmans"), and Andrea Riseborough ("To Leslie") managed last year. And since the SAG ensemble award favors films with large casts, more intimately scaled movies like "Past Lives" and "The Holdovers" shouldn't be counted out.

Israeli Actor Left Wounded By Gaza Blast: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The actor, Idan Amedi, underwent surgery to remove shrapnel from his body and was expected to recover, Israeli news media reported.
An Israeli soldier who is an actor in the popular Israeli series "Fauda" on Netflix was seriously wounded when a truck filled with explosives blew up in the Bureij area of central Gaza on Monday, the Israeli military said.
The actor, Idan Amedi, 35, who is also well-known in Israel as a composer, songwriter and pop singer, was airlifted to a hospital in Israel, where he underwent extensive surgery to remove shrapnel from his body. His condition has improved now and he is expected to recover, Israeli news media reported.
Six soldiers were killed in the truck explosion and eight were wounded, including Mr. Amedi, the Israeli military said. Although the exact cause of the explosion had not been determined by Tuesday evening, a preliminary investigation suggested that it was inadvertently caused by fire from an Israeli tank, said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the chief spokesman for the Israeli military.
For safety reasons, most soldiers had been ordered to leave the site where a small crew of combat engineers was preparing the explosives, Admiral Hagari said, and a tank was stationed nearby to secure the area and provide cover. Then the tank identified what was thought to be a threat.
"The tank opened fire at the threat, and in a tragic outcome, struck an electricity pole nearby, knocking it over and igniting the explosives," Admiral Hagari said.
In "Fauda," which has aired for four seasons on Netflix, Mr. Amedi plays Sagi Tzur, a newcomer to an elite Israeli counterterrorism unit that goes undercover into the occupied Palestinian territories, using the fighters' fluency in Arabic and familiarity with local culture to blend in and hunt down terrorists.
As Israel launched a full-scale war in Gaza in response to the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas, the show's depiction of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict gained urgency and other cast and crew members and their family members were called up to fight. In November, a producer on the show, Matan Meir, 38, was killed in a booby-trapped tunnel shaft near a mosque in northern Gaza.
Mr. Amedi rose to fame in 2010 after appearing on the popular Israeli TV show "A Star Is Born," performing his song, "The Pain of Warriors," which became an instant hit.
The song is written as a letter from a soldier on the front line to his lover, and reveals how much he has been keeping from her, "all the nightmares, the screams and blood on the uniform."
Mr. Amedi has served as a reservist since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel. At the time, he wrote on his Instagram account that he would give up performing or singing for a year in order to remain in combat, saying the Israeli military needed to take action to protect Israelis in the south and the north, where cross-border attacks with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have escalated.
"Anything other than the elimination of Hamas in Gaza and the uprooting of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon poses an immediate danger to our children," he wrote.
Another video posted to his Instagram account shows Mr. Amedi, who was serving in a combat engineering unit, counting down before exploding a target and dedicating it to Oct. 7 victims and two comrades killed in combat. "We will avenge their blood," he says in the video.

Golden Globes Were Watched By 9.4 Million: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The number of viewers was higher than last year, but still down significantly compared with prepandemic audience totals.
The Golden Globes averaged 9.4 million viewers on Sunday night, according to Nielsen, an increase over the 2023 ceremony ratings but still significantly lower than the audience totals of just a few years ago.
Until 2020, the Globes regularly drew 17 million to 20 million viewers. In 2019, the Globes was narrowing the viewership gap with the Oscars so significantly that it appeared the telecast could become the most-watched awards show.
And then disaster struck.
First came the pandemic, which deprived the 2021 Globes of its usual booze-soaked freewheeling ceremony, sending the ratings tumbling. Then came a scandal for the organization that administers the Globes, which led NBC to refuse to broadcast the 2022 ceremony. Last year, NBC gave the Globes a one-year chance, and the audience figures were still low: Just over six million people watched.
For months, there was speculation that a streaming service like Netflix or Amazon could pick up the rights to the Globes. That did not happen. In November, CBS picked up the rights for another one-year arrangement. (In a statement announcing the deal, George Cheeks, the CBS president, said the Globes could help promote scripted programming that had been delayed by last year's strikes in Hollywood. Those shows premiere next month.)
CBS announced a host -- a relatively unknown Jo Koy -- only a few days before Christmas.
Reviews for Mr. Koy were harsh, with critics taking particular issue with the comedian's bizarre mid-monologue pivot, in which he blamed other writers for some of his dull jokes. "Yo, I got the gig 10 days ago, you want a perfect monologue?" he said. "Yo, shut up. You're kidding me, right? Slow down. I wrote some of these -- and they're the ones you're laughing at."
Critics were not kind to the telecast, either. Vanity Fair called it a "near-total disaster," and a critic at The Hollywood Reporter said it was "the dullest awards show" he had ever seen. The Ankler likened it to the "RC Cola of award shows."

Amid All the Talk, Here Are the Takeaways: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "The Holdovers," "Poor Things" and "Barbie" all won multiple awards in the film categories, while the TV shows "Beef" and "The Bear" each won three.
The 81st Golden Globes kicked off Hollywood's awards season on Sunday in a chaotic and sloppy manner, with the host, Jo Koy, delivering a train wreck of a monologue, winners alternately seeming to take the ceremony seriously and not at all, and prizes going to a wide array of films and television shows.
"Oppenheimer," which entered the ceremony with eight nominations, emerged as the movie to beat in the coming Oscar race, winning five Globes, including for best drama, Christopher Nolan's directing and Cillian Murphy's acting. "Barbie," "The Holdovers" and "Poor Things" also won notable movie awards.
Here are the other main takeaways:
The most nominated film, "Barbie," which received citations in nine categories, won two Globes, including the one for best cinematic and box office achievement, a newly created prize. Its other victory was for best song.
HBO's "Succession" was the top television winner, as expected. The show collected Globes for best drama, actress (Sarah Snook), actor (Kieran Culkin) and supporting actor (Matthew Macfadyen).
"Poor Things," a surreal science-fiction romance, won best movie, comedy or musical. Emma Stone, the film's star, received the Globe for best comedic actress, while Paul Giamatti ("The Holdovers") received the statuette for best comedic actor.
Lily Gladstone won the Globe for best actress in a drama for her performance in "Killers of the Flower Moon," becoming the first Indigenous person to win the award.
Da'Vine Joy Randolph ("The Holdovers") was honored as best supporting actress. Robert Downey Jr. ("Oppenheimer") won best supporting actor.
Netflix's "Beef" and FX's "The Bear" each won three Globes. "Beef" was named best limited series, and Ali Wong and Steven Yeun collected Globes for their acting in the show. "The Bear" won the trophy for best comedy and two of its stars, Ayo Edebiri and Jeremy Allen White, were honored for their performances.
It was the first time that the Hollywood establishment had convened since the resolution of twin union strikes that shut down the industry for much of the past year. The Globes themselves were looking to turn a page by moving past an ethics, finance and diversity scandal that resulted in the sale of the show, an overhaul of its voting body and a change of network to CBS from NBC.
In recent years the Golden Globes has become known for speeches about causes and concerns, most of them progressive. Last year, the ceremony gave airtime to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who spoke about his country's war with Russia. This time around, the host and the winners seemed determined to steer clear of politics, with hot-button subjects like the Israel-Hamas war going unmentioned.
The more the Globes change, however, the more they seem to stay the same. Just as in the past, voters spread their awards far and wide; five movies won at least two trophies. And, just as in the past, there was at least one curve ball -- this year in the form of best screenplay, which went to the French film "Anatomy of a Fall." Gold Derby, which compiles the predictions of two dozen awards handicappers, had predicted that "Barbie" would win.

No, That's Not Taylor Swift Peddling That Cookware: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The singer did not promote a giveaway of the popular cookware, but an artificially generated version of her voice suggested otherwise.
Taylor Swift's affinity for Le Creuset is real: Her collection of the cookware has been featured on a Tumblr account dedicated to the pop star's home décor, in a thorough analysis of her kitchen published by Variety and in a Netflix documentary that was highlighted by Le Creuset's Facebook page.
What is not real: Ms. Swift's endorsement of the company's products, which have appeared in recent weeks in ads on Facebook and elsewhere featuring her face and voice.
The ads are among the many celebrity-focused scams made far more convincing by artificial intelligence. Within a single week in October, the actor Tom Hanks, the journalist Gayle King and the YouTube personality MrBeast all said that A.I. versions of themselves had been used, without permission, for deceptive dental plan promotions, iPhone giveaway offers and other ads.
In Ms. Swift's case, experts said, artificial intelligence technology helped create a synthetic version of the singer's voice, which was cobbled together with footage of her alongside clips showing Le Creuset Dutch ovens. In several ads, Ms. Swift's cloned voice addressed "Swifties" -- her fans -- and said she was "thrilled" to be handing out free cookware sets. All people had to do was click on a button and answer a few questions before the end of the day.
Le Creuset said it was not involved with the singer for any consumer giveaway. The company urged shoppers to check its official online accounts before clicking on suspicious ads. Representatives of Ms. Swift, who was named Person of the Year by Time magazine in 2023, did not respond to requests for comment.
Famous people have lent their celebrity to advertisers for as long as advertising has existed. Sometimes, it has been unwillingly. More than three decades ago, Tom Waits sued Frito-Lay -- and won nearly $ 2.5 million -- after the corn chip company imitated the singer in a radio ad without his permission. The Le Creuset scam campaign also featured fabricated versions of Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey, who in 2022 posted an exasperated video about the prevalence of fake social media ads, emails and websites falsely claiming that she endorsed weight loss gummies.
Over the past year, major advances in artificial intelligence have made it far easier to produce an unauthorized digital replica of a real person. Audio spoofs have been especially easy to produce and difficult to identify, said Siwei Lyu, a computer science professor who runs the Media Forensic Lab at the University at Buffalo.
The Le Creuset scam campaign was probably created using a text-to-speech service, Dr. Lyu said. Such tools usually translate a script into an A.I.-generated voice, which can then be incorporated into existing video footage using lip-syncing programs.
"These tools are becoming very accessible these days," said Dr. Lyu, who added that it was possible to make a "decent-quality video" in less than 45 minutes. "It's becoming very easy, and that's why we're seeing more."
Dozens of separate but similar Le Creuset scam ads featuring Ms. Swift -- many of them posted this month -- were visible as of late last week on Meta's public Ad Library. (The company owns Facebook and Instagram.) The campaign also ran on TikTok.
The ads sent viewers to websites that mimicked legitimate outlets like the Food Network, which showcased fake news coverage of the Le Creuset offer alongside testimonials from fabricated customers. Participants were asked to pay a "small shipping fee of $ 9.96" for the cookware. Those who complied faced hidden monthly charges without ever receiving the promised cookware.
Some of the fake Le Creuset ads, such as one mimicking the interior designer Joanna Gaines, had a deceptive sheen of legitimacy on social media thanks to labels identifying them as sponsored posts or as originating from verified accounts.
In April, the Better Business Bureau warned consumers that fake celebrity scams made with A.I. were "more convincing than ever." Victims were often left with higher-than-expected charges and no sign of the product they had ordered. Bankers have also reported attempts by swindlers to use voice deepfakes, or synthetic replicas of real people's voices, to commit financial fraud.
In the past year, several well-known people have publicly distanced themselves from ads featuring their A.I.-manipulated likeness or voice.
This summer, fake ads spread online that purported to show the country singer Luke Combs promoting weight loss gummies recommended to him by the fellow country musician Lainey Wilson. Ms. Wilson posted an Instagram video denouncing the ads, saying that "people will do whatever to make a dollar, even if it is lies." Mr. Combs's manager, Chris Kappy, also posted an Instagram video denying involvement in the gummy campaign and accusing foreign companies of using artificial intelligence to replicate Mr. Combs's likeness.
"To other managers out there, A.I. is a scary thing and they're using it against us," he wrote.
A TikTok spokesperson said the app's ads policy requires advertisers to obtain consent for "any synthetic media which contains a public figure," adding that TikTok's community standards require creators to disclose "synthetic or manipulated media showing realistic scenes."
Meta said it took action on the ads that violated its policies, which prohibit content that uses public figures in a deceptive way to try to cheat users out of money. The company said it had taken legal steps against some perpetrators of such schemes, but added that malicious ads were often able to evade Meta's review systems by cloaking their content.
With no federal laws in place to address A.I. scams, lawmakers have proposed legislation that would aim to limit their damage. Two bills introduced in Congress last year -- the Deepfakes Accountability Act in the House and the No Fakes Act in the Senate -- would require guardrails such as content labels or permission to use someone's voice or image.
At least nine states, including California, Virginia, Florida and Hawaii, have laws regulating A.I.-generated content.
For now, Ms. Swift will probably continue to be a popular subject of A.I. experimentation. Synthetic versions of her voice pop up regularly on TikTok, performing songs she never sang, colorfully sounding off on critics and serving as phone ringtones. An English-language interview she gave in 2021 on "Late Night With Seth Meyers" was dubbed with an artificial rendering of her voice speaking Mandarin. One website charges up to $ 20 for personalized voice messages from "the A.I. clone of Taylor Swift," promising "that the voice you hear is indistinguishable from the real thing."

The Price When Wanderers Cannot Wander: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In his 1863 essay "The Painter of Modern Life," Charles Baudelaire described the passionate city dweller as "a kaleidoscope gifted with consciousness." In the French poet's eyes, the city dweller had a unique opportunity to absorb and mirror the poetry of freely moving multitudes. For the committed flâneur, Baudelaire wrote, "the crowd is his element, as the air is that of birds and water of fishes."
I felt this way in New York City 15, even five years ago. Sidewalks could be strolled contemplatively, providing one kept to the right, and roads could be crossed without much trepidation.
But I was hit by three bikes this past summer -- two on sidewalks and all three after sunset -- and spared dozens more collisions only because of my increasingly frantic footwork. In the years since the pandemic lockdown, drivers, with their ever-bigger vehicles, appear to have grown more aggressive. They seem less likely to yield to crossing pedestrians and more likely to stop, unperturbed, on crosswalks. Motorcyclists routinely whiz through red lights and tyrannize bike lanes. Bicyclists fly down avenues like arrows, bike lanes and one-way signs be damned, and a precious few of them halt for crossers. Electric delivery bikes chase poverty wages down our sidewalks, throwing the last sliver of pedestrian refuge into a novel sort of anarchy.
Weaving through throngs of inimitably colorful, diverse, bizarre New Yorkers once felt like performing "an intricate sidewalk ballet" -- which is how Jane Jacobs, another famous literary flâneur, marvelously depicted the scene that was Greenwich Village's Hudson Street in the 1950s.
Today my inner flâneur has been replaced by a neurotic curmudgeon, the likes of which Fran Lebowitz personifies in the Netflix show "Pretend It's a City." Ms. Lebowitz disparages drivers who stop their vehicles on crosswalks and cyclists who pay no heed to their surroundings. "I am a person who believes, every day, I have a very high chance of being killed crossing the street," she says in the show's pilot episode, adding, luridly, "It's an astonishment to me that every day tens of thousands of people aren't slaughtered in the streets of New York."
It is an astonishment to me, too.
While parts of the world have increasingly safeguarded their walkers, the United States has seen a sharp rise in pedestrian fatalities over the past few years. Deaths in New York City may not have climbed into the tens of thousands, but they remain much higher than we would like. In addition to bringing the obvious consequences of death, injury and the erosion of civic life, this citywide discord has taken a toll on emotional and philosophical life, too.
"Only ideas won by walking have any value," Friedrich Nietzsche wrote in "Twilight of the Idols." Nietzsche, like Schopenhauer and Kant before him, took daily strolls to unravel the day's thought puzzles and refine seeds into concepts. There are few more effective ways to think through a philosophical or personal problem than by taking a long walk. Something about the body having been set to a task (and assigned a route) allows the mind to whir into conversation -- into the inner dialogue we call thinking.
But this is possible only as long as the flâneur's peaceable, rhythmic perambulation remains relatively uninterrupted. My hourslong strolls through New York City have been indispensable to my literary life; I cannot finish an essay if it hasn't been aired out over 30 blocks.
The fruits of flânerie also extend to communion with the past and present. To wander through this city's nexus of triumphs, failures and noble attempts is to find oneself awash in the accumulation of history. It is to commune with my idols past -- writers, poets, philosophers -- while marinating in the vivacity of my contemporaries. When I walk down Riverside Drive by 109th Street, I sometimes run my fingers along the red bricks of the prewar building in which Hannah Arendt lived. I feel cosmically proximate to her then, as I do elsewhere in the city with Edith Wharton, W.H. Auden, Mary McCarthy, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Truman Capote, Walt Whitman and Langston Hughes.
Without unstifled access to our city's tree-lined streets and architectural marvels, New York's amblers are left trapped in tiny apartments and cluttered offices. When we go outside, the domination of cars, scooters and bicycles imprisons us in public, triggering omnipresent skirmishes, dodges and clenches of the jaw. Today it too often feels as if crossing the street at a "Walk" light is not a right so much as a pleading negotiation -- as if my free movement were begrudgingly, charitably permitted by glittery-eyed, two-ton monsters that inch impatiently forward, resentful to have relinquished precious seconds.
New York today feels a universe away from the city roamed by the writers I love. One might wonder what kind of literature they would make here now, in a city that seems to envelop us in restrictive, ambient anxiety rather than lyrical inspiration -- and in ever more innovatively disruptive ways.
A city that no longer accommodates wandering no longer accommodates wondering, too, and a flâneur without freedom falls into a sort of zombified routine. I've started to limit my walks outside, and even quick trips to the grocery store, gym and local coffee shop can take the form of obstacle courses with hazardous stakes. Because free city walking has become so encumbered, so subordinate to wheeled expediency, I've found my thoughts more prone to distraction, tautology and the disorder of reflexive associations. Now I pace around my apartment in order to think through my essays, but dwindling are those unexpected connections between ideas -- the rewards of spontaneous tangents jostled into discovery by discursive movement. My inner voice has quieted, my inner life dulled, all while, outside, the roar of engines and the clamor of disharmony are louder than ever.
Perhaps the most philosophically valuable aspect of flânerie is the degree to which it returns us to an analog habitat. If we're collectively inclined to drown out our inner voices with TV shows, dating apps, online screeds and looping videos, a long walk outside doesn't just serve to politely wrench us out of tiny rooms and away from tiny screens. It also allows the inner voice to emerge from slumber, to engage with itself and thus for the mind to find itself once again. Nietzsche glorified ideas "won by walking" precisely because they're born of this redemptive self-consciousness.
In Baudelaire's "A Lost Halo," an angelic poet anxiously crosses a busy boulevard. He trips and falls, and his halo slips off his head and onto the muddy street. He leaves it behind, fearful of barreling horses and carriages, but he finds a silver lining in the forfeiture: "Now I can go about incognito," he says, "do bad things, and indulge in vulgar behavior like ordinary mortals." In this magical city, we surely cannot afford to relinquish individual responsibility, to give in to anarchy, to leave our halos in the mud. Our freedom, epiphanies and inner lives hang in the balance.

Full text: This month's picks riff on disorientation, with an unknowable ex, an unnatural house and an uncanny dad.
'Soft Liquid Center'
Rent or buy on major platforms.
Steph (Steph Holmbo) starts a new life after leaving her awful boyfriend by getting a new apartment and a new group of friends. But she's having bizarre dreams of traipsing through the woods, and what's worse, her furniture sometimes moves on its own. Then, in this strange film's strangest scene, Steph digs out the flesh of a giant watermelon, turning the floor where she's sitting into what looks like a brutal crime scene -- a taste of the spectral, time-collapsing horrors to come.
For their feature debut, the directors Joseph Kolean and Zachary Gutierrez, who go by Perry Home Video, have made an experimental horror film that will stump some people but mesmerized me. (When a friend tells Steph, "I've been feeling really weird lately," I started to as well.) Holmbo, who co-wrote the script with the directors, told the blog What Sleeps Beneath that the film was inspired by past relationships of hers that were "deeply toxic and unhealthy, often especially in unexplainable ways." That notion of heartbreak and survival as the ends of supernatural means comes alive here, thanks to a disorienting story, a slow-burn visual style and a score, by Roberto Garza, that knocked me off balance.

Critics are divided over the bonkers feature film debut by the Saudi writer-director Meshal Aljaser. Detractors think it's busy and empty. Fans are in love with its visual and narrative thrills. They're both right.
Set on a single day, the film follows Sara (Adwa Bader, electric), a young woman who, in an act of furtive rebellion against her wealthy, traditionalist family, sneaks out with her secret boyfriend, Saad (Yazeed Almajyul), to a lavish party in the desert. But as Saad speeds along a dark road, he hits a camel, a fatal fate that the animal's mother mourns off camera with a cry that sounds like it came from hell's waiting room. From there, this genre-hopping film, equal parts psychological thriller and maverick dark comedy, shifts into warped warp speed.
Watching the film gave me a "Run Lola Run"-like rush. Aljaser's camera almost never stops swooping and reversing. Angles look like it hurt to get them. One nutso long shot looks like it was filmed from Mars. After almost two hours, I was in love with its showiness. But I was also left wanting for a Saudi genre film this cuckoo and bold to offer a clearer takeaway.

Armand (Achille Reggiani) agrees to take over his late father's bowling alley, to the relief of Armand's cop half brother, Guillaume (Arieh Worthalter). Boyishly handsome, Armand has no problem taking home a young female bowler one night. But what begins as a fling turns into a horrific rape, a scene that the director, Patricia Mazuy, depicts with the same unflinching brutality that made the monstrous assault in Gaspar Noé's "Irreversible" a dealbreaker for many viewers. Armand, it turns out, is a serial killer, and Guillaume is the investigator assigned to the case.
Mazuy's film mines many dark themes -- animal cruelty, sins of the father, toxic masculinity -- that don't always gel. Yet she is such an assured director that she makes this sometimes hard-to-stomach drama -- and I mean that narratively and sometimes physically -- worth watching. As a police procedural, the film stretches credulity, but as a neo-noir drama about a psychopath and his corrupting emotional zigzags, it shines. Reggiani has a grim countenance that makes his deeply disturbing performance feel natural, which he should take as praise. Simon Beaufils, the cinematographer, makes a bowling alley look like the devil's playground.

Chris (Chris Page) wakes up in a room in a big, haphazardly furnished house that he doesn't recognize. One of his arms is covered in blood. There's a Post-it note that tells him not to go outside, and another on the bathroom mirror that says "Don't stay in here too long." Another note is even more ominous: "Don't let it see you." His handwriting matches that of the person who wrote the messages, but that doesn't solve the mystery of where he is and why a creepy claw is trying to rip through a shower curtain.
That's the cryptic setup to the writer-director Alex Davidson's twisty film, but I don't want to say more. Because what I thought was a psychological thriller with science fiction undertones (and nearly no dialogue) turned out to be a fresh spin on a genre I won't mention -- the better to keep from spoiling this film's final surprise.

Better the devil you know than the devil you don't: Good advice, generally. But what if the devil you know is your dad? That's the unsettling premise behind Sebastien Blanc's freakish science fiction-horror hybrid, his feature film debut.
William (Tobi King Bakare) wakes up from a coma, unable to speak, after being seriously injured in a car accident. His adoptive father, Richard (Steve Oram) takes him home to recover, but warns William that his mother, Amelia (Ramona Von Pusch), who was with William in the car, doesn't want to see him.
But wait: Why is dad digging a big ditch in the backyard and being evasive about his wife's whereabouts? And how come the refrigerator is full of rotten food? And what is that thing with glowing eyes in the kitchen?
With a script that's both contemplative and creepy, Blanc delivers a scary meditation on parenthood and the promise, and perils, of an afterlife. Race too: William is Black and his parents are white -- they speak but he doesn't -- infusing issues of adoption, forgiveness and consciousness with "Get Out"-like discomfort, even with an ending that veers toward B-movie territory.

Best and Worst of 'The Crown': [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As the Netflix series depicting the royal family concludes, it's time to hand out some superlatives.
"The Crown" has been a dizzying marathon of a series, packing nearly 60 years of history into six seasons of serious drama and frivolous gossip. Sometimes rushing headlong through the decades, other times plodding turgidly through the minutes, the show has been destination television since 2016 -- a sumptuous, low-stakes diversion in an era of bewildering turmoil.
Does it have a deeper meaning, other than being an impressive feat of expensive storytelling? It's hard to say.
As we contemplate a future in which we will be forced to evaluate new royal developments without the help of "The Crown," it's time for the first (and last) annual Crownie Awards.
Worst Haircut: Prince Harry
"The Crown" always veered confusingly between playing up the actors' resemblances to their real-life counterparts (Alex Jennings, uncannily channeling the Duke of Windsor) and appearing not to care very much at all (Dominic West, patently handsomer and more on the ball than his character, Prince Charles.)
Still, it was a jolt to see Prince Harry in the final season. Played by Luther Ford, he seems like a charmless, angry Ron Weasley bizarrely sporting Prince Valiant-style bangs.
Best Costume: The Revenge Dress
"The Crown" often dressed its actors in replicas of their characters' best-known clothes, for a pleasing sense of verisimilitude. (See, for instance, the wedding dresses worn by Princess Elizabeth, Lady Diana Spencer and Camilla Parker-Bowles.)
As was the case in real life, the best outfit of all was the smoking-hot Christina Stambolian dress worn by Diana (Elizabeth Debicki) in Season 5, at a party in Kensington Gardens on the very night that Prince Charles appeared on television and confessed to cheating on her with Camilla Parker-Bowles.
It was thrilling to see Debicki's entrance in that dress -- form-fitting, off the shoulder, with an asymmetrical hem and a chiffon train flowing saucily from the waist -- and it made for a breathtaking re-creation of that memorable moment.
Most Delicious Put-Down: The Duke of Windsor
"The Crown" was peppered with cutting remarks and snobbish asides, and the best insults came in the first season, when the Duke of Windsor returns briefly to London from his unhappy Parisian exile for his brother's funeral. He asks for money after his family threatens to cut off his allowance and argues that his wife, the former Wallis Simpson, should be awarded the honorific Her Royal Highness because of her royal-adjacent status.
Nobody is particularly sympathetic, and it hardens his heart. England, he writes to Wallis, is a "sunless, frozen hell."
"And what a bunch of ice-veined monsters my family are," he continues. "How cold and thin-lipped and dumpy and plain."
Most Outrageous Reputation Inflation: Prince Philip
Who is this kindly old gentleman exuding benevolent wisdom in the final episodes, asking people how they're feeling, thinking back on his days as a young father, and praising Queen Elizabeth for successfully concealing "the torment you've been going through" in her wedding speech for Charles and Camilla?
Surely it can't be Prince Philip (Jonathan Pryce), the queen's crotchety husband, who in real life had a reputation as a fearsomely irascible curmudgeon who reveled in his own offensiveness? ("You are a woman, aren't you?" Philip once said to a Kenyan woman offering him a present. Speaking to an Aboriginal leader in Australia, he asked: "Do you still throw spears at each other?")
Earlier seasons of "The Crown" showed Philip's more abrasive, frustrated side, and there were a few flashes of the old splenetic spirit in the final episodes, as when he snaps at a hapless functionary: "for God's sake, take the bloody photograph, will you!" But mostly he seemed like a benign and wise old patriarch.
Most Gratuitous Reputation Tarnishing: Carole Middleton
Kate Middleton's mother, Carole, has always presented herself as a model of elegant discretion and admirable good nature. She exudes an air of helpful maternal enthusiasm and smiling back-seat support for her daughter and her son-in-law. She has never seemed eager, at least not in public, to thrust herself forward or trade on her royal connections.
So it was bewildering to see her portrayed in Season 6 as a humorless social climber with one goal: pushing her daughter into snagging Prince William.
Doubtless Mrs. Middleton is glad that Kate and William ended up together. Maybe, as Tina Brown has written, she did orchestrate Kate's decision to go to the University of St. Andrews, where Prince William had enrolled, for the purpose of putting her daughter in the prince's way.
But the show's depiction of Carole (Eve Best) reacting with stony-faced displeasure when Kate brings home her non-William boyfriend, a blameless aristocrat named Rupert -- and then grimly haranguing Kate for failing to bag the prince? That seems not only unlikely, but also unfair.
Biggest Doormat: Camilla Parker-Bowles
Camilla's job in "The Crown" is to be jolly, supportive and self-effacing, no matter how tortured and miserable Charles is and how frequently he makes her listen to him whine and complain on the phone about his troubles. Calling her on the eve of their wedding, he speculates excitedly about the possibility that his mother might abdicate and cede the throne to him.
"Just think about the boys," Camilla (Olivia Williams) tells him, swallowing her dismay at the prospect so as not to discomfit him. But, as he told her in the famous "tampon-gate" conversation in 1989, "your greatest achievement is to love me."
(Runner-up in this category is Kate Middleton, played by Meg Bellamy, who also logs a lot of phone time in which she does more listening than talking.)
Dumbest Use of the Supernatural: The Ghosts of Diana and Dodi
The final season introduced a bevy of phantoms who materialized from the ether to soothe, advise and declaim to various living characters. This device worked well when Queen Elizabeth (Imelda Staunton, in the queen's last iteration) was visited by the ghosts of her former selves, played by Clare Foy and Olivia Colman; they served to underscore the poignancy of the passage of time in her long life.
But did we really need to see Ghost Dodi and Ghost Diana assuaging the guilt of those they had left behind? No.
Unlikeliest Dialogue: The Whole Series
Who knows how the royal family really talks to each other behind closed doors. But it seems improbable that their real-life conversations include so much long expository commentary on royal protocol, precedent, duty and history -- "parentheticals that seem cribbed from Wikipedia," as Helen Lewis wrote in The Atlantic.
"What would he know of Alfred the Great, the Rod of Equity and Mercy, Edward the Confessor, William the Conqueror or Henry the Eighth?" Queen Mary barks at Elizabeth in the first season, speaking of Prince Philip, who comes from the exiled Greek royal family. "It's the Church of England, dear, not the Church of Denmark or Greece."
Characters on "The Crown" also had a habit of articulating their emotions and laying out their interpersonal conflicts in a way that would be embarrassing even in 21st-century American families, let alone among repressed, stiff-upper-lipped British aristocrats from the past.
"Brother has indeed turned against brother," King Edward says to his younger brother, the future King George, as the two argue about Edward's abdication in Season 1.
In Season 3, Prince Philip requests a private meeting with the American astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins at Buckingham Palace. He is having a bit of an identity crisis. "I've not been able to achieve the things I would have liked to," he blurts out to the nonplused guests.
Most Enduring Relationship: Elizabeth and Margaret
What a study in contrasts between Queen Elizabeth -- so dutiful, so burdened by history -- and her sister, Princess Margaret, who appears to have been put on the earth to have heady, ill-conceived love affairs, smoke and drink to excess, and party late into the night on Mustique. "I'd rather die than do exercise," Margaret says in Season 6, when Elizabeth suggests ways she might cheer herself up after a series of strokes.
But the two are shown sharing a rare intimacy and a deep affection. "Hello, you," they say by way of greeting, and Elizabeth is a tender, loving nurse to her ailing sister. Their last scene together comes at the end of an exuberant flashback to the night when they slipped out to celebrate with the crowds on V-E Day, in 1945.
At the end of the evening, the two princesses return to Buckingham Palace and Elizabeth asks Margaret -- now the older version, played by Lesley Manville -- if she is coming inside.
"I'm afraid not," Margaret says. "But I will always be by your side, no matter what." It's the most heartfelt moment in the entire series.

Full text: This month's picks include tales of Southern crime, a slick Japanese remake, a hunt for hidden treasure and more.
'Fast Charlie'
Rent or buy on most major platforms.
I never knew I needed to hear Pierce Brosnan with a Southern accent until Phillip Noyce's "Fast Charlie." The former Bond plays the titular "problem solver," as he calls himself, cooler than a summer breeze. A turf war between his boss, Stan (James Caan in one of his final film roles) and a New Orleans gangster named Beggar (Gbenga Akinnagbe) results in the apparent murder of Stan and his entire crew, pushing Charlie to seek vengeance before Beggar finds him, too. Charlie's predicament also envelops his lover, Marcie (Morena Baccarin), a sharp-talking taxidermist.
Charlie is rendered in the mold of John Wick, if Wick remained in the biz until his actual retirement age. Brosman moves quietly and efficiently while leaning on smartly delivered one-liners. "What do you want?" Beggar asks. "You, not breathing," Charlie retorts. Some old dogs do well without new tricks.
'The Dirty South'
Rent or buy on most major platforms.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Another Southern revenge story, this time in Northern Louisiana, occurs in the writer-director Matthew Yerby's grim and gritty "The Dirty South." Weighed down by an alcoholic father and an absent, ne'er-do-well mother, Sue Parker (Willa Holland) is on the verge of losing her family bar to the town's wealthy patriarch, Jeb Roy (Dermot Mulroney), if she doesn't come up with $ 30,000 in three days. Lucky for her, Dion (Shane West), a petty pickpocket from an equally broken family, just rolled through town. Sue teams up with Dion to rob Jeb, striking a blow to Jeb's fief.
At its heart, "The Dirty South" is a heist flick. The resourceful Dion teaches the determined Sue the tricks of his trade and quickly falls in love with her. The climatic heist, a brawling affair between Sue and Jeb, is soundtracked by "Carol of the Bells," ripping the bow from Yerby's rough and tumble holiday treat.
'Hard Days'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Having previously written about "A Family" and the "The Village," I'm persistently on the lookout for the Japanese director Michihito Fujii's next film. His special interest in random bystanders who become stuck in larger, nefarious webs re-emerges in his slick, unhinged remake of the Korean action film "A Hard Day." Fujii's "Hard Days" opens on Detective Kudo (Junichi Okada) accidentally hitting a pedestrian with his car. This victim turns out to be at the heart of a battle between a corrupt internal affairs investigator, Yazaki (Go Ayano), who's tasked with retrieving a key to a vault, and the elderly gangster (Akira Emoto) who is intent on stealing its contents.
The messy situation immerses Kudo into a pure comedy, turning scenes requiring subterfuge -- a traffic stop or his mother's funeral -- into hilarious near catastrophes. Okada builds his performance from broad physical gags toward a showdown against a crazed Yazaki among the tombstones of a Buddhist temple, not unlike the ending to the classic western "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." Their battle of the wills even leaves an opening for a sequel.
'The Legend and Hag of Shaolin'
Stream it on Hi-Yah!
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The Chinese director Zhang Dicai's "The Legend and Hag of Shaolin," with its faceless white-clad cult following its holy goddess on a trail to a MacGuffin treasure map, certainly qualifies as offbeat. Zhang leans into the comedic potential of this otherworldly premise through the two martial arts warriors -- Hong (Gu Shangwei) and Shiyu (Zhao Wenzhuo) -- who take the map into hiding. In a country village, the pair run an acupuncture clinic that, despite their best efforts to lay low, becomes a hit with the town's women.
Though corrupt martial arts masters, a romance and a major twist arise, the lighter-than-air fighting is the film's primary vehicle. Clean frames and fluid choreography imbue Hong's leaps and slides with balletic grace. The Foley artists, the key engine to any good action film, propel these staged confrontations, making Hong's trusty spear sound like a whistling crystal searching for blood.
'Robbing Mussolini'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Pietro (Pietro Castellitto) is a small-time gun runner, who, with his sharpshooting partner Marcello (Tommaso Ragno), works to earn a living during the waning days of World War II. Though Pietro deals with the resistance, he isn't a revolutionary. He's on the side of earning the kind of money he hopes will impress his girlfriend, Yvonne (Matilda De Angelis), who happens to be the mistress of Achille Borsalino (Filippo Timi), a brutal Fascist commander. After hearing about the Italian leadership's plan to flee the country with a bounty of gold, Pietro forms a team to steal the treasure first.
The Italian director Renato De Maria's "Robbing Mussolini" is an inspired blending of "Inglourious Basterds" and "Sunset Boulevard," relying on lush period detail, ornate Art Deco sets and resplendent gowns emblazoned with intoxicating splashes of red. The heist itself, in a nearly impregnable square surrounded by high walls, barbed wire and snipers, is equally imaginative: Long tracking shots capture the bevy of explosions and well-choreographed firefights, with biting precision and arresting flair, on an audacious scale.

Full text: Alone in London with a day to kill, Jon Martin was hungry for an off-the-cuff adventure when he decided to show up for a meal at a stranger's home.
A writer from North Carolina, Mr. Martin, 36, was finishing up a trip to Europe and had just parted ways with a friend. Sick of restaurant-hopping, he was browsing the event site DesignMyNight when he stumbled across the Fengzhen supper club, a twice-a-month event promising a home-cooked Chinese and Southeast Asian feast.
He found himself taking a southbound train to the end of the line and knocking on the door of a terrace house, where he joined 11 strangers to eat a 10-course meal prepared by Jay Zhang. The host, a hairstylist by trade, was leaning into another passion that evening: taking strangers through an indulgent culinary experience.
The experience, for which Mr. Martin prepaid about £65, or $ 80, was "absolutely worth it," and left him feeling more connected to "the real, everyday people that live there and make the place what it is," he said. "You get things at a supperclub that you do not get at a restaurant."
Before the pandemic, London's supper clubs had become a popular alternative to the restaurant scene, offering a more familial alternative for a night out. The events, usually held in the homes of amateur chefs, rode a wave of popularity in the 2000s, until lockdowns forced them to stop.
Now, as communal eating has returned, the trend has evolved, with chefs old and new preparing meals. With a little sleuthing, visitors can eat Indian street food in a chef's home, Malaysian cuisine at a local community center or Sri Lankan dishes at a neighborhood cafe.
Finding the events and lining one up can take a degree of research: Many local supper clubs, shared through word of mouth or social media, are the passion projects of self-taught cooks wanting to test their skills on beloved cuisines. Those wanting to attract broader clientele post their clubs on sites like Eventbrite and DesignMyNight or offer bookings on food experience sites like Eatwith and WeFiFo. Some clubs go viral with the help of TikTokers and food influencers. Visitors searching for a particular theme can even find supper clubs for singles looking to date, lovers of comedy or listeners of Motown music.
Ticket prices for the events also vary, from £30 to as high as £150, which rivals the cost of high-end dining experiences.
What separates a supper club from a pop-up, aficionados say, involves distinct markers: a venue that, if not at someone's home, is an intimate space rather than a restaurant. Diners tend to pay for the meal before they arrive, which observers say makes the experience feel less transactional. The menu is fixed (though dietary requests can sometimes be taken into account) and tends to involve a unifying story or theme, often drawing on the chef's background. And diners, solo or in groups, are heavily encouraged to socialize.
To achieve this, some supper club hosts make use of name-tags and icebreakers like pre-dinner quizzes. Others hope shared tables, or a setting odd enough to be a conversation starter, will do the trick.
Dining on a Tube car
On a recent Saturday evening in East London, I sat with eight strangers in a repurposed 1970s Underground train carriage as part of the three-times-a-week Tube Train supper club. As we squeezed into the carriage's seats, and waited for the first course to arrive, we exchanged introductions and cracked transport-related jokes. By the time the third course arrived -- a Peruvian-Japanese dish of cured hake -- two Swedish tourists to my right and a group from Kent to my left had covered Brexit, NATO and the city's noisiest train lines. By the final course -- a sponge cake soaked in amaretto -- someone had ordered a round of Negronis for the table and the conversation had turned to sibling rivalries and bad dates.
"You can get to meet all kinds of people you might not meet otherwise, and just sit there for hours and talk this and that," said Karin Kragenskjold, a psychologist from Stockholm who brought her sister to the dinner after spotting it on social media. "I really, really liked it." She paid £67 for the night's dinner, though drinks were separately charged.
Supper clubs became widespread in Britain's capital at a buzzy time in the London food scene. Their popularity was pushed by food bloggers and critics who hailed them as a more authentic alternative to the flashy restaurant scene.
"There is something quite intimate, anarchic and unusual going to someone's home that you've never met before," said Kerstin Rodgers, the author of "Supper Club," a cookbook and how-to, and an early adopter of the trend who began hosting grass-roots events in 2009 at her home. "It's an extreme sport." (In July, she hosted a "Barbie and Ken" themed food club.) Supper clubs have "fundamentally changed" the way Londoners eat out, she said.
For chefs who felt shut out from traditional pathways to food careers, the events offered a route to success in the industry. "It gave me the confidence to get work and start my own business," Ms. Rodgers said.
Among the high profile success stories is the British restaurateur Asma Khan, whose journey from supper club chef to Soho restaurant owner was profiled on an Emmy-awarding winning season of the Netflix show "Chef's Table."
Inspired by lockdowns
Until lockdown, Akshi Shah Farrelly, 28, had not considered herself much of a cook. She started cooking to quell her cravings for her favorite Indian foods, "and it actually turned out edible," she said, laughing. "I thought -- let me keep working on it."
An English teacher by profession, she started hosting a monthly Jamanvar supper club -- the name means "feast" in Gujarati -- at her home this year, posting tickets on Eventbrite.
At one seating this year, 10 guests who had paid about £35, were gathered family-style around the Farrelly family's dining table. They were deep in conversation when Ms. Farrelly popped her head out from the kitchen to introduce the next dish: pav bhaji skewers, part of a six-course menu that she had spent weeks preparing.
Her husband bustled around the table in an apron, serving the food. Her teenage nephew politely topped up everyone's glasses. Though they had never met Ms. Farrelly, some guests had driven almost an hour to attend the dinner at her home. After dessert was served, she poured herself a drink and joined the revelry.
But even professionally trained chefs have found success in the format. After culinary training in Argentina and working in London restaurants, Beatriz Maldonado Carreño, 46, had been looking for a venue for her growing supper club. She and a colleague decided to lease a decommissioned Victoria line train that is parked at an East London museum.
"It can't be more London than that," said Ms. Maldonado Carreño who added that the Latin-inspired menu was a nod to the city's rising Latin population.
Chefs aspiring and established hosting supper clubs say they are driven less by monetary gain than by a desire to feed people and create connections.
"What people look for in a supper club is a certain degree of authenticity," said Alice Whittington, 41, who runs a Malaysian-themed club under the name Eastern Platters. At her dinners, hosted at neighborhood bars and community centers, Ms. Whittington makes shareable courses that are meant to be passed around, and curates a playlist of Southeast Asian music.
She was surprised, but delighted, when a meal last November drew a group of New Yorkers, who said they discovered it on social media. "I built this supper club around my London community. I'm very happy to show outsiders what it's like," she said, adding that she wanted to challenge the "stiff upper lip" idea of British people. "You're going to meet interesting, new people that are going to change your preconceptions about London."

The Fake Nose Hall of Fame: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Maestro" isn't the first time a supersize sniffer set off a whiff of controversy. Here's a look at the most notable schnozzes onscreen.
In August, the first trailer for "Maestro," a biopic of Leonard Bernstein, the composer of "West Side Story" and so much more, set off a backlash almost immediately: Bradley Cooper was wearing a prosthetic nose for the title role.
Critics on social media accused the star, who is also the director, of playing into an antisemitic trope with the Size XL prosthesis -- and asked whether someone who is Jewish would have been more sensitive about makeup choices.
Cooper and Netflix, where "Maestro" will begin streaming on Wednesday, declined to comment. In a statement at the time, Bernstein's three children, who had been working with Cooper on the film, came to the actor's defense, noting in a series of posts on X, "It happens to be true that Leonard Bernstein had a nice, big nose." (The family declined to offer additional comment.)
It's hardly the first time an oversize septum has made an onscreen appearance or courted controversy. Here are 12 of the most memorable fake noses in cinematic history, sorted by size from dainty ð¥¸ to elephantine ð¥¸ð¥¸ð¥¸ð¥¸ð¥¸.
Orson Welles, 'Touch of Evil' ð¥¸
Like Edmond Rostand's poet and swordsman, Cyrano de Bergerac, Orson Welles was obsessed with his nose. (He believed his was too small; it was, of course, completely normal.) But instead of channeling his fixation into a healthy pursuit like, say, helping another man win the affections of his own beloved, he sported dozens of fakes over his career. One of the largest was the pugnacious pair of nostrils he wore as the corrupt police captain Hank Quinlan in the 1958 murder mystery "Touch of Evil."
Nicole Kidman, 'The Hours' ð¥¸
Nicole Kidman may have delivered a stirring performance as Virginia Woolf in "The Hours" (2002), but Denzel Washington joked that it was the prosthetic beak she wore that won her the best actress Academy Award. ("The Oscar goes to, by a nose, Nicole Kidman," he joked when announcing her win.) Kidman wore a fresh one each day on set, though she told The Associated Press that she hung on to a silver one she was given when shooting wrapped.
Ralph Fiennes, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2' ð¥¸
Is that thing even functional? Probably not; snakes don't have noses -- just nostrils -- and smell with their forked tongues. We wouldn't be surprised if J.K. Rowling's reptilian baddie in this 2011 franchise finale had one of those, too. But at least we may finally have an answer as to what Voldemort's unnaturally long fingers are good for: Nose-picking.
Meryl Streep, 'The Iron Lady' ð¥¸
Like Kidman, Meryl Streep rode the prosthetic nose she donned to play the British prime minister Margaret Thatcher in Phyllida Lloyd's 2011 biopic to an Oscar win (her third). But this time, the transformation's genius was in its subtlety -- when the first photos of Streep on set were released, the press made nary a peep about the nose.
Laurence Olivier, 'Richard III' ð¥¸ð¥¸
Unlike Welles, Laurence Olivier didn't habitually don a fake nose for his roles because of a perceived insecurity about the size of his own; rather, it was just one of the suite of theatrical accessories, including masks and wigs, that he, and many other actors, used to transform into various characters. In "Richard III" (1955), which Olivier also directed, his character's nose is, as one blogger put it, "majestically prominent."
Rudolph, 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' ð¥¸ð¥¸
With a workshop of Santa's elves nearby in this 1964 special, the best Rudolph's dad, Donner, could do to help his son fit in at school was make a fake nose from mud? He won't be winning any father-of-the-year awards for that effort.
Margaret Hamilton, 'The Wizard of Oz' ð¥¸ð¥¸ð¥¸
Margaret Hamilton came by some of the goods to play the Wicked Witch of the West naturally: She was known for her overlarge nose, which her own father had encouraged her to have surgically altered. But she got the last laugh when she landed the role of the now-iconic villain in "The Wizard of Oz" (1939) -- for which her nose was made even longer (and greener).
Matt Damon, 'Ocean's Thirteen' ð¥¸ð¥¸ð¥¸
Sure, there are performers with bigger noses on this list, but Matt Damon might be the only one who planned a con around his. In this 2007 sequel, his character, Linus, dons the prosthesis -- which Damon nicknamed "The Brody" in a nod to the actor Adrien Brody's well, you know -- in a bid to disguise himself and gain access to a case full of diamonds.
Steve Carell, 'Foxcatcher' ð¥¸ð¥¸ð¥¸
Steve Carell's souped-up schnozz in this 2014 true-crime tale may have left some people scratching their heads -- the real-life version of his character, John du Pont, the millionaire wrestling enthusiast-turned-murderer, wasn't well known, so the attention to detail seemed excessive. But the nose did serve another purpose: It made audiences forget they were staring at Carell, who was known mainly for comedies at the time.
Alec Guinness, 'Oliver Twist' ð¥¸ð¥¸ð¥¸ð¥¸
Charles Dickens wrote Fagin in "Oliver Twist" as a thoroughly antisemitic villain, and in the 1948 film adaptation, Alec Guinness, the non-Jewish actor who played the character, spoke in a droning lisp and appeared with hooded eyes and an enormous prosthetic hook nose. The nose was deemed "incredibly insensitive," as The Jewish Chronicle wrote, and it provoked significant anger from Holocaust survivors.
Billy Crystal, 'The Princess Bride' ð¥¸ð¥¸ð¥¸ð¥¸
Billy Crystal was already so funny in "The Princess Bride" (1987) that the director, Rob Reiner, claimed that he had to leave the set during Crystal's scenes as Miracle Max because he was unable to contain his laughter. Adding a bulbous tomato of a nose took Crystal's physical comedy over the top. (Mandy Patinkin, who played Inigo Montoya, actually bruised a rib trying to stifle his own chuckles.)
Steve Martin, 'Roxanne' ð¥¸ð¥¸ð¥¸ð¥¸ð¥¸
You could land a bird on that thing (which the director, Fred Schepisi, did). Steve Martin's five-inch appendage for the 1987 film took 90 minutes to apply every day and two minutes to remove. "God how I hated that thing," he told The Washington Post.

Full text: This collection of gems includes character-driven dramas, dark comedies, smart documentaries, and romantic comedies both sunny and disturbing.
As 2023 comes to a close, our monthly showcase of hidden gems on your streaming subscription services showcases a handful of worthwhile releases from this year that may have escaped your notice: character-driven dramas, dark comedies, smart documentaries, and romantic comedies both sunny and disturbing.
'A Thousand and One'
Stream it on Amazon Prime Video.
The writer and director A.V. Rockwell begins this wrenching character drama in New York City circa 1994, and nicely recaptures the look and feel of Gotham indies of that era. But that's not just window dressing. While ostensibly telling the story of a young woman trying to go straight after a stint at Rikers Island and raise her son, Rockwell folds in relevant reminders of the city's history in the intervening years and adroitly incorporates them into her characters and their ongoing struggle, reminding us that "quality of life" policing and the dirty business of gentrification are never purely policy issues. Yet it's more than just a polemic; Teyana Taylor is shattering as the mother in question, Josiah Cross is charismatic and sympathetic as her teenage son, and the revelations of the closing scenes are wrenching and powerful.
'Rye Lane'
Stream it on Hulu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A sensation at this year's Sundance Film Festival, the debut feature from the director Raine Allen-Miller is a zippily paced and endlessly satisfying compressed-timeframe romantic comedy (think "Before Sunrise" and its follow-ups) with a delightfully of-the-moment voice and feel. Dom (David Jonsson) and Yas (Vivian Oparah) meet-cute in an art gallery bathroom; he's crying in a stall over a fresh breakup, and she's nursing a broken heart as well (albeit more quietly), and they wind up spending a few whirlwind hours baring their souls and helping each other settle their romantic scores. It's a venerable setup, rendered with vibrancy and inventiveness by Allen-Miller, and the screenplay by Nathan Bryon and Tom Melia is full of witty, quotable dialogue. But the whole thing would fall apart without the bulletproof chemistry of Jonsson and Oparah; you want them to end up together so much, and that's half the work of a great rom-com.
'Rotting in the Sun'
Stream it on Mubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Another Sundance breakout, this pitch-black comedy finds the director Sebastián Silva also starring as himself -- or rather, a depressed and suicidal version of himself. After nearly drowning at a gay nude beach, Sebastián meets a charismatic but insufferable American influencer, Jordan Firstman (playing himself, and admirably game about it), who tries to engage him in a collaboration. What follows is both psychologically bruising and uncomfortably funny, while posing thought-provoking questions about guilt, privilege and the omnipresence of social media. Most impressively, it reminds us that L.G.B.T.Q. stories don't have to be about positive representation; Silva allows his queer characters the complexity to be as annoying, difficult and exploitative as his story requires.
'El Conde'
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Pablo Larraín, the director behind "Jackie" and "Spencer," cooks up his most unconventional riff on the biopic yet with this stylized hybrid of dark comedy, social commentary and gore-heavy horror. The premise is delicious, positing that the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet (Jaime Vadell) was, in fact, a literal vampire who faked his own death and went into hiding in the country. The razor-sharp script, by Larraín and the Chilean playwright Guillermo Calderón, ruminates on the parasitic nature of capitalism, wit and intelligence, and the cleverness of the narration (which not only tells the story but wryly comments on it) is topped only by the reveal of who is voicing it. Ed Lachman's black-and-white cinematography stuns, and Larraín injects the proceedings with genre thrills and bleak laughs.
'Sanctuary'
Stream it on Hulu.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Margaret Qualley and Christopher Abbott both make brief but impactful appearances in "Poor Things," one of the awards favorites of the season; viewers who enjoy that cockeyed meditation on sexual mores will find themselves equally fascinated by the duo's provocative spring two-hander. Abbott stars as Hal, the wealthy scion of a luxury hotelier who is about to take over as the company's chief executive; Qualley is Rebecca, who first appears to be interviewing him for the job, but is gradually revealed to be his longtime dominatrix, acting out a scene of his own creation. Their tricky psychosexual exchanges, a complex series of shifting power plays and deeply embedded desires, make for situations both highly dramatic and unabashedly erotic -- the kind of movie for grown-ups it feels like they never make anymore, until they do.
'Sharksploitation'
Stream it on Shudder.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The title, for those not in the know, refers to a subgenre of exploitation movies prompted by the earthshaking success of "Jaws"-- increasingly silly and derivative stories of shark attacks, grizzled sailors, frustrated scientists, corrupt politicians and swimsuit-clad human sacrifices. Stephen Scarlata's giddily entertaining documentary tracks the evolution of these pictures, from the direct rip-offs of the '70s and '80s to their utterly insane contemporary counterparts, the cheapo disaster hybrids of the "Sharknado" ilk. But it also drills deeper, running down the history of sharks in fiction in general, as well as the (often negative) effects these works have had on the public perception of these much-maligned animals.
'De Humani Corporis Fabrica'
Stream it on Mubi.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The latest effort from the accomplished documentary filmmakers Véréna Paravel and Lucien Castaing-Taylor combines a distinct nonfiction film style -- the fly-on-the-wall institutional portrait, most frequently identified with Frederick Wiseman, focusing on a French hospital -- and a more experimental approach, utilizing specialized cameras to explore the interiors of the human body during medical procedures. The latter footage, while not for the squeamish, is fascinating, taking a detached and almost fantastical view of our organs and orifices that's akin to the landscapes of phantasmagorical science fiction. But the straightforward documentary sections are equally transfixing, forgoing talking head interviews for overheard conversations and operating room chitchat ("This guy's weirdly put together!"), and capturing moments of staggeringly raw emotion and vulnerability.

Life After Loss Can Still Have Laughs: [Review]

Author: Wilkinson, Alissa

Publication info: Wilkinson, Alissa. 

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/life-after-loss-can-still-have-laughs/docview/2910068288/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In his feature directorial debut, Daniel Levy applies a light but wise hand to a man navigating life after loss.
Romantic comedies are powered by farcical set pieces like missed connections, mistaken identities and mix-ups that lead to happy-ending fantasies. (They're all modeled on Shakespeare, in the end.) Those sorts of moments do abound in "Good Grief," which features pretty urbanites in pretty places learning lessons about friendship, life and love, just like a rom-com would. But to the immense credit of the movie's writer, director and star Daniel Levy (of "Schitt's Creek"), this is a very different kind of movie -- and a much better one.
That's not to say "Good Grief" isn't funny, because often it is. But it's as if the familiar madcap beats have been wrapped around a drama, and the result is somehow light-handed yet deft and authentic in its treatment of grief's long tail. The man at its center, Marc (Levy), is an artist living in London whose husband, Oliver (Luke Evans), dies in a car accident, leaving behind a lot of loose ends, some of them hidden from his loved ones. Marc tries to navigate the first year of life as a stunned widower with the help of his friends Sophie (Ruth Negga) and Thomas (Himesh Patel). They're all creative people -- Sophie designs costumes for movies, Thomas works at a gallery -- and all in their late 30s, with a long history behind them. Each also harbors long-simmering hurts of their own, and when the three spend a weekend in Paris together, things come to a head.
This is the sort of film you want to live inside, with beautiful furnishings, glowing light and an affluent coziness that verges on Nancy Meyers territory. Oliver was the author of a Potter-esque young adult book series that spawned a successful film franchise, so he leaves Marc comfortably well-off, with a gorgeous house into which Thomas simply moves to keep his friend company. Without having to grapple with how Marc will pay his bills -- a familiar complication of sudden loss for many people -- "Good Grief" is freed to focus on more existential and emotional dimensions. When you've entwined your life with someone else's, what happens when they're gone? When love evaporates without warning, how can you keep living?
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The answers are complex, because everyone experiences and processes various stages of grief differently. Feelings zig and zag. We try things to drown out the pain, feeling better one day and horrid the next. Nothing moves predictably. Nobody can tell you how to fix it, because it can't be fixed, only lived through.
Levy's script navigates all of this complexity nimbly, never over-explaining what Marc is going through. Instead "Good Grief" does that rare, beautiful thing: It trusts the audience to pay attention. It's restrained in revealing the details of Marc and Oliver's marriage -- joys, sorrows, compromises, conflicts -- as well as the back story of the group's friendship. There are no real twists, and every time it seemed the movie was about to take the easy way out, it didn't. Thank goodness.
How well "Good Grief" works for you may depend on your tolerance for watching long conversations among friends about pain, regrets and loss. Mostly I think it's effective; a few times, it sags, losing its rhythm briefly in abstractions. But it always returns, generating emotion without diving into a treacly pit of cloying mush. The credit lies with the actors: Negga's vivacity, Patel's aching sincerity and Levy's uncanny talent for great line readings make these people feel instantly recognizable, their chemistry legible as complicated love.
Late in the film, Marc admits that when his mother died, he "opted out" of the pain by distracting himself, and now he's doing the same again. Other characters opt out of their pain by drowning it or denying it or simply refusing to acknowledge it. Yet the pain that accompanies loss sticks around like a hollow spot in your chest, changing shape but never disappearing. In most rom-coms, conflicts tend to resolve easily, all a product of misunderstanding. In "Good Grief," resolution is not the point. The idea is to keep on loving, to find new life.
Good Grief
Rated R for tragedy, and for 30-somethings behaving like hot messes. Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

The Best Shot at a Best-Picture Nod: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: It's a very competitive year for the top Oscar. With precursor awards like the Golden Globes coming soon, here's what may make the cut.
The good news is that it's been a great year for movies.
The bad news is that, now, the battle for best picture will be bloodier than ever.
With such a wide field of acclaimed contenders, plenty of worthy films will be dealt a bad hand when the Oscar nominations are announced on Jan. 23. Even today's self-imposed assignment to narrow the list to the 10 likeliest nominees proved a harrowing task; instead, I have hedged with an unlucky 13.
Ahead of the Golden Globes on Sunday, and the bellwether industry nominations next week from the producers' and actors' guilds, here are the current contenders with the most viable shot at a best-picture nomination, ranked in descending order according to their certainty.
'Oppenheimer'
Christopher Nolan's blockbuster biopic has the feeling of an old-fashioned sweeper: It's a highbrow film and a populist hit -- exactly the sort of movie Oscar voters and general audiences should be able to agree upon. Still, this race isn't sewn up. Recent best-picture winners tend to tug more at the heart than at the head, and there are a slew of contenders that can make a more effective case for that organ. And though Nolan has been nominated five times before, he has never been able to convince voters to actually hand him the Oscar: Even when he directed "Dunkirk" (2017), the sort of technically stupendous World War II movie that should have been a slam-dunk for the academy, voters flocked to the warm and cuddly Guillermo del Toro ("The Shape of Water") over the crisp, professorial Nolan.
'The Holdovers'
Could Alexander Payne's Christmas movie be this year's "CODA," a scrappy little heartwarmer that defeats the imposing auteurist film it's up against? Set in the 1970s and shot like a film from that era (even the precredits studio logos are appealingly vintage), this boarding-school dramedy couldn't be more of a bull's-eye for older academy members, who'll be eager to give "The Holdovers" their they-don't-make-'em-like-this-anymore vote. Paul Giamatti, the film's lead, and Da'Vine Joy Randolph, have could-win heat in the actor and supporting actress categories, and movies that triumph in the acting and screenplay races have a nearly unbeatable portfolio for best picture. If Payne manages a best-director nomination, it's a good sign that this underdog could slip past all the big-budget spectacles and go the distance.
'Barbie'
Greta Gerwig's plastic-fantastic comedy was indisputably the movie of 2023: This billion-dollar blockbuster went over like a rock concert in theaters, and its creative swerves had Hollywood types marveling at what Gerwig was able to get away with. Though Oscar voters have gotten a bad rap for ignoring mega-budget hits, they're typically willing to make an exception for movies with a distinctive point of view and a high level of craftsmanship, which the deliciously decorated "Barbie" has in spades. A fun movie that's full of heart and a standout in this group of contenders, "Barbie" is limited only by the not insignificant number of voters who'll be thinking, "Can I really give Hollywood's most prestigious award to a toy?"
'Killers of the Flower Moon'
Martin Scorsese's well-regarded movie would have a better shot at the top Oscar if "Oppenheimer" had been a contender in a different year: Between these two weighty, three-hour historical dramas, voters may deem Nolan's more significant, simply because it made nearly a billion dollars worldwide. Still, the 81-year-old Scorsese has won only one Oscar and time is ticking for the academy to give him another. If his lead, Lily Gladstone, comes out on top of a fiercely competitive best-actress race, that could help burnish the film's chances of picking up another significant prize.
'Poor Things'
The Venice Film Festival kicks off awards season in earnest every August, and Emma Stone movies that play there often get a sensational launchpad: Just look at Oscar favorites like "La La Land" and "Birdman" and "The Favourite," the last of which kicked off Stone's very fruitful partnership with the director Yorgos Lanthimos. Their most recent film, "Poor Things," won the Golden Lion at Venice this year and quickly established itself as a major contender, able to compete for up to three acting nominations (for Stone and her supporting actors Mark Ruffalo and Willem Dafoe) and a huge haul of below-the-line nods for its stunning costumes, cinematography, production design and visual effects. There's no doubt it'll be a best-picture player, but is there a narrative to push the film and Stone over the top in a very crowded year?
'Past Lives'
Celine Song's directorial debut was a breakout indie hit this summer, but this intimate romantic drama was in danger of receding once bigger and noisier rivals arrived in the fall. Fortunately, "Past Lives" begins this awards season in strong shape, earning the best-film trophy at the Gotham Awards, five nominations at the Independent Spirit Awards, and a key nomination for best drama at the Golden Globes. Like "The Holdovers," it's a smaller-scale film that some voters simply adore, and that passion will count for a lot in this field.
'American Fiction'
There may be no more auspicious festival prize than the People's Choice Award voted on by attendees of the Toronto International Film Festival: Every movie that won there over the past decade went on to score a best picture nomination, and three of them -- "12 Years a Slave," "Green Book" and "Nomadland" -- actually took the top Oscar. This bodes awfully well for the writer-director Cord Jefferson's contemporary comedy "American Fiction," which hit big out of Toronto, netted crucial nominations at the Golden Globes and Indie Spirits, and ought to land its leading man, Jeffrey Wright, the first Oscar nomination of his long career. (I should note Jefferson is a friend.)
'Maestro'
Bradley Cooper's first directorial effort, "A Star Is Born," deserved better from the Oscars. It won only the original-song trophy when so much else about it, including Cooper's ace lead performance, was also worth recognizing. Then again, Cooper had only himself to blame for that result: He was so determined to land the directing nomination, which ultimately eluded him, that he didn't give his acting the push it merited. I wonder if something similar may happen this year: Cooper's Leonard Bernstein drama, "Maestro," is an even bigger directorial swing, and though he delivers exactly the sort of makeup-aided, transformative real-person performance that Oscar voters go gaga for, the fate of "Maestro" currently seems tied up in whether the directors' branch will finally admit Cooper to the club.
'Anatomy of a Fall'
The hip studio Neon has a knack for guiding Palme d'Or winners from the Cannes stage into Oscar's inner circle, and the French courtroom drama "Anatomy of a Fall" could very well follow in the footsteps of Neon's "Parasite" and "Triangle of Sadness." It helps that the lead, Sandra Hüller, has enough heat to make it into the best-actress race, though the film was dinged by France's decision to submit instead "The Taste of Things" as its contender for the international film Oscar: As fans of "RRR" found last year, it's hard for world cinema to penetrate the best-picture lineup without a corresponding nod in the international-feature category.
'May December'
Can Todd Haynes finally score a best-picture nominee? Though the director's drama "Carol" got awfully close, "May December" is the most viable contender he has ever made, a favorite with critics' groups and a mainstream conversation-starter since its debut on Netflix. If Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore, and Charles Melton all pick up acting nominations and the writer Samy Burch snags an original-screenplay nod, a place in the best-picture race ought to follow, but Haynes and his oeuvre have proved too smart for the room before. Let's hope the academy's tastes have caught up.
'The Zone of Interest'
Jonathan Glazer's audacious Holocaust drama is one of the most acclaimed movies of the year, the probable winner of the international-feature Oscar, and could even score Glazer an auteurist slot in the best-director category. Still, its chances for best picture are harder to predict. Every other contender on this list is likely to earn at least one acting nomination and any such recognition for "Zone" would come as a big surprise. It would also be the most challenging art-house film to make the best-picture lineup in ages: When older, more traditional voters cue the movie on their academy app and are met with a black screen and several minutes of unsettling score, will they stay seated through this unusual overture or close the app to call tech support?
'The Color Purple'
This musical take on the classic Alice Walker novel is banking on some late-breaking momentum, aided by a strong box office return on Christmas Day, to push it into the best-picture lineup. Still, it's missed out on a few key nominations, failing to make the American Film Institute's populist-leaning 10-best list or even snag a Golden Globe nomination for best comedy or musical, which should have been a given. Earning an ensemble nomination from the Screen Actors Guild on Jan. 10 is all but necessary to move "The Color Purple" up on this list.
'Society of the Snow'
Last season, when the academy announced semifinalist shortlists in a wide variety of below-the-line categories, Netflix's war film "All Quiet on the Western Front" had the sort of surprisingly strong showing that presaged a stellar nine Oscar nominations and four wins. That's the reason I'm keeping an eye on the streamer's Spanish-language plane-crash drama, "Society of the Snow," which made the international-feature shortlist and also popped up as a semifinalist for visual effects, score, makeup and hairstyling (even edging out "Barbie" in the latter category). If all of these branches are already taking notice, don't be surprised if "Society of the Snow" vaults past a better-known contender by the morning of the Oscar nominations.

One Cinematographer but Two Very Different Looks: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Erik Messerschmidt worked with the directors Michael Mann and David Fincher to create cohesive worlds that feel nothing alike.
Michael Mann's new drama "Ferrari," about several important weeks in the life of the racecar driver and manufacturer Enzo Ferrari, is many things: biographical drama, thriller, period costume film, and also a story about business rivalries, domestic disputes and personal grief. Adam Driver plays the automotive magnate as a man divided between his obsessive pursuit of professional glory and his straining responsibilities as a husband and father. Accordingly Mann approaches these two worlds with different, even diametrically opposed styles. There are intense, breakneck racing sequences and dark, elegiac domestic scenes, and little in between.
"There's really two distinct aesthetic sensibilities in the film," Erik Messerschmidt, the film's director of photography, said in a recent interview. "Michael wanted the interpersonal drama parts of the film to be more classically made than the racing."
Messerschmidt said that for the heavier moments Mann "wanted to reference Italian Renaissance paintings," with their pronounced shadows and dense compositions; the racing scenes, by contrast, made use of cutting-edge technology and contemporary techniques.
Messerschmidt also served as the cinematographer on "The Killer," David Fincher's recent thriller about a hit man dealing with the fallout of a job gone wrong, now streaming on Netflix. Looking at the two films side by side reveals the marked contrasts in the directors' approach.
"Their use of the camera, in particular, is very different," Messerschmidt said. "Michael is often looking for those spontaneous moments, and I think he's a little more shoot-from-the-hip than David is. Whereas David is a very precise, methodical filmmaker -- he's one of a kind that way."
Here, Messerschmidt explains how the look of "Ferrari" was achieved on and off the track and how it compared with his work on "The Killer."
Vintage Speed
"Ferrari" opens with a brisk montage of grainy black-and-white newsreel footage that shows Enzo in his youth racing for Alfa Romeo. Mann, who had been trying to make "Ferrari" since the early 2000s, spent a lot of time poring over archival footage of motor racing from this era, and he and the crew watched it often to help faithfully capture the look. While shooting an early racing sequence, Mann had the idea to open with Enzo himself on the track, to remind the audience that he used to be a racer.
The scene is "a combination of actual archival footage and visual-effects compositions of Adam driving a period-correct racecar from the '20s," Messerschmidt explained. Driver had to actually get on the track: it's not a sound stage or a green screen but footage of him that's been rotoscoped, which accounts for why this shot looks so realistic.
By contrast, Messerschmidt and Fincher spent a lot of time adjusting images for "The Killer" in postproduction to hone the look of key locations in Paris, the Dominican Republic and Chicago, which they wanted to differentiate aesthetically. "All of those places have a unique look, in terms of architecture, design and how the light falls," the cinematographer said. Paris, for instance, was depicted with "this kind of split-tone color palette of cool shadows and warm highlights."
While each location had its own visual identity, Messerschmidt said he was conscious of "still keeping them within one cohesive world."
"I didn't want it to feel like a ransom note of color palettes," he joked.
Racing Along
The second half of "Ferrari" focuses on his efforts to win the 1957 Mille Miglia, a wildly competitive race that covers almost 1,000 miles on public roads. To capture its blistering intensity, Mann got extremely close to the vehicles, as in this shot of two cars speeding neck and neck on a winding mountain overpass. The camera team, Messerschmidt said, was following just behind in a Porsche Cayenne. "We were driving these cars at the actual speeds," Messerschmidt said. "Michael was not interested in faking it or undercranking the camera."
As in this shot, many of the driving scenes have a rawness that emphasizes just how fast and dangerous the racing is. The style, Messerschmidt said, "has a very vérité feel to it," which adds to the sensation of raw power. "These cars are visceral, they are loud, and the engines shake, and the suspension is stiff. That was something we wanted to show from very beginning."
Night Drive
Part of the Mille Miglia race takes place on an open stretch of road in the dead of night. The only sources of light are the cars' headlights, which illuminate the rain-slick road and reflect off one another. Shooting this sequence without conventional movie lighting, Messerschmidt said, was a matter of necessity, because there was no obvious place to put up lights. "I had a lot of anxiety about that scene," he said. "I didn't really know what I was going to do."
Eventually, he said, he "decided to roll the dice and just do it with the headlights."
"The Killer" makes striking use of nighttime as well, in part because the movie is about a man who "lives and lurks in the shadows," Messerschmidt said. "We wanted to work in this murky world. It felt like an appropriate thing to lean into that in the film."
Up Close and Personal
When "Ferrari" is not on the track, the camera has a tendency to probe the characters closely, sometimes getting right up in their faces. In this sequence on the factory grounds, the lens gets so near Enzo that his features become almost a blur. "When Michael really wants to get the audience into a character and bring you close, he will put you literally close to the actor," Messerschmidt said.
To achieve this "very odd point of view," Messerschmidt employed a "skater scope," which extends the lens about 10 inches from the body of the camera. That extension "means we can get very close to the actor without the Steadicam itself hitting the actor's knees," he explained.
Fincher also wants to use the camera to understand his characters in "The Killer," but "the camera has no personality in the way that Michael's camera does," Messerschmidt explained. "Ferrari" has "a very subjective camera," while Fincher "is working with a conversation between subjectivity and objectivity." The camera "reinforces" the unnamed executioner played by Michael Fassbender.
This is clear in the many precise frames and symmetrical compositions -- an aesthetic that mirrors the hit man's meticulousness. "When the killer is in control and confident, the camera is extremely confident, in terms of how we operate it and how the shots cut together," Messerschmidt said. "When the killer loses control and starts to fall apart, the camera falls apart as well."
Memories at Sunset
A centerpiece of "Ferrari" takes place at an opera, where Enzo has an intense emotional reaction. Mourning the loss of his son, he thinks back to their time together, as the film cuts to brief, gauzy flashbacks, including this one, in which the two are playing in a field. The camera is very low to the ground, and the sun is just setting over the horizon; the delicate style is reminiscent of the work of Terrence Malick.
"I think I get now maybe how Malick works," Messerschmidt said. For this flashback, he and Mann started "working with the actors and the camera, improvising a bit," he said, adding that they just happened to catch this interaction. "It was very spur of the moment. It wasn't previsualized."
Small and Agile
At times during the racing sequences in "Ferrari," the camera is fixed to the body of the car itself, stuck alongside as the vehicle zooms at extraordinary speeds. In this shot, we see the bold Ferrari logo against a whooshing blur of grass and road. Because they were sticking a camera onto a car that was pushing its technical limits, "we had to be very conscious of weight distribution and aerodynamics," Messerschmidt said. Their choice for these shots was a Red Komodo camera, "which is about the size of a Rubik's Cube." As Messerschmidt noted, "This would have been a very challenging film to make with a large, cumbersome motion picture camera."

Full text: "Mad Max" gets a prequel, "The Wiz" returns to Broadway and Larry David gets another crack at a series finale.
The Met Looks to Right a Historic Wrong
Early in 1969, the Metropolitan Museum sparked an uproar with an exhibition called "Harlem on My Mind: Cultural Capital of Black America, 1900-1968." Although conceived as the museum's first big-ticket acknowledgment of African American creativity, it included no visual art beyond documentary photomurals. Black artists, many working in Harlem just blocks north of the museum, angrily picketed the show, denouncing it as evidence of art world racism writ large.
As a student visiting New York in 1969 I saw, and was baffled by, that show, so I'm eager to see a new one that can only be viewed as a corrective to it, the marquee-scale survey of paintings, sculptures, photographs and films titled "The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism" scheduled to open at the Met in February. The announced inclusion of a wealth of African American art considered inadmissible to the Met half a century ago -- some represented by rarely seen loans from the collections of some of the country's historically Black colleges and universities -- is, on its own, an exciting prospect. And so is the exhibition's larger promise to fully position modern African American art not just as a local phenomenon, but as a generator of international modernism itself.
Furiosa Gets an Origin Story
This year brings a lot of sequels: "Inside Out 2," "Beetlejuice 2," "Joker: Folie à Deux," "Gladiator 2," "Dune: Part Two," plus new films in the "Quiet Place" and "Venom" and "Paddington" and "Godzilla" and even "Despicable Me" cinematic universes. I rarely get excited for non-original films, since most of them come off as naked cash grabs capitalizing on existing I.P. and risk-averse audiences. But I'm always curious if a sequel (or prequel or side-quel or whatever) will manage to be good, and the one I'm excited for is "Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga." George Miller returns to direct an origin story for the character that Charlize Theron played in 2015's "Mad Max: Fury Road," with Anya Taylor-Joy in the Furiosa role. I love a dystopia, and few have exceeded the sheer adrenaline and dread of "Fury Road." I'm revisiting all the "Mad Max" movies in preparation.
Tom Hollander Tackles Truman Capote
Clive Owen as an aging Sam Spade on AMC's "Monsieur Spade" (Jan. 14), Helena Bonham Carter as the 1970s soap opera star Noele Gordon ("Nolly," PBS), Ben Mendelsohn and Juliette Binoche as Christian Dior and Coco Chanel ("The New Look," Apple TV+, Feb. 14) -- there may have never been a new TV year with so many intriguing bits of casting. But the one that has me the most curious is the wonderfully acidic British actor Tom Hollander playing Truman Capote in FX's "Feud: Capote vs. the Swans" (Jan. 31). Naomi Watts, Diane Lane, Chloë Sevigny and Calista Flockhart play some of the society women Capote befriended and then used as material for his highly unflattering roman à clef "Answered Prayers"; if the thought of Hollander channeling Capote as he calls Happy Rockefeller "that fat-ankled harridan" turns you on, then you must tune in.
'The Wiz' Returns to Broadway
I tell everyone that my son Sidney is a musical theater kid. So naturally, his favorite movie is "The Wiz." And, of course, for his eighth birthday, we went to Baltimore, where the musical version first debuted in 1975, and its current tour started this past October. My parents even saw one of its 1,672 performances during its original four-year Broadway run, when it won seven Tonys, including best musical. Because I come from a family of avid "Wiz" fans, I find myself anticipating its return to Broadway this April at the Marquis Theater with more zeal than usual.
Based on L. Frank Baum's children's book "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" and with an all-black cast, "The Wiz" is a cultural classic, so its revivals have to come with some powerful updates. Directed by Schele Williams with additional writing by Amber Ruffin, it now features Nichelle Lewis, whose TikTok audition landed her the role as Dorothy; a stirring Melody A. Betts as Aunt Em and Evillene; Kyle Ramar Freeman as the Lion, Phillip Johnson Richardson as the Tinman; Avery Wilson as the Scarecrow; and Deborah Cox as Glinda, with Wayne Brady returning to Broadway to play the Wiz. My sneak peek already has me excited about this dynamic cast, Hannah Beachler's ("Black Panther") kaleidoscopic set and the former Beyoncé choreographer JaQuel Knight's dance moves, especially when Dorothy and her squad of outsiders make their way to Emerald City.
A Double Dose of Itamar Moses
Talk about range: February brings to New York stages two exceedingly contrasting works by Itamar Moses, who previously wrote the book for "The Band's Visit." Feb. 15 through March 10, the Public Theater presents Lila Neugebauer's staging of "The Ally," starring Josh Radnor as a Jewish college professor caught in the crossfire between wokeism and free speech when asked to sign a social justice manifesto. The topicality is off the charts.
Then, Feb. 28 through April 7 at the Minetta Lane Theater, Audible reunites Moses with some of his "Band's Visit" collaborators for "Dead Outlaw." The musical, directed by David Cromer, with a book by Moses and songs by David Yazbek and Erik Della Penna, is about ... a mummy. Specifically, the mummy of a failed Old West gunslinger, used as a sideshow attraction for decades before the truth is discovered in a super-gross way. Spoiler alert -- I guess literally.

Stylish Spy Moves, Stacked Cast (and One Cat)
The concept at the center of "Argylle" -- a best-selling author discovers that what she writes comes true -- immediately reminds me of one of my favorite films, "Stranger Than Fiction." (I'm just a sucker for meta stories about the power of storytelling.) Starring Bryce Dallas Howard as a meek spy novelist whose words draw her into the dangerous world of espionage, "Argylle" (opening Feb. 2) is directed by Matthew Vaughn, whose devilishly stylish "Kingsman" franchise suggests he'll know just how to play to and satirize the spy movie genre. The cast is filled with actors who have taken on action roles but have also shown impressive comedic chops (Henry Cavill, Sam Rockwell, John Cena and Samuel L. Jackson among them), while the cinematography looks to share the same sleek style Vaughn has made his signature. And an inconvenient, frazzled cat in a backpack? The cherry on top.
Larry David Does Another Finale
How in the world did Larry David do it? It's a question I've been hearing a lot lately. How did he make one of the funniest episodes of television ever out of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? How did he tackle race, the Holocaust, Trump without getting in trouble? How did he make us care so much about these insufferable rich Hollywood types whining during their golf game? How did he manage the impossible feat of putting on 11 seasons of a show dominated by improvised small talk? The questions are rhetorical, of course, but everyone knows the answer. Larry David is really really (dare I say "pretty preeetty") good at what he does. So, his last season of "Curb Your Enthusiasm," which premieres Feb. 4, is a sad occasion. But it's also one of the few things on television that I will not tape but watch exactly when it airs. I don't know what the storylines of the next season will be, but here's one idea to consider: David has already written a much-anticipated finale, the one on "Seinfeld." I thought it was excellent. Many disagreed. Jerry Seinfeld has said onstage that he will be revisiting this finale in some form. Food for thought.
'Girls5eva' Hit the Road
When Season 2 of "Girls5eva" ended in 2022, my hopes for a renewal were slim; no Peacock original show has actually made it to a third season. But now it isn't a Peacock show anymore: There is a third season premiering March 14, but it will be on Netflix. Season 1 found the '90s girl group reuniting, and in Season 2 they put out their album. This season, they're heading out on tour, an experience for which they are not prepared. I am of course looking forward to the zingy jokes and warped nostalgia, but the even bigger wish is for another absolute banger that will join "Four Stars," "B.P.E." and "I'm Afraid" on my playlists.
Christmas in Spring at the Met
First things first: "El Niño" isn't an opera about weather patterns. In fact, while John Adams's energetic, eclectic two-hour score is opera-length, it's not exactly an opera at all. It's an oratorio, in the tradition of Handel's "Messiah," that tells the Nativity story without characters or naturalistic scenes. It's more of a reflection on the tale; the choral numbers and solos have their texts drawn from the Bible as well as from Latin American poetry, all sewn together by Adams and Peter Sellars.
First performed in 2000, the piece isn't always staged, but for its Metropolitan Opera premiere (April 23-May 17), the company is giving it a grand treatment. The production, directed by Lileana Blain-Cruz, boasts the conductor Marin Alsop, the soprano Julia Bullock, the bass-baritone Davóne Tines and the mezzo-soprano J'Nai Bridges -- inspired musical forces. It's a few months late for Christmas, but "El Niño" will be welcome nevertheless.
Brittany Howard Unveils Startling New Songs
Unbridled emotions, sonic ambitions and audacious singing have been the makings of Brittany Howard's songs since she arrived with Alabama Shakes in 2012. She's steeped in Southern soul and rock, and her voice has gospel-rooted power. But with Alabama Shakes and then on her 2019 solo album, "Jaime," Howard moved far beyond revivalism, pushing toward startling new hybrids; her co-producer, Shawn Everett, has also worked with SZA and Kacey Musgraves. Howard's second solo album, "What Now," is due Feb. 2, and its advance singles have plunged into the turbulence of a failing relationship, leaping between the percussive and the ethereal. The full album promises even more innovative ups and downs. Howard begins a North American tour on Feb. 6, with New York City shows Feb. 16 and 17 at Webster Hall.

Caught Up in People Caught Up in Cults: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The stories are juicy, but the volume is perhaps tied to a persistent question: Why do so many people believe so many crazy things?
Nobody joins a cult. They just joined an exciting group of people trying to change the world. They just wanted to empower themselves, to feel better, to know Jesus, to do drugs with interesting people, to be different from their parents, to live off the grid. Then things got hairy and now here they are, sagely describing this process to a dutiful filmmaker.
Our current cult documentary boom has been going strong for years now, beginning in earnest with 2018's "Wild Wild Country" and not really letting up. There has been "Jonestown: Terror in the Jungle," "Heaven's Gate: The Cult of Cults," "The Way Down," "Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey," "Stolen Youth: Inside the Cult at Sarah Lawrence," "Waco: American Apocalypse," "Shiny Happy People," "The Deep End," "In the Name of God: A Holy Betrayal." There were two Nxivm documentaries -- "The Vow" and "Seduced: Inside the Nxivm Cult" -- and two more on the online romance group Twin Flames Universe: "Desperately Seeking Soulmate" and "Escaping Twin Flames." In the past month or so there has been "Love Has Won" on HBO and "Born Into Synanon," on Paramount+. This is nowhere near a comprehensive list.
So what's to account for our apparently bottomless appetite for such tales? (Streamers wouldn't keep making them if nobody was watching.) Well, on a purely craven level, these stories are juicy as hell -- sex, love, murder, redemption, ecstatic connections and a rending of the social fabric. Money, money, money. You'd be crazy not to make a documentary about all of it, about all the weird hairdos and strange lingo, all the anguish and absurdity.
But the volume and repetition perhaps reflects a broader, persistent sense of unease, a need to ask, over and over: How in the world do people believe things like this? Why do people worship lies? Is there a way to show them the light?
Oh, gosh, if anyone knew the answer to that, we'd be living in a very different world. Individually, these documentaries demonstrate that lots of people believe lots of garbage. Taken as a whole body, though, they suggest that, actually, nearly everyone believes at least a little garbage.
Some of the better documentaries stress the relationship between high-control groups and general social ills: "Seduced," the shorter but more perceptive Nxvim documentary, highlights the misogyny that drove much of the organization. "The Way Down" traces an Evangelical leader's message from intense body shaming to even more intense advocacy for corporal punishment.
The less curious instantiations, which present the leaders' hectoring and philosophizing at length, can start to feel misguided. They're like those 1990s girls-magazine articles about the dangers of eating disorders that also doubled as how-to guides for budding anorexics.
But even as quality and particulars vary, there is a sameness to a lot of these shows. Subjects ready themselves and chat to off-camera producers. We see joyous footage of the early days, and then usually an ex-member says, "Or that's what I thought," or sometimes, "But then things started to change." Some former members are horrified by what they've done, and others want to make sure the story includes the good parts, too, or they even still believe. Sometimes family members describe their heartache.
Many of these groups have already been the subjects of at least one podcast or article before making the leap to television. If you're interested in high-control groups in general, this can make the TV documentaries feel even more repetitive.
In format, perspective, style and distribution, the contemporary cult exposé nestles in comfortably with two other recent booms: true crime and scam sagas. Cults are also adjacent to conspiracies, another growth industry -- both are forms of tribalism defined by their distance from reality. Synanon and the like sit alongside stories of Theranos, crypto frauds, pyramid schemes and QAnon not just on streaming services, but also within the greater misinformation and disinformation diaspora.
There's a gawking appeal to this programming, of course, and a reasonable desire to hold people accountable for causing so much despair. But after spending hundreds of hours hearing from all sorts of devotees, what becomes clear is that participation in a cult is often a response to the sorrows of the world, to its shortcomings and capricious cruelty, to being stuck or maligned or afraid. No, we are not all equally susceptible to undue influence, but if you've ever bought something because of advertising, easy does it on that high horse.
In "Escaping Twin Flames," a former member says her deconstruction occurred when the leader told her to write a report on the two Nxivm documentaries to affirm the ways he was not a cult leader. "Every point we were coming across when we were doing this research was pointing to the fact that he was, in fact, a cult leader," she says. "Things started to churn at that point."
Perhaps things start to churn for viewers, too. The drive to understand others is also a drive to understand ourselves. Could it be that the appeal of cult stories partly reflects a desire to deconstruct pernicious control in our own lives? Or to at least reconsider the extent to which we've substituted the standards of capitalism, patriarchy, diet culture, consumerism, improv comedy, whatever, for our own? If we can nail down how other people get fooled and then unfooled, then maybe we'd know what to do when something seems not quite right.
It is scary when you begin to think that the institutions, leaders and premises that define your life and way of thinking may be corrupt and illegitimate. But maybe if you could watch, oh, hundreds of people in a variety of smaller contexts on every streaming platform and cable network go through that process, the path forward would become a little clearer. You would have some idea of where to head. You might feel less isolated. Actually, maybe we could watch together. In fact, we could form a little group.

Not Your Average Lady of the House: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Todd Haynes and Julianne Moore take one of the most overlooked characters in Hollywood and peel back the layers to expose lonely souls and monsters.
Near the beginning of Todd Haynes's new film, "May December," there's a moment that has become the subject of fascination. Julianne Moore's Gracie Atherton-Yoo is preparing for a barbecue. She tells her teenage twins to be careful as they head to the rooftop with friends, and then she goes to the fridge. The music swells. A look of fear crosses her face: "I don't think we have enough hot dogs."
It's certainly a funny beat, but it's also one that taps into themes that Haynes has been exploring and subverting with Moore for nearly 30 years: the construct of the perfect American suburban housewife. Gracie's expression indicates something is indeed terribly wrong, but it's just the thin notion that her day might not go as planned. The worst thing that could happen is that there might not be enough hot dogs. (The next cut reveals there are plenty of hot dogs.)
But Gracie is, of course, no ordinary housewife. She's married to Joe (Charles Melton), who was just 13 when they began the relationship that would send her to prison, where she gave birth to their first child. And yet the life she has built for herself is, on the surface, idyllic. She has a house by the water. She bakes cakes and hosts parties. If not for the circumstances of how she and her husband got together, she would seem the ideal wife and mother. Or would she?
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Since Haynes's first collaboration with Moore, on "Safe" (1995), the two have worked together to dig into his -- and America's -- preoccupation with the housewife archetype. But these women, as Haynes envisions them and as Moore portrays them, are never quite what they seem, and their movies chip away at notions of domestic femininity that the characters at first hold dear.
Each film -- "Safe," "Far From Heaven" (2002) and now "May December" -- opens with a Moore housewife living contentedly in carefully curated spaces. Then we watch as her views are challenged by outside forces that pollute the havens she has created. Together, Haynes and Moore probe the psyches of women who are so often dismissed as a sunny June Cleaver from "Leave It to Beaver" type, there to serve and do little else.
In different films, these characters might be treated as window dressing. Cinema history is littered with overlooked spouses, but Moore and Haynes instead analyze them. Moore's knack for playing fragility gives these ladies a disarmingly porcelain quality that we watch get shattered.
In "Safe," Moore is Carol, a wife and stepmother living in the San Fernando Valley in 1987. Her days are filled with little tasks -- gardening, going to the gym -- and initially the biggest disruption seems to involve the couch she and her husband have ordered arriving in the wrong color. The moment of that realization anticipates Moore's hot dog exclamation in "May December." She stops in her tracks and exclaims, "Oh my God!" with a look of utter dismay as if this were a terrible tragedy.
But then Carol grows sick, and she begins to suspect that it's the modern world that is poisoning her. Her illness means she can no longer go about her routine of easy socializing with other women in her sphere. At a baby shower full of minor pleasantries, a friend's child is sitting on her lap when she has an attack. The others at the party notice her gasping for air, but they are slow to go to her side. Haynes holds her in a frame all alone for a beat as the camera closes in on her face in a state of sheer distress and the ominous score by Ed Tomney hums.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Moore plays Carol with an almost babylike voice. And yet that innocence, also demonstrated by her penchant for drinking milk, cannot protect her from the toxicity that she claims her body rejects. By the end, she has left her home duties and husband behind and moved to a self-help retreat, where even the usual cabins are too exposed for her. The only way she can survive is contained inside a safe house. She looks in a small mirror and tells herself, "I love you."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Haynes once explained to The Film Stage that with the movie, he "wanted your own narrative expectations to first drive this woman out of a certain kind of oppression, and then ultimately drive her back into it." At the end, Carol is still sheltered, but not like she used to be; she's sheltered in a completely different, arguably even more unnerving way. She has broken free from her housewife existence; however, she has locked herself up. She loves herself, but at what cost?
The same can be said of Moore's Cathy Whitaker in "Far From Heaven," Haynes's homage to the melodramas of Douglas Sirk set in the 1950s. Cathy -- a demure presence who uses words like "jiminy" -- is so practiced at her role as a devoted housewife that in one of her early scenes she is being interviewed for a local gazette as a model for other women "with families and home to keep up." But as she's talking to the reporter she notices something that shakes her: a Black man walking through her yard. His presence is alien in the fall Connecticut foliage. She softens when she hears that he is Raymond Deagan (Dennis Haysbert), the son of her late gardener.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Raymond's arrival coincides with another revelation for Cathy. Late one night she decides to bring dinner to her husband, Frank (Dennis Quaid), in his office, dutifully fulfilling her role as a caretaker. She finds him kissing another man. As she wrestles with her husband's homosexuality, she starts to feel like an outlier among her crowd. That feeling becomes manifest when she starts to associate publicly with Raymond, breaking the neighborhood's taboo of friendship with a Black person. She speaks to him at an art exhibition, drawing sneering glances from her peers. It's a scene that in some ways echoes the baby shower in "Safe." We can see how Cathy becomes unusual to the other women around her, except in this case she finds human connection she never knew she needed.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Still, like Carol, Cathy gets no happy ending. She and Frank decide to divorce, and Raymond, after his daughter is injured in a racist attack, chooses to move away. Cathy tries to catch Raymond before his train leaves, and while they share a smile, he doesn't disembark. Cathy is alone. With both Carol and Cathy, we watch their worlds being broken open and root for that experience to push them into better places. Instead, both are abandoned. For as much as they may try to leave their societal roles behind, they are powerless to undo the decades of conditioning that boxed in women like them.
On the surface, Gracie from "May December" has much in common with Carol and Cathy: her desire for her home to be beautiful; her distinctive, childlike way of speaking. And yet Gracie differs from her fellow heroines and not simply because she's the only one of the Moore heroines not written by Haynes; the movie's screenplay is by Samy Burch. From the outset we know there's a rot inside Gracie. It's not her environment that's a plague: It's Gracie herself.
The plot is set in motion by the arrival of an actress, Elizabeth (Natalie Portman), who wants to study Gracie to play her in an independent film. But while Elizabeth stirs up latent emotions in Joe, Gracie resolutely maintains the blinders she has put on that allow her to live an ostensibly normal, guilt-free life despite her crimes. In the middle of an awkward family dinner at a restaurant, after Gracie's older children from her previous marriage arrive, she encounters Elizabeth in the bathroom. Elizabeth asks her what her expectations were for the evening.
"That tonight would go well, that my children would love me and my life would be perfect," Gracie explains. Elizabeth suggests that perspective is naïve, to which Gracie responds, without irony, "I am naïve. I always have been. In a way, it's been a gift."
Carol and Cathy are tempted to venture beyond their confines, but Gracie takes solace in hers. She's an American monster who uses the stereotype of the good housewife to live with the evil she has committed. While her compatriots end their stories in isolation, Gracie gets to go back to worrying about hot dogs. Domesticity isn't a prison for her. It's a safe house.

Vintage Films Are His Animating Passion: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: "Guess you could say I hoard," said Tommy José Stathes as he maneuvered around the shelves of his storage unit. Large enough to accommodate a minivan, it was stuffed with thousands of film canisters stacked floor to ceiling, arranged by studio and labeled with Sharpie. "Bray: Farmer Alfalfa Sees New York," one read. Another said: "Fleischer: Adventures of Popeye (1935)."
"Oh," he muttered absently as he paused before a tower of brass movie cans, "what do we have here?"
Once a week, Mr. Stathes heads from his small studio apartment in Queens to his enormous collection of vintage cartoons: a celluloid library of around 4,000 reels, some of the prints more than 100 years old. It is certainly one of the largest collections of early animated films anywhere in the world -- and that accounts for the holdings of the Library of Congress, according to an archivist who does restoration there.
Usually, Mr. Stathes is searching for a specific clip -- something with Felix the Cat ("the biggest star in 1920s cartoons"), say, or Popeye -- for the regular events he hosts at Metrograph, an arty Lower East Side movie house with red velvet seating and chilled Junior Mints.
For his most recent screening, he dug out some vintage reels with a Christmas feel, like Fleischer Studios' "Somewhere in Dreamland" -- a Technicolor fantasia that follows two street urchins who scavenge firewood and go to bed hungry. Mr. Stathes first watched it on VHS tape as a toddler. "I think it helped me to better understand and connect with the inner children in my own grandparents, all of whom were born right around the time of the 1929 stock market crash and grew up during the Great Depression."
Now 34, Mr. Stathes makes a living as a professor of animation history at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. But his true vocation is curating vintage cartoon programs. In addition to his gig at Metrograph, he also regularly shows at Roxy Cinema and the Society of Illustrators and has over the last decade landed a recurring role on Turner Classic Movies.
It was by sheer chance that executives at the network, also known as TCM, saw an article about a 21-year-old movie historian on Fox News Latino.
They understood quickly that this young collector had amassed a deeper cartoon archive than TCM had ever gained access to. "We can't do everything," the network's longtime lead programmer, Charles Tabesh, said in a phone interview. "But sometimes something comes along and you just think: This is an important part of film history -- one we've never explored."
The network contracted Mr. Stathes to produce a program in 2012, for which he provided an hour's worth of silent animation he had recently restored. Then, a couple of years later, he found himself being interviewed on air by the channel's marquee host, Robert Osborne, as the network's expert on vintage cartoons. Mr. Stathes knew then that he had arrived.
It is a far cry from his early days, when he used to screen oddball cartoons at strange little pop-up places that don't typically show movies. His very first show, when he was not even old enough to drink, was in a dive bar stuffed with vintage clutter in Bushwick, Brooklyn, called Goodbye Blue Monday. From that success, he bounced around various community centers (including the Queens Public Library, where he had a yearslong stint) and storefront galleries, like Shoestring Press in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
This avocation can be traced back to an obscure Farmer Alfalfa cartoon his father showed him once. From there, he expanded to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and Felix the Cat, and he started hunting for reels in local antique shops and flea markets. He soon progressed to eBay, ultimately piling up a six-figure investment in the archive.
His devotion to silent cartoons -- the very birth of the form -- is unrivaled. In fact, he has helped the Library of Congress identify some of its own collection. George Willeman, who oversees the nitrate film vaults for the library, recalled being amazed when Mr. Stathes, then in his 20s, took a seat in the archive and identified reel after reel of unidentified cartoons made decades before he was even born.
"As far as I know," Mr. Willeman said, "Tommy is the king of silent animation."
As for how much his archive is worth today, Mr. Stathes is reluctant to venture a guess. "Films don't have standardized valuations like coins or other regularly traded collectibles," he said. "It's a very niche, specialized field concerning objects that are more utilitarian than anything else."
"Might any of the kids here be alarmed by a creepy snowman?" Mr. Stathes asked a 100-strong crowd, nearly all of them adults shifting around on velvet seats during a Halloween-themed screening at Metrograph a couple months ago. It's clear he loves playing M.C. -- as he worked the audience, his enthusiasm was infectious. Mr. Stathes launched into a discussion of the disputed merits of Molly Moo-Cow, a key character for New York City-based Van Beuren Studios during the 1930s. "She always saves the day -- and she's a cow!" he marveled. "I mean ..." His voice trailed off and he sighed wistfully.
Ian Adams, who began attending Mr. Stathes's cartoon screenings back when they were projected onto sheets tacked to the walls of ad hoc venues, is now part of Metrograph's programming department. The repertory theater first sought Mr. Stathes out to do a Halloween program in 2021. His Christmastime "Happy Endings" special ran last week. "Tommy has a following," Mr. Adams said.
This August, Mr. Stathes introduced the theatrical release of "Cartoon Carnival" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where he stayed for a Q. and A. session with the audience. Produced by a British filmmaker, the movie focuses on the pioneers of cartoons and follows Mr. Stathes's quest to preserve them. According to the director, Andrew T. Smith, Mr. Stathes "kind of inspired the documentary." He stumbled onto Mr. Stathes's work online and was struck by his devotion.
"He just kind of crossed me as someone very young to take on this quite big responsibility of gathering this archive of neglected films," Mr. Smith said.
"Cartoon Carnival" has been shown on TCM, but Mr. Stathes is hoping it will get picked up by a streaming service like Netflix, which would definitely help offset the costs associated with maintaining the archive. The rent for his storage unit is now up to nearly $ 1,000 per month.
"That's the kind of big break I truly need," Mr. Stathes said. "Yes, I do it out of a love for the medium -- because I enjoy sharing the film. But I do also have to get either a flat fee or a share of ticket sales, to get by."
"Hopefully a time will come when I don't have to push so hard and hustle so much every single day to keep all this collecting and archiving and storing and event production afloat," he continued. "I still want to do those things as the years go on, but really need an additional set of buoys under me."

A QVC Host Can Help You Sell Yourself: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Author: Piepenburg, Erik

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On a Saturday night earlier this month, the QVC host Shawn Killinger kicked off another episode of "Shawn Saves Christmas," the seasonal series she hosts live at QVC's gargantuan 24/7 broadcast center in West Chester, Pa., about an hour's drive from Philadelphia. But by the end of the first segment, it seemed like Shawn was going to sink Christmas instead.
As I watched from behind the cameras, she accidentally tipped over a rolling tote bag, shattering a wine bottle loudly enough to be heard on air. "We are going to need a mop," she said with a cringe and levity, owning the oopsie, as did the camera, which lingered on the aftermath for several seconds. As the screen cut to a photo of the product, Killinger hustled to another part of the set to talk about mascara as the crew, panicked-looking but resolute, made the mess disappear in minutes.
Having talked to Killinger quite a bit by that point, I suspected she was mortified by the disaster. When she is presenting on QVC, she had told me earlier, she feels like she is "pedalling a unicycle uphill through a rancid windstorm while juggling flaming swords while chewing gum and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance."
But if she was, she didn't show it. And the secret to that friendly composure is what brought me to QVC HQ.
Most TV shows are trying to sell you something, whether it's the Lexus in a conventional ad, a product-placed luxury watch or just a Netflix subscription. But on QVC -- it originally stood for "Quality Value Convenience," in case you've ever wondered -- the selling is the entire point, and many of the products verge on the nutty.
Nobody needs a mega tub of skin cream that smells of "gilded pear." I know this, but I've got two of those suckers because Killinger convinced me to hand over $ 68.57. I wanted to see how she did it.
I only started watching Killinger closely this year, but already my New Year's resolution is to be like her. I set my calendar to Shawn because I don't feel like she's hustling me, as I do when I watch other QVC hosts. And she doesn't go for the hard pitch the way my salesman father hawked metal plating services in Northeast Ohio. Her style is mac-and-cheese comforting.
I want to emulate how she makes salesmanship and public communication look effortless, assured and girlfriend-y, whether she's talking up mukluks or just talking to her audience. I want others to see me as I see her: persuasive, confident, free of impostor anxiety, fun.
I'd invited myself to QVC so I could learn from Killinger, who stands 5'6" and on this night looked on-brand kicky in a dandelion-colored cold-shoulder sweater from her signature collection, plus bluejeans and white fashion boots.
"The big secret is that I don't sell," she told me, first thing. "I'm not a salesperson. I'm a storyteller."
She turned out to be not a Harold Hill but a self-deprecating Gen X-er from the Midwest, same as me. Now in her 17th year at QVC, she said she is finally at peace with being able "to go on camera and be savage vulnerable and talk about chin hair."
Autocorrect and English teachers will tell you that "savage vulnerable" is ungrammatical, but that's another reason to admire Killinger. A self-described "verbal acrobat," she freestyles marketing-speak that on paper looks out of left field but comes across on air as offhandedly inventive. In her dictionary, "gabillion" is an adjective, "novelty" can come in a top or bottom and "pajama fatigue" is no joke. She's a pitcher-poetess.
"I am much more comfortable letting it all hang out," she said, "which frankly is hysterical because for the first 40-plus years of my life I was terrified to do that."
Killinger is from Grosse Pointe, Mich., a Detroit suburb, but spent a chunk of her childhood in Mexico City, where her father, who worked for Ford Motors, moved the family when she was 11. She was bullied there for looking different and bullied again back in America when she pulled up to Grosse Pointe South High School -- preppy Izod city -- looking "like a combo platter of Debbie Gibson, big bangs, shellacking hair spray, blow dryer to keep them up, white frost lip gloss."
In 1995, she graduated from Penn State with a marketing degree and later worked in television, including on air in local news in Albany, N.Y., and Orlando, Fla. In 2006, Martha Stewart fired her from "The Apprentice."
A self-proclaimed homebody, she likes to spend her free time with her husband, Joe Carretta, and adopted daughter, Jagger, who is 6. She also cares for her mother, "who's 84 and lives with me and is not great and requires a lot of care, and trying to be a mom to a 6-year-old, who, by the way, I'm 51, so I started a little late there."
Search for Killinger's name online and the first results are articles about a cheeky on-air debate she had in 2017 with her frequent co-host, the fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, about whether the moon is a star or planet. (It is neither.)
I called Mizrahi, and he agreed that anyone who wants to learn how to be more breezily authoritative, or come across like it, should watch what Killinger does with a pullover.
"The confidence that I exude is more like bravado, like a fake confidence," he said. "Whereas when she puts on a jacket or a little sweater, she looks amazing in it because she's so committed to how great it looks on her that she really looks great."
Daniel Pink, the author of "To Sell Is Human," a book about the science of sales and persuasion, didn't know who Killinger was before I called him up. But he said that the very best sellers build community with their audience by legitimately believing in their products.
"My hunch is that she's an effective seller less because she's a good storyteller but because she actually, sincerely believes in what she's selling, and she thinks it will make people's lives better," he said. "That's a difficult thing to confect."
Killinger said she has some say but no veto power regarding which products she sel---- sorry, tells stories about. (QVC wouldn't say how much money Killinger brings in.) And if she has to pitch something she doesn't like? I didn't ask for relationship advice, but I got it.
"If I'm looking at a blazer, I may not like the color of that blazer or the cut of that blazer, but man I love the buttons on that blazer," she said. "I think the art form and the skill of it is to know that there's always something that can fascinate you, intrigue you, make you fall a little bit in love, even if it's not the whole thing."
The collected Shawn I see onscreen -- the one I had just seen barely break stride after accidentally smashing a wine bottle on live TV -- isn't the Shawn she sees on playback. She assumes that when people watch her, they see "just sheer chaos, madness," she said, and then imagined viewers' reactions: "'Does she have a point? Is she just riffing? Or is she anchored in a purpose?"'
"By the way," she added, "I am." And what is that purpose? It's not to peddle.
"When you're watching, I want you to love that story about my husband manscaping because I want you to be my friend," she said. "I want you to know that on [expletive] days I'll be here. You don't need to buy anything. Just tune me in."
As I left the QVC compound, I wondered if I was asking myself the wrong question. Maybe my resolution shouldn't be to sell myself harder but to be myself better. Killinger told me this without telling me this when she recalled this advice she had given herself:

Full text: In 2023, male characters pouted elaborately after something they saw as their birthright was put in check.
I've seen the greatest men of my generation regress into petulant babies -- at least in the movies. Over and over in this year's films, male characters throw elaborate temper tantrums, whining, huffing and raging like toddlers in their terrible twos.
At Sundance in January, I joined the audience in cackling at "Fair Play," in which a bratty finance guy devolves into a childish display of irascibility. Come summer, I saw the trend expand with the boffo success of "Barbie," in which Ryan Gosling's Ken makes an entire career out of pouting on the beach. And the fall saw a preschool's worth of new baby men in "Poor Things," "Dream Scenario" and "Anatomy of a Fall," and one great baby man of history in "Napoleon."
The meltdowns themselves varied -- one barked like a dog, another blasted music, a few made faces, most yelled, many cried -- but the trigger was the same: a perceived loss of power to a woman.
In "Poor Things," that male torment is played for farce. Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) has only recently discovered orgasms when she meets Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), a local rake who piques her interest. Their bond is simple: he is besotted; she relishes his sexual prowess. But trouble arrives when the pair voyages abroad and Bella, eager to indulge in new cuisines, sights and lovers, tires of Duncan's micromanaging. She tries to send the stage five clinger packing, but he keeps popping up, alternating between profanity-laden outbursts and beseeching appeals to reciprocate his devotion.
"I am not understanding this complicated feeling," Bella remarks dispassionately at one point, as Duncan snivels over her sleeping with another man. The line lands as a joke; Duncan's weepy reaction is entirely uncomplicated. But Bella's confusion also hits on something real. Duncan doesn't own Bella, as much as he would like to, and he sees himself as the victim of that reality.
The comedy in "Fair Play," directed by Chloe Domont, is cast in a darker tone, and centers not on concerns about sex, but career. Here, our petulant man is Luke (Alden Ehrenreich), a hedge fund analyst who, early in the movie, loses out on a promotion to his fiancée, Emily (Phoebe Dynevor). This means that Luke reports to Emily, while she wins coveted face time with the boss.
To Luke, a silver-spoon-fed nepotism hire, nothing could be more intolerable. "I think I'm handling everything pretty well, given the circumstances," he snarls at Emily before shrieking about how she "stole" his job.
Luke makes his thinking clear: He wanted the promotion, so it belonged to him. This delusion of entitlement is echoed, to an extent, in Justine Triet's "Anatomy of a Fall," a tremendous work of drama that follows a novelist, Sandra (Sandra Hüller), after the sudden death of her husband, Samuel (Samuel Theis). Samuel was also a fiction writer, albeit a more stagnant one, and openly resented Sandra's success.
In one crucial flashback, Samuel instigates a domestic scuffle with his wife. As the quarrel escalates, Samuel calls her selfish, chastises her for not learning his native language and accuses her of stealing his book premise. Finally, he prods, "I've given you too much -- too much time, too many concessions. I want this time back and you owe it to me."
The gender dynamics of "Anatomy" are thornier than those in "Fair Play," but the two films play well side by side. Triet and Domont share an interest in how power seesaws in contemporary straight relationships. By positioning their couples within the same professions and then pushing them to the brink, the filmmakers are conducting a kind of test. In this more equitable era, how do men and women balance being a good partner with self-realizing? At what point does envy trump affection? Is there any going back after it does?
These are familiar questions with murky answers. The past decade has seen a cavalcade of bloated, juvenile men throw hissy fits after something they saw as their birthright -- authority, prestige, admiration -- was put in check. These spectacles can be sinister, pathetic and comical all at once, a semi-contradiction that movies, designed to pull in both directions, are ideally suited to dissect.
No film this year synthesized these ideas more plainly than one about a plastic doll. Near the end of "Barbie," once the Kens unlink arms and Gosling's Ken stomps into the Dreamhouse, Barbie (Margot Robbie) hurries to comfort him. He sobs. She says she likes him as a friend. And then the pair agree to dismantle Barbieland's system of male supremacy and instate a more just society.
Wiping away tears, Ken confesses, "To be honest, when I found out the patriarchy wasn't about horses, I lost interest anyway." It's funny to think it could be so easy. It's excruciating to know it's really not so hard.

Actor's Death Highlights South Korea's Drug Policy: [Foreign Desk]

Author: Yoon, John

Full text: The actor, Lee Sun-kyun, had been questioned on suspicion of drug use in a country that has long drawn a hard line against anything other than total abstinence.
Lee Sun-kyun, the "Parasite" actor who was found dead on Wednesday, was far from the only celebrity entangled in South Korea's latest antidrug crackdown.
Yoo Ah-in, the actor known for his roles in the 2018 film "Burning" and the 2021 Netflix series "Hellbound," is facing trial after testing positive for propofol, marijuana, ketamine and cocaine, officials say. Several South Korean retailers have cut ties with the actor since the drug accusations became public. He is no longer listed as a cast member for the second season of "Hellbound."
G-Dragon, the rapper and former member of the K-pop boy group BigBang, had been under investigation for possible drug use until the police dropped the case earlier this month after he tested negative on several drug tests. Nevertheless, BMW Korea removed images of him from its online advertisements.
The recent accusations against high-profile entertainers here have highlighted the continuation of a strict antidrug policy and attitudes in South Korea that have drawn a hard line against anything other than total abstinence from drug use.
Some officials hail that toughness as critical to keeping drug use under control. But the policies have also come under criticism from treatment experts who say that the authorities focus too much on punishment rather than rehabilitation.
"When you look at data and you look at the harsh penalties that have been in place for decades now, they haven't worked," said Gloria Lai, a regional director for the International Drug Policy Consortium, an organization that promotes evidence-based drug policies around the world. "And the cost on people's lives is huge."
Since Mr. Lee's death, the police in Incheon, a city west of Seoul, who had questioned him on suspicion of using marijuana and ketamine, have been criticized for their treatment of Mr. Lee during the investigation, saying it was disproportionate to the severity of the allegations against him.
Seongcheol Park, Mr. Lee's lawyer, denied the drug charges and accused the police of violating rules about the public release of information. He said Mr. Lee had tested negative in multiple drug tests.
Mr. Park added that the police had intensively investigated the allegations that Mr. Lee had used drugs but did not take seriously enough his assertion that he had been the target of blackmail.
"The process was insulting and humiliating to him, even though there was no evidence that he had taken drugs," Mr. Park said in a telephone interview. "While it's true that drug investigations are necessary, it's a problem when they go too far and don't follow procedures and protocols."
Kim Hui-jung, the Incheon police chief, defended the investigation at a news conference on Thursday. He said that his agency had performed properly and legally, "based on specific informant statements and evidence."
South Korea's tough stance on drugs is in line with that of some other countries in Asia. A drug conviction can carry the death penalty in China and Singapore. Japan and Taiwan, too, have maintained minimal tolerance for drug use. Governments in Japan and Singapore have publicly spoken out against a strategy called harm reduction that has become more prominent in Western nations, Ms. Lai said.
"A harm reduction approach is controversial," she said, "because you're basically saying that, even if someone continues to use drugs, you think that they still deserve to be treated with care and with access to health services."
South Korea stands apart from countries like the United States, Canada and some in Europe, which approach drug use as a public health matter rather than simply a criminal one.
Still, South Korea's drug policies, combined with its geographic isolation, have helped keep drug use low, experts say.
But reports of trafficking and use have surged in the past few years, though experts say it is difficult to obtain accurate data on drugs in South Korea because of stigma and the fear of imprisonment. Drug-related arrests, including for its consumption and sale, rose to more than 17,000 this year from about 10,400 in 2019, according to official data. Among them, teens were the age group with the largest growth, jumping sixfold to 1,000 arrests from 160. It is unclear whether that increase in arrests represents an actual spike in drug use, or whether intensified enforcement is playing an outsize role.
President Yoon Suk Yeol and officials in his politically conservative government declared a "war on drugs" after taking office in 2022, warning that drugs were becoming more accessible nationwide. Celebrities have also led "just say no" campaigns on social media. Some talk shows have dedicated entire episodes to antidrug programming.
The country's latest crackdown, and the rhetoric of Mr. Yoon and officials in his administration, have echoed the "war on drugs" of the 1970s and '80s in the United States, said Hyeouk Chris Hahm, a professor at the Boston University School of Social Work.
"Cracking down with these harsh punishments and unreasonably long years of imprisonment is not going to be effective" in reducing drug use and overdose deaths, Professor Hahm said. "And we know that from the history of the U.S."
South Koreans can even be prosecuted upon returning home for using drugs outside the country. Once convicted of using illicit drugs, a person can be required to complete a mandatory education program run by the Justice Ministry, or be imprisoned, said Yoon Hyunjun, a drug policy expert at Sogang University in Seoul.
A prison sentence can range from six months to four years, depending on the type of drug. For trafficking, the sentence can be up to 14 years.
Drug treatment experts say that the country's approach is too narrowly focused on punishment. The mandatory education program that offenders take is not individualized enough to each person's needs and does not provide a sustainable plan to overcome addiction, Ms. Yoon said. While the government has called for more rehab clinics for drug users, they remain far fewer than those for alcoholics.
"In our country, drug rehabilitation is less often viewed as an effort to overcome addiction than as a penalty," Ms. Yoon said. "People's mind-sets are focused strictly on punishment."
But public policy experts warned that approaching drug use only in a punitive way falls short at curbing drug use, addictions and overdose deaths.
"It needs to be in tandem with education, changing the culture and good infrastructure for addiction treatment," said Jimi Huh, a professor of public health at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. "Having a punitive policy only -- that's not going to cut it."

Art Is Her Sanctuary, Action Is Her Specialty: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Sofia Boutella knows what it's like to lose a home.
Born and raised in Algeria, Boutella was 10 when she and her family fled to Paris after Algeria descended into civil war.
Now 41, she drew on that formative experience for Zack Snyder's sci-fi epic "Rebel Moon -- Part One: A Child of Fire" as Kora, a mysterious woman who has been uprooted from her former life and must create a new one in a village on a distant moon. Like Kora, Boutella understands what such a journey takes from you and what it gives in return.
"There is something that happens when you remove yourself from your country of origin that is very powerful," Boutella said. "I don't feel a sense of belonging to a territory. But at the same time, I feel such a strong sense of being part of this earth and a connection to it as a whole."
Before turning to acting, Boutella danced -- attending ballet class in Algiers when she was a girl and, finding a semblance of stability when she continued with ballet as well as jazz, contemporary and hip-hop in France. She also tried rhythmic gymnastics and spent a year on her new country's national team.
When she was 19, she became a dancer for a Nike Women's campaign, crisscrossing the globe, and soon landed a gig as a stage dancer for Madonna, a life-changing experience that opened the door for work with Rihanna and Usher.
"I was a tomboy when she met me," Boutella said of Madonna. "She gave me my first pair of heels."
During breaks from touring, Boutella pursued her dream of becoming a theater actor, studying under the influential Elizabeth Kemp in Paris and later at the Stella Adler academy in Los Angeles.
But her breakout moment as an actor involved intense action: playing Gazelle, Samuel L. Jackson's lethal henchman with blades for feet, in the 2014 original "Kingsman: The Secret Service." That performance led to other action roles, including the titular character of "The Mummy" (2017) and Charlize Theron's fellow spy in "Atomic Blonde" (2017).
Then along came "Rebel Moon," which begins streaming Thursday on Netflix. When Boutella received a callback to play Kora, she was both thrilled and anxious. "I was terrified at first because I just wanted to do well and I was intimidated in an inspiring way to be directed by Zack Snyder," she said.
During a recent video interview from a hotel in Los Angeles, Boutella discussed life in Algeria, the connection between dancing and acting and what drew her to Kora. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
What was it like to grow up during a civil war?
I think for a child it's not something you realize really, especially if you haven't known life any differently. We had a curfew, and we would hear bombs exploding here and there. It was something that I was just, in a weird way, used to. I think it was a different experience for my mother. My dad already lived in France and was traveling a lot. My parents separated when I was 4. But during those 10 years, I would go visit him in France here and there. Once I started going to France I started to see that life is different elsewhere. But when you're so young, your perception is a bit warped.
That must have been a huge transition to move to France at 10 years old.
The aspect I could not have anticipated was the culture shock and how quickly I had to adapt. I remember going to school for the first time and not being able to speak because the amount of information that was thrown at me constantly was so overwhelming.
The one place I found refuge, where I found commonality with when I was in Algeria, was art and when I started dancing again in France, because I felt that there were no differences. We all spoke the same language and we all had the same culture in a way that felt comfortable and felt like home.
But outside of that, it was a different experience. Going to school in Algeria, we all wore blouses, so every social class was the same. But in France we were all judged by the way we looked and how cool we were, and I definitely was not cool.
What did you particularly enjoy about dancing?
It's basically a whole other form of communication and it's a different language. What I loved was the ability to just let so much of what I felt out. It was a refuge for me. I felt safe. And I just felt alive when I danced. I still do.
Do you still dance now?
I will always dance. Let's put it that way. I dance for people around me. For my friends for free. Not for a job. I would love to do a dance musical. I don't know if I will go on tour again as a dancer. I think those years are behind a bit right now.
You've take on roles in a lot of action movies. Is there something about action movies that you love?
It's just how it happened. When I stopped dancing, I didn't think, "OK, I'm going to be an action person." My love for cinema is really pure and for theater. I didn't think at all that I would do action. When I booked "Kingsman," I hadn't done any martial arts or fight training in my life. But my dance training gave me the ability to learn another physical form, like martial arts. So I use the same principles of discipline and using your body, learning choreography by observation.
What drew you to "Rebel Moon"?
It's my first leading role. For the longest time I told my team I didn't want to play a lead. It was from a place of feeling deeply that I got so lucky to be able to be on set with incredible actors. Starting with "Kingsman," Sam Jackson mentored me through that experience in a tremendous way. And he still is very present in my life. After that I got the chance to work with Zach Quinto and Chris Pine [in "Star Trek Beyond"], who elevated me so much, and then Tom Cruise, who taught me tremendously [on "The Mummy"], then Charlize in "Atomic Blonde." The only way to keep learning is to have a mentor, and I don't know if it's because of my dance background, but I enjoy the state of being an apprentice.
Around the time I booked "Rebel Moon," I remember telling my team, I think I'm ready. You could always see that Zack had such strong women that had their own voices in his films. And I love that for this project he was able to make his protagonist a woman, and not only a woman who is a badass, but he gave Kora a true dilemma to overcome, true emotions that are very, very deep and complicated.

Sofia Boutella knows what it’s like to lose a home.

And I love that, for this project, he was able to make his protagonist a woman, and not only a woman who is a badass, but he gave Kora a true dilemma to overcome, true emotions that are very, very deep and complicated.

Full text: The star-studded spectacles have returned in full force since the actors' union strike ended. So has the fashion.
When the actors' union went on strike, many could not promote their projects. The future of red carpets quickly became a topic of concern. But within days of the strike ending in early November, celebrities had again begun stepping out in their finest borrowed garments and those fears disappeared faster than the flash of a flashbulb.
After the strike-induced hiatus, and with awards season now underway, outfits have gotten bolder. We've seen real-life Wonkas, daring silhouettes and, despite the time of year, lots of shirtless men.
The looks on this list are highlights from red carpets in November and December. Consider them a taste of what to expect as some of the biggest events of the coming year kick off in January.
Jacob Elordi: Most Oxbridge!
The actor left his purses at home for the Los Angeles premiere of "Saltburn," allowing his sharply tailored three-piece suit to get all the attention.
Elizabeth Debicki: Most Diana!
Though the actress did not accessorize her black off-the-shoulder dress with pearls, her look at the Los Angeles premiere of "The Crown" Season Six: Part 1 seemed like a subtle homage to the so-called revenge dress worn by Princess Diana, whom she plays in the series.
Meg Bellamy: Most Effortless!
A red poppy pin diverted attention from the plunging neckline of the slinky, black dress that the actress -- who plays Kate Middleton in "The Crown" -- wore to the Los Angeles premiere. (The pin was in honor of Britain's Remembrance Day.)
Lizzo: Most Ruffled!
The singer and flutist was a vision in white ruffles at the world premiere of "Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé." A flowing robe worn over her stomach-baring two-piece made the look more elegant.
Laverne Cox: Most Frozen!
At the "Renaissance" premiere, a red-carpet host of "Live From E!" traded her microphone for a tiny purse that complemented her ice-blue corset and sleek silver skirt.
Janelle Monáe: Most Pop Art!
The singer seemed to channel one of the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama's speckled pumpkins in a hooded polka-dot dress with a balloon skirt at the "Renaissance" premiere.
Charles Melton: Most Debonair!
In a double-breasted suit and no shirt at the Gotham Awards, the "May December" actor -- who received the award for Outstanding Supporting Performance -- looked like a hypebeast James Bond.
Da'Vine Joy Randolph: Most Regal!
The actress, a star of "Only Murders in the Building," dazzled at the Gotham Awards in a deep-blue velvety gown that fit like a glove.
Timothée Chalamet: Most Wonka!
The star of "Wonka" dressed the part at the film's world premiere, pairing a purplish suit with chocolate-brown boots.
Lily Gladstone: Most Radiant!
The bright marigold color helped show off the unusual structure of the dress that the "Killers of the Flower Moon" actress wore at the Academy Museum Gala.
Barry Keoghan: Most Commando!
After baring it all in "Saltburn," the actor went shirtless beneath an olive-green vest and matching pants that brought out the color of his eyes at the Academy Museum Gala.
Greta Lee: Most Statuesque!
The "Past Lives" actress lit up the Academy Museum Gala carpet with a crimson column-like gown and a glowing complexion.
Emma Stone: Most Sleeves!
At a "Poor Things" screening in London, the actress evoked her wardrobe in that film with a shawl that made it look like her slip dress had mega sleeves.
Stella Bugbee, Madison Malone Kircher and Anthony Rotunno contributed reporting.

The History Behind the Close of 'The Crown': [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: To close the show's six-season run, the episodes open in 1997 and depict a heartthrob prince, an offensive party costume, several deaths and a marriage.
After seven years of seamlessly blending royal fact and fiction, the second part of "The Crown" Season 6 brings the lavish Netflix show to a close.
The final six episodes, which arrived on Thursday, open in 1997, and follow several story lines concerning members of the royal family and aspects of Tony Blair's tenure as Britain's prime minister. (Bertie Carvel plays Blair.)
A grieving Prince William (Ed McVey) unexpectedly becomes a worldwide heartthrob and falls in love while studying at the University of St. Andrews. The queen (Imelda Staunton) grapples with her own mortality following the loss of her sister, Princess Margaret (Lesley Manville), and the Queen Mother (Marcia Warren), in a short space of time. In the finale, set in 2005, Prince Charles (Dominic West) finally marries his longtime partner, Camilla Parker Bowles (Olivia Williams).
Here is a look at what The Times and other news outlets reported at the time. You can find more in the TimesMachine archive browser. (Warning: This feature contains spoilers for Season 6 of "The Crown.")
Episode 5, 'Willsmania'
In this episode, Prince William returns to school soon after Princess Diana's funeral. He attended Eton College, the prestigious British boarding school known for educating prime ministers, Nobel laureates and, of course, aristocracy.
In April 2017, the British tabloid The Sun reported that William returned to school just four days after the ceremony and received handwritten condolence letters from more than half of his fellow students.
On the show, he is also handed a sack of letters from his fans across the globe, especially adoring young women. It is the beginning of the so-called "Willsmania" of the late '90s, when William became the focus of intense international attention. This new heartthrob status is also made clear when he visits Vancouver with his father and younger brother Harry (Luther Ford), and young women line up to catch a glimpse.
On June 22, 1998, The Times reported that the trip to Vancouver in March of that year "alerted the palace to what a pinup the 6-foot-1-inch prince with the shock of blond hair, blue eyes and downward looking shy smile so reminiscent of his mother has become to teenage girls."
The following year, Christina Ferrari, the managing editor of Teen People, a youth-focused version of People magazine, told The Times that Will was "an international superstar almost on the level of Leonardo DiCaprio."
Episode 6, 'Ruritania'
In Episode 6, Queen Elizabeth seems threatened by the public's positive reception of Blair, the new prime minister. "People really do seem to love him, and see him as a true son of England," she says, "and a unifying national symbol, in a way they used to see me."
In February 1999, Warren Hoge wrote in The Times that Blair was a "youthful, articulate and visionary leader" and "the most popular prime minister in British history."
On the show, we see Blair telling the queen about his attempts to persuade President Bill Clinton to send troops to Kosovo to drive Serb forces out. The queen is concerned to learn that the prime minister has a new nickname: "King Tony." According to a Times report from 1999, he was given that sarcastic nickname by attendees of that year's NATO Summit, because of all the media attention he was getting.
According to that Times report, Blair made a "grand entrance" in Washington before embarking on a "media blitz" to garner American public support for fighting the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. (White House officials said Clinton "did not feel upstaged.")
Episode 7, 'Alma Mater'
Viewers meet an 18-year-old Prince William, who informs journalists that he has met the requirements to attend his chosen college, St. Andrews, where he will go after taking a year off from his studies.
In "The Crown," the prince receives his exam results while with his family, but in reality, he had already left Britain for his year abroad. In video footage by ITN of Prince William at a news conference on Sept. 29, 2000, he told journalists that when he received his results, he was "in the middle of nowhere" in a jungle in Belize.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
At St. Andrews, the episode follows Kate Middleton (Meg Bellamy) and William as they adjust to university life. Despite William initially dating a woman named Lola Airdale-Cavendish-Kincaid and Middleton a man named Rupert, there is clear romantic chemistry between the pair.
According to The Times of London, Prince William dated two women before Kate: Olivia Hunt, who they newspaper called "a brainy sort," and Carly Massy-Birch, whom "William had a two-week snog with," according to an anonymous source. Somebody else (also anonymous) told the paper that Kate had apparently dated Rupert Finch, "a handsome Norfolk boy," whom she met when she arrived at college.
Episode 8, 'Ritz'
Flashbacks to the young princesses Margaret (Beau Gadsdon) and Elizabeth (Viola Prettejohn) celebrating the end of World World II on May 8, 1945, or V-E Day, show the pair sneaking out of Buckingham Palace to party among the public on the streets and at the Ritz hotel. An initially shy Elizabeth finds a large group of Americans swing dancing, and she joins in after some initial hesitation.
"You dark horse. Who'd have known you could jive," Margaret says to her older sister on their way back to the palace. "There must have been 50 men chasing you."
In reality, while Margaret and Elizabeth did take to the streets of London to celebrate the war's end, it seems they had their parents' permission. In 1985, the queen gave a televised speech to the British public, in which she "for the first time told her subjects how she and Princess Margaret had slipped into the crowds outside Buckingham Palace to join the V-E Day celebrations and had walked for miles through the city," according to The Times.
"I remember we were terrified of being recognized," Queen Elizabeth is reported to have said.
In May 2020, during another televised address, the queen spoke of the "jubilant scenes" the royal family saw from the balcony of Buckingham Palace earlier on V-E Day. "The sense of joy in the crowds who gathered outside and across the country was profound," she said.
This episode also follows Princess Margaret's declining health, and a series of strokes she suffered between 1998 and 2001. The first was at a party on the Caribbean island of Mustique; in a second, in a bathtub, she suffered severe burns; and one more, in her bedroom, left her hospitalized. Margaret died soon after, in February 2002.
"The Crown" shows the princess smoking and drinking against her doctor's orders, but Margaret's friends have refuted that she lived such a lifestyle. "I have seen far too much suggesting that Margaret was an unashamed hedonist who spent her life partying," a friend told The Guardian after she died. "It truly misunderstands her."
Margaret's obituary in The Times describes her as an "attractive and fun-loving" woman who "earned a reputation in her youth as a free spirit."
Episode 9, 'Hope Street'
In a television interview at the start of the ninth episode, the Egyptian businessman Mohamed al-Fayed (Salim Daw) calls the royal family "gangsters" who intentionally killed Princess Diana and his son, Dodi. Al-Fayed claims that when the "dracular British royal family" discovered that Diana was pregnant "with a Muslim child" -- Dodi's -- "they killed her."
In reality, much like the show depicts, al-Fayed gave several interviews over many years in which he accused the royal family of playing a significant role in Princess Diana's death.
In 1998, The Times reported that al-Fayed told the British media that "there was a conspiracy, and I will not rest until I have established exactly what happened"; speaking on "60 Minutes Australia" in 1999, al-Fayed also claimed that MI6, aided by the C.I.A., had been spying on Dodi and Diana; and in a 2007 interview with Al Jazeera English, he called the crash "absolute clear horrendous murder."
The show also shows Operation Paget, a police inquiry that was opened to re-examine the incidents leading up to the car crash that killed the couple. In December 2006, The Times reported that the inquiry took three years, and cost British taxpayers 3.69 million pounds, about $ 7 million at the time. It concluded that Princess Diana "was killed the way the authorities always said she had been killed: in a car accident, along with her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul," Sarah Lyall wrote.
While the investigation into Diana's death is ongoing on "The Crown," Prince William continues his studies at St. Andrews, where the recently single Kate Middleton models in a charity fashion show. The show recreates the sheer dress the real-life Kate wore in 2002 for the college show, a piece designed by Charlotte Todd, who was a college student at the time. In 2011, and following the announcement of William and Kate's engagement, Todd sold the dress for £78,000, according to The Daily Telegraph (around $ 125, 000 at the time).
On the show, soon after William attends the fashion show, the pair start formally dating and move in together, along with two friends. According to The Sun, the couple moved into 13A Hope Street with Olivia Bleasdale and a fellow Etonian, Fergus Boyd.
Back at the palace, the queen is dealing with her mother's death and the Golden Jubilee, an international celebration to mark 50 years of her reign. Elizabeth spends most of the episode worried about a lack of public interest, and whether a crowd will gather for her balcony appearance at Buckingham Palace. She is pleasantly surprised by the masses of people who attend.
On June 5, 2002, The Times reported that over one million people cheered outside the gates of the palace for the jubilee. On the same day, The Guardian reported that the event was more successful than both critics and organizers had anticipated.
Episode 10, 'Sleep, Dearie Sleep'
To wrap the show up, the final episode of "The Crown" finds a way to address the queen's death -- she died in 2022 -- while still being set in 2005. We see her planning her own funeral, including choosing the bagpipe lament "Sleep, Dearie Sleep" to play at the funeral.
According to The Times of London, it took 20 years to plan the queen's real funeral, with the task falling to Edward Fitzalan-Howard, the 18th Duke of Norfolk, whose ancestors have been responsible for planning significant royal occasions since 1672. Before the queen's death, "we had annual meetings in the throne room of Buckingham Palace," the duke told the newspaper in 2022. "It started off with 20 people; by April this year, it had reached 280. I have had a lot of help from Buckingham Palace staff."
The queen's personal piper, Paul Burns, did indeed play "Sleep, Dearie Sleep" to close the queen's funeral on Sept. 19, 2022.
Negative press surrounding Prince Harry during his younger years also gets some screen time. The prince is photographed at a "colonials and natives" costume party, wearing a military outfit with a swastika on the arm, which soon makes front-page news. In the aftermath of the scandal, William and Harry argue about the part each had played in the choice of costume, which the show depicts William encouraging when the brothers shop for their costumes.
On Jan. 13, 2005, a photograph of Prince Harry in the outfit, holding a drink and a cigarette, ran on the front page of The Sun. Harry apologized for his unsuitable costume choice in the accompanying article: "I am very sorry if I have caused an offense," he said. "It was a poor choice of costume." In his recent memoir, "Spare," Harry wrote that William and Kate "howled" with laughter when they saw the costume.
"The Crown" also portrays Blair's fall from public grace. He has a new nickname, "Tony Bliar," because many believed he misled the public over the invasion of Iraq in 2003. That year, The Times reported that at least 750,000 antiwar protesters gathered at a demonstration in London, and noted that Blair had lost the British public's approval. "I do not seek unpopularity as a badge of honor," Blair is reported to have said. "But sometimes it is the price of leadership and the cost of conviction."
With the queen's blessing, Charles and Camilla were finally married in a televised civil wedding ceremony. In April 2005, The Times said: "Given all the twists of fate and circumstance that have conspired against it, perhaps the most wondrous thing about the wedding on Saturday between Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles is that it took place at all."

Full text: DealBook lists its favorite podcasts and books for getting smarter about business and the economy.
Whether your holiday season comes with flight delays, a long road trip or a rare day with space on your calendar, it's likely you're about to have some free time.
If you'd like to use it to get a little smarter about deals and the economy -- and perhaps even enjoy yourself in the process -- you're in luck: Here are our favorite books and podcasts from this year (plus one game) that will help you do just that.
An investigative reporter unpacks the crypto industry
"Number Go Up: Inside Crypto's Wild Rise and Staggering Fall" by Zeke Faux
Cryptocurrency has its detractors, including the JPMorgan Chase chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who told a congressional hearing this month that the government should ban digital assets. But few crypto critics have been as committed to trying to understand the technology and to thoroughly exploring the industry -- which has seemed at times to make money from nothing -- as the Bloomberg investigative reporter Zeke Faux. In his book, "Number Go Up," he travels around the world for two years meeting the people fueling the enthusiasm for digital tokens -- and uncovering corruption, greed and exploitation along the way.
The book was released about a month before the criminal trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the crypto exchange FTX, who was convicted of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy last month. Faux begins by admitting that he did not see through Bankman-Fried's billionaire wunderkind facade when they met. But Faux did have his suspicions about the crypto industry and promises from digital asset enthusiasts that blockchain would democratize finance, and he met many of the people peddling these ideas. "From the beginning, I thought that crypto was pretty dumb. And it turned out to be even dumber than I imagined," he writes.
Global trade, the online game
Tradle
Quiz time: Which country's outbound trade was roughly $ 597 billion in 2021? A hint: Its top export categories were cars, refined petroleum, wine and valves.
A. Japan
B. Argentina
C. United States
D. Italy
The answer is D, Italy.
That's according to Tradle, the Wordle-style game about world trade that has become a daily habit for economics buffs, global policy geeks and at least one DealBook editor.
Developed by the Observatory of Economic Complexity, a trade data visualization specialist, Tradle takes gamers across the globe each day. The hints could lead to a developing island economy whose chief exports are recreational boats (the Cayman Islands, for example) or to a Group of 7 giant like Canada (Spoiler: chief exports include crude oil, sawed wood and fertilizers).
Gilberto García-Vazquez, an economist whose firm is behind the game, told Marketplace this summer that Tradle's global popularity was a big surprise. The site was attracting "close to a million visits per month," he said, another sign that everyone likes a good game -- even ones about global trade.
If Hollywood had a sports podcast
"The Town"
Who's up in the media business and who's down? Tinseltown's chief industry has an image built on art and glamour, but Matt Belloni's podcast about its inner workings treats it like sports, with an A.M. talk-radio vibe (no surprise, given its roots in The Ringer podcast network) and an informed casual approach to the subject. Belloni rose up through the Hollywood trades and is the author of Puck's flagship newsletter, What I'm Hearing, but on the podcast he adopts an approach that welcomes in more casual followers of media news. Close watchers of the industry, however, will still appreciate the interviews with newsmakers like Ted Sarandos, a Netflix chief executive, and Mark Shapiro, president of Endeavor, on hot topics like the streaming wars, the actors' and writers' strikes and why superhero movies are stumbling.
A glimpse into a climate apocalypse
"Fire Weather: A True Story From a Hotter World" by John Vaillant
Wildfires were all over the news in 2023. Burning Canadian forests smothered New York in smoke, there were deadly blazes in Maui, and extreme heat caused Greece's worst fires on record. In "Fire Weather," the reporter John Vaillant writes about an earlier wildfire that provided a hint of what was to come.
In 2016, Fort McMurray, Alberta, was engulfed in flames, forcing 90,000 people to evacuate. The city is the center of Canada's oil sands industry, which means it relies on the production of fossil fuels that contribute to global warming. Vaillant calls it a "bifurcated reality," with executives acknowledging the threat posed by carbon dioxide emissions but still making money from the industry despite the damage it evidently causes.
The contradictions won't end soon. Some of the world's biggest energy companies signaled this year that they are doubling down on fossil fuels via a series of deals in the shale oil patch. July was the hottest month ever recorded. And the United Nations' climate conference in United Arab Emirates -- a petrostate -- was the first to publicly state that the world needs to move away from fossil fuels.
We aren't done producing and using fossil fuels, and our world is heating up. Those two trends are inevitably going to bang into each other again, and Vaillant's book is a useful look at how that might unfold.
A warning about the geopolitical challenges threatening market democracy
"The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism" by Martin Wolf
Martin Wolf, the chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, is a believer in the marriage of liberal democracy and market economics. The combination, he argues, has created the most successful societies in history, generating prosperity and freedom.
In "The Crisis of Democratic Capitalism," he argues that's changing because the system is failing to deliver economically and politically, leading to the rise of populists and self-defeating political movements. Brexit, the election of Donald Trump as president and the rise of rentier capitalism are all bad for democratic societies and the institutions upon which they rely, he writes. And that has worrying consequences for free societies and the businesses that operate within them.
The case is personal for Wolf. He is an economist and his parents were refugees from the Nazis, who were able to gain power partly because of the Great Depression. History, he says, is a warning that political mistakes can be hugely destructive when combined with economic disasters.
A podcast that profiles the drama of big deals
"The Closer"
Reporting about deals often centers the numbers. That approach can miss the drama behind them and the effect afterward. "The Closer," a podcast hosted by the journalist Aimee Keane, unfolds rich stories behind the headlines, often revealing unexpected consequences.
In its first episode, it explored the 2013 merger between American Airlines and US Airways, which created the world's largest airline, and the role that labor unions played in the deal. Since then, the podcast has explained how an action from the Department of Justice led to Modelo's rise to become the top beer in the U.S.; why a failed deal in 2018 led to WeWork's bankruptcy this year; and how private equity investors and Walmart killed Toys "R" Us (an episode that features DealBook's Lauren Hirsch, who broke the story that the company was considering bankruptcy).
The show's trick is showing the continuing relevance of old deals, and how the cascading events they unleash can reshape industries.
A podcast for true deal nerds
"Acquired"
The tech investors Ben Gilbert and David Rosenthal take listeners behind the scenes of some of the world's most famous companies: Costco, LVMH, Porsche. Their extensively researched episodes run several hours long (one on Nike was about four hours) and explain the strategies and strange turns of fortune that allowed the founders of these companies to build enduring businesses. Gilbert and Rosenthal devote some episodes to guests, including the Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang and the Berkshire Hathaway executive Charles Munger, who was interviewed about a month before his passing in late November.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Javier Milei warned that things would get worse before they got better. Now Argentines are living it.
Over the past two weeks, the owner of a hip wine bar in Buenos Aires saw the price of beef soar 73 percent, while the zucchini he puts in salads rose 140 percent. An Uber driver paid 60 percent more to fill her tank. And a father said he spent twice as much on diapers for his toddler than he did last month.
In Argentina, a country synonymous with galloping inflation, people are used to paying more for just about everything. But under the country's new president, life is quickly becoming even more painful.
When Javier Milei was elected president on Nov. 19, the country was already suffering under the world's third-highest rate of inflation, with prices up 160 percent from a year before.
But since Mr. Milei took office on Dec. 10 and quickly devalued the Argentine currency, prices have soared at such a dizzying pace that many in this South American country of 46 million are running new calculations on how their businesses or households can survive the far deeper economic crunch the country is already enduring.
"Since Milei won, we've been worried all the time," said Fernando González Galli, 36, a high school philosophy teacher in Buenos Aires.
Mr. Galli has been trying to cut back without making life worse for his two daughters, who are 6 years and 18 months old, including switching to a cheaper brand of diapers and racing to spend his Argentine pesos before their value disintegrates even further. "As soon as I get my paycheck, I go buy everything I can," he said.
Nahuel Carbajo, 37, an owner of Naranjo Bar, a trendy Buenos Aires wine bar, said that like most Argentines, he had become accustomed to regular price increases, but this past week went far beyond what even he was used to.
Since Mr. Milei won, the price for the premium steak that Mr. Carbajo serves soared 73 percent, to 14,580 pesos, or roughly $ 18, per kilogram, about 2.2 pounds; a five-kilogram box of zucchinis rose to 15,600 pesos from 6,500; and avocados cost 51 percent more than the beginning of this month.
"There's no way for salaries or people's incomes to adapt at that speed," Mr. Carbajo said.
Mr. Milei's spokesman, Manuel Adorni, said accelerating inflation was the inevitable consequence of finally fixing Argentina's distorted economy.
"We've been left with a multitude of problems and unresolved issues that we have to start addressing," he said. "Inevitably, we will go through months of high inflation."
Mr. Milei has warned Argentines that his plans to shrink the government and remake the economy would hurt at first. "I prefer to tell you the uncomfortable truth rather than a comfortable lie," he said in his inaugural address, adding this past week that he wanted to end the country's "model of decline."
Argentina's economy has been mired in crisis for years, with chronic inflation, rising poverty and a currency that has plunged in value. The economic turmoil paved the way to the presidency for Mr. Milei, a political outsider who had spent years as an economist and television pundit railing against what he called corrupt politicians who had destroyed the economy, often for personal gain.
During the campaign, he vowed to take a chain saw to public spending and regulations, even wielding an actual chain saw at rallies.
After Mr. Milei's victory, price increases began accelerating in expectation of his new policies.
The previous leftist government had used complicated currency controls, consumer subsidies and other measures to inflate the peso's official value and keep several key prices artificially low, including gas, transportation and electricity.
Mr. Milei vowed to undo all that, and he has wasted little time.
Two days after taking office, Mr. Milei began cutting government spending, including consumer subsidies. He also devalued the peso by 54 percent, putting the government's exchange rate much closer to the market's valuation of the peso.
Economists said such measures were necessary to fix Argentina's long-term financial problems. But they also brought short-term pain in the form of even faster inflation. Some analysts questioned the lack of adequate safety nets for the poorest Argentines.
In November, prices rose 13 percent from October, according to government data. Analysts predict prices will increase another 25 percent to 30 percent this month. And from now until February, some economists are forecasting an 80 percent jump, according to Santiago Manoukian, the chief economist at Ecolatina, an economics consulting firm.
The forecasts are partly caused by soaring gas prices, which increased 60 percent from Dec. 7 to Dec. 13, and have a trickle-down effect on the economy.
The currency devaluation made imported products like coffee, electronic devices and gas immediately more expensive because they are priced in U.S. dollars. A monthly Netflix subscription in Argentina jumped 60 percent to 6,676 pesos, or $ 8.30, the day after the devaluation, for example. It also prompted some domestic producers, including farmers and cattle ranchers, to increase prices to align them with their own rising costs.
With the chronic high inflation, labor unions often negotiate large raises to try to keep up, yet those wage increases are quickly eaten up by sharp price hikes. Informal workers, a list that includes nannies and street vendors, and who make up nearly half of the economy, also do not get such raises.
On Wednesday, Mr. Milei launched his next big steps to remake the government and economy with an emergency decree that significantly reduces the state's role in the economy and eliminates a raft of regulations.
The measure prohibits the state from regulating the rental real estate market and setting limits on fees that banks and health insurers can charge customers; changes labor laws to make it easier to fire workers while also placing limits on strikes; and turns state companies into corporations so they can be privatized.
Many legal analysts immediately questioned the decree's constitutionality, saying that Mr. Milei was trying to subvert Congress.
After the speech, people across Buenos Aires, like Jesusa Orfelia Peralta, 73, a retiree, took to the streets banging on pots to show their displeasure.
She worried that price increases would make proper health care too expensive for her and her husband. Despite severe spinal problems, she said she did not hesitate to head out, using a walker, and vent her anger in public. "Where else would I be?" she said.
Mr. Milei has sought to discourage protests by threatening to cancel welfare plans and fine anyone involved in demonstrations that block roads. Human rights groups have widely criticized such policies as restricting the right to peacefully protest.
For now, most Argentines are trying to figure out how to make ends meet in what often feels like both a complicated course in economics and a frenzied sprint to buy before prices rise again.
"I always say that we are at university, and every day we sit for a difficult exam, every five minutes," said Roberto Nicolás Ormeño, an owner of El Gauchito, a small empanada shop in downtown Buenos Aires.
Mr. Ormeño said he had been scouring the market for his ingredients and changing suppliers almost every week, either because they increase prices too much or provide poorer quality products.
He is trying to avoid passing along too much of his price increases to customers, though he is unsure how long he can sustain that. "I see my frequent customers buying one dozen instead of two" dozen empanadas, he said.
Marisol del Valle Cardozo, who has a 3-year-old daughter, has been cutting back in a bid to make ends meet, turning to cheaper brands and going out less. "We don't turn the air-conditioning on as much," she said. "We decreased our plans on weekends from four times a month to just once."
Ms. Cardozo, who works for a police department outside Buenos Aires, said that she got a raise this year, but that it is already not enough. She also drives an Uber, but said that fare increases had not kept up with the soaring gas prices.
Despite the challenges, Ms. Cardozo said she remained a Milei supporter and was hoping his policies work.
"We were living under a fantasy," she said, referring to gas prices before the recent hike. "If these adjustments are necessary to thrive in the end, they're worth it."

Full text: I am The Times's bureau chief in Miami, covering Florida and Puerto Rico. I try to keep up with detective series and subtitled shows. Here are five things I've been watching, reading and listening.
The Apartment
Miami has so many characters, it's surprising more novels aren't set here. Ana Menéndez's history-rich tale, published this year, takes place in a single apartment on Miami Beach over many years and is haunting right from the prologue, when a Native American woman in the distant past gathers sea turtle eggs on the sand.
Shetland
I came across Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez in Ann Cleeves's novel "Raven Black," the first in her series set in the remote Shetland Islands of Scotland. The BBC's adaptation is moody and transporting. I can't believe Douglas Henshall ended his run as Perez last year after seven seasons.
Rawayana
Rawayana, a Venezuelan alt-rock band, has a reggae-funk sound that reminds me of my childhood in Caracas. The band's latest album, "¿Quién trae las cornetas?" ("Who Brings the Speakers?"), was released in September.
Borgen: Power & Glory
I discovered the original three seasons of the political drama "Borgen" during the coronavirus pandemic -- parliamentary intrigue in Danish! -- and was thrilled when it returned in 2022 to explore what had become of Birgitte Nyborg, the protagonist and onetime prime minister on the show, 10 years later.
Radio Ambulante
For more than a decade, "Radio Ambulante" has roamed Latin America to tell long-form narrative audio stories. (Think "This American Life," but in Spanish.) The latest season began in September, and I wish I had a few longer drives coming up to binge it.

Full text: As Netflix pours more of its resources into original content, Amazon Prime Video is picking up the slack, adding new movies for its subscribers each month. Its catalog has grown so impressive, in fact, that it's a bit overwhelming. Here are some of our favorites you can stream right now.
'Cassandro' (2023)
"The exotico has lost, like always," shrugs the announcer of the low-rent wrestling match, which doesn't really bother Saúl (Gael García Bernal) all that much -- he's "the runt," and he's got problems of his own. One of the pleasures of Roger Ross Williams's comedy-drama, which is loosely based on a true story, is how steeped it is in the lore of the lucha libre, the traditions and characters and lingo that give this world its juice. Saúl, a cheerfully, unapologetically gay wrestler, devises a flamboyantly theatrical new character: an exotico, yes, "but he wins." (Roberta Colindrez plays his trainer.) Williams deftly dramatizes how this persona, and his success with it, changes everything, and while he follows the standard sports-underdog playbook, the picture's overwhelming exuberance and kindness set it apart.
'Silver Dollar Road' (2023)
Early in the new documentary by Raoul Peck ("I Am Not Your Negro"), Gertrude Reels remembers her father's deathbed wish: "Whatever you do, don't let the white man have my land." That land, a 65-acre spread (including acres of invaluable waterfront property) in Carteret County, North Carolina, has been at the center of a long, complex legal battle for decades. Not all gentrification happens in the cities, and Peck's keenly observed "intimate portrait" follows this family through years of injustice and wrangling, capturing (and sharing) their indignation.
'All the President's Men' (1976)
This 1976 masterpiece from Alan J. Pakula meticulously details the early days of Watergate -- the crime, the cover-up and the scandal that ultimately brought down the Nixon presidency. The reporting of that story was first unpacked by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in their 1974 book; aside from casting Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman to play the duo, Pakula and the screenwriter William Goldman steadfastly refused to glam up this decidedly un-Hollywood story, focusing not on the dramatic fall of the president but on the grunt work of shoe-leather reporting. And yet, by slogging through the trenches with these reporters and waiting patiently through a seemingly endless series of slammed doors, dead-end leads and "nondenial denials," the payoff is all the more satisfying. (Hoffman is also outstanding in "Marathon Man.")
'Sound of Metal' (2020)
Riz Ahmed is devastatingly good as Ruben, a drummer whose entire life -- his music, his relationship, his self-image -- is upended by a sudden case of extreme hearing loss, in this wrenching drama from the writer and director Darius Marder. Ruben's sense of solitude, even with others, quickly transforms to self-consciousness, then self-doubt, then self-destruction. "Sound of Metal" is ultimately less about finding a cure than finding the stillness within oneself. Marder works in a quiet, observational style, skillfully avoiding clichés, taking turns both satisfying and moving. Our critic praised the film's "distinctive style." ("Love & Mercy" is another heartbreaking portrait of a musician's journey.)
'Sorry to Bother You' (2018)
The musician and activist Boots Riley makes his feature directing debut with this wildly funny, frequently bizarre mixture of Marxist dogma and Marx Brothers-style silliness. LaKeith Stanfield (later an Oscar nominee for "Judas and the Black Messiah") stars as Cassius, a telemarketer who discovers the secret to success and must determine how much to exploit it. That sounds like a fairly straightforward setup, but Riley approaches the material with the eye of an experimental filmmaker, and ends up taking Cassius on a journey into the dark heart of extreme wealth and depravity. You may love it or you may hate it, but you've certainly never seen anything quite like it. ("The Voices" and "The Lighthouse" are similarly strange and bleakly funny.)
'The Handmaiden' (2016)
The filmmaker Park Chan-wook ("Oldboy") takes the stylistic trappings of a period romance and gooses them with scorching eroticism and one of the most ingenious con-artist plots this side of "The Sting." Working from the Sarah Waters novel "Fingersmith," Park begins with the story of a young Korean woman who, as part of a seemingly straightforward swindle, goes to work as a Japanese heiress's handmaiden, occasionally pausing the plot to slyly reveal new information, reframing what we've seen and where we think he might go next. Our critic called it "amusingly slippery entertainment." (If you like offbeat romances, try "Ondine.")
'Support the Girls' (2018)
The writer and director Andrew Bujalski ("Funny Ha Ha," "Computer Chess") creates what looks, on its shiny surface, like a sunny workplace comedy along the lines of "Working ..." or the Chotchkie's scenes in "Office Space." But he's up to something much slyer, a smart examination of class and gender politics in one of their most pointed playgrounds: a Hooters-style sports bar and grill, where customers leer at scantily clad waitresses while the manager, Lisa (Regina Hall), tries to keep temperatures cool (and maintain her own sanity). It's a "stealth charmer," with a richly textured anchoring performance by Hall and a sparkling supporting turn by Haley Lu Richardson, a "White Lotus" favorite.

'Maestro' Serves As a Safety Net: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Bradley Cooper's movie has an unrelenting focus on Bernstein's marriage. What's missing are his struggles as a musician.
Three society women in cocktail dresses stare up at the camera, each with her right fist raised in the Black Panther salute. The cover line: "Free Leonard Bernstein!"
This was New York Magazine's issue of June 8, 1970, which led with Tom Wolfe's gleeful 25,000-word evisceration of a party that had been held at Bernstein's Park Avenue apartment that January. The purpose was to raise awareness of -- and money for -- the 21 Panthers in jail awaiting trial on charges of planning political violence.
Their incarceration had become a cause célèbre among a certain set of well-off white liberals, of whom Bernstein and his wife, Felicia -- the subjects of "Maestro," Bradley Cooper's movie about their troubled marriage, now streaming -- were prime examples.
The backlash to the party's "elegant slumming," as The New York Times put it in an editorial, was swift and brutal. Wolfe's story, months later, was only the most expansive piece of anti-Bernstein criticism. Jewish groups incensed at some of the Panthers' positions picketed his apartment building and booed him when he led the New York Philharmonic. "Radical Chic," as the article was titled inside the magazine, was one of the loudest, bitterest scandals Bernstein ever experienced.
It is also one of the many things that go unmentioned in "Maestro," a depiction of a peerlessly multifaceted musician who was among the great cultural personalities of the 20th century. Bernstein (1918-90) was a composer, conductor, arranger, pianist, best-selling author and TV educator to millions. It can be hard today to imagine a classical musician being a glamorous mainstream celebrity, but that was Lenny. His tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic in the 1960s -- which began as his "West Side Story" star was gleaming -- is still considered the orchestra's modern heyday.
Every biopic is a selective version of a life, and Bernstein's wide-ranging and eventful life is more in need of selectivity than most. But "Maestro" is unblinkingly focused on Leonard and Felicia's marriage, its ups and downs caused in large part by his romantic desires toward men.
For Cooper, Bernstein's consistent struggle in his marriage is countered by just-as-consistent success in his art and career. The movie bursts open with the 25-year-old Lenny's triumphant, last-minute debut with the Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall in 1943. Broadcast nationally over the radio, it jump-started a half-century of renown.
From there, it's a parade of acclaim: the bright-toned early ballets and musicals, the stirring final chorus of "Candide," a soul-shaking performance of Mahler's Second Symphony, packed parties (not the political ones), broadcast interviews.
There are some flies in the ointment. Bernstein long grumbled that he wished he could compose when all the world wanted was more of his conducting, and "West Side Story" burdened him as he sought fame for his more "serious" music. The film briefly alludes to this, with Bernstein's manager trying to squeeze as much money as possible out of podium work. But on the whole, "Maestro" shows Bernstein the artist as perfectly satisfied (and perfectly acclaimed), while Bernstein the man is fatally flawed.
His relationships with men after his marriage are portrayed as more glancing and casual than they were in reality. And his separation from Felicia in 1976 and '77, when he tried to live openly as gay, is treated in "Maestro" as a selfish mistake. The most indelible showcase for Bernstein's sexuality in the film is a late-in-life, almost Mephistophelean dance party -- as sweaty as his calisthenic conducting, bathed in lurid red light -- as he seduces a student.
There's lots of the man's defects in "Maestro"; the artist's are nowhere to be found. Missing entirely is "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue," his flop of a musical with Alan Jay Lerner that closed after seven performances on Broadway in 1976. And missing are his three grimly unsuccessful symphonies, the kind of high-minded music he wanted to be remembered for instead of "On the Town."
Bernstein plays a bit of it on the piano at the beginning of the film, but otherwise missing, too, is "A Quiet Place," the serious opera he longed to write his whole career -- and which some 40 years later is still being futzed with by his estate to try and make it work onstage. While a scene in "Maestro" is set at the premiere of his "Mass," which helped open the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1971, we aren't made aware of its mixed reception.
And from that smash debut at Carnegie on, the film treats Bernstein as unimpeachable on the podium. But though he is today widely revered as a conductor of the music of others, that was hardly a universal opinion at the time. A 1967 Times review by Harold Schonberg, a longtime Bernstein skeptic, describes "an overblown and rather vulgar performance" of Mahler's Second: "He took a terribly slow tempo, and that made his heavy-handed expressive devices -- those pauses! those rubatos! -- all but wrapped up in comic-strip balloons: Pow! Wham! Sigh!"
But no one in "Maestro" nay-says Bernstein's music making. This artificially heightens the contrast of his career with his marriage, distorting the viewer's sense of him and his legacy. As an admirer of Bernstein's work, warts and all, I was disappointed to find his life as an artist depicted as less complex -- and less interesting -- than his life as a husband.
Cooper doesn't pay much attention to Bernstein's personal stumbles, either, if they don't relate to the marriage. Most glaring is the "Radical Chic" affair, in which his critics seized on the contrast between Upper East Side progressivism and open radicalism, with Bernstein being quoted in The Times (unfairly, he said) as answering a Panther's call to seize the means of production with "I dig absolutely."
It would have been an intriguing episode to include in "Maestro" since both Bernsteins were implicated in the blowback, which served to unite them in fiasco. But that would have been jarring because it's so unlike the scenes preferred by Cooper, in which Lenny is the perpetrator and Felicia the victim. Omitting the whole scandal contributes to the film's flattening not just of Bernstein's life but also of Felicia's, which was full outside the marriage, too. (She was active in the American Civil Liberties Union, the civil rights movement and protests against the Vietnam War.)
"Radical Chic" was big news. But what I missed most in "Maestro" was a minor bit of Bernstein: the 1952 one-act "Trouble in Tahiti," a deceptively peppy, stealthily devastating piece about a prosperous, unhappily married suburban couple.
This was an autobiographically charged work; the main characters were originally named Sam and Jennie, the names of Bernstein's parents, who fought bitterly through his childhood. (The wife's was eventually changed to the more singable Dinah, the name of Bernstein's paternal grandmother.)
But the movie presents Bernstein as a fully formed genius, without an evident childhood or parents beyond a passing mention of his father's cruelty. It would have made sense for Sam and Jennie to have been more present in "Maestro," if only to offer some context for Bernstein's own difficult marriage. The sense of history repeating itself might have relieved some of Cooper's insistence on Bernstein and his sexuality bearing sole responsibility for his problems with Felicia.
All these omissions lead to a rigid, either-or, black-and-white atmosphere. And for all Cooper's well-practiced facsimiles of Bernstein's galvanizing, perspiring, emotionally all-in style on the podium, that gives the film a stilted, brittle quality at its core.

Colman Domingo was at an Equinox gym in New York when his agent called. A rush of hope overtook him: After a week spent auditioning for eight film and television roles, finally he was about to get something.
This was in 2014, which Domingo experienced as a year of incredible highs and dangerously low lows. He had just come off a successful, soul-enriching transfer of the stage musical “The Scottsboro Boys” in London, but upon returning to New York, he felt quickly cut down to size. Despite his Tony nomination for the Kander and Ebb musical, Domingo was stuck auditioning for “under-fives,” screen roles that had little more to offer than a line or two. Still, he felt backed into a corner, praying that one of them would hit.
The most promising was a callback for HBO’s Prohibition-era drama “Boardwalk Empire”: To audition for a maître d’ at a Black-owned nightclub, Domingo had donned a tuxedo to sing and tap dance for the producers. You can imagine how he felt then when his agent began that call at the gym by saying that everyone on “Boardwalk Empire” had loved his audition. This is the one that’s going to change it up for me, Domingo thought . This is the one that’s going to finally be my big break.
There was just one problem, his agent said. After the callback, a historical researcher on the show reminded producers that the maître d’s in those nightclubs were typically light-skinned, and Domingo was not. “Boardwalk Empire” had passed.
“That’s when I lost my mind,” Domingo said. He remembers how he screamed and slid to the floor that day as everyone in the gym stared. He remembers numbly repeating to his agent, “I can’t take it anymore. I think this is going to kill me.” And he remembers that somehow in his daze, he made it back home to his husband and announced that he was ready to walk away from acting forever.
The severity of that low point is all the more startling because right now, Domingo couldn’t be riding higher. When I met him a few weeks ago in the restaurant of a Los Angeles hotel, the 54-year-old actor was glowing with the satisfaction of a man whose long-deferred dreams had finally begun to be realized. Last year, he won the Emmy for outstanding guest actor in a drama series for his performance as Ali in “Euphoria”; at Christmas, he’ll co-star in a new movie version of “The Color Purple,” which adapts the Tony-winning Broadway musical and casts Domingo as the troubled, abusive Mister.
But his most significant current credit is “Rustin,” a Netflix drama that finally lets him play the leading man. In this biopic from Barack and Michelle Obama’s production company, Higher Ground, Domingo is so juicy and compelling as gay civil rights activist Bayard Rustin that he was nominated at the Golden Globes for best actor in a drama and could be a contender at the Oscars, too.
“I don’t want to miss this moment,” Domingo said, digging into a plate of jumbo shrimp with the same gusto he brought to Rustin, the man who organized 1963’s historic March on Washington, where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. “All the films, all the lights, all the accolades, all the beautiful critical responses — I want to bathe in all of that right now.”
In person, the Philadelphia-raised Domingo cut a striking figure: 6-foot-3 in a slinky black turtleneck, he was handsome, bearded and blessed with the sort of baritone that has earned him recent voice roles as a Transformer and as Batman. The arrow in his left earlobe was a nod to his sociable Sagittarius personality (“They’re born during the party months”), and whenever Domingo smiled widely and slapped his hand on the table, the big gold ring on his finger would punctuate his sentences with a vibrant trill. If anyone at the restaurant didn’t know who he was yet, they could tell just by looking at him that this was a charismatic somebody.
“The fact that he is a joyful, playful, available spirit is truly an accomplishment,” said “Rustin” director George C. Wolfe, who noted that some actors become embittered after years of false starts. “I don’t think he’s allowed ‘Why is it taking so long?’ to contaminate his sense of worth and discovery and play.”
Domingo is now sanguine about his long-delayed path to movie stardom.
“I’ve had many moments where I just needed that little shine or that little push or that extra scene that I know we shot, but decisions were made,” he said. “It happens. You can shoot a film and do some of the best work of your career, and they leave out three incredible scenes, and you’re like, ‘That could have made me. That could have changed everything.’”
Still, to stay in the game and generate his own opportunities, Domingo had to learn the other skills that he now considers his superpowers, writing and starring in plays like “A Boy and His Soul” and “Wild With Happy” while expanding his repertoire to television hosting and directing for the stage.
“I know for sure when I’m leading a film like ‘Rustin’ or being a part of ‘Color Purple,’ I can actually be a greater contributor and collaborator because I have all these skills,” Domingo said. “Maybe that’s the thing I’ve learned in my long and winding career: Nothing anyone can give me is better than something I can make myself.”
There is a phrase in “Rustin” so potent that it was put on the poster: “Own your power.” It’s something Rustin tells an initially doubtful King in order for him to summon the strength to lead, and for Domingo to become the leading man he was meant to be.
After that demoralizing phone call at Equinox, he let his longtime agent go and signed with new management that quickly secured him a regular role on the AMC hit “Fear the Walking Dead.” Steady work on that eight-season zombie drama gave Domingo the stability to quit dropping everything to fly across the country and jump through hoops out of desperation for screen tests that never paid off.
Filmmakers responded to his growing confidence and the roles grew, too, in well-reviewed films like “If Beale Street Could Talk” (2018), “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” (2020) and “Zola” (2021). But Domingo eventually decided that if he wanted to be a leading man, he had to treat himself like one and cease auditioning.
“I became an actor that was ‘offer-only’ probably sooner than the industry thought I should have,” he said of the risky move. “But I decided I have a body of work. You can go and look at it, you can ask other directors about me, and you can make me the offer or not.”
Only once did Domingo break his rule to audition for a director friend who would not cast him.
“I was shocked because I allowed myself to do that again, then it didn’t yield the results that I wanted,” Domingo said. “It broke something in our friendship because I thought, ‘No, you have to be my advocate.’”
The trouble with developing a sense of self-sufficiency is convincing people they still need to go to bat for you. Luckily, Wolfe, who had cast Domingo in a key supporting role in “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom,” knew this was an actor who was destined for more.
“He’s been ready for a very long time,” Wolfe said. “It’s taken the world time to catch up to him.”
For “Rustin,” Wolfe needed an actor who was spirited, intelligent and charismatic, a description that suited Domingo down to the bone.
“People who knew Bayard said that when he walked in a room, heads all turned,” Wolfe said. “That seemed very much like Colman.” And Domingo felt validated to have the director pushing for him.
“He got to know me fully as a human being and as a collaborator and someone who could wrestle text with him, and he advocated for me,” Domingo said. “Did he advocate to Netflix? To the Obamas? He advocated to somebody, because he made the decision and it was a direct offer.”
Although the movie is traditional, the role of Rustin is anything but: The furthest thing from a strait-laced activist, he was a flamboyant, out gay man possessed of a self-certainty so contagious that he could persuade just about anyone to link arms with him.
“I think he used his higher-pitched, reedy voice as a tool to disarm people,” Domingo said. “A Black queer man running around the world with his mid-Atlantic standard accent, playing the lute and singing Elizabethan love songs? That’s wild!”
And Domingo enjoyed the way Rustin owned his sexuality in the same way he was unafraid to occupy space: “He could still pull men at a bar with three teeth missing.” After Domingo appeared on “The Tonight Show” to discuss “Rustin” with his shirt unbuttoned to the navel, he received an appreciative text from Lilli Kay, one of the young actors in the film’s ensemble: “I think Bayard would want to be remembered as a sexy Black leader,” she told him.
Domingo’s sexuality is something he had to own, too: Although he’s been out since his 20s, it took him time to build the self-confidence he now exudes in spades. “There’s a quote that my husband likes to use: ‘Don’t be born beautiful, be born crafty,’” he said.
Once skinny and shy, Domingo is now a well-built flirt, and he looks for opportunities to invest his characters with the same kinetic energy he learned to summon from within himself: “When I directed my play ‘Dot,’ I remember on the first day I said, ‘I think all the characters are sexy — the elderly woman, the gay couple, the single woman.’ Because you can’t leave sexuality out of roles.”
That’s the same way Domingo approached Mister in “The Color Purple,” the role Danny Glover played in the original Spielberg film: Domingo wanted Mister to be guided by his prowess, moving as though he were on the hunt, since that virility was the only way Mister knew how to express himself out in the world.
“He’s a very sexual being, but he’s not a romantic,” Domingo said. “He uses women, maybe to have power in some way. None of it’s love, because he wasn’t taught that.”
For much of the film, Mister abuses his wife, Celie (Fantasia Barrino-Taylor), and the audience may come to hate him for it. Domingo could not: He had to leave space for Mister to seek redemption by the end of the film, and scenes with the character’s domineering father suggested to Domingo that this was a classic example of a hurt person who hurts others.
“I wanted to understand his humanity, his desires, needs and dreams,” he said. “They were also cut short, and that’s why he puts his foot on Celie’s neck the entire time.”
The most important thing Domingo wanted to make sure of is that “Rustin” and “The Color Purple” would not sink into misery. Rustin’s role in the March for Washington was often marginalized, but he never succumbed to self-pity, and for all the terrible things visited upon Celie in “The Color Purple,” she deals with that adversity in imaginative, even hopeful ways.
“We turn on the news and we know we need stories like this,” Domingo said. “How are we going to make it to another day? How are we going to rally and be inspired? How are we going to deal with our trauma and look it in the eye and make something joyful with it?”
Maybe that’s why Domingo never let all those setbacks drive him out of the business: His own creative spark simply couldn’t be extinguished.
“There were times when I thought, ‘Maybe I’m not the one for the light to shine on,’” he confessed. “I think Rustin understood that was possibly his place. But someday when you look up and everyone takes notice for what you’ve been doing and building, and they see you fully as your whole self as an artist, it’s humbling.”
A few hours before our interview, Domingo had gone for a walk in Beverly Hills and felt appreciation, bordering on awe, for the unlikely path that had led him to this moment.
“I will try not to cry,” he said, “but I know for sure that I’m living in my dreams.”
He paused, considering it. “Not even my dreams — my mother’s dreams and my grandparents’ dreams and my ancestors’ dreams. Things were not set up for my family in this way. I was not set up to be able to do this and be here.”
But he is here, finally. And since none of it came easily, those hard-won spoils taste even more delicious.
“I’m enjoying all of it,” Domingo said, gesturing to his plate with a wide grin. “I will eat the food. I will enjoy the cocktail. I’m sitting here eating jumbo shrimp with my fingers, and you know what?” He leaned forward. “I’m going to need you to have one, too.”

Full text: The late Kenny DeForest delivers an hour to remember him by, while Dina Hashem and Pete Holmes offer entertaining contrasts.
Kenny DeForest, 'Don't You Know Who I Am?'
Stream it on YouTube
When I was 9 or 10, I was picked last for a football game and, because of my thick glasses, immediately given a nickname: the Brain. This was no compliment. The quarterback on my team, after steering clear of me for most of the game, couldn't continue to ignore that I was being left uncovered and grudgingly tossed a long spiral that fell firmly into my hands for a touchdown, changing my name. The Brain became the Brain Who Could Catch. This remains probably the greatest moment in my life.
The absurdity of glorying in such minor athletic triumphs has never been captured more lovingly and amusingly than in a special released this year by Kenny DeForest. This hour of jokes, which begins and ends with a game of one-on-one basketball, is titled "Don't You Know Who I Am?" When DeForest died this month at 37, in a bike accident in Brooklyn, most didn't.
It's a peculiar kind of cruelty when a young comic dies, which only partly explains the outpouring of love on social media. DeForest, who took over as host of the Sunday show at the Knitting Factory years ago, was beloved by comics for his generosity, infectious spirit, easy smile and love of the craft of stand-up. The stories that have emerged about him offering support or simply brightening up a room are as inspiring as they are legion. One of the many awful elements of this tragedy is that he was exactly the kind of joyful, skilled comic who could help ease the pain of it.
"Don't You Know?" is about coping with the end of something important, in this case his athletic career. "I really appreciate you being here," he says at the start. "It's a real honor to be able to pursue my second dream." His first was basketball. That ended after he was dunked on by a future N.B.A. player in a high school game. Athletes struggle to move on, he says, because they don't know what to do with their intensity, which he explores, along with struggles with depression and alcoholism.
With silky ease, DeForest turns these dark subjects into humor. His laid-back delivery makes them seem manageable, in part through punchlines and charm. But also a clear belief in the power of jokes. The end of his basketball career is reframed as the start of his comedy career. He finishes his special with an amazingly romantic story recounting New York playground glory.
You may relate to how he turns the memory of a step-back jumper on a Brooklyn street into something monumental. You may find it goofy. But it's a wonderful example of how a story can be more powerful than a dunk, how it can provide solace and inspiration and even hope.
Some are lucky enough to have memories of DeForest. The rest of us have his work, his two superb late-night TV sets (the one from "Late Night With Seth Meyers" is the funniest, in my opinion) and this recent hour, which ends with him breaking the fourth wall, looking at the camera and flashing a preposterous smile.
Dina Hashem, 'Dark Little Whispers'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Stream it on Amazon Prime
In a mustard yellow hoodie and jeans, Dina Hashem couldn't be more unassuming, opening her debut special with a "hey" and a little wave, resembling the shy kid in class raising a hand but only getting halfway there. She nods to how her introspective, quiet personality is an odd match for stand-up. "I'm not supposed to be here," she says. "I'm supposed to be depressed at the library." And yet, those who follow comedy in New York know that she would kill at the library, just as she does at clubs.
One of the best deadpan artists working, she delivers a handful of superb, often dark premises, most of which emerge in a low-key offhanded style, as if she's spitballing. There's a clever one about the marketing meeting to come up with "Never forget" after Sept. 11 and an elaborate bit about how it must be weird to meet God in the afterlife if you have had plastic surgery. "God would be looking at you like, you didn't like my work?"
A Muslim comic, Hashem delivers clever bits about religion, including a tricky one about the meaning of jihad that seems to be going one way, then spins out into a surprise that will delight language nerds. Maybe her soft-spoken vibe allows her to get away with more than a loudmouth would, like a line about Jeff Bezos going to hell, delivered on an Amazon platform. I bet he would laugh.
Pete Holmes, 'I Am Not for Everyone'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Stream it on Netflix
In his latest special, Pete Holmes makes a forceful counterargument to atheist comics like Ricky Gervais who mock belief in God. It's a smart joke, but what I will remember from this hour is the one that followed: "Ever have to poop so bad that you pee second?"
For better and worse, my kids see a lot of stand-up, and so my 9-year old was watching this joke with me. I have never heard her laugh so loud. A full-body guffaw, followed by her pointing at the screen and saying, "I know exactly what he means."
There's a power in that moment of recognition in stand-up, especially when it's about something you're not supposed to talk about in class or at the dinner table. Reaching comedy heaven is more about finding those jokes, lowbrow as they may be, than arguments about God.
Holmes, who has a gaping mouth and stuffed-animal physique, did dad jokes before he was a dad. In midcareer, he remains plugged in to the bountiful pleasures of the silly, the throwaway pun, the goofy word choice, the prank. Has becoming a dad made him more scatological? Maybe. And yet, even though he has very funny bits about the very young and very old, he isn't aiming for a demographic.
You should watch him with kids only if you're holding a remote tightly, because there's enough yelling about dildos that you will need that fast-forward button. That his comedy mixes the sweetly innocent with the dirty, the stupid with the sophisticated, the warm with the spiky may not help him commercially, but I respect it. His art is an honest reflection of his sensibility with a minimum of pandering. As dumb as this sounds, his jokes about poop and pee have integrity.

Documentary Filmmaker Aims His Lens at Santos: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The filmmaker, Jenner Furst, will pay Mr. Santos an archival material fee, an arrangement similar to the one he used with Billy McFarland, the subject of "Fyre Fraud."
George Santos, the disgraced former congressman trying to parlay his notoriety into a cottage industry, is now participating in a documentary film project on his colorful lies, life and times.
The film is being led by Jenner Furst, a successful documentarian whose projects include a Peabody-award winning documentary about Kalief Browder, a young Bronx man whose suicide after an extended detention on Rikers Island became a symbol of the breakdown in criminal justice in New York.
Mr. Furst is also known for a documentary genre that he refers to as true comedy, and it is those stories -- among them the Amazon docuseries "LuLaRich," about a leggings-hocking pyramid scheme, and "Fyre Fraud," which went behind the scenes of a high-end music festival that wasn't -- that have earned him a peculiar distinction.
"I'm a scammer whisperer," said Mr. Furst with a laugh.
Of the two films, "Fyre Fraud," which hit Hulu in 2019, was an especially big hit. One of two competing projects on the subject, it was the only one to interview the story's ostensible villain, Billy McFarland, who had pleaded guilty to wire fraud and agreed to forfeit $ 26 million.
But the project drew criticism after it was revealed that Mr. Furst had compensated Mr. McFarland to license materials used in the film.
Mr. Santos will likewise see some financial compensation for his participation, in the form of an archival materials fee. Mr. Furst asserted that the arrangement was common in the industry, which has exploded in recent years after streaming giants like Hulu and Netflix began investing heavily in documentaries. He said the payment -- the amount of which he declined to disclose -- would cover photographs, videos, and "a lot of personal stuff that people have never seen."
Mr. Furst is aware that many find it distasteful that Mr. Santos is profiting off his notoriety.
But he rejects this view, explaining that his work helps in the long run ensure that justice is served: "The only way that people can get their money back is somehow for there to be money created, to put money in their hands," Mr. Furst said.
Filming is already underway for the documentary, which Mr. Furst says will include interviews with a number of people in Mr. Santos's inner circle.
The ex-congressman still faces 23 felony counts including wire fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft. Prosecutors say he defrauded campaign donors and the federal government across a range of criminal schemes.
Mr. Furst insisted that no topic is off the table, from the pettiest accusation to the most serious charge.
But the filmmaker hopes the project will bring some humanity to the story of Mr. Santos, whose sins, he said, pale in comparison to those corporate, governmental and social systems that shape our culture.
"I really focus more on the human side of the story," Mr. Furst said, saying he would aim to understand Mr. Santos's childhood, insecurities, heartbreaks and betrayals.
Asked whether he believes that Mr. Santos's misdeeds, both accused and admitted, ought to disqualify him from holding office, Mr. Furst called it "a silly question."
"There is the illusion that there's good people and bad people," he said in an interview. "Ultimately, there still is truth. And I am committed to truth. And somehow, as someone committed to truth in a post-truth era, I don't think I can be as religiously attached to the existence of truth anymore."
Indeed, Mr. Furst said, he is not concerned by the possibility that Mr. Santos might be less than truthful with him. "He could sit and tell me lies the entire time. Ultimately, based on my ability to bear out the truth around him, that ... that becomes pure entertainment."
This is hardly the first time that Mr. Santos has been able to profit off his escapades: Earlier this month, he set himself up on the platform Cameo which allows users to pay celebrities for short personalized video messages. In his first week, Mr. Santos earned more than $ 174,000, the company confirmed -- the equivalent of a year of his earnings as a member of Congress.
Since then, Mr. Santos, who has raised his rates to $ 500 per video, has rarely allowed opportunity go to waste, even introducing a limited Christmas edition "Santos-Claus" series of Cameos which he said would help "make Christmas great again!"
Mr. Santos has pleaded not guilty to the charges he faces.
But in a court appearance last week, Mr. Santos's lawyer, Joseph Murray, told a judge that he'd been engaging in negotiations with prosecutors about paths to conclude the case without going to trial, which might or might not include restitution payments.
Mr. Santos is due next in court on Jan. 23.

Let Us Hip You to That, Dude: Pee-wee's Christmas Special Is Free: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: "Christmas at Pee-wee's Playhouse" has come and gone from streaming platforms over the years. Now it's back in a dazzling remastered version on YouTube.
A remastered, restored version of "Christmas at Pee-wee's Playhouse" is available now for free on the Pee-wee Herman YouTube channel, and if you haven't seen the 1988 special in a while, or, heaven forbid, ever, this is clearly the time.
The special is a revolving door of celebrity guests and a mash-up of '80s stars and '50s nostalgia: Whoopi Goldberg, Magic Johnson, Joan Rivers, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello, Charo. Grace Jones sings "Little Drummer Boy." k.d. lang sings "Jingle Bell Rock." There is camp whimsy and childlike wonder, knowingly hokey and homoerotic in equal measure.
"Christmas" has come and gone from streaming platforms over the years, but the remastering here is the major draw. You can practically feel the nap of Chairry's upholstery -- the whole set dazzles in its textured, surrealist glory. (Dopamine décor, you wish you had this flair.) If only all of "Pee-wee's Playhouse" were available to stream in such visual splendor.
Television Christmas specials are still around, though not with the same kind of ambition and style as this or something like "A Muppet Family Christmas." And even high-profile ones, like "A Very Murray Christmas" from 2015, have not established themselves in the canon. Instead, the latest new canon entry is a genre not an individual show: The Hallmark Christmas movie.
One way to become a classic is to be excellent; another is to be constant. Repetition and tradition can be one and the same. Broadcast "It's a Wonderful Life" on television enough times and it transforms from an airtime filler to an essential, treasured ritual. At this point, these corny-on-purpose mild rom-coms have expanded well past just the Hallmark Channel -- Lifetime, OWN, BET+, Hulu, Netflix, the Roku Channel and plenty of other networks and platforms churn them out as diligently as elves make toys. More than 100 such movies aired this year, and it doesn't show signs of stopping. And that's not a vice! Schlock is a common feature of the Christmas vault. But that's one thing that makes this special even more, well, special: Even in its homages, "Christmas at Pee-wee's Playhouse" is still uniquely itself.

Paramount And Warner Talk Merger: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The talks, which are said to be in the early stages, add Warner Bros. Discovery to the list of companies pursuing a possible deal with Paramount.
Warner Bros. Discovery has joined the ranks of companies expressing interest in a possible merger with Paramount, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.
David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery, had lunch this week with Bob Bakish, Paramount's chief executive, and expressed interest in a potential merger of the two companies, the two people said.
During the lunch, which was held Tuesday at Paramount's Midtown Manhattan headquarters, the prospect of a merger came up in a wide-ranging conversation between Mr. Bakish and Mr. Zaslav, the people said.
Warner Bros. Discovery's stock fell on news of the deal, which was reported earlier by Axios. Paramount's stock dipped slightly in after-market trading.
Shari Redstone, who controls Paramount through her stake in its parent company, National Amusements, has recently shown a willingness to part with her family's media empire. In recent weeks, National Amusements held talks about selling its controlling stake to Skydance, the movie studio with production credits on Paramount franchises like "Top Gun" and "Mission: Impossible."
There is ample business logic in a tie-up of Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount. Paramount's bundle of TV networks, which include MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central, could give Warner Bros. Discovery greater leverage in negotiations with cable distributors like Comcast and Charter.
The companies could also save costs on producing and marketing shows and movies on their networks and from their movie studios. And Paramount's CBS broadcast network would give Warner Bros. Discovery, which operates NBA TV, another platform for airing National Basketball Association games, a selling point in its negotiations with the league on a renewal of rights.
But there would be significant hurdles to any deal. Though Warner Bros. Discovery has paid down much of the leverage it incurred as a result of the 2021 deal to merge Discovery with AT&T's WarnerMedia, the company is still burdened with more than $ 40 billion in debt. And it remains to be seen whether arcane tax laws would allow Warner Bros. Discovery to strike a deal before the two-year anniversary of the completion of the merger, which is in April.
A deal for Paramount, if it came to fruition, could set off further consolidation among media companies, which have huddled together for warmth in recent years as the dying embers of the TV business burned low. Though TV companies like Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery have been bankrolled by cash from cable distributors over the decades, the pay-TV ecosystem is becoming increasingly shaky as viewers cut the cord in droves.
With the exception of Netflix, most streaming services are no better off. Traditional TV programmers like Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount have invested billions of dollars in streaming services like Max and Paramount+, but they have failed to reproduce the cash-rich business model of cable TV.
Ms. Redstone's relationship with Mr. Zaslav will ultimately be a factor in the outcome of the negotiations. The two are well acquainted in the clubby world of media executives and share many powerful friends, including the owner of the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft.

Heartbreak Never Dulled A Naughty Royal's Sparkle: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: In the sixth season, Princess Margaret suffers a series of strokes that shatter her glamorous exterior. "She doesn't know how to function," said Lesley Manville, who plays the role.
On the day that Queen Elizabeth II died, Lesley Manville was in hospital.
The actor was filming an episode of the final season of "The Crown" in which her character, Princess Margaret, is visited at her sickbed by her older sister Elizabeth, played by Imelda Staunton. When the two actors were briefed that the real queen "may well pass today," Manville recalled in a recent interview, they told the crew they'd like to carry on filming the emotional scene.
They wrapped at 4 p.m., Manville said, "which we later found out was around the time she died."
In the sixth and final season of "The Crown," it is Manville's character that is approaching the end. Margaret was one Windsor family's more rebellious members, and as a young woman, she fell in love with the divorced air force officer Peter Townsend, though she was not allowed to marry him. In the show, this heartbreak casts a shadow over the rest of her life.
Still, that pain never dulled Margaret's sparkle. Manville, 67, who speaks with the command of a seasoned stage actor, described Margaret as glamorous and alluring, "a woman who was never off the front pages of the newspaper in the '50s and '60s -- the Diana of that generation."
On "The Crown," Vanessa Kirby initially played Margaret (Seasons 1 and 2), followed by Helena Bonham Carter (Seasons 3 and 4), and by the time Manville took up the role for Season 5, the princess was in her 60s. Over the decades, the show presents Margaret's glitzy lifestyle in stark contrast with Elizabeth's years of quiet duty.
But much of Margaret's earlier glamour was stripped away after she suffered three strokes between 1998 and 2001. Manville was drawn to the knottiness of portraying Margaret "in this difficult and lonely time of her life," she said. When the character's illness also takes away her looks, her identity is shaken, too. "She doesn't know how to function," Manville said.
"Ritz," the eighth episode of the new season, depicts the strokes and Margaret's decline. The princess defies her doctor's orders and continues drinking and partying on the Caribbean island of Mustique, where she suffers a second stroke. Ahead of filming, Manville met with several stroke victims, she said, to accurately show the physical and psychological aftereffects. The challenge was to balance the realism of a drooping mouth and slurred speech with "speaking coherently enough," she added.
During this period of ill health, Margaret's planner was no longer full -- "She didn't like that," Manville said -- and her royal engagements were less frequent. "When you had all of that, and then you just see it ebbing away, that's fascinating to play," Manville said.
Meriel Sheibani-Clare, who co-wrote Episode 8, said that in this episode, the show's creators wanted to reframe Margaret by celebrating her support for her sister. Manville played her as "brittle and spiky," Sheibani-Clare said, while still conveying vulnerability so "she sometimes feels like a little girl."
Manville said "the uniqueness of the series" was that it allowed her "to do my Margaret," quite separate from Kirby and Bonham Carter's performances. But running through all three performances, Manville noted, has been a thread of naughtiness. In one comedic vignette from Episode 8, Manville's Margaret, banned from smoking by her doctor, ransacks the palace in search of a cigarette and takes a hungry, exalted puff. If she had played Margaret without a sense of humor, Manville said, "that would not be picking up the baton very successfully."
Manville, who has been a fixture of British stage and screen since the mid-1970s, said she has never wanted to be "a personality actress who just plays themselves all the time." When she accepted the role of Margaret in 2020, she was about to portray a '50s cleaning lady in the feature "Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris." The contrast between playing that role and a "real blue blood aristocrat" was "too tempting for words," Manville said.
Staunton, another British actor with a long résumé, said she and Manville were "old friends" and had bonded during "a hilarious time flying around on harnesses" while making Disney's 2014 live-action film "Maleficent."
In "The Crown," the actors channel their offscreen relationship through gentle sisterly banter. But in Episode 8, an intimate scene in which Elizabeth reads to the ailing Margaret in bed at home is a rare opportunity to see the queen's stiff upper lip quiver. Elizabeth softens and grows wistful, while Margaret's wit crackles in the face of her own mortality.
In her last episodes of "The Crown," Manville said she wanted to amplify "the pain of life without a partner" and Margaret's loneliness, which she said was present even when Kirby played her as a young woman.
But the show's creators didn't want to define Margaret by her love life. "There had been so much out there by the tabloids and biographers about poor, sad, tragic Margaret," Sheibani-Clare said.
"But right to the end," she added, she spoke to her sister on the phone every day."

A Dress Fit for a Princess Now Has a Price to Match: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The black and blue evening dress sold for more than 11 times the expected price, a sign of Diana's continuing allure more than a quarter century after her death.
She wore the ballerina-length evening dress to a 1985 dinner hosted by the mayor of Florence, Italy, and again to the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra the following year. On Sunday, that dress, which belonged to Diana, Princess of Wales, sold at auction for nearly $ 1.15 million -- a record amount for one of her dresses.
The piece, created by Jacques Azagury, the Moroccan-British fashion designer, was "synonymous with the Princess of Wales's royal elegance and eternal grace," the Hollywood auction house, Julien's Auctions, said in a statement, noting that it had sold for more than 11 times what the auction house had predicted that it would bring.
The dress was sold along with a matching illustration that detailed its black velvet bodice embroidered with metallic stars, a two-tier royal blue organza skirt with a sash and bow (a nod to Diana's love of dance) and one of her signature looks: shoulder pads.
"The fact that this dress, all these years later, goes for this amount -- I think people continue to be in awe of her and her fashion," Elizabeth Holmes, a fashion critic and expert in the royal family's style, said in an interview on Monday. "Diana has remained a fashion icon."
The sale of the dress came as "The Crown" -- the opulent Netflix series about the British royal family that has renewed interest in the life of Princess Diana and her children -- airs its final season. Several of the show's 60 episodes are devoted to the princess and the controversies in the years leading up to her death in a car crash in 1997.
The series also showcases her famous clothes. Diana, among the most photographed women in the world at the time, knew her fashion would be observed by millions, and evolved from a modest young woman into a glamorous international celebrity.
"She knew the power of a picture," Ms. Holmes, the fashion critic, said, describing how Diana used fashion to communicate with onlookers and draw attention to the charities she supported -- even as her public speech was limited. When Diana wore the ballerina dress in the 1980s, the princess had truly begun to lean into her personal style, taking risks with shorter hemlines, lower necklines and bold silhouettes, Ms. Holmes said. "You can see that in this dress," she added. "You can place it in time."
The sale followed an auction in September at which Diana's iconic black sheep sweater was sold by Sotheby's for $ 1.14 million.
At Sunday's sale, a blouse the princess wore in her 1981 engagement portrait sold for $ 381,000, four times its original estimate, Julien's Auctions said.
Diana was the first to auction off her clothing -- cleaning out her closet just months before she died to sell 79 dresses in New York and donate $ 3.25 million to charity.
"It's interesting to see how her style, thank God, changed," Joan Rivers, the comedian, said at the time, as she observed the cocktail and evening dresses. A Los Angeles real estate broker, Donna Burgess, noted at the same event that she had come "to Never-Never Land to get a piece of the fairy tale" that, at the time, appeared to some to be Princess Diana's life.
As is common, Julien's did not reveal the buyer of the Azagury ballerina dress. Ms. Holmes, the critic, said she hoped whoever it was would treat it with appropriate care.
"I'm dying to know what the people who buy these clothes do with them," she said. "Are you hanging it in your closet? What's going on?"

Defining Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism: [Letter]

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "Is Anti-Zionism Antisemitism, by Definition?" (front page, Dec. 12):
What is Zionism? To me, being a Zionist in 2023 means that I accept the right and the necessity of the survival of the Jewish people and the existence of a Jewish state that ensures their survival.
Anything that undermines or threatens Israel's survival also undermines or threatens the existence of the Jewish people and is, ipso facto, antisemitic.
Philip B. Berger
Toronto
To the Editor:
I am a Jew by culture and ancestry, albeit a secular one. I abhor contemporary violence by both Hamas and Israel. Historically, however, I have found that in recent years, Israel's aggressive behavior has been the more objectionable, and Israel seems more determined to demoralize and destroy the Gaza population than to surgically remove Hamas.
In the 1950s, when I was a young child and Israel a struggling young state, I paid small sums to buy leaves that I pasted on a picture of a tree until I had bought enough for a tree to be planted in Israel in honor of my grandmother. My father bought Israel bonds -- hardly the best monetary investment -- in my name and those of my siblings. In the late 1960s and early '70s, when I had my own children and when Israel had become an expansionist power, I asked him to stop.
Although a Jew, I am emphatically not a Zionist, and I resent and fear the conflation of the two.

The writer is distinguished emeritus professor of anthropology at the State University of New York.
To the Editor:
Jonathan Weisman describes radically different interpretations of Zionism as, alternately, a movement ensuring Jewish sovereignty and safety, or an oppressive colonialism. What is often lost in the debate is the historic diversity among many Zionisms (plural), which continue to struggle with one another for primacy today.
One version of Zionism is expansionist, deeply nationalistic and largely unconcerned about the human rights of non-Jews, while another version on the Zionist spectrum is profoundly humanist at its core and envisions an equitable coexistence between Jews and Palestinians.
Supporting a Zionism that promotes pluralism and shared society is the only vision for a better future for these two peoples whose fates are intertwined.

Just Keeping Trump From the White House Won't Save Democracy
To the Editor:
Re "The Resolute Liz Cheney," by Katherine Miller (Opinion, Dec. 10):
While I appreciate former Representative Liz Cheney's relentless opposition to Donald Trump because of the danger he poses to the nation, keeping him out of the White House won't alone save democracy. We also desperately need to stop Ms. Cheney's fellow Republicans from undermining elections in their pursuit of permanent political power.
Republicans have used extreme means to draw House districts in their favor and refused to join Democrats to stop those gerrymanders even though they deprive voters of fair representation and promote polarization by increasing the number of safe seats.
Almost all Republicans voted against restoring provisions of the Voting Rights Act that would help assure protection against racial discrimination. They opposed measures to enact basic ballot access standards, instead allowing states to impose restrictive rules and locate polling places to make it harder for groups they don't favor to vote.
And they refused to support bills to stop the pernicious influence of big donors, opposing even basic disclosure rules to stop secret "dark" money from warping our political priorities.
Standing up to Mr. Trump does little good if we allow Republicans to destroy our democracy by other means. Voters need to elect people to protect free and fair elections before Republicans succeed in rigging them in their favor. Otherwise, we will have rule by a party instead of rule by the people, and our experiment in self-governance will be at an end.

Policies on Curbing Drug Addiction
To the Editor:
Re "Rethinking Drug Policies in an Ailing Portland" (front page, Dec. 12):
As a law enforcement veteran, I believe that the police have an important role in supporting community safety. But policymakers can't keep relying on the police as a Band-Aid to every problem. We cannot arrest our way out of addiction. And increasing criminalization to solve public drug use, as some suggest in the article, won't work.
I worked and supervised police narcotics and gang units. Eventually, I saw that the laws I was charged with enforcing didn't make my neighbors safer. No matter how much we ramped up enforcement or how many people we arrested, it didn't stop the flow of drugs into our community or prevent people from dying.
For over 50 years, the United States has prioritized criminalization as a response to drug use, yet stronger drugs like fentanyl have emerged, and our country is facing a health crisis with record-setting overdose deaths.
To make any progress toward curbing addiction, we need to increase access to the addiction services and support people need: treatment, overdose prevention centers, outreach teams to connect people to care, and housing. More criminalization is a false promise of change.

Lights Dim Off Broadway
To the Editor:
Re "Off Broadway, Vital to Theater Scene, Struggles" (front page, Dec. 8):
It saddens me to read about the struggles and closures of our city's intimate theaters. These are the institutions that nurture new work. Losing them darkens our future.
During this crisis, I hope artistic directors will remember that it doesn't have to cost a fortune to put on a play. Even a bare-bones staging gives us something Netflix never can: a story shared by strangers in person in real time.

Asia's Disappearing Sea
To the Editor:
Re "A Giant Inland Sea Is Now a Desert, and a Warning for Humanity," by Jacob Dreyer (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Nov. 28), about the shrinking Aral Sea in Uzbekistan:
Together, we -- an archaeologist, a geographer and a historian -- have extensive experience in the Aral Sea region. We take exception to Mr. Dreyer's description of this place as resembling "hell." Rather than stereotyping the region as a wasteland that people should flee from (Mr. Dreyer stresses his desire to leave the region as quickly as possible), we must recognize the meaning and value that the Aral Sea and its environs still hold for its residents today, and we should center those residents' desired futures.
We also need to consider the Aral Sea region a vital knowledge zone. As we confront shrinking bodies of water in many other regions around the globe, we can learn from the perseverance of Aral Sea residents. If we listen, what lessons can we learn from them as we prepare for future ecological disasters?

Delays of Biblical Proportions Stalled a Sequel: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A flood, a fire, Covid and "Shrek" were just a few of the roadblocks to "Dawn of the Nugget," arriving 23 years after the original hit.
When "Chicken Run" was released in theaters in June 2000, audiences and critics alike were charmed by the Claymation chickens Ginger and Rocky and the story of their escape from a sinister farm.
The movie, which was the first feature from Aardman Animations (home of Wallace and Gromit and Shaun the Sheep), grossed more than $ 220 million and became the highest-grossing stop-motion animated film -- a record it still holds.
Now the sequel "Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget" is finally arriving on Netflix. The director Sam Fell; Aardman's creative director, Peter Lord; and the production designer Darren Dubicki explained what caused 23 years of delays.
At first it was sheer exhaustion.
Despite the instant success of the first film, Aardman, its partner on the production, DreamWorks, and the creators were in no rush to make a second one.
Sequels weren't as much of an expectation then as they are today, and the arduous process of Claymation had left the team relatively exhausted and ready for a break.
"It's like you've just run a marathon and someone says, 'Hey, how about running another marathon?' You think, 'Well, not just now,"' Lord said. "So right back in 2000s, we were perhaps not ready. But after that, we had no objection to making a sequel at all."
DreamWorks had agreed to make five films total with Aardman, but any potential new productions fell off the priority list. The Hollywood studio instead focused on other stop-motion animated projects that were already in the pipeline and quickly zeroed in on a sequel to "Shrek" after the original became a box office smash in 2001.
"So for a few years, the studio was sort of distracted, the relationship with DreamWorks finished and 'Shrek' arrived," Fell said, adding that Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of DreamWorks Animation at the time, "was probably more interested in 'Shrek,' too, by then."
There was also a fire.
Even before sequel plans were in place, there was a setback: In Bristol, England, the warehouse filled with all the "Chicken Run" puppets, molds and sets caught fire. When it was time to start working on a second film, "we had to really start from scratch," Fell said.
He explained that they "didn't have any reference apart from the making-of book -- there were no puppets or anything to refer to."
Lord added, "We were briefly discouraged by the scale of the problem, and then we thought, 'Well, no, it's just like any other movie. Just get on with it."'
The do-over allowed for greater creativity: while the first film took place primarily in a single location -- a Yorkshire chicken farm -- the second one has dozens of intricate and colorful sets.
"It was pretty apparent when we started reading the script, the scope and scale of the script meant that the world was much vaster than the first film," Dubicki said.
For Lord, seeing the characters come back to life after being lost in the fire was a moving experience.
Then came the flood.
After designs were rendered and all the puppets recreated, production of the sequel was on track -- until the warehouse where the production team was storing all the characters and sets, as well as filming the movie, flooded.
"The roof buckled in the heat of the hot summer and then it just started raining like mad for three days," Fell explained. "The whole studio started leaking, like, not just a little bit, like a lot."
The team ended up engineering a system of funnels from the ceiling and bringing the water away from the sets. Fell likened it to Willy Wonka's factory.
On top of that? The pandemic.
Preproduction began in the early months of 2020, but like everything else, it came to a screeching halt as the pandemic shut down regular life.
When the crew started working again, the necessary Covid-19 precautions significantly slowed down the process.
"Stop-motion animation is a very collaborative business -- it's about people being together in the same place, discussing, making group decisions, looking through the camera, choosing the building, designing, planning camera moves," Lord noted. "In Covid, you couldn't do that. You had to bring everyone on the set one at a time."
Dubicki added, "You had to be really mindful of bringing people together at various points that were integral to making it move forward."
It turns out that not only did staff members have to quarantine if someone tested positive or felt sick -- the clay characters did as well.
Crew members "hold and touch and move the puppet with their hands, so by the time they were finished their shot, the chicken was then considered to be potentially contaminated and someone had to come in with gloves and a mask and take the chicken to the quarantine area," Fell explained.
"There were shelves in a tent with a U.V. light where Babs would be put on the shelf for 10 days before anybody could touch her again," he added, referring to Ginger's knitting compadre.
"Weather, wind, pestilence, plagues -- we survived it all," Fell said with a laugh, and joked, "Next one's coming out in 2050."

NEW YORK — Think of the worst person you know: the kind who blabs people’s secrets, mocks their diction, dismisses their pain while making festivals of her own. Throw in a tendency toward casual antisemitic slurs, for which she thinks she has a free pass, and a “What’s the big deal?” approach to racism.
Now add a deep wound and a wicked tongue and you’re almost partway to Antoinette Lafayette, the monster played by Sarah Paulson in the blistering revival of “Appropriate” that opened on Broadway on Monday. Recalling yet somehow outstripping the thrilling vileness of theatrical viragos like Martha in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and Violet in “August: Osage County,” she is the burned-out core of a nuclear family reactor, taking no prisoners and taking no blame.
But even in Paulson’s eye-opening, sinus-clearing performance, Toni, as she’s called, doesn’t sum up the outrageousness of Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’ play, which has a deep wound and wicked tongue of its own. To get all the way to its sweet spot — and Lila Neugebauer’s production for Second Stage definitely gets there — you must further multiply Toni by her brothers, each awful in his own way.
Bo (Corey Stoll) is passive and entitled, content to let others fail as long as he can’t be faulted. Frank (Michael Esper) is a serial screw-up, the rare person for whom statutory rape is not the worst thing on his resume. At the heart of their grievances is greed — Bo’s for money, Frank’s for forgiveness and Toni’s for revenge.
So when the three, accompanied by their assorted spouses, children, enablers and ghosts, gather in the grand dramatic tradition to dispose of their late father’s estate, you know things are going to explode. Indeed, as the curtain rises at the Helen Hayes Theater, it appears they already have. The Arkansas plantation house in which generations of the family have lived, in eyeshot of the cemetery where generations of their slaves are buried, is now a hellhole in spirit and fact. The once grand building is collapsing under the weight of centuries of evil and, more recently, decades of hoarding.
The two seemingly incompatible stories — the evil and the hoarding, one national, one domestic — come together in a way I don’t want to spoil; it’s part of the brilliance of the play that it lands its biggest surprises with satisfying thumps at exactly the right moments. Suffice to say that when horrible relics of the past, both the country’s and the family’s, are discovered in the clutter, they force the Lafayettes to reexamine the legacy of their father, supposedly once in line to be a Supreme Court justice but also, depending on whom you ask, a saint or a psychopath.
To Toni he was “a thinker! A loving person!” Frank says he was bipolar and abusive. Bo is too avoidant to offer a strong opinion, but his wife, Rachael (Natalie Gold), makes up for that. To her there is no question the old man was an antisemite (she once overheard him refer to her as Bo’s “Jew wife”) and a racist. Even so, she has insisted on bringing the couple’s children — a petulant 13-year-old girl (Alyssa Emily Marvin) and a hyperactive 8-year-old boy (Lincoln Cohen, on the night I saw it, and, alternating in the role, Everett Sobers) — to experience their “roots” as part of “a little American history Southern tour-type thing.”
It’s the kind of laugh line — there are also guffaws, cackles and strange gasp-giggle combos — that works because we think we know more than she does. But it’s also a stinger because, the play suggests, we may not. In “Appropriate,” the “little American history Southern tour-type thing” is meant for the audience, too.
That history is of course full of horrors, not the golden past portrayed in works about the gracious days of juleps and spirituals. But neither is it, for Jacobs-Jenkins, as neatly political and singularly damning as when filtered through a progressive lens. Questioning whether racism and antisemitism are really the core sins of this particular family, “Appropriate” posits that the problem may instead be that they’re just personally hideous. And if that’s true, could it also be true that the various institutions of subjugation so rampant throughout human society are nothing more (or less) than convenient formats for the expression of hate hard-wired in our hearts?
Cherry-picking some of the worst examples imaginable — the play also features Elle Fanning as Frank’s sententious, sage-smudging fiancee and Graham Campbell as Toni’s drug-dealing son — Jacobs-Jenkins makes a convincing if despairing case. That he does so largely through comedy and melodrama (with an astonishing coda of surrealism) makes “Appropriate” easier to enjoy than to understand. The grammatically two-faced title doesn’t help, but easy understanding is not what the author appears to be after.
I have to admit that when I first saw it, at the Signature Theater in 2014, neither understanding nor enjoyment were forthcoming. Rereading my scathing review in light of what is obviously a rave today, I am forced to grapple with my own past — and the play’s. It would be easy to say that the difference between then and now is the heavy rewriting Jacobs-Jenkins has done in the interim. And certainly, comparing the two scripts, I see the clearer dramatic architecture and sharper point of view that a playwright in his prime, at 38, can impose. (I thought Jacobs-Jenkins’ most recent play, “The Comeuppance,” was one of the best of 2023.)
It would also be easy to attribute the improvement to Neugebauer’s direction, which is so smart and swift for most of the play’s substantial length that you feel gripped by storytelling without being strangled by argument. Her staging, on a towering double-decker set by design collective dots, is also nearly ideal, accentuating (with the help of Jane Cox’s painterly lighting) the conflicts and alliances among the characters. And the daredevil cast, instead of reveling in falling apart, focuses for as long as possible on keeping it together. We thus experience, in the force of that repression, just how awful human awfulness must be if human will cannot ultimately corral it.
Though all those improvements are real, they do not fully explain why I’ve flipped for this revival. Perhaps this does: Playwrights who show us things we are reluctant to see may have to teach us, over time, how to see it. And we must be willing to have our eyes opened. I guess I’ve changed at least that much in 10 years of reviewing, and Jacobs-Jenkins is part of the reason.

Caught Up in a Scandal, Then Letting Loose: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At the Beacon, the comic took a different tack after posting a video rebutting a New Yorker article on fabrications in his work. The crowd went wild.
Finishing a story about a girl cheating on him in 11th grade, Hasan Minhaj turned to the audience at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan during the first of two shows on Friday night and said, "Don't fact-check me."
The crowd came alive at this nod to the recent New Yorker article by Clare Malone exposing several of his onstage stories as fabrications. "I had to go head-to-head with one of the most dangerous organizations in the world," he said, adding that he didn't mean the U.S. military or the Israeli Defense Forces. "I am talking about a white woman with a keyboard."
Then he mocked the article as "water is wet" obvious before describing it as a sign of success. "I've made it: I got a real old scandal," he said, adding, "A dorky scandal." With regret in his voice, Minhaj said he didn't molest a child or sleep with a porn star: "I got caught embellishing for dramatic effect."
Typical crisis management dictates you should move on, not fixate. But in our attention economy, where the most popular Netflix specials of the past year featured Chris Rock talking about the Slap and John Mulaney joking about going to rehab, comedians are wise to consider Rahm Emanuel's famous political advice: Never let a good crisis go to waste. Minhaj split the difference. He did not linger on the story but dedicated a solid chunk of jokes to it that got one of the biggest responses of the night. There were moments when I even thought this scandal might be the best thing that ever happened to him.
For such a polished, assured comedian, getting your image scuffed up a bit can add a little more tension to your comedy. David Sedaris faced a similar media firestorm and very few even remember it. In his new act, Minhaj mocked how politicians treat him as a spokesman for his people. ("They think I'm the brown whisperer," he said.) The more nuanced critiques of his deceptions focused on the context of his work, firmly in "The Daily Show" tradition of blurring lines between silly comedy and grave journalism. The New Yorker article took some of that weight off him, shifting expectations.
It's notable that he released a 21-minute video defending himself and criticizing the New Yorker piece as misleading. (For a smart analysis that gets into the weeds on the issues, read Nadira Goffe from Slate.) Instead of downplaying the dust-up as he did onstage, he argued in the video that the New Yorker writer made him sound like "a psycho," and he even expressed a few notes of contrition, promising to be "more thoughtful" about blending fiction and nonfiction. In a way, he did this at the Beacon, drawing attention to his lies, teaching his audience how to read him.
Reactions to this article varied wildly. My least favorite was the popular genre of commenters who emerge after every scandal to pile on by saying, "I never liked their work anyway." It manages the feat of trivializing moral and artistic issues.
Yet the Minhaj controversy quietly opened a useful, long overdue discussion about truth in comedy that leverages nonfiction. More art than ever leans on the trust and authenticity of journalism, so it's good for performers to think about the peculiar bargain they have struck with their audience and how to navigate it. There is an endless number of funny ways to tip off a crowd to your level of honesty.
While I thought some of Minhaj's fabrications were unnecessary and wrongheaded, I never thought he was a "psycho." What I saw was a comic responding to the incentives of a culture that not only prefers its politics wrapped inside a personal emotional story, but also gives clout to dramatic displays of victimhood.
We live in a time when seemingly everyone, no matter how rich, famous or successful, is angling to play the victim. Elon Musk invites sympathy by telling us that a company refusing to advertise on his site is equivalent to blackmail. When even Taylor Swift says she was canceled in the Time magazine article announcing her as Person of the Year, you know that the ability to repackage yourself as the underdog is limitless.
As it happens, this provides an opening for jokes. In Leo Reich's cleverly self-aware new special, "Literally Who Cares?" (Max), the young comic spoofs this tendency. He begins by saying his show is sponsored by his dad, who runs an incredible small business you might have heard of named Deutsche Bank. By the end, he insists he's oppressed. "I read something recently that even if you haven't been oppressed, you can feel like you have and it triggers the same endorphins."
The comic artist currently tackling this theme best is the filmmaker Kristoffer Borgli, whose feature "Sick of Myself" introduced audiences to a character who intentionally takes pills to make herself physically ill, to gain attention and fame. Borgli's new movie, "Dream Scenario," is about a beta male professor played by Nicolas Cage accused by a colleague of "searching for the insult." In an outlandish twist, he starts showing up in people's dreams doing violent things, and fragile students freak out in a parody of delicate sensitivities. The professor sees himself as the real victim and is then tempted by the embrace of Joe Rogan, Jordan Peterson and, of course, the French. In other words, this movie is riffing on the most popular victim narrative of our moment: Cancel culture.
Thankfully, Minhaj doesn't go there, but he gets close. At one point in his show, he said the real divide in the country was not between rich and poor, Democratic or Republican, but between "the insane" and "the insufferable."
The insane include the people who stormed the capitol. He calls them nuts, before adding: "but fun." Then he grew more animated describing the insufferable by their "NPR tote-bag energy" and "hall monitor" tendencies. It was a head fake to The New Yorker article before a pivot to self-deprecation, poking fun at the time he corrected Ellen DeGeneres on her show for mispronouncing his name.
"What was I expecting?" he asked. "She's a billionaire who's best friends with Oprah. She's not a Sufi poet."
Minhaj is telling us that he was a member of the insufferable. A reformed one, perhaps? It repositions him less as a righteous political comic than a more self-questioning, personal comic, a move he had already begun to make; this scandal may have accelerated the shift.
His show concluded with a long bit about therapy and family, in which, deploying one of his characteristic dramatic pauses, followed by whispery voice close to the microphone, he confessed his real kink: Acceptance.

The Sensory Overload Is a Curious Matter: [Review]

Full text: "Stranger Things: The First Shadow," a London theater show based on the Netflix series, pummels the audience with sensory overload and its lavish budget.
As theatergoers took their seats, a buttery waft of popcorn in the auditorium was an indicator of what was to come. "Stranger Things: The First Shadow" -- a spinoff of the hit Netflix series, "Stranger Things" -- brings a high-octane, TV-movie sensibility to the stage, pummeling the audience with horror-show frights and sensory overload: eerie smoke effects, mind-boggling levitations, scary vocal distortions reminiscent of "The Exorcist" and noise -- so much noise.
Directed by Stephen Daldry ("Billy Elliot: The Musical"; "The Crown") and written by Kate Trefry and Jack Thorne in collaboration with the TV show's creators, the Duffer brothers, the show runs at the Phoenix Theater, in London, through Aug. 25, 2024. It's a gaudy, vertiginous fairground ride of a play, exactly what you'd expect from a show co-produced by Netflix: Cheap thrills, expensively made.
"Stranger Things: The First Shadow" is billed as a prequel to the Netflix series, which is set in the fictitious town of Hawkins, Ind., during the mid-1980s. The location is the same, but the year is 1959, and the play tells the origin story of Henry Creel, who appears as a malevolent sociopath in Season 4. We meet him here as a troubled, withdrawn adolescent (played with great aplomb by Louis McCartney) burdened with psychic, clairvoyant and telekinetic powers of unknown provenance.
Henry, a newcomer to Hawkins, strikes up a tentative friendship with another oddball, Patty Newby, played with a winning blend of naïve compassion and halting self-doubt by Ella Karuna Williams. The two youngsters bond over their shared, deeply uncool, love of comic books and, somewhat improbably, land the lead roles in their high-school musical. When several of its cast members find their household pets mysteriously killed, Henry appears to be implicated. His peers take it upon themselves to investigate, and stumble, "Blair Witch"-style, into a baroque nightmare.
Amid the horror, the play carries a sentimental message about young misfits finding solace and community. Patricia, an adoptee, never knew her mother ("My whole life I've been the girl from nowhere," she laments), and feels a kinship with Henry because he is misunderstood. He reassures her by pointing out that many of their favorite comic book characters are orphans: "Having no parents is basically a prerequisite to being a superhero." Similarly, Henry is desperate not to let his strange powers define him. (He insists: "I'm not a freak! I'm normal!")
In these respects the tale is redolent of Young Adult fiction, but the can-do vibes are served up with a bleak twist, since the odds -- as we know from Season 4 -- are stacked against Henry. A research scientist, Dr. Brenner (Patrick Vaill), ostensibly enlisted to help him, has nefarious motives; the influence of Henry's father, Victor (Michael Jibson), who has severe PTSD from World War II, is also a source of intrigue. All avenues lead, inexorably, to a big conspiracy involving a secret government program. The supporting cast comprise a panorama of recognizable social types -- dumb jocks, deadbeat boyfriends, vapid bimbos, oafish policemen -- whose antics provide light relief.
Miriam Buether's set evokes 1950s small-town life with a nostalgic, homey touch: a crescent of school locker rooms for the high school scenes, the community church and a local liquor store are elegantly rendered. Later on, a government psychiatric facility is a neon-lit, white brickwork affair, cold and clinical.
Some of the backdrops are staggeringly elaborate. The opening scene, depicting a nautical disaster, is like something from a Hollywood action movie. In keeping with this aesthetic, the sound, by Paul Arditti, is quite simply relentless. Thunderously loud crashing sounds occur with nerve-shredding frequency -- the "jump scare" technique beloved of horror movies. Henry's paranormal powers are obscurely connected to electromagnetic energy, so there are lots of buzzing electrical noises whenever he has one of his moments.
In its totality, the production is lavish to the point of embarrassment, and the sheer scale of the thing is hard to reconcile with the play's rather modest intellectual aspirations and lack of originality. One is left simultaneously impressed and a little bewildered. Haven't television and cinema already got these bases covered? Is this what theater is for?
"Stranger Things" first aired in 2016. It's over four years since Mike Hale suggested, in his Times review of Season 3, that the show might be suffering from "franchise fatigue." The original concept had a certain straightforward appeal -- weird goings-on in a backwoods town, sinister machinations of shady state agencies, sympathetic nerds getting a chance to shine -- but it was never quite strong enough to sustain serious longevity. The show powered on regardless, because there was money to be made.
"Stranger Things: The First Shadow" achieves what it sets out to do, and die-hard fans will surely lap it up -- but it may well prove to be a death throe. The real spectacle here is that of a franchise eating itself.

Full text: The S&P 500 rose 0.5 percent and the Nasdaq composite picked up 0.6 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average finished essentially flat after most of a 0.2 percent gain faded by late afternoon.
Retailers and big technology companies were among the big gainers. Amazon.com rose 2.7 percent and Etsy climbed 4.7 percent for the biggest gain among S&P 500 stocks.
Chipmaker Nvidia rose 2.4 percent, while Meta added 2.9 percent and Netflix closed 3 percent higher.
Energy companies also rallied as the price of crude oil jumped amid growing concerns about attacks from Iranian-backed Houthis on shipping in the Red Sea. Oil and natural gas giant BP has joined the growing list of companies that have halted shipments in the major trade route.
Valero Energy rose 2.6 percent and Marathon Petroleum added 2.3 percent.
U.S. Steel soared 26.1 percent after agreeing to be acquired by Japan's Nippon Steel. The Pittsburgh steel maker played a key role in the nation's industrialization. The all-cash deal is valued at about $ 14.1 billion, or $ 14.9 billion with debt. That's nearly double what was offered just four months ago by rival Cleveland Cliffs.
Investors had several other corporate buyout updates to review. Photoshop maker Adobe rose 2.5 percent following an announcement that it is terminating its planned $ 20 billion buyout of Figma. Door maker Masonite International fell 16 percent after saying it will buy PGT Innovations in a deal worth about $ 13 billion.
Treasury yields mostly rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.95 percent from 3.92 percent late Friday.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 21.37 points to 4,740.56. The Dow edged up 0.86 points to 37,306.02, and the Nasdaq gained 90.89 points to 14,904.81.
Markets in Europe finished mostly lower, while markets in Asia closed lower.
The broader market surged last week and added to solid December gains after the Federal Reserve signaled that inflation may have cooled enough for the central bank to shift to cutting interest rates in 2024. The Dow closed out last week with a record, while the S&P 500 ended the week with its longest weekly winning streak in six years, while edging closer to its all-time high.
The benchmark S&P 500 is now up more than 23 percent this year, while the Nasdaq is up more than 42 percent.
"The winning streak, plus the fact that the Fed has pivoted as inflation continues to fall, has kicked off kind of a momentum burst," said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Baird.
Lower interest rates typically take pressure off financial markets. The Fed's goal since 2022 has been to slow the economy and grind down prices for investments enough through high interest rates to get inflation under control. Economic growth has slowed, but has not dipped into recession, while inflation continues easing.
Wall Street is betting that those conditions mean the Fed is done raising interest rates and could start cutting them in early 2024. Investors will get their last big inflation update of the year on Friday when the government releases its report on personal consumption expenditures. It's the Fed's preferred measure of inflation and has been easing since the middle of 2022.
Analysts polled by FactSet expect the measure of inflation to soften to 2.8 percent in November from 3 percent in October. It was as high as 7.1 percent in June 2022.
Investors will also have a few big earnings reports to review this week, which could give them a better sense of how companies and consumers are faring amid high interest rates and lingering inflation. Package delivery service FedEx will report its latest financial results on Tuesday and Cheerios maker General Mills will report its results on Wednesday. Athletic footwear giant Nike will report its latest results on Thursday.

Full text: I'm a national correspondent for The Times, based in Atlanta. The backs of my reporter's notebooks are usually scribbled with people's suggestions for what to watch, listen to and read. Here are some things I've been into lately.
Son Rompe Pera
The Mexican passion for Colombian cumbia is one of the great love stories of the Americas, as I learned during my own love affair with Mexico City, where I used to be a correspondent. Son Rompe Pera, from the Mexico City suburb of Naucalpan, is the latest to infuse the genre with punk energy.
The Arab of the Future
The author-illustrator Riad Sattouf grew up splitting time between his mother's native France and the Middle East of his brilliant but troubled Pan-Arabist father. His tender, often hilarious autobiographical series, on par with Marjane Satrapi's landmark "Persepolis," captures the pain and wonder of childhood, and the ways cultural differences can sometimes prove irreconcilable.
Reign Supreme
This dramatic series is about the explosion of rap culture in France, and it reminds me how fluid rap's boundaries were in its earliest stages: In one scene, the protagonists gawk at Parisian break dancers plausibly getting down to "Vitamin C," the classic Krautrock track.
We Don't Know Ourselves
Fintan O'Toole's "Personal History of Modern Ireland" vividly evokes a country intent on reimagining itself on its own terms amid the gravitational forces of England and America. O'Toole infuses the story with intimate portraits, like a close-up of his sadistic grade-school teacher Hoppy, whose ability to freeze students in "a pure petrified dread" suggests that not all traditions are worth keeping.
Duncan Trussell Family Hour
Duncan Trussell, a stand-up comedian, is more of a free-jazz conversationalist whose long-running podcast mashes together psychedelic yammering, Buddhist wisdom, woo-woo West Coast guru culture and heaping plates of scatological word salad, often assembled in precarious Jenga-like towers of adjectives and adverbs that stretch toward the highest planes of consciousness. Sometimes he actually gets there.

'The Crown' Gets the Royal Family's Power Exactly Right: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The final six episodes of "The Crown" were released this week, bringing Peter Morgan's engrossing saga of the Windsors -- bookended by the marriages of Elizabeth and Philip in 1947 and Charles and Camilla in 2005 -- to an end. The Netflix series had all the appeal of a classic prime-time soap, and sure enough, tens of millions of people have tuned in, escaping reality to dwell for an hour in a bubble of fashion, money, gossip, intrigue and betrayal.
To many, escape is the whole point of royal watching -- which is why royal mania is so often dismissed as a frivolous distraction. The royals are no longer as powerful as when they oversaw the rise of modern Britain and its empire. But the world of the Windsors is still intimately, and sometimes painfully, connected to our own. In that sense, the saga of the royal family, as captured in "The Crown," offers supreme lessons in resilience, demonstrating that even the most traditional leaders can change with the times, relinquishing old roles to find new ways of exerting power and influence.
It may be easy to look at the monarchy today and assume its role is almost entirely ceremonial, but kings and queens -- and their extended families -- still exert tremendous social influence, especially as exemplars of morality. That was a role that King George III and his advisers pioneered way back in the 18th century when, to maintain their relevance, the royal family was expected to establish standards of proper behavior and stand by them. For better and worse, that expectation persists.
In the most favorable instances, royals have used this soft power to engage in cultural repair and provide moral leadership. Queen Victoria, for example, served as the first patron of the British Red Cross, helping to reform the kind of care received by those injured during conflicts. On the eve of World War II, King George VI met with Franklin D. Roosevelt in Hyde Park, N.Y. In eating hot dogs together, the king and president telegraphed Anglo-American solidarity in the face of rising fascism.
Over time, such stories have helped us understand that the actions of the royals affect not just their world but also our own, which may explain both our perpetual curiosity about the family and the intensity of our emotions as we litigate their choices. Many prestige cable shows have insightfully examined the dynamics of a marriage -- take Tony and Carmela Soprano, -- but when "The Crown" dissects Charles and Diana's doomed marriage, it is re-enacting a pivotal moment in history that informed how many modern couples think about marital obligation and what we owe our partners and ourselves.
The final season of "The Crown" -- and, in many ways, the modern story of the Windsors -- has been haunted by the ghost of Diana, a figure who perhaps understood this dynamic between perception and obligation better than anyone. We may remember Diana first for her outfits and her sudden renown but she went on to do humanitarian work that benefited AIDS patients, spoke openly about her bulimia, pursued solutions to homelessness and campaigned for land mine removal in Bosnia and Angola.
In different but no less powerful ways, King Charles III is currently trying to use his influence to help mitigate the impact of climate change. At the core of these efforts is an acknowledgment that, whatever their political role, royals can, and should, have consequence. But their actions also reflect a recognizable human urge to shape the world around us and take control of our circumstances. That's why we can see so much of ourselves in the royals when they strive for control -- and often fail to achieve it.
Of course, the royals can still seem clueless and out of touch. Take their halting and awkward attempts to reckon with the role their ancestors played in shoring up a brutal empire. Centuries ago, monarchs funded the slave trade and Queen Victoria and her descendants provided symbolic glue for the British Empire and Commonwealth realms. The royal family is still tethered to that imperial past. The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate, received significant public criticism during a 2022 royal tour of the Caribbean when some suggested they failed to adopt a sufficiently apologetic stance toward Britain's colonial past. King Charles fared better on his recent visit to Kenya by acknowledging Britain's violent response to the Mau Mau uprising in the 1950s. Even so, the royals are navigating what the British journalist Afua Hirsch described last year as "a clamoring chorus of global trauma" led by "those colonized in the name of the British crown."
But what history teaches us -- and "The Crown" artfully conveys -- is that the royal family can embrace change when forced to. The show has always been most successful when it's not just penetrating the royal bubble but puncturing it. Yes, we've followed the Windsors, but we've also entered the homes of the grieving mining families of Aberfan following the sudden collapse of a colliery spoil tip. We've observed the Bahamian-born valet Sydney Johnson lovingly care for the exiled Duke of Windsor. And in the final seasons we've watched the Egyptian businessman Mohamed al-Fayed and his son Dodi make tragic efforts to recast themselves as British elites. The exploits of the monarch are never just about the monarch. They are also, inevitably, about us. When the queen encounters her subjects, she often comes away changed. Though it could still be improved and modernized, the monarchy we see now, under King Charles, is a far cry from the one in 1947 captured on "The Crown" when it began.
We might thrill to be escorted inside Balmoral Castle and Buckingham Palace, where we keep close company with Queen Elizabeth II and her restless brood. There's certainly pleasure in listening in to the imagined private conversations of a queen so famously tight-lipped that her unofficial mantra was reportedly "Never complain, never explain." But all of these stories, from the young Elizabeth to Charles and Diana to William and Harry, have reverberated precisely because they offer more than simply voyeuristic escapism. They help us understand our world a little better -- and the way that we have shaped the royals' rarefied realm.

Full text: Jes Tom used to be obsessed with finding "the one" to ride out the end times with. Now, the comic is happy just talking about sex in front of strangers six nights a week.
The first thing to know about Jes Tom, a stand-up comedian who approaches the craft with a spirit of mischief, is that they "only say true things."
So when their roughly 75-minute set parcels out recollections of explaining glory holes to their mother, watching their polyamorous girlfriend get married on Twitch or discovering -- after four years on testosterone -- that they were newly into men, you would be forgiven for wondering how any one person's dating life could be so complex.
"I thought testosterone would turn me into a man, but it turned me into a twink," Tom, who is nonbinary, revealed to a cackling West Village audience last week at the Greenwich House Theater in Manhattan.
"Less Lonely," Tom's solo comedy show about their quest for love, sex and gender confirmation "at the end of the world," swerves between self-deprecation, vulnerability and shameless horniness. In the show, which opened on Monday, Tom takes their obsession with death and love and recalls the highs and lows of navigating relationships from their adolescence through their early 30s.
An earlier version of the show -- Tom has been developing and touring it for about two years now -- was "inspired by love and by being in love," they said. But what was once the final note is now, "like, a midpoint in the show."
"Since then, my life has changed over and over and over again, and the world has been changing," Tom said. "And so I've just been kind of building out and updating and trying to find what is the actual story of the show."
Tom, who is 33 and of half-Japanese and half-Chinese descent, said they knew they were queer from a young age. Growing up in San Francisco, a city with large L.G.B.T.Q. and Asian populations, they never felt underrepresented -- a disadvantage they managed to overcome.
"There's nothing worse for a queer teenager than a supportive environment," Tom joked onstage while wearing a vintage Yohji Yamamoto shirt, short black trousers from Asos and Gucci loafers. How will they ever forge an interesting personality?
On a video call, Tom went into detail about their fixation with death and an "apocalypse romance" -- their term for the theoretical person with whom you're going to ride out the end of days, a major preoccupation of the show. What began as a quest to find "the one," whether through monogamy, polyamory or other styles of dating, turned into a break from it altogether.
"From when I was 11 years old, I spent my entire life either being in a relationship or being so obsessed with the idea of getting into a relationship," they said. "Something in me changed; I stopped wanting to do that."
Now they are trying to focus on themselves, figure out who they are and what they need.
"I think it has to do with me realizing that I was kind of casting for a partner instead of necessarily dating people I had a real connection to," Tom said.
Tom moved to New York City after graduating from Smith College in 2013 and started doing comedy. In the years since, they have worked on shows like "Tuca & Bertie" and their own Instagram series, "Dear Jes," for Netflix. They were most recently a story editor on the second season of Max's "Our Flag Means Death."
For nonbinary people in comedy, navigating the industry still comes with challenges about their own identities. At the start of their performance, Tom offered a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer to the crowd, stating that although they are a trans person who likes to talk about sex, they aren't representative of all trans people, who often are stereotyped that way.
Later, Tom described being mindful of the possibility that their identity could be taken out of context, and potentially be weaponized against other trans people.
"I just wanted to outwardly acknowledge that," Tom said of their disclaimer during the show, "because I literally self-identify as a pervert."
They said that they felt a "burden of responsibility," being a marginalized person in the public eye. And while there are certainly other successful trans stand-up comics, there aren't a ton of them.
"I also just want to be like, this is not scary," Tom said. "Sex is not scary. And me talking about sex is not scary."
Through their onstage exploration of feelings of loneliness, different relationship dynamics, fears and jealousy, Tom comes to the conclusion that you don't need "the one" when the world is falling apart. You just need to find love wherever and however you can receive it.
"It's about transition. It's about change," they said.

New Challenges For Brave Poultry: [Review]

Full text: This sequel is in many respects a cover song, a repeat of the beats and characters of "Chicken Run."
Have you ever spent quality time with a chicken? I raised them as a teenager, and I do not particularly recommend it. They can be smelly and dirty. They're honestly not very bright. Yet they're like living cartoons, weird and funny to watch, with spindly little legs holding up plump little bodies. They cluck disapprovingly when you take their eggs, and they'll eat anything you dump in their yard (including, uh, chicken).
It's the species' natural slapstick that made them prime fodder for "Chicken Run," the 2000 runaway success, which was also Aardman Animations' first foray into feature-length stop-motion filmmaking. The studio had previously been best known for Wallace, a middle-aged inventor with a cheese addiction, and his silent but clever dog Gromit, who always helped him out of scrapes. In their chickens, though -- with close-set beady eyes and faces far more expressive than a real chicken's stolid look could ever be -- the studio located comic gold.
In "Chicken Run," the humans are the villains, especially Mrs. Tweedy, the cruel owner of a chicken farm where the detainees are eventually made into pies. (The film's creative team have said it started as a spoof of the 1963 adventure film "The Great Escape.") The chickens wish to remain outside the confines of pastry and, ideally, get away from horrible Mrs. Tweedy and her horrible meek husband altogether. (He is certain the chickens are organizing, but she ignores him.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
At the end of that film, the chickens escape, a caper led by an intrepid red hen named Ginger. The start of "Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget," a sequel over two decades in the making, retells the escape story quickly -- for the benefit of the viewer as much as an egg, the soon-to-be-hatched offspring of Rocky the Rooster (voiced by Zachary Levi, replacing Mel Gibson) and Ginger (Thandiwe Newton, replacing Julia Sawalha). It's been a while since the daring escape, and the chickens are living on an island paradise, knitting and making jam and telling war stories and doing whatever else a stop-motion chicken might wish to do with total freedom from fear. No pies are in sight. No Tweedy menaces. "I think it's time to put the past behind us," Ginger tells Rocky, and as their newly hatched little chick Molly grows, they decide not to tell her about their life back at the farm. The only link to the mainland is Nick and Fetcher, the pair of scavenging rats who arrive with a load of "quality old junk" every month.
Yet of course, Molly wants to know what's on the other side of the water, setting off a caper with strong overtones (including the musical sort) of "Mission: Impossible," sprinkled with some references to Bond villains, "The Truman Show," "The Stepford Wives" and probably some other movies I missed. "Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget," directed by the Aardman stalwart Sam Fell, is in many respects a cover song, a repeat of the beats and characters of "Chicken Run." But when the source material was so fun, the cover is bound to be enjoyable, and this one is, even if it sags a little around the two-thirds mark. There's punning, and contraptions, and ducks that shoot lasers out of their eyes. It's a good time.
The film can be read, without stretching, as a broadside against factory farming (or maybe eating chickens generally), as well as an existential examination of the nature of freedom. But what might be most interesting about "Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget" is how it echoes a theme of many animated films for children, everything from "Finding Nemo" to "Elemental": the overprotective parent who needs to calm down and let their kid have an adventure. Since plenty of these films are the product of people with children of their own, there's probably a little self-exhorting going on. As memes and social researchers attest, children today have far less freedom to roam about their neighborhoods than the youngsters of, say, "Stranger Things." The insistent recurrence of the theme suggests, at minimum, a culture-wide anxiety, the kind that will be hard for observers in the future to miss.
But then, this is a movie about chickens, and togetherness, and about not leaving anyone behind, and also about a paradise for fowl on an island where they can build their own little thatched houses and knit their own little bicycles. Its lessons are gentle, its comedy endearing. These chickens, at least, are a pleasure to be around.
Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget
Rated PG. Running time: 1 hour 41 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

Zombie TV Has Come for Cable: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Many of the most popular channels have largely ditched original dramas and comedies, morphing into vessels for endless reruns.
In 2015, the USA cable network was a force in original programming. Dramas like "Suits," "Mr. Robot" and "Royal Pains" either won awards or attracted big audiences.
What a difference a few years make.
Viewership is way down, and USA's stand-alone original programming department is gone. The channel has had just one original scripted show this year, and it is not exclusive to the network -- it also airs on another channel. During one 46-hour stretch last week, USA showed repeats of NBC's "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit" for all but two hours, when it showed reruns of CBS's "NCIS" and "NCIS: Los Angeles."
Instead of standing out among its peers, USA is emblematic of cable television's transformation. Many of the most popular channels -- TBS, Comedy Central, MTV -- have quickly morphed into zombie versions of their former selves.
Networks that were once rich with original scripted programming are now vessels for endless marathons of reruns, along with occasional reality shows and live sports. While the network call letters and logos are the same as before, that is effectively where the overlap stops.
The transformation could accelerate even more, remaking the cable landscape. Advertisers have begun to pull money from cable at high rates, analysts say, and leaders at cable providers have started to question what their consumers are paying for. In a dispute with Disney this year, executives who oversee the Spectrum cable service said media companies were letting their cable "programming house burn to the ground."
"It's kind of like when you drive by a store and you can see they're not keeping it up, and it looks kind of sad," said Linda Ong, a consultant who works with many entertainment companies and used to run marketing at the Oxygen cable network. "It feels like they don't have the attention. And they don't -- they're being stripped for parts."
The media companies that own the channels are in a bind. The so-called cable bundle was enormously profitable for media companies, and more than 100 million households subscribed at the peak. But subscribers are rapidly declining as people migrate toward streaming.
Now roughly 70 million households subscribe to cable. As a result, most media companies are pulling resources from their individual cable networks and directing investment toward their streaming services. Peacock, which is owned by NBCUniversal, the same parent of USA, has begun making more and more original scripted shows over the last three years.
However, most streaming services are hemorrhaging cash. (An NBCUniversal executive said this week that Peacock would lose $ 2.8 billion this year.) Cable, though it is getting smaller, remains profitable.
Now, some industry insiders and analysts are questioning whether executives shifted too quickly and are limiting future revenue from distributors and advertisers.
"Unfortunately, they're killing the golden goose," Michael Nathanson, a media analyst, said of entertainment companies and the cable bundle. "Yes, maybe this demise was inevitable. But by putting more and more content in streaming, there's literally nothing on cable."
In 2015, there were at least 214 original scripted programs on premium and basic cable, according to programming records analyzed by The New York Times. By last year, that figure had fallen 39 percent, and it has fallen even more this year -- partly, perhaps, because of the monthslong writers' and actors' strikes.
In 2015, TBS and TNT aired 17 scripted shows. This year, it has a total of three series, according to the records. Cable networks like Comedy Central, Freeform, A&E, History, MTV and Lifetime also air far fewer scripted programs.
Reruns are filling the hole. On a recent weekday, TBS played shows like "Friends," "The Big Bang Theory," "Modern Family" and "Young Sheldon." Over at Comedy Central, there were "The Office" and "Seinfeld." MTV had 20 consecutive hours of "Catfish: The TV Show."
Cable executives say they have made programming moves that fit better in a diminished cable landscape -- and, in many cases, cost less to produce.
A spokeswoman for NBCUniversal said USA had moved investment from scripted programming toward unscripted programming, library rights and sports. The channel's live sports coverage includes the Premier League, NASCAR and Olympic events. Professional wrestling remains a backbone of the network, as it has been for many years.
Ratings in prime time are enough to keep USA as the No. 3 cable entertainment network, the spokeswoman said. She also noted that NBCUniversal did not sell advertising exclusively for USA but across many of the company's brands.
A spokeswoman for TBS and TNT, two other top cable channels, pointed to the release of the second season of a British drama, "The Lazarus Project." She said TBS and TNT offered various other scripted options for viewers, noting hits that were originally made for other channels, like "The Big Bang Theory," "Friends" and "Modern Family."
There are some exceptions among cable channels. Bravo, another NBCUniversal property and the home of the "Housewives" franchise, "Vanderpump Rules" and "Below Deck," remains a culturally relevant force that has spawned a popular in-person annual convention: BravoCon. The Hallmark Channel has laid claim to the holiday season, spitting out one Christmas movie after the next, and has scored strong ratings. (Hallmark and Bravo shows also appear on Peacock.) The Paramount cable network was able to release a bona fide hit in recent years with "Yellowstone."
But more common are the lineups at channels like USA. The original nonsports programming comes largely in the form of reality shows. This year's programs include a celebrity bar-themed game show, "Barmageddon," and a competition show, "Race to Survive: Alaska."
It's quite a departure from the upbeat, procedural programming that once defined the network -- and the brand. Series like "Monk" and "Suits" were part of a strategy that included as many as 10 original scripted shows per year. ("Suits" has since found new life, setting streaming records this year on Netflix.)
Ms. Ong, the consultant and chief executive of Cultique, which advises entertainment companies, said she had recently visited the USA website. There was no mention of "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit" or "9-1-1" or "Shark Tank" or other network repeats that populate the network's lineup day to day. There were, however, banners for some of the reality shows on USA, programs on Peacock and NBC, and other shows from cable networks like CNBC and Telemundo. The mishmash was reflective of the current state of the network.
"USA doesn't have value beyond a television set right now," Ms. Ong said. "There are some brands that have value beyond their existence as a linear network -- Bravo has that. USA doesn't."
Mr. Nathanson, the media analyst, said that could spell trouble. Even as cord-cutting accelerated in recent years, advertisers mostly stuck with the cable networks. But last year, he said, was finally a "tipping point" -- when advertisers began to look askance at nonsports cable programming.
Cable advertising revenue has decreased by double-digit percentages for five consecutive financial quarters, Mr. Nathanson said. He said he had never seen that outside a recession.
"Advertisers are starting to realize that there's really nothing on here and they shouldn't pay for it," he said.

Lionel Dahmer, 87, Who Agonized About Having Raised a Serial Killer: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The father of Jeffrey Dahmer, he wrote a memoir that one reviewer said sought to "peer not just into the soul of his son but into his own."
Lionel Dahmer, the father of the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer and the author of a haunting memoir about his son's youth, died on Dec. 5 in Medina, Ohio. He was 87.
His death, at a hospice facility, was confirmed by Jeb Muller, one of his caregivers. Mr. Dahmer had suffered a series of heart attacks in recent years, and his health declined after the death of his wife, Shari Dahmer, in January, Mr. Muller said.
Lionel Dahmer was a little-known, personally reserved industrial chemist before the Dahmer name, thanks to his son, became one of the most notorious in the nation.
In 1991, Jeffrey Dahmer confessed to killing and raping 17 young men and boys over the previous 13 years. He drugged men's drinks, strangled them, masturbated on their corpses, cut them up with a buzz saw and lined their skulls up in his apartment. He ate some of their body parts.
The entertainment industry has found that his macabre tale sells. Among other television and film projects, Netflix last year released the mini-series "Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story," which has surpassed a billion hours in viewing time.
Biographical accounts of Jeffrey's life focus on the violation of essential human taboos -- gratifying desire at the outer limits of evil. Jurors at his trial engaged in a tortured deliberation before concluding that he was sane, and that he was therefore eligible to spend life in prison. He was sentenced to 15 life terms.
Lionel's life, as recounted in his 1994 memoir, "A Father's Story," offered an indirect view into that depravity -- not the thing itself but a rational mind struggling to make sense of it.
Lionel sought to "peer not just into the soul of his son but into his own," the British author Will Self wrote in The New York Times Book Review. "Throughout, the sense of someone constitutionally ill-equipped for introspection of any kind groping toward a vile realization is gripping."
Mr. Dahmer described himself in his book as "almost totally analytical" -- a chemist, comforted by the scientific predictability of his work, whose emotional life resembled a "broad, flat plain."
Yet he wrote vividly about the uncanniness of seeing Jeffrey's face, which looked so much like his own, staring at him from the front page of a newspaper, and about revisiting old memories.
"As I recall him in his infancy, I feel overwhelmed by a sense of helpless dread," Mr. Dahmer wrote. "I dwell on the small, pink hands, and in my mind I watch them grow larger and darker as I think about all that they will later do, of how stained they will become with the blood of others."
Lionel Herbert Dahmer was born on July 29, 1936, in the suburbs of Milwaukee, where he grew up. His mother, Catherine (Hughes) Dahmer, taught history at an elementary school, and his father, Herbert, taught elementary school math while holding down a second job as a barber.
After attending college at the University of Wisconsin, he became a graduate student in chemistry, earning a master's degree in the subject at Marquette University and, in 1966, a Ph.D. from Iowa State University.
He married Joyce Flint, a telephone operator who had recently become a teletype machine instructor, in 1959.
She became pregnant days after the wedding. The coming months were a kind of ill omen.
Joyce Dahmer suffered from seizures and emotional fits. Her legs locked into place, she trembled, her jaw jerked to the right and became frighteningly rigid, and she foamed at the mouth. Sometimes the episodes would end only when a doctor injected her with barbiturates and morphine. She took as many as 26 pills a day.
Mr. Dahmer responded by retreating into his work, spending almost all his time at his chemistry lab.
When the couple saw each other, they fought bitterly.
Jeffrey's birth in 1960 brought about a period of happiness. But the Dahmers never got past the mistrust and alienation that had already set in. During fights, Ms. Dahmer would sometimes pick up a kitchen knife and make jabbing motions. She once left home in her nightgown, walked a few blocks away, entered a field of high grass and lay down.
They divorced in the summer of 1978. Mr. Dahmer married Shari Jordan at the end of the year.
Mr. Dahmer described Jeffrey in his infancy as bubbly and likable. When Mr. Dahmer got home from work, the boy would jump into his arms.
He noticed Jeffrey beginning to become withdrawn after a hernia caused a bulge in his scrotum, leading to surgery. After the birth of the couple's second child, David, Jeffrey adopted an attitude of passivity to hide his emotions, his father wrote.
For years Mr. Dahmer, busy in his laboratory, did not see any reason to get more involved in Jeffrey's life. He was aware that his son was intensely, problematically awkward; but he recalled feeling that way, too, when he was young. Mr. Dahmer had the fond sense, he wrote, that Jeffrey's problems could also be seen as indications that father and son were alike.
He learned only years later that Jeffrey had become an alcoholic as a teenager, when the family lived in Bath, a suburb of Akron. Jeffrey would spent his free time roaming around looking for animal remains to inter in his own private cemetery. He stripped the flesh from the bones of roadkill. He mounted a dog's head on a stake.
Reflecting on his son's youth, Mr. Dahmer realized that Jeffrey had become completely isolated. And that, Mr. Dahmer came to think, was the source of his son's necrophilia.
"He was becoming so afraid of other people, so intimidated by their presence, that in order for him to have contact with them, they needed to be dead," Mr. Dahmer wrote.
Jeffrey Dahmer was killed in a Wisconsin prison in 1994.
Mr. Dahmer is survived by a sister, Eunice Roberts; his son David; and two grandchildren. In recent decades, he and his second wife had lived in Seville, a small northern Ohio town outside Medina.
In September, Fox News's streaming service, Fox Nation, released its own Dahmer mini-series, "My Son Jeffrey," which included family home movies and recorded conversations between Lionel and Jeffrey from visits Lionel made to Jeffrey in prison.
Mr. Muller said that Mr. Dahmer was not involved in the recent TV projects about his son. A few years ago, a flood in Mr. Dahmer's basement prompted him to ask Mr. Muller to throw out or burn artifacts of Jeffrey's life, including a set of Jeffrey's cutlery, an old locker and records of his prison commissary purchases.
Lionel made sure to dispose of one thing himself.
He brought a box to a field on the property around his home, opened it and removed from it an urn that had been sent to him by the prison that had housed Jeffrey. He then removed a bag from the urn and waved it around. Jeffrey's ashes poured out. He said aloud that he hoped Jeffrey would find a resting place.

Zombie TV Has Come for Cable

Full text: Enlarge this image.
In 2015, the USA cable network was a force in original programming. Dramas like “Suits,” “Mr. Robot” and “Royal Pains” either won awards or attracted big audiences.
What a difference a few years make.
Viewership is way down, and USA’s stand-alone original programming department is gone. The channel has had just one original scripted show this year, and it is not exclusive to the network — it also airs on another channel. During one 46-hour stretch last week, USA showed repeats of NBC’s “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” for all but two hours, when it showed reruns of CBS’ “NCIS” and “NCIS: Los Angeles.”
Instead of standing out among its peers, USA is emblematic of cable television’s transformation. Many of the most popular channels — TBS, Comedy Central, MTV — have quickly morphed into zombie versions of their former selves.
Networks that were once rich with original scripted programming are now vessels for endless marathons of reruns, along with occasional reality shows and live sports. While the network call letters and logos are the same as before, that is effectively where the overlap stops.
The transformation could accelerate even more, remaking the cable landscape. Advertisers have begun to pull money from cable at high rates, analysts say, and leaders at cable providers have started to question what their consumers are paying for. In a dispute with Disney this year, executives who oversee the Spectrum cable service said media companies were letting their cable “programming house burn to the ground.”
“It’s kind of like when you drive by a store and you can see they’re not keeping it up, and it looks kind of sad,” said Linda Ong, a consultant who works with many entertainment companies and used to run marketing at the Oxygen cable network. “It feels like they don’t have the attention. And they don’t — they’re being stripped for parts.”
The media companies that own the channels are in a bind. The so-called cable bundle was enormously profitable for media companies, and more than 100 million households subscribed at the peak. But subscribers are rapidly declining as people migrate toward streaming.
Now roughly 70 million households subscribe to cable. As a result, most media companies are pulling resources from their individual cable networks and directing investment toward their streaming services. Peacock, which is owned by NBCUniversal, also the parent of USA, has begun making more and more original scripted shows over the last three years.
However, most streaming services are hemorrhaging cash. (An NBCUniversal executive said this week that Peacock would lose $2.8 billion this year.) Cable, although it is getting smaller, remains profitable.
Now, some industry insiders and analysts are questioning whether executives shifted too quickly and are limiting future revenue from distributors and advertisers.
“Unfortunately, they’re killing the golden goose,” Michael Nathanson, a media analyst, said of entertainment companies and the cable bundle. “Yes, maybe this demise was inevitable. But by putting more and more content in streaming, there’s literally nothing on cable.”
In 2015, there were at least 214 original scripted programs on premium and basic cable, according to programming records analyzed by The New York Times. By last year, that figure had fallen 39%, and it has fallen even more this year — partly, perhaps, because of the monthslong writers’ and actors’ strikes.
In 2015, TBS and TNT aired 17 scripted shows. This year, that’s down to a total of three, according to records. Cable networks including Comedy Central, Freeform, A&E, History, MTV and Lifetime also air far fewer scripted programs.
Reruns are filling the hole. On a recent weekday, TBS played shows including “Friends,” “The Big Bang Theory,” “Modern Family” and “Young Sheldon.” Over at Comedy Central were “The Office” and “Seinfeld.” MTV had 20 consecutive hours of “Catfish: The TV Show.”
Cable executives say they have made programming moves that fit better in a diminished cable landscape — and, in many cases, cost less to produce.
A spokesperson for NBCUniversal said USA had moved investment from scripted programming toward unscripted programming, library rights and sports. The channel’s live sports coverage includes the Premier League, NASCAR and Olympic events. Professional wrestling remains a backbone of the network, as it has been for many years.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The "people" on this list -- who are presented in no particular order -- reflect the ways that the Styles desk defines its coverage: high and low; fun and serious; curious and open-minded; reveling in characters; appreciating the material world; inviting everyone to the party.
Many were recognized for being Styles-ish, others for being stylish. (Several could not have done it without the help of stylists, costume designers and other crews.) Lots came from the worlds of politics, film, TV, music, sports and fashion. But a few caught our attention in less expected places, like courtrooms.
Some had great hair. Some had singular accessories. One person had both -- and was mistaken for a duchess in disguise. Certain people might surprise you or (we hope) inspire heated debate. After all, one thing they had in common is they made us talk: about what we wear, how we live and how we express ourselves.
Michelle Yeoh
The actress made history at the Oscars, became a face of Balenciaga and stood out on every red carpet.
Beyoncé
Her wardrobe for the Renaissance tour featured almost an entire season's worth of couture looks.
Phoebe Philo
Six years after leaving Celine, fashion's prodigal daughter returned with a namesake brand sold only online. Fans lost their minds, some over what they felt were high prices.
Frances Tiafoe
Big Foe, as the tennis player is known, scored big style points when he played the Australian Open in his colorful lava-lamp-like kit.
P.J. and Josie in 'Bottoms'
P.J., played by Rachel Sennott, and Josie, played by Ayo Edebiri, helped to usher in a rugby shirt renaissance.
NewJeans
With a sound inspired by late '90s and early 2000s R&B, the bunny-ears-wearing members of NewJeans climbed to the top of Billboard charts and earned various distinctions -- including being the first female K-pop act to play Lollapalooza.
Representative Patrick McHenry of North Carolina
A silver lining of watching the many House speaker votes? Seeing the outgoing Republican congressman's various bow ties.
Jeff Bezos' Schooner
When the boat set sail, many started to see Lauren Sánchez, the former news anchor who became engaged to the Amazon founder in May, in its figurehead. In an interview with Vogue, she denied it was her likeness, suggesting that if the figurehead were inspired by her, it would have bigger breasts.
Travis Kelce
Proximity to a certain pop star has made the Kansas City Chiefs tight end a household name -- and a desirable billboard for labels like KidSuper.
Doja Cat
The singer and rapper has made an art form of altering her image, using prosthetics (and an Oscar de la Renta gown) to evoke Karl Lagerfeld's cat at the Met Gala and covering herself in ruby crystals to complete her fiery look at a Schiaparelli couture show.
Dylan Mulvaney
The transgender influencer did not let critics of her Bud Light campaign stop her from gracing red carpets at events like the Tony Awards, where she sparkled in a semi-sheer gown.
Pharrell Williams
Since taking over men's wear at Louis Vuitton, he has tapped (a pregnant) Rihanna for an ad campaign and has designed a $ 1 million handbag.
Gwyneth Paltrow
Perhaps the only thing more talked about than her clothes at her ski crash trial were her courtroom quips, like "Well, I lost half a day of skiing," which inspired a wave of T-shirts and other merchandise.
The Sphere
Las Vegas's new arena has become the biggest visual spectacle in a city full of them.
Alan Cumming in 'The Traitors'
As host of the murderous reality TV competition, the actor gave a master class in men's wear.
Lauryn Hill
Her tour celebrating the 25th anniversary of her album "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" treated fans to nostalgia and some pretty neat costumes.
Paul Mescal
His commitment to -- and command of -- the mullet was remarkable.
The Ludicrously Capacious Bag in 'Succession'
As Tom Wambsgans said in the show: "What's even in there, huh? Flat shoes for the subway? Her lunch pail? I mean ... it's monstrous. It's gargantuan. You could take it camping. You could slide it across the floor after a bank job."
Jacob Elordi
Onscreen and off, the actor has surprised people with his accessories (that eyebrow piercing in "Saltburn") and lack thereof (walking barefoot in Los Angeles). But his best accessorizing by far has been with handbags big and small.
State Representative Justin Jones of Tennessee
The Democratic lawmaker's white suit became a potent political symbol when he was briefly expelled from the Tennessee legislature over a protest for gun control.
Lily Gladstone
On red carpets, the breakout star of "Killers of the Flower Moon" has a knack for mixing luxury fashion with pieces from independent and Native American designers.
M3GAN in 'M3GAN'
The twisted doll had a killer outfit.
Greta Lee
The "Past Lives" actress dresses with a fearlessness that makes fashion fun. Her return to red carpets was among the many benefits of ending the actors' union strike.
King Charles III
He finally got to wear St. Edward's Crown.
Ice Spice
The rapper known for her red Afro was the inspiration for a diamond necklace, a drink at Dunkin' and lots of Halloween costumes.
Maggie Smith
Her Loewe campaign was one the fashion world didn't know it needed.
The A.I. Pope
Few of the artificially generated images that have flooded social media feeds were as fly as the rendering of Pope Francis in that puffer.
Jenna Lyons
If nothing else, the "Real Housewives of New York City" reboot was a platform to remind people how well she executes high-low style.
Jerrod Carmichael
Remember how many great outfits the comedian wore as host of the Golden Globes?
Prince Hussein and Princess Rajwa of Jordan
There was a lot of fashion at their royal wedding, but the bride and groom might have dressed the best.
Law Roach
He quit styling A-list celebrities. Or did he? Either way, he garnered a ton of attention for a job that's mostly behind the scenes.
Kristen Kish
She's the new host of "Top Chef," which hopefully means more opportunities to see her in top-notch tailoring.
Jimmy Butler
After the Miami Heat lost the N.B.A. championship, the forward kicked off a new season with a new (temporary) emo look that included facial piercings, black nail polish and 2007-era Pete Wentz hair.
Gaurav Gupta
The Indian couturier, who started his line some 20 years ago, was invited to show at Paris Couture Week for the first time. He also made the atmospheric blue gown Cardi B wore to the Grammys.
Troye Sivan
The capstone of his stylish year? When Timothée Chalamet and the band boygenius replicated a look from the singer's "Got Me Started" video -- a tight white tank, baggy blue pants and red undies -- on "Saturday Night Live."
Mark Zuckerberg
He bulked up. And he might have agreed to a cage match with Elon Musk?
Ariana Madix
The "Vanderpump Rules" cast member came out of "Scandoval" with a cover of Glamour -- and possibly looking better than ever.
Amy Lau in 'Beef'
As Amy, played by Ali Wong, unraveled, her changing hair and wardrobe perfectly captured her emotional state.
Karl Jenkins

Pamela, played by Carey Mulligan, had the clothes of Moira Rose and the hair of Grace Coddington.
Coco Gauff
The U.S. Open champion's electric separates at the tennis tournament were almost as exhilarating as her performance on the court.
Taylor Swift
Chances are she got someone you know to start wearing friendship bracelets or Kansas City Chiefs gear.
Rihanna
Though she's still keeping fans waiting for a new album, she did deliver an epic performance at the Super Bowl halftime show, where she revealed her second pregnancy while wearing a red Loewe jumpsuit, replicas of which the brand later sold -- and quickly sold out of.
The 71 entries on this list were chosen from an initial pool of some 250 submitted by Styles staff members. The larger pool was winnowed in meetings and video calls that were not without passionate debate. To those who did not make the cut, 2024 is just a few weeks away -- and we'll be watching.

Full text: For our critic-at-large, the year was marked by the Black excellence of "Purlie Victorious," the brutality of "Bottoms" and rage of "Beef."
For me, 2023 was a year of entertainment that captured people pushed to their emotional limits, whether that was the rage of two bitter enemies, the desperation of a widow who only sees a future of annihilation or the pent-up aggression of a bunch of high school girls. But it was also a year of colorful, funny and biting Black stories on stages. Throw in a dancing goth, a freshly single New York City fashionista and a chronicle of a dying band, and you've got my top picks for everything that tickled my fancy in the past year across theater, film and TV.
'Swing State'
Call me a masochist, but what I most loved about Rebecca Gilman's devastating play was that it tapped into multiple registers of despair: individual, communal, ecological. Peg, a widow living on a prairie in Wisconsin, is nursing concerns about endangered animals and environmental catastrophe, and how everything is leading us to an uninhabitable planet. But alongside Peg's global anxieties are a host of much more intimate sorrows -- grief for her husband, a sense of hopelessness, and isolation -- that are driving her to consider suicide. Gilman's script offers black humor, suspense and a crushing ending. And the empathetic direction, by Robert Falls, of a stellar cast led by Mary Beth Fisher and Bubba Weiler, provides a sense of existential urgency to every minute. (Read our review of "Swing State.")
'Purlie Victorious'
At the end of this Ossie Davis play, our hero, Purlie Victorious (a larger-than-life Leslie Odom Jr.), heartily declares, "I find, in being Black, a thing of beauty: a joy, a strength, a secret cup of gladness." I nearly cried at this ecstatic celebration of Blackness, because this Broadway production, cleverly directed by Kenny Leon, was itself a prime example of Black excellence. As hilarious as it is biting, "Purlie Victorious" follows Purlie's scheme to reclaim the inheritance owed to his family in the Jim Crow South. Kara Young, as Purlie's love interest -- the uniquely named Lutiebelle Gussie Mae Jenkins -- proves she can carry off a fearless comedic performance on par with her dramatic roles. (Read our review of "Purlie Victorious.")
'Jaja's African Hair Braiding'
Even if the hairstyles in this play weren't as fabulous as they were, Jocelyn Bioh's "Jaja's African Hair Braiding," about a day in the life of African immigrants working in a Harlem hair-braiding shop, would still be a sparkling Broadway delight. That's thanks to Bioh's colorful characters and brisk, playful dialogue. Whitney White's direction provided extra spark, and the production's re-creation of real braid hairstyles and salon culture felt novel; it's not often that Black spaces are so lovingly portrayed, or portrayed at all, on Broadway. (Read our review of "Jaja's African Hair Braiding.")
'Stereophonic'
Earlier this year, after guiltily binging the soapy Amazon Prime series "Daisy Jones & the Six," I wondered what a better version of this narrative -- the band drama full of drugs, sex and music that's kinda-but-not-really about Fleetwood Mac -- would look like. I didn't know until I saw David Adjmi's "Stereophonic," which kept me fully engaged through its full three-hour running time. The central band's journey to celebrity then collapse, the addictions, the toxic relationships -- the bones of the material are the same, but "Stereophonic" is unique in the way it uses music to do some of the storytelling. Entirely diegetic, the songs aren't used for exposition or ornamentation; they exist as products in themselves, which we hear in different incarnations, in different parts, sometimes several times before we hear the final version. We learn about the characters through the parts they play in making and performing this music -- which, by the way, is amazing, and written by Will Butler, formerly of Arcade Fire. The cast is flawless, and the production is so meticulously composed, including David Zinn's stunning set and Ryan Rumery's explosive sound design, that it feels like you're actually being ushered into this world of Billboard hits, giant bags of cocaine and ego-driven rock stars. I can't wait to see it again. (Read our review of "Stereophonic.")
'Flex'
There are a lot of reasons I liked this Lincoln Center Theater production about a high school basketball team, but one of them was, to my surprise, more a feat of athleticism than of drama. Throughout the performance I went to, Starra, the team's talented, headstrong captain played by Erica Matthews, never missed a shot to the basket set above the stage at the Mitzi E. Newhouse. A story about the clash of beliefs, personalities, priorities and ambitions among these girls in lower-class, rural Arkansas, "Flex" was a win in all respects, from Candrice Jones's engaging script to Lileana Blain-Cruz's dynamic direction to the strong cast. I'm no fan of team sports, and in any other context would find taking the role of basketball spectator tedious; but, even if for only two hours, "Flex" transformed me into a fan. (Read our review of "Flex.")
'Bottoms'
I loved the chaos of this weird, perversely satisfying film about two unpopular high school students who start a girls' fight club with the ultimate goal of losing their virginity. Rachel Sennott, who delivered a panic-inducing performance in "Shiva Baby," plays the similarly unstable and unpredictable PJ, opposite Ayo Edebiri's adorably dweeby Josie. "Bottoms" has a brutal sense of humor that gleefully spirals into a violent finale I won't forget anytime soon. (Read our review of "Bottoms.")
'Beef'
The only reason I didn't ravenously consume this phenomenal Netflix series in one go was that "Beef" was so effective in its storytelling, performances and direction that every episode felt staggering, but in the best way. It would have been so easy for this series, about the way rage rips apart and connects the lives of two unhappy strangers (played by Ali Wong and Steven Yeun), to stay in one lane and offer us 10 straight-up comedic episodes of steadily escalating acts of sabotage and retribution. But "Beef" also offers up pathos and humanity, getting to the brokenness underneath its characters' rage without forgiving or dismissing their most heinous actions. Wong and Yeun are stellar in every scene, and beautifully navigate the chaotic turns of the script. (Read our review of "Beef.")
'Primary Trust'
A story about a grown man named Kenneth (William Jackson Harper) with no family living a quaint, routine small-town life with his imaginary best friend, "Primary Trust" was one of those shows that left me practically clutching my chest with feeling by the end. Harper delivered one of the finest, most exacting performances I saw this year; his Kenneth was delicate but not fragile. A contemporary fable about alienation, loneliness and facing the wild unknowns of adult life, "Primary Trust" felt cathartic, especially given how quarantines and six-foot distances changed many people's understanding of isolation. (Read our review of "Primary Trust.")
'Survival of the Thickest'
The actress-comedian Michelle Buteau has so much charm that it seems to radiate from the TV. She exudes a playful energy and has a deep pocket of grand, larger-than-life facial reactions that serve punchlines without her even saying a word. So watching "Survival of the Thickest," her bright, stylish confection of a sitcom on Netflix, feels like a soul-affirming treat. Buteau stars as Mavis Beaumont, a personal stylist forced to re-evaluate her relationship, home and career when she catches her longtime boyfriend cheating. Mavis starts at square one, moving into a tiny apartment with an eccentric New York City roommate and building her brand from the ground up. A little awkward, a bit misguided but full of heart, brains, talent and personality -- and also, let's not forget, style -- Mavis is infinitely relatable, and, importantly, a Black full-figured heroine with supportive and snarky Black friends. In other words, she feels real.
'Wednesday'
When it comes to gothic, sexy teen revamps of old franchises, like "Riverdale" and "Chilling Adventures of Sabrina," I'm often turned off by the baroque plots, aesthetic preening and self-conscious ... well, adolescence of it all. "Wednesday" is a delightful exception, in part because the Addams daughter did goth before it was cool. (And it doesn't hurt that the director, Tim Burton, has been the goth king of filmmaking for decades.) The show strikes the perfect balance between juicy teen dramedy and ghoulish supernatural thriller, with Jenna Ortega starring as the ever-dour and ever-surprising young mistress of darkness. Her performance delivers flashes of color behind Wednesday's signature dead eyes and deadpan mannerisms; she manages to carry off a character with a sociopathic disconnect from the world around her and yet still make her the charming antiheroine. And I'm still waiting for anything to come along that I enjoyed as much as Wednesday's dance in Episode 4. (Read our review of "Wednesday.")

From Legoland to the Thrill Ride of 'The Crown': [Style Desk]

Full text: When Meg Bellamy got the call that would change her life -- the one telling her that after months of auditions, it was she, among thousands of hopefuls, who would play Kate Middleton in the final season of "The Crown" -- she was already standing in the shadow of Windsor Castle. But she wasn't looking the part of a royal just yet.
"I was crouched in costume among the bin lorries of a delivery car park at Legoland," Ms. Bellamy, 21, said at a London hotel suite last month. "Until that point, my most regular acting gig had been playing a red plastic brick."
In 2022, and with no professional acting experience, she was working as a performer at the theme park when she spotted a casting call on Twitter for the role of Kate Middleton. Competition to play one of the most famous women in the world during her college years was fierce. Thousands of young actresses were posting videos about their auditions. But after a neighbor remarked on her resemblance to Britain's future queen, Ms. Bellamy, crushed after several drama school rejections, decided to try out for the part. Three weeks after sending a tape, she got a call -- the first in what would be a several monthslong casting process.
"I never really believed I would get the role, not in the beginning anyway," she said. "But then with every round, I started to feel like I had a real chance, and that it might actually be mine to keep. When it was, I was completely shellshocked."
Now, more than two years after that call, Ms. Bellamy's trajectory from obscurity to the brink of stardom appears to be well underway. Last week, she appeared on the front of The Daily Telegraph, which used a still from the series that recreated the moment in 2002 when Ms. Middleton, on a charity fashion catwalk in a daringly sheer dress, was rumored to have first turned the head of Prince William.
This week, ahead of the release of Part 2 of "The Crown" on Dec. 14, Ms. Bellamy was on the red carpet at the London premiere in a creamy Valentino column gown -- 24 hours after attending the Fashion Awards, where she wore a blazer dress with a suit and tie by Huishan Zhang.
And for months she has been courted by big fashion names like Gucci and Dior -- she attended Dior shows in Paris in July and September -- which have a habit of snapping up emerging talent with juicy contracts before they ascend to heights of celebrity. After all, if a fashion house can't hire the Princess of Wales to sell lipstick and handbags, perhaps the unknown actress playing her to an audience of millions is the next best thing.
Over its six seasons, the casting of "The Crown" has largely been anchored by a constellation of established performers, though it has also boosted the sparkly careers of several new faces, including Emma Corrin, who played Princess Diana in Season 4. What was it about Ms. Bellamy that prompted executives to take a chance on her for this role?
"We found that there was an openness to her, an intelligence and a sweetness to her, and a chemistry between her and Ed McVey, who plays Prince William," said Robert Sterne, the casting director for "The Crown." "You wanted to go on the journey with Meg. You wanted her to tell you the story."
Doing Kate Justice
Much has already been made of the parallels between Ms. Bellamy and Ms. Middleton, beyond their delicate features and masses of glossy auburn hair. How both were raised by close families in the royal county of Berkshire. (Ms. Bellamy was actually born in Leeds, in Yorkshire, and has a light Northern twinge that still lingers on some of her vowels.) How both were extremely sporty at school, with a particular love of lacrosse. (Ms. Bellamy, who said she was academic, was also head girl, which is similar to a class president.)
But unlike the Princess of Wales, who studied art history at the University of St. Andrews, Ms. Bellamy didn't attend university. After a number of star turns in school musical productions, including Sandy in "Grease" and Scaramouche in "We Will Rock You," she wanted only to act. She is acutely aware that people wait a lifetime for a break like hers, which came months after leaving high school.
Before the six month shoot, Ms. Bellamy spent months preparing to play Ms. Middleton. She watched documentaries and read newspaper clips compiled by researchers. She also worked with movement and voice coaches to perfect her performance. She took home costumes -- a nostalgic Noughties-inspired wardrobe of low-rise flared jeans, peplum tops, chunky belts and fringed suede knee-high boots -- to wear as she practiced her lines.
"I must have looked insane," Ms. Bellamy said. "I would be dressed as her, reading a book about her and trying to sound like her while walking around the house." She noted that while there is endless footage of Ms. Middleton after she formally joined the royal family in 2011, there is little -- beyond a handful of paparazzi photographs -- from her time at St. Andrews, where she first befriended and then fell in love with Prince William.
"Her first press interview was when she became engaged at 29, so she was something of a blank canvas," Ms. Bellamy said. "I spent a lot of time thinking about what she would have been like before she knew where life would take her and that William would become her husband. I hope that I've done Kate justice."
At the same time, she added, it was nice to remove the layer of complexities that come with being a royal and just play her as a girl who's going to university and falling in love.
When photographs of Ms. Bellamy and Mr. McVey filming at St. Andrews emerged this spring -- and ever since then -- there was intense online interest in her private life and next career steps. (So far, Ms. Bellamy has yet to announce her next role.) Lately she has been working with the stylist Felicity Kay to hone her public image and build a brand for herself.
Has being thrust into the spotlight given her a vague notion of what it must be like to be a royal?
"It's something I've been thinking about, especially as we've done more press ahead of the release," she said. "I really can't imagine the level of pressure royals face day to day. I mean, until last month I'd never been to Hollywood. Then I was not just there, but on a red carpet with people shouting my name."
She added: "But I keep telling myself that this is something I've always dreamed about. You have to remember that, before all of this, I wore a school uniform and could only afford high-street brands like Primark."

Hot Glazed Doughnuts on the Menu: For Parisians, How Sweet It Is: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As dawn broke in central Paris on Wednesday, a throng of 500 people, mostly French, stood with uncharacteristic patience in a snaking line, intent on buying a decidedly un-French confection: an American doughnut. A hot, glazed Krispy Kreme doughnut, to be exact.
It was the grand opening of the chain in France, and patrons -- dozens of whom had camped out overnight -- watched through a giant window as a conveyor belt ferried fried dough toward a waterfall of sugary frosting. When the doors opened, they swarmed inside, ordering doughnuts by the dozen to take out, or noshing at bistro tables in a cafe-style setting.
"The French love American products, and there's a hype around American food chains," said Amir Boudokhane, 25, a project manager at a medical clinic, as he waited to get in. A Krispy Kreme ad had popped up on his Instagram feed, and he rushed to get there before work. "I'll be late," he said with a smile. "But at least I'll have doughnuts for my colleagues."
The sight of French people flocking to American fare might have seemed surreal a generation ago in a country that loves its Michelin-starred restaurants, three-hour dinners and iconic baguette. But today, the world's gastronomic capital happens to be one of the biggest markets in Europe for major American fast-food chains, as evolving consumer habits, influenced by a more casual younger generation and social media, reshape the dining landscape.
In the spring, Popeye's fried chicken drew huge crowds in Paris when it opened the first of 350 restaurants planned across France. Wendy's has announced plans to set up shop in France. Burger King, KFC, Starbucks, Domino's Pizza, Chipotle, Steak 'n Shake, Carl's Jr. and Five Guys have long had toeholds, but they are rapidly expanding their footprints with plans for hundreds of new locations across the country.
Leading the pack is McDonald's. After the United States, France is the chain's most profitable country, with more than 6 billion euros ( $ 6.5 billion) in sales from over 1,500 restaurants in 2022. France is also the second-biggest market for Burger King, with €1.2 billion in revenue last year.
"France is an El Dorado for American fast-food brands," said Xavier Expilly, a consultant who helped oversee the French openings of Burger King, Five Guys and others. "Habits are shifting -- people are eating faster than before, and they want a different experience," he noted. "The American chains know how to respond to that need perfectly."
Krispy Kreme is the latest. At the opening on Wednesday, a D.J. thumped out dance music to the waiting crowd. A red carpet adorned the entrance, while the company's mascot -- a doughnut -- bobbled alongside workers handing out fresh glazed goodies to eager patrons.
Miguel Calic-Cuere spent the night in front of the store with dozens of fans eager to secure a good place in line. "I hardly slept because it was so cold," said the 20-year-old student, who kept warm by taking short walks and making friends in the growing crowd. Waiting for the opening "was a moment of solidarity for all of us," he exclaimed. When the doors finally opened, he found himself the lucky winner of a free box of a dozen Krispy Kremes each month for the next year.
Celia Lea Amarouche, 19, and Marie Besson, 28, were ready to open their wallets after seeing Krispy Kreme cameos in American TV shows that they had watched to improve their English, including "The Simpsons" and popular crime shows. Seeing Kylie Jenner dig into Krispy Kreme doughnuts on TikTok sealed the deal, Ms. Besson said.
"Doughnuts are little known in France compared to croissants and pain au chocolat," said Alexandre Maizoué, the director general of Krispy Kreme France and a member of the executive committee of Wagram Finance, a French private-equity firm backing the company's venture. He gestured around the store, where people crowded around five counters, picking out chocolate frosted doughnuts with sprinkles, or a dozen glazed in strawberry pink.
"This is all about American pop culture," he said. Krispy Kreme "appeals to Generation Netflix," he added. "They've seen all the American series. They like U.S. culture and the American art de vivre."
Doughnuts rolled off an assembly line that had been imported from North Carolina, where the chain is based. New flavors were created to appeal to the French palate, including a fresher fruit taste for the apple doughnut and less sweetness to the strawberry frosting. One Frenchified version was loaded with gingerbread, a cookie often served with an espresso at cafes.
The store, in a premium spot that Krispy Kreme took over from the French Michelin-starred chef Alain Ducasse, will make 45,000 doughnuts a day. A dozen more sites will open in Paris in the next three months, Mr. Maizoué said, and Krispy Kreme doughnuts will be sold at dozens of French supermarkets.
Things were not always smooth for American brands in France: Burger King was forced to pull out of the French market before re-entering a decade ago, after it insisted on sticking with a burger menu that was too American for French tastes. McDonald's, by contrast, catered some offerings to the French market by introducing add-on items not in its U.S. restaurants, like croissants and a facsimile of the croque-monsieur sandwich.
McDonald's also set a standard by creating a sit-down restaurant atmosphere that made French consumers steeped in cafe culture feel more comfortable about gathering at a table around a Big Mac. It also uses French-sourced meats, cheeses and breads.
Other American fast-food chains have adopted that same model to survive -- and thrive, Mr. Expilly said. "Sales in France are two to three times higher than in other countries because companies have modified that ultrafast American dining experience," he said.
French food isn't about to be knocked from its perch: The No. 1 lunch counter is still the local bakery. About 2.6 billion baguette sandwiches are sold each year in France, compared with 1.4 billion hamburgers, according to Gira Conseil, a French consultancy.
But in terms of sheer earning power, American chains dominate, making up nearly 30 percent of all fast-food sales, a broad category that includes rapid-service restaurants. The top five American fast-food companies in France had €8.6 billion in sales last year, according to Xerfi, a Paris-based research firm.
By all accounts, there is more money to be made. American chains are expanding abroad because saturation levels in the United States have reached record highs, said Aaron Allen, founder and chief strategist of Aaron Allen & Associates, a Chicago-based consultancy that focuses on the global food service and hospitality industry.
"The U.S. brands have battled it out, and there's only so many places to put them," he said. "So you see a rush to get to those countries where norms are changing and there's more acceptance of fast food."
That is the case in France, where the younger generation is more casual than its parents were and regular mealtimes at home have splintered. Hourlong sit-down lunches have morphed into shorter breaks that send people looking for a faster alternative.
And the use of food delivery services like UberEats and Deliveroo exploded during the pandemic, fueling a penchant among young people to order in with the tap of an app -- a phenomenon that didn't exist in France a decade ago.
Back at Krispy Kreme, Michele Fidel and Charlie Anglo, who work at a luxury hotel in Paris, had rushed to the opening after seeing friends post about it on Facebook. "We'd been praying that Krispy Kreme would come here!" Mr. Anglo exclaimed.

Is It Really the Apocalypse? Oh, if You Insist.: [Review]

Full text: This film about the apocalypse, directed by Sam Esmail and adapted from Rumaan Alam's novel, leaves little room for imagination.
The haunting cleverness of Rumaan Alam's novel "Leave the World Behind" -- published in 2020, when every novel about the apocalypse felt uncannily prophetic -- comes in what it doesn't say. For the whole book, you're expecting to find out what's caused the catastrophe that is just beginning to reach the main characters, New Yorkers who just happen to be vacationing out in the sticks when things start going wrong. And then, tensions stretched to the breaking point, the book thwarts all expectations, leaving behind a feeling of lingering unease.
The film adaptation of the novel, written and directed by the "Mr. Robot" creator Sam Esmail, also leaves behind lingering unease, but for entirely different reasons. In this rendition of the story, Julia Roberts and Ethan Hawke star as Amanda and Clay Sandford, an advertising executive and her English and media studies professor husband, who live a comfortable but not extravagant life in their Brooklyn home. (He says it's in Sunset Park; she says it's in Park Slope; that's a clarifying character detail, if you know the geography.)
Prompted by her annoyance with humanity, Amanda, a prickly misanthrope, rents a house to which she, Clay and their teenagers decamp. They wish, as the listing promised, to "leave the world behind." (As a New Yorker, I have to pause on this house for a second, because somehow it's in the woods, only reachable by a multi-hour drive and remote enough that cellular service is extremely spotty, but the Manhattan skyline seems closer from the yard than it does when you're in, like, Brooklyn Heights. I don't know.)
Anyhow, the house is beautiful and they're happy for a few hours until they go to the beach, where something so bizarre happens that I, who am not made of such strong stuff as them apparently, would have headed back to my Sunset Park (Slope) home immediately. Instead they go back to the house and seem to shake it off, for a while -- until a man (Mahershala Ali) and his daughter (Myha'la) show up on the doorstep, claiming that this is their house, and they're so sorry, but there's a blackout in the city and can they please stay here tonight?
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
It soon becomes clear there's more than a blackout, but this is where the movie really goes awry. Here is the thing about stories about the apocalypse: What they reveal, most of all, is what we think will actually end the world. What works in the novel is this question is left open, a blank space for the reader to fill with their own conjecture. Thus the reader discovers something about themselves, maybe indulges in a little self-examination, without getting caught up in the plausibility of this particular catastrophe.
You can do that in a movie -- Jeff Nichols's stellar 2011 thriller, "Take Shelter," comes to mind -- but it is a bit trickier to exercise restraint in a visual medium, and requires deft storytelling. Instead of leaving room for imagination, Esmail elects to throw everything at the screen. What will bring the apocalypse? White liberal racism (present in the novel, but underlined in some thuddingly obvious ways here, like when Clay keeps turning the car radio dial and landing on 1619 AM). Class divisions. Also conspiracy theorists and survivalists ranting about microwave weapons. Also our phones, our market fluctuations, our enemies foreign and domestic, self-driving cars, radiation -- in essence, a "dysfunctional nation," populated by people who, like Amanda, don't really like one another.
So basically, a divided country, one easily manipulated by bad actors. After a while, the movie plays like a bulleted list of everything wrong with America -- fair enough -- but hurled so relentlessly at the audience that you can only assume the goal is for anyone watching the movie to find something they agree with. In the onslaught, the narrative tension dulls into passivity, both for us and for the characters. Really, no one is in control, as one person says. No one is pulling the strings. And "the best even the most powerful people can hope for is a heads up."
A more skillfully crafted movie might have been able to turn that sentiment into something more horror adjacent, or at least a little more discomfiting. But there's a lot of over-signaling dialogue here: Early on, Clay tells Amanda about a former student who wrote a book about how "media is both an escape and a reflection," and comments, apropos of nothing, that it's "a contradiction that she manages to reconcile." Camerawork choices seem to suggest a third party is watching them -- lots of showy overhead spiraling shots, repeated punch-outs to the earth floating in space -- but have no narrative payoff. And though the main cast are accomplished, beautiful and intermittently interesting, they feel out of place in a movie that ought to have been a lot more scary, or a lot more subdued. Here, they feel stranded.
The film's ending seems like a punchline. It's strongly implied that what will survive the apocalypse is not humanity or beauty or neighborliness or even civilization, but physical media, the DVDs that will still work when the internet and the streamers go down. "Leave the World Behind" is a Netflix movie, so there's irony in that. But I guess it's one irony I can get on board with. This is the way the world ends: Not with a bang, but a theme song.
Leave the World Behind
Rated R. Some scary stuff, some swearing, and the beginning effects of radiation. Running time: 2 hours 18 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

Where to Stream Norman Lear's Shows: [Correction]

Full text: Beginning with "All in the Family," Lear filled the airwaves throughout the 1970s with popular, critically acclaimed shows about families from varied ethnic and economic backgrounds.
The writer and producer Norman Lear, who died on Tuesday at 101, got his start in television in the 1950s, selling jokes and sketches to comedians like Jerry Lewis. After dabbling in film as a screenwriter and a director, Lear -- already approaching his 50s -- found unlikely success and a new career path when he convinced CBS to take a chance on his sitcom "All in the Family" in 1971. Though the show was based on the British series "Till Death Us Do Part," Lear made his version distinctly American and of the moment, bringing spirited arguments about race, class, religion, politics and the generation gap into living rooms across the country.
When "All in the Family" became a phenomenon, Lear and his colleagues started producing spinoffs and similar series, filling the airwaves throughout the 1970s with critically acclaimed and high-rated shows about families from varied ethnic and economic backgrounds.
Lear's golden touch dimmed by the end of the decade, as the audience's tastes changed. But he's still regularly cited as an influence and even sometimes as a direct mentor by TV writers and producers interested in engaging with pressing social issues in entertaining and provocative ways. And his original work had an unusual revival in the 21st century, which saw a modernized version of Lear's "One Day at a Time" and multiple broadcast TV specials in which actors performed old Lear scripts live, treating them like canonical theater pieces.
Here are six of the best shows Lear was involved with:
'All in the Family' (1971-79)
For much of the 1960s, television producers tried to compete with the movies by making their shows more visually dynamic -- more "cinematic," in other words. But with "All in the Family," Lear and his frequent writing-producing partner Bud Yorkin took TV back to its roots in live theater, staging what were essentially weekly one-act plays about the Queens-based Bunker family: the grouchy bigot Archie (Carroll O'Connor), his doting but dim wife Edith (Jean Stapleton), his feminist daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers) and his feisty liberal son-in-law Mike (Rob Reiner).
In the early seasons especially, the plots were minimal, and mainly an excuse to let these characters trade insights and insults while debating the issues of the day, in lengthy scenes at once uncomfortably intense and explosively funny.
Buy it on Apple TV .
'Maude' (1972-78)
The first "All in the Family" spinoff flips the original's premise, shifting the setting from a ultraconservative, working-class Queens neighborhood to a proudly liberal upper-middle class home in Westchester County. In "Maude," Bea Arthur plays the title character: an opinionated suburbanite who, like Archie Bunker, is certain she knows what's wrong with the world ... and who argues a lot about it with her family and neighbors.
A terrific show in its own right -- featuring groundbreaking episodes that tackle topics like abortion, alcoholism and domestic violence -- "Maude" is also the perfect counterpoint to "All in the Family," making it clear that Lear and Yorkin saw the humanity and the flaws in people across the political spectrum.
Buy it on Amazon Prime Video or Apple TV .
'Good Times' (1974-79)
In the early seasons of "Maude," the heroine occasionally clashed with her maid, Florida Evans (Esther Rolle), who had little patience for her well-meaning but often obstinate boss. Rolle's performance earned her a sitcom of her own, playing Florida again, in a show about a close-knit but economically struggling Black family in the Chicago projects.
"Good Times" gave Lear and the series's cocreators, Eric Monte and Mike Evans, the chance to explore the ways that the problems of the working classes fell differently on the Evanses of the world than they did for the Bunkers.
Stream it on Peacock ; buy it on Amazon Prime Video or Apple TV .
'The Jeffersons' (1975-85)
Just as "Maude" is a ritzy suburban spin on "All in the Family," so "The Jeffersons" is like an upscale "Good Times," weighing the issues a rich Black family faces in a high-end Manhattan neighborhood.
George Jefferson (Sherman Hemsley) is another indelible creation like Archie and Maude: a self-made man with a lot to say about the state of society and how to succeed. His ego is checked by his wife Louise (Isabel Sanford), who has to deal everyone he offends -- from their privileged white neighbors to their sharp-tongued maid, Florence (Marla Gibbs).
Buy it on Amazon Prime Video .
'One Day at a Time' (1975-84)
Though it lacked the "from the front lines of the culture wars" hook of earlier Lear-produced sitcoms, "One Day at a Time" proved to be one of his most durable series -- and, in its own way, it was strongly reflective of its time.
Set in a late 1970s and early '80s Middle America hobbled by inflation, stagnant wages and broken homes, the show follows the divorced mother Ann Romano (Bonnie Franklin) and her precocious teenage daughters, Julie (Mackenzie Phillips) and Barbara (Valerie Bertinelli), as they try to avoid driving each other nuts in their tiny Indianapolis apartment. It's a heartwarming dramedy that's also honest about the emotional and economic strains of modern family life.
Buy it on Amazon Prime Video or Google Play .
'One Day at a Time' (2017-20)
The original "One Day at a Time" was much softer in tone than "All in the Family," but the 21st-century remake flashes more of a cutting edge, while still retaining all the heart and humor of its forebear. Developed by Gloria Calderón Kellett and Mike Royce (with Lear onboard as a producer and godfather), the new version features a Cuban American family in Los Angeles, led by an Army vet named Penelope (Justina Machado) and her traditionalist mother Lydia (Rita Moreno). Spanning the tumultuous Trump years, this "One Day at a Time" hearkens back to Lear's early shows in its style -- with a lot of long scenes set in one cozy living space -- and in the writers' willingness to tackle everything from PTSD to immigration law to gender identity.

Hidden Currents, Tugging Us Under: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ava DuVernay's new feature film, adapted from the Isabel Wilkerson book "Caste," turns the journalist into a character who examines oppression.
Ava DuVernay's "Origin" is as audacious as it is ambitious. At its core, it concerns an intellectual argument about history and hierarchies of power, but it's also about the fraught process of making this argument. It's a daunting conceit that DuVernay has shaped into an eventful narrative that is, by turns, specific and far-ranging, diagnostic and aspirational. It is a great big swing about taking a great big swing, and while the film is more persuasive as a drama than the argument it relays, few American movies this year reach so high so boldly.
The inspiration for "Origin," which DuVernay both wrote and directed, is Isabel Wilkerson's acclaimed, best-selling 2020 book "Caste." In it, Wilkerson argues that to fully understand the United States and its divisive history, you need to look past race and grasp the role played by caste, which she sees as an artificial and static structural "ranking of human value that sets the presumed supremacy of one group against the presumed inferiority of other groups." Caste, she writes, separates people -- including into racially ranked groups -- and keeps them divided. These separations, as the subtitle puts it, are "The Origins of Our Discontents."
For the film, DuVernay has turned Wilkerson into a dramatic, at times melodramatic character of the same name -- a moving Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor -- who develops her thesis while traversing history and continents on a journey from inspiration to publication. The movie also includes segments of varying effectiveness that dramatize Wilkerson's understanding of specific caste systems: One is set in Nazi Germany in the 1930s, another in Depression-era Mississippi and a third in India over different time periods. This last interlude focuses on Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar (Gaurav J. Pathania), who helped draft India's Constitution and championed the rights of Dalits, people once deemed "untouchables."
Isabel's intellectual quest is bold, sweeping and determinedly personal -- a handful of close relatives have decisive roles -- and DuVernay's version of that venture is equally expansive. She gives it tension, tears, visual poetry, shocks of tragedy, moments of grace and many interlocking parts. "Origin" opens in 2012 with a re-enactment of the last night in the life of Trayvon Martin (Myles Frost), the unarmed 17-year-old who was fatally shot by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer. The killing becomes the catalyst for her thesis about caste because, the more she considers it, the more she believes that racism alone can't explain it. Racism, she says at one point, has become "the default" explanation.
Isabel's process unfolds rapidly and is framed by her resistance to the default. Her resistance surfaces in a discussion that she has with her husband, Brett (a sympathetic Jon Bernthal), and mother, Ruby (Emily Yancy), as they watch President Obama address Martin's death on TV. It also informs Isabel's talks with an acquaintance (Blair Underwood), who early on urges her to write about the case, pushing her to listen to the 911 calls that were made the night Martin was killed. (Wilkerson is a former bureau chief for The New York Times; her first book is "The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America's Great Migration.")
Isabel does listen to the 911 calls one quiet evening at home. Steeling herself, she begins the recordings, at which point the scene shifts to the night of the killing; it's as if she had hit play on a grotesque movie. As DuVernay cuts back and forth between Isabel and that night, you hear George Zimmerman, a largely offscreen presence, talking to a dispatcher as he follows the worried teenager in his car. ("He's running.") You also watch as a terrified Martin struggles for his life. DuVernay's staging here is blunt, visceral and harrowingly intimate. Isabel is shaken and so are you, in part because the 911 calls in the re-enactment are real.
"Origin" doesn't tip that the calls are real, though it's obvious. (Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, is thanked in the credits.) The calls are excruciating. They intensify the palpable urgency that defines "Origin" from its opening and informs even outwardly ordinary scenes, urgency that feels very much like the sounding of an alarm. DuVernay has consistently drawn from history in her work, including in her documentary "13TH" (about the racism of the American prison system), her period drama "Selma" (about the 1965 march and the events preceding it) and her Netflix series "When They See Us" (about the teenage victims known as the Central Park Five). For her, history isn't a random dusty box to open; it is a living thing.
This explains, I think -- beyond obvious commercial considerations -- DuVernay's decision to turn Wilkerson into Isabel, the empathetic heroine of a story larger than any one person. DuVernay fleshes out the character from the start in homey scenes of Isabel with her family, so you're smitten quickly. And Ellis-Taylor helps keeps you on the character's side even when you wonder where she's headed and why. Isabel is an appealing, celebrated public intellectual. As such, she lives in her head (she often misplaces her keys), but she also lives in a body shaped and buffeted by a past that is always present, a past that at times reveals itself in meaningful details: in a flirty joke, a misty story and the memory of a Tuskegee airman.
As a character, Isabel doesn't simply make this material approachable, she embodies it, putting it into warm, breathing, at times weeping terms, much like the characters in the historical episodes. It's instructive that DuVernay shows Isabel falling apart after she endures great personal loss and before she goes deep into her investigation into caste. When her cousin Marion (Niecy Nash-Betts) comforts her, murmuring "I'm right here," the film shifts into a deeper melodramatic register that, in its raw emotion, is startling and touching. It is a potent reminder that Isabel's intellectual project isn't some dry exercise; it is, instead, a search for meaning that insists history is also written on bodies and through lived experience.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Not everything works. There are too many scenes and DuVernay clutters the narrative by over-cutting among them; she also, in an attempt to strengthen Isabel's ideas, needlessly stages one scene in a Nazi extermination camp and another on a ship transporting captive Africans during the Middle Passage. More prosaically, Isabel's research can seem less like work and more like tourism, especially when she's drifting through museums and libraries. It's in a Berlin exhibition, for one, that she learns of the connection between old American racial classifications, in which anyone of mixed ancestry was considered Black, and Nazi Germany's Nuremberg race laws, which segregated Jews from so-called Aryans.
"Caste" has generated criticism, including for its omission of class politics; as the historian Charisse Burden-Stelly points out in the journal Boston Review, the word capitalism never appears in the book. For his part, the author Sunil Khilnani, writing in The New Yorker, sees in Wilkerson's book "more grim continuity than hopeful departures, more regression to the mean than moments of progress." Despite its well-wrought, meaningful tears, "Origin" is, by contrast, extraordinarily hopeful. It never makes a persuasive case for Isabel's thesis, but I'm not convinced it needs to. For DuVernay, speaking to the convulsions of a past that shape us is a moral imperative, and so too is the optimism that is finally her film's greatest argument.

As an elder statesman of tomfoolery, Johnny Knoxville also comes to mind. And of course the two have collaborated, sharing the screen for the film "Jackass 4.5" as well as for this summer's ABC reality series "The Prank Panel."
André has honed his stunts over some 20 years, duping celebrities and commoners alike, whether through his self-titled talk show on Adult Swim or his 2021 Netflix film "Bad Trip." So it's not surprising that last month he released a book on modern pranking written with his co-conspirator Dan Curry, "Dumb Ideas: A Behind-the-Scenes Exposé on Making Pranks and Other Stupid Creative Endeavors (and How You Can Also Too!)."
Even though André occasionally flirts with the mainstream, most recently lending his voice to the family-friendly flick "Trolls Band Together," he will assume his typical role of instigating jester, encouraging fans to chug ranch dressing or something similar, when his tour stops here on Friday. Tickets are $ 49.50 on AXS. SEAN L. McCARTHY
Music
Kari Faux
Dec. 8 at 8 p.m. at Baby's All Right, 146 Broadway, Brooklyn; babysallright.com.
A beguiling figure in independent hip-hop for a decade, Kari Faux began making beats and self-releasing mixtapes from her hometown, Little Rock, Ark., and after some of those early efforts caught the ears of tastemakers -- Donald Glover among them -- her growing success brought her to Los Angeles.
Faux's projects over the years have shown considerable range, both emotionally and sonically. But Southern rap remains embedded in her musical DNA, and is at the center of her recent album, "Real B*tches Don't Die!" Produced after Faux relocated to Houston, and featuring regional rap heavyweights like Big K.R.I.T. and Gangsta Boo, the record has Faux winding through woozy, unhurried instrumentals while navigating themes of grief and self-care.
At Baby's All Right on Friday, Faux's opener is Pink Siifu, another artist whose recent work has foregrounded his Southern roots. Tickets are $ 24 at SeeTickets. OLIVIA HORN
Caroline Davis
Through Dec. 9 at 8:30 p.m. at the Stone, 55 West 13th Street, Manhattan; thestonenyc.com.
A tip for crossword fans: an alula, or "bastard wing," is a small digit, tufted with feathers, on the anterior edge of a bird's wings, a crucial adaptation for creating lift in flight. Alula is also the name of the ever-evolving electroacoustic jazz ensemble headed by the saxophonist and composer Caroline Davis. The group's two albums of emotive alto sax and richly textured rhythmic explorations (2019's "Alula" and October's "Alula: Captivity") continually achieve lift -- and exemplify a spirit of purposeful evolution. Davis's real-life passions -- for collective catharsis, for facing injustice, for building community -- power her music, too, which breathes and seethes, edging between poles of outrage and meditative clarity.
Davis will play with a different group each night during her run at the Stone. The lineups are thick with major players: The pianist Craig Taborn and the turntablist Val Jeanty play in a trio with Davis on Thursday. Friday finds Davis in a quartet with Matt Mitchell on piano, Rashaan Carter on bass and Terri Lyne Carrington on drums, while Saturday introduces the latest iteration of Alula, featuring Qasim Naqvi on modular synth, Chris Tordini on bass and Jason Nazary on drums.
All sets are $ 20; tickets are cash only at the door. ALAN SCHERSTUHL
Kids
Lyrics & Lyricists Jr.: 'Celebrating Sondheim'
Dec. 9-10 at 1:30 p.m. at Kaufmann Concert Hall, 92NY, 1395 Lexington Avenue, Manhattan; 92ny.org.
Stephen Sondheim was introduced to Broadway shows when he was just a boy. This weekend, children can enjoy their own introduction to musical theater classics through the work of one of the genre's most prominent creators: Sondheim himself.
This composer and writer, who died in 2021, is the focus of the first program in a newly created young people's version of Lyrics & Lyricists, a series 92NY (formerly the 92nd Street Y) has been presenting for more than 50 years. Lyrics & Lyricists Jr., which offers 45-minute shows (the adult events run an hour and a half), treats audiences to the same mix of biography and songs, delivered by a costumed cast that performs far more dance than fans of the original series usually see.
Written by Jeffrey Sanzel and directed and choreographed by Megan Doyle, "Celebrating Sondheim" will feature numbers from productions that include "Company," "Into the Woods," "Merrily We Roll Along" and "A Little Night Music." Children, who receive an activity guide to take home, will learn that such shows forever changed the American musical by elevating emotional depth over sheer effervescence.
Tickets start at $ 20. LAUREL GRAEBER
Film
Todd Haynes
Through Dec. 30 at the Museum of the Moving Image, 36-01 35th Avenue, Queens; movingimage.us.
Todd Haynes's "May December," starring Natalie Portman as an actress and Julianne Moore as the notorious tabloid fixture Portman's character will soon play, rarely tips its hand. Is it a disturbing drama about how abuse ripples across time, or a satire about a performer's efforts to understand a willfully unreflective person? American cinema's pre-eminent deconstructionist, Haynes has trafficked in such ambiguities for decades. The glam-rock opus "Velvet Goldmine" (on Saturday and Dec. 17) appropriates the structure of "Citizen Kane." "Far From Heaven" (on Dec. 23) turns the subtext of Douglas Sirk's 1950s melodramas into the text.
As the museum's monthlong Haynes retrospective continues into its second weekend, the lineup will offer another chance to catch two shorter early works, "The Suicide" and "Assassins: A Film Concerning Rimbaud" (showing together on Saturday). Also on the calendar are Haynes's dissection of Bob Dylan, "I'm Not There" (on Sunday and Dec. 29), which distributes attributes of the singer's personality over six actors; and his excellent, comparatively straightforward mini-series adaptation of "Mildred Pierce" (on Sunday), which stars Kate Winslet.

Full text: Archie and pals get radicalized when their hometown, now conveniently relocated in India, is threatened by corporate overlords.
Namaste from Riverdale! In "The Archies," the director Zoya Akhtar transplants the all-American comic book hamlet to India, where the Anglo-Indian teenager Archie Andrews (Agastya Nanda) is up to his usual tricks, dating both Betty (Khushi Kapoor) and Veronica (Suhana Khan).
Set in 1964, this inessential Bollywood-tinged fantasia is two and a half hours of soda shops, chaste dates, candy-colored petticoats, and athletic musical numbers choreographed to a mix of modern-ish new tunes and classics like "Wooly Bully." Akhtar, who wrote the script with Ayesha Devitre Dhillon and Reema Kagti, is fearless in her fanciful reorientation. Why not?
It's an extravagant stunt perked up by moments of absurdity. Reggie (Vedang Raina) invents beat-boxing; the kids applaud a quote from Jean-Luc Godard: "Cinema is truth 24 times a second." Mostly, however, it's rote shtick. Jughead (Mihir Ahuja) chows down on some kind of burgers while Archie and his girlfriends flirt, fight and flirt some more.
Suddenly, the focus shifts from how much Riverdale hasn't changed to how much it might under threat of a corporate takeover. This wheezy old save-the-town plot only holds our interest because of our long acquaintance with the characters who are now being radicalized. It's strangely compelling to watch Archie transform into an anticapitalist activist. "I can't just live my life for kicks," he sings, "Everything is politics -- hey, hey!"
The cast is tasked solely with looking chipper and gyrating enthusiastically. The ladies do a saucy number on roller skates; later, Khan's vampy Veronica lands a back flip. The film does its darnedest to dazzle from its lavish production design to its showboating cinematography. For good measure, Akhtar slaps cartoon-style exclamations on the screen: "Smack!" "Pow!" and, for Hindi speakers, "Dhishoom!"
The Archies
Not rated. In Hindi and English, with subtitles. Running time: 2 hours 21 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

Hot Glazed Doughnuts on the Menu, and Parisians Can’t Get Enough

Full text: Enlarge this image.
PARIS — As dawn broke in central Paris on Wednesday, a throng of 500 people, mostly French, stood with uncharacteristic patience in a snaking line, intent on buying a decidedly un-French confection: an American doughnut. A hot, glazed Krispy Kreme doughnut, to be exact.
It was the grand opening of the chain in France, and patrons — dozens of whom had camped out overnight — watched through a giant window as a conveyor belt ferried fried dough toward a waterfall of sugary frosting. When the doors opened, they swarmed inside, ordering doughnuts by the dozen to take out, or noshing at bistro tables in a cafe-style setting.
“The French love American products, and there’s a hype around American food chains,” said Amir Boudokhane, 25, a project manager at a medical clinic, as he waited to get in. A Krispy Kreme ad had popped up on his Instagram feed, and he rushed to get there before work. “I’ll be late,” he said, smiling. “But at least I’ll have doughnuts for my colleagues.”
The sight of French people flocking to American fare might have seemed surreal a generation ago in a country that loves its Michelin-starred restaurants, three-hour dinners and iconic baguette. But today, the world’s gastronomic capital happens to be one of the biggest markets in Europe for major American fast-food chains, as evolving consumer habits, influenced by a more casual younger generation and social media, reshape the dining landscape.
In the spring, Popeye’s fried chicken drew huge crowds in Paris when it opened the first of 350 restaurants planned across France. Wendy’s has announced plans to set up shop in France. Burger King, KFC, Starbucks, Domino’s Pizza, Chipotle, Steak ’n Shake, Carl’s Jr. and Five Guys have long had toeholds, but they are rapidly expanding their footprints with plans for hundreds of new locations across the country.
Leading the pack is McDonald’s. After the United States, France is the chain’s most profitable country, with more than 6 billion euros ($6.5 billion) in sales from over 1,500 restaurants in 2022. France is also the second-biggest market for Burger King, with 1.2 billion euros in revenue last year.
“France is an El Dorado for American fast-food brands,” said Xavier Expilly, a consultant who helped oversee the French openings of Burger King, Five Guys and others. “Habits are shifting — people are eating faster than before, and they want a different experience,” he noted. “The American chains know how to respond to that need perfectly.”
Krispy Kreme is the latest. At the opening on Wednesday, a DJ thumped out dance music to the waiting crowd. A red carpet adorned the entrance, while the company’s mascot — a doughnut — bobbled alongside workers handing out fresh glazed goodies to eager patrons.
Miguel Calic-Cuere spent the night in front of the store with dozens of fans eager to secure a good place in line. “I hardly slept because it was so cold,” said the 20-year-old student, who kept warm by taking short walks and making friends in the growing crowd. Waiting for the opening “was a moment of solidarity for all of us,” he exclaimed. When the doors finally opened, he found himself the lucky winner of a free box of a dozen Krispy Kremes each month for the next year.
Celia Lea Amarouche, 19, and Marie Besson, 28, were ready to open their wallets after seeing Krispy Kreme cameos in American TV shows that they had watched to improve their English, including “The Simpsons” and popular crime shows. Seeing Kylie Jenner dig into Krispy Kreme doughnuts on TikTok sealed the deal, Besson said.
“Doughnuts are little known in France compared to croissants and pain au chocolat,” said Alexandre Maizoué, the director-general of Krispy Kreme France and a member of the executive committee of Wagram Finance, a French private-equity firm backing the company’s venture. He gestured around the store, where people crowded around five counters, picking out chocolate frosted doughnuts with sprinkles, or a dozen glazed in strawberry pink.
“This is all about American pop culture,” he said. Krispy Kreme “appeals to Generation Netflix,” he added. “They’ve seen all the American series. They like U.S. culture and the American art de vivre.”
Doughnuts rolled off an assembly line that had been imported from North Carolina, where the chain is based. New flavors were created to appeal to the French palate, including a fresher fruit taste for the apple doughnut and less sweetness to the strawberry frosting. One Frenchified version was loaded with gingerbread, a cookie often served with an espresso at cafes.
The store, in a premium spot that Krispy Kreme took over from French Michelin-starred chef Alain Ducasse, will make 45,000 doughnuts a day. A dozen more sites will open in Paris in the next three months, Maizoué said, and Krispy Kreme doughnuts will be sold at dozens of French supermarkets.
Things were not always smooth for American brands in France: Burger King was forced to pull out of the French market before re-entering a decade ago, after it insisted on sticking with a burger menu that was too American for French tastes. McDonald’s, by contrast, catered some offerings to the French market by introducing add-on items not in its U.S. restaurants, like croissants and a facsimile of the croque-monsieur sandwich.
McDonald’s also set a standard by creating a sit-down restaurant atmosphere that made French consumers steeped in cafe culture feel more comfortable about gathering at a table around a Big Mac. It also uses French-sourced meats, cheeses and breads.
Other American fast-food chains have adopted that same model to survive — and thrive, Expilly said. “Sales in France are two to three times higher than in other countries because companies have modified that ultrafast American dining experience,” he said.
French food isn’t about to be knocked from its perch: The No. 1 lunch counter is still the local bakery. About 2.6 billion baguette sandwiches are sold each year in France, compared with 1.4 billion hamburgers, according to Gira Conseil, a French consultancy.
But in terms of sheer earning power, American chains dominate, making up nearly 30% of all fast-food sales, a broad category that includes rapid-service restaurants. The top five American fast-food companies in France had 8.6 billion euros in sales last year, according to Xerfi, a Paris-based research firm.
By all accounts, there is more money to be made. American chains are expanding abroad because saturation levels in the United States have reached record highs, said Aaron Allen, founder and chief strategist of Aaron Allen & Associates, a Chicago-based consultancy that focuses on the global food service and hospitality industry.
“The U.S. brands have battled it out, and there’s only so many places to put them,” he said. “So you see a rush to get to those countries where norms are changing, and there’s more acceptance of fast food.”
That is the case in France, where the younger generation is more casual than its parents were, and regular mealtimes at home have splintered. Hourlong sit-down lunches have morphed into shorter breaks that send people looking for a faster alternative.
And the use of food delivery services like UberEats and Deliveroo exploded during the pandemic, fueling a penchant among young people to order in with the tap of an app — a phenomenon that didn’t exist in France a decade ago.
Back at Krispy Kreme, Michele Fidel and Charlie Anglo, who work at a luxury hotel in Paris, had rushed to the opening after seeing friends post about it on Facebook. “We’d been praying that Krispy Kreme would come here!” Anglo exclaimed.

New BBC Chairman Picked Amid Funding Squeeze: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The News
Samir Shah, a longtime TV executive, was selected to be the next chairman of the BBC, Britain's public broadcasting company, the government said on Wednesday, about eight months after a political scandal led to the resignation of the previous chairman, Richard Sharp. Mr. Shah's appointment is subject to questioning by lawmakers.
Background: A loan to the prime minister is scrutinized.
Mr. Sharp stepped down in April after an investigation found that he had failed to disclose his involvement in arranging a loan of nearly $ 1 million to Boris Johnson while he was prime minister.
A former Goldman Sachs banker and adviser to the British government, Mr. Sharp took on the role of BBC chairman in early 2021. He had previously donated to the governing Conservative Party and was reportedly advising his former employee Rishi Sunak when Mr. Sunak was chancellor of the Exchequer. Some saw Mr. Sharp's ties to the government as a potential benefit to the broadcaster during a critical period in which it was in negotiations with lawmakers about its funding and a review of its charter, which sets out its mission and public purpose.
Why It Matters: The BBC is facing questions over its funding.
Even as the BBC continues to command a central position in the British media and broadcasts around the world, it has been rocked in recent years by leadership changes, attacks on its impartiality and a deep squeeze on its funding that has led to substantial cost-cutting. The chairman serves as an essential face of the BBC and interacts with government.
As chairman, Mr. Sharp came to a deal with the government over its license fee, which is charged each year to any household with a TV and makes up about two-thirds of the BBC's funding. The fee was frozen for two years but is set to rise in line with inflation for four years starting in April.
Still, it leaves the broadcaster under intense financial pressures as it struggles to compete with streamers like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Last month, the BBC announced plans to cut spending on news services as part of a recent plan to save 500 million pounds.
The broadcaster will soon be in negotiations with the government about its charter, which expires in 2027. Those talks are expected to include a discussion about alternative funding models.
"It was very clear that the government was very intent on producing a squeaky clean appointment process," said Alice Enders, director of research at the media research firm Enders Analysis.
Dig Deeper: A TV executive honored for his services in broadcasting.
Mr. Shah has spent more than three decades in television, including 11 years at the BBC in late 1980s and 1990s. After that, he joined Juniper, a TV production company, where he is chief executive and creative director. Mr. Shah was awarded an Order of the British Empire in 2020 for services to diversity in broadcasting.
He served on a commission that investigated race and ethnic disparities in Britain in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. The commission published a report in early 2021, which was deemed controversial for its somewhat positive outlook of race relations in Britain.
Mr. Shah "has a clear ambition to see the BBC succeed in a rapidly changing media landscape," Lucy Frazer, the culture secretary, said in a statement on Wednesday. "I have no doubt he will provide the support and scrutiny that the BBC needs to meet the challenges and opportunities of the future."
What Happens Next: Government will set the license fee amount.
The license fee is set to rise in April, but Ms. Frazer expressed concern this week about the amount of the increase, which is about £15. Calling the rise "significant," she said the government was looking at which measure of inflation should be used to determine the increase.
Samir Shah is chief executive of Juniper, a TV production company. (PHOTOGRAPH BY BBC) This article appeared in print on page B3.

Hundreds of Films, and Two Critics Have to Pick: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Selecting the 10 best films of the year is always an exercise in decisiveness. This year, a strong slate made cutting the list a "small agony," one critic said.
The end of the year brings a deluge of "best of" lists at The New York Times, and few are quite as eagerly anticipated as the "best movies" roundup. (Bookworms may think otherwise.)
This year, Manohla Dargis, chief film critic, and Alissa Wilkinson, a Times film critic, offered their own lists of their 10 favorite films of 2023. Ms. Dargis first wrote a "best of" list for The Times in 2004; this year marks Ms. Wilkinson's first list (she joined The Times last month). The two worked independently and learned of each other's selections only after making their own.
Ms. Dargis's list spotlighted 10 films that coaxed people out of their homes and into theaters, including highly hyped flicks from blockbuster names (Christopher Nolan's "Oppenheimer") and quieter directorial debuts (A.V. Rockwell's "A Thousand and One"). The films Ms. Wilkinson selected all grappled with the concept of "ordinary evil." For example, Martin Scorsese's "Killers of the Flower Moon" forced viewers to confront the question: Is anyone really innocent?
As it happens, both critics anointed "Killers of the Flower Moon" as their No. 1 pick. Both say they are guided by instinct, not by a list of criteria, when evaluating films. And neither is concerned if her picks are contested in the comments section -- in fact, both said they liked to see a spirited dialogue.
In separate conversations, Ms. Dargis and Ms. Wilkinson explained their "best of" selection process. Read excerpts from both interviews, which have been edited and condensed, below.
Manohla Dargis on her Process
Manohla Dargis found cutting her list of favorite films down to 10 to be "a small agony," but knew it would help guide readers through the thicket of choices. One movie she could watch over and over again is "The Wizard of Oz."
You've been writing about films professionally since 1987 and have critiqued them for The Times for nearly 20 years. How has your approach changed?
It changes all the time. My starting point is always, What is interesting to me about this? Then I use that as the thread that I continue to pull; I see where it takes me. I don't have any sort of formula or template. Reviews are about trying to say something interesting about how a particular object works. That's how I see the job, really. The review has to be interesting to me, otherwise it won't be interesting to anyone else. Even with a dull movie, I ask, Well, why was this movie dull?
I fundamentally believe that reviews are a form of service journalism. I'm here to let you know, in one way or another, how I feel about a movie.
I try to avoid the kind of hype that occurs online, because that is usually generated by public relations. The best way to see a movie is to know absolutely nothing about it. Rarely do I get that opportunity. But it can be quite delightful.
You see hundreds of movies a year. How do you narrow down your favorite 10?
I scan a lot of lists. I look at The Times's Critics' Picks. I look at them to remember what I liked and to see what the other critics recommended. There is no way I can see every single movie that comes out in a year -- it's hundreds, if not thousands, of movies. My list is limited to those that were released in theaters, and I don't add anything that hasn't opened in the United States. I want these movies to have had a life out in the world.
Was there anything specifically noteworthy about putting together the list this year?
Most years, the 10 titles on my list can be rearranged differently depending on the day. It is somewhat unusual, then, that from the moment I started thinking about this list, I knew what was going to be No. 1.

Alissa Wilkinson, a former film writer for Vox, was hired at The Times and immediately began work on her "best of" list. But she had been keeping a running inventory of films in her head all year long. One movie she could watch over and over again is "The Devil Wears Prada."
You're new to The Times and its readership. As a critic, you have to be aware of your audience, but independent of it. What does that look like?
I think this list was doubly important to me because in some ways, it served as my introduction to The Times's readership. It is very representative of how I think about film.
A lot of it comes down to the question of, What is a Top 10 list for? A lot of people see it as a list that's meant to validate their taste, or as a predictor of the Oscars. I don't think that's useful. For me, the best Top 10 lists are the ones where I don't agree with them at all, or I haven't even heard of most of what's on it, because it tells me the things that I haven't seen that I probably should. The more varied the lists are, the better. For critics, the thing that is most important when you're putting together a Top 10 list is giving your audience something to chew on.
Are you a gut feeling kind of person, or do you consult a list of criteria?
I have always operated on the assumption that everyone has a reaction to a film that's slightly different, and they're all valid. The fact that a film moves me, and that the person sitting next to me is left stone cold, doesn't mean there's something wrong with them or with me. But for a critic, the job is to start with the gut feeling and then try to nail down where that's coming from. I am making an argument for my reaction.
It's really important for critics not to go in with a list of things that they believe a movie ought to be judged by. Every movie has a thing that it is trying to be, and I'm asking, Do I think it's successful at its own aims? I'm often really proud of the reviews where people are like, I can't quite tell if you liked it.
I'm not here to tell you to like something. I'm here to tell you how I saw something and why I saw it that way, and help you process your own reaction.
A ranked list can feel reductive. But you're trying to keep things nuanced.
I compare being a critic to being a sommelier. I drink wine and I might like it. But my friend who's a sommelier can tell me why it works or doesn't. That's because he's had a billion more glasses of wine than I have and has thought about them. A critic is like a sommelier for film -- I'm going to have different perspectives because I've seen hundreds of movies. But importantly, that doesn't invalidate someone else's perspective. That's what art is for; that's what makes it fun.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Last year, it became Humberto Leon's job to shape the appearances of 20 young women, whose ages ranged from 14 to 21.
He decided what kind of clothing, shoes and jewelry they would wear. He told them how their hair should be cut and their makeup applied.
"You have to imagine, with 20 girls, I want each and every one of them to stand out," Mr. Leon said.
Still, young women do not always take kindly to being told how to dress. There were tears. "That's not how I like to do my hair," some of them told Mr. Leon.
"I said, 'I know, but trust me. I'm helping you own your personality,"' Mr. Leon recalled. "They think they know what's best for them. And I have to give them an objective opinion of what I think would look great on them."
Professionally, it was in their best interest to listen to Mr. Leon. Under his guidance, they could become the main characters in their own makeover montage -- a tradition stretching from "Pygmalion" to "The Princess Diaries" to, perhaps more relevant to this group, "The Hunger Games."
These 20 girls were in direct competition with one another. Six of them would eventually be named members of a new pop group. Upon its debut, this group would already have the support of Hybe, the company that brought K-pop to the world, and Universal Music Group, the world's largest record company. The competition would also be the subject of a Netflix documentary series.
Throughout it all, the contestants' public image would be in the hands of Mr. Leon, a 48-year-old fashion designer who rose to prominence in downtown New York during the 2000s with his store Opening Ceremony -- a popular boutique for up-and-coming labels -- then was recruited to reinvigorate a luxury brand in Paris, then started opening restaurants with his family during the pandemic in Los Angeles.
In September 2022, he was brought on as creative director for this girl group competition -- a partnership between Hybe and Geffen Records, which is owned by Universal Music Group -- in which 120,000 applicants from around the world were narrowed down to 20 contestants, or "trainees," all of whom were relocated to Los Angeles to train intensively in singing and dancing.
When those contestants were announced in August, Mr. Leon dressed them for their first group photo shoot in matching gray schoolgirl uniforms. They wore blazers bearing the name of their competition: Dream Academy.
By November, half of this group was eliminated through a combination of fan voting and judges' evaluations. The culling was chronicled on YouTube. ("We're not forming a friend group, we're forming a girl group," one young woman said during a particularly tense elimination round.)
For the final photo shoot before the six winners were announced, Mr. Leon dressed the trainees now as "elevated" schoolgirls. This time they showed more skin in tailored gray sets, trading their chunky white socks for black mesh, looking like more polished, modern versions of Britney Spears in " ... Baby One More Time," the music video that made a 16-year-old girl a star.
One morning in Hollywood, I watched as Mr. Leon oversaw these final portraits. He reminded one 17-year-old contestant, Megan, to correct her stance. She had a tendency to stand with her legs wide apart, which Mr. Leon had nicknamed "the Megan." As in, "Don't do 'the Megan,' Megan."
Later, while the 10 remaining trainees filmed a music video, I noticed that Megan had a way of staring down the camera with a cool, come-hither expression -- similar to the seductive one Ms. Spears adopted. (Megan, of course, was not yet born when " ... Baby One More Time" was released.)
This tendency was not corrected.
When it came to being sexy, Mr. Leon said he had always told the girls, "Whatever you're doing, do it for yourself, because you want to feel that way."
K-pop, But Not
"Dream Academy" was not Mr. Leon's first time working with a girl group.
In 2021, he met the Linda Lindas, a punk quartet that went viral after performing at the Los Angeles Public Library. At the time, its members were between 10 and 16 years old. They had come to eat at Mr. Leon's restaurant Chifa, named for a Chinese restaurant his mother, Wendy, opened in Peru in the 1970s before the family moved to the United States.
When Mr. Leon offered to direct their first music video, the group said yes. "Growing Up" showed the four girls and four cats shredding in a suburban home, dressed in 1970s-inspired outfits.
When she saw the video, Michelle An, now president of creative strategy at Interscope Geffen A&M, said she thought it was "so cute and so innovative and so appropriate for their age." She was particularly taken with the illustrations of cats painted on the girls' closed eyelids.
Ms. An's job is to help her labels' artists, like Billie Eilish, with "visual world building," she said. "You make this music -- what imagery do you want out there to help your fans understand what this song is trying to say?"
Geffen had an unusual project in the works with Hybe, a Korean entertainment powerhouse. What began as a conversation about music distribution ended with Bang Si-hyuk, the chairman of Hybe, proposing that they build a group together. Hybe would bring elements of K-pop's famously rigorous training and development program -- the same system with which Hybe built BTS -- to the United States for the first time, filling it with trainees from various regions, not just East Asia.
One hurdle, though, was the Americans' concern that the group could seem too factory-produced. "K-pop has a reputation of being manufactured," Ms. An said.
Even outside K-pop, the history of boy bands and girl groups reeks of "not being as organic and real," said John Janick, the chief executive of Interscope Geffen A&M, pointing to glossy reality shows of the 2000s, like "Making the Band."
In order to make the group feel real, the executives said, the girls had to feel real. Their personalities couldn't be forced; there would be no extreme archetypes, no Posh or Sporty or Baby Spice. They needed someone who could draw out the girls' distinct backgrounds and abilities but also make them cohere visually as a group. They were convinced Mr. Leon could be that person.
"In the entertainment business," Mr. Janick said, "everybody wants to have taste, but not all people do."
'A Curious Mind'
Instead of going to fashion school, Mr. Leon likes to say, he worked at the Gap for 10 years.
At 14, he was hired at a store in West Covina, Calif., and learned he had a skill for designing windows. He continued working on visual displays for Gap while attending the University of California, Berkeley. After graduating in 1997, he accepted a corporate job with Old Navy in San Francisco.
In 2000, Mr. Leon left for New York, working at Burberry as the director of visual merchandising.
In 2002, he founded Opening Ceremony with Carol Lim, a college friend.
"We have a similar approach to life," said Ms. Lim, who was the business-minded chief executive to Mr. Leon's creative director. "A curious mind," she called him.
A decade later, having cultivated a Midas-touch reputation for coolness, the duo became design directors at Kenzo, a LVMH-owned brand in Paris.
At Kenzo, Mr. Leon took a particular interest in marketing visuals. Mr. Bang, the Hybe chairman, called a 2016 fragrance advertisement starring a frenetic dancing Margaret Qualley, directed by Spike Jonze, one of his "favorite fashion artworks."
Mr. Leon and Ms. Lim left Kenzo in 2019, then sold Opening Ceremony and closed its stores in 2020, moving to the same neighborhood in Los Angeles to raise their families.
Around this time, Mr. Leon said he had an epiphany: Even if he was "good" at it, he didn't have to keep working in fashion. "I was able to create a feeling, and a feeling can transfer," he said. "I decided to open up my world a bit."
Sometimes Mr. Leon still designs clothes; recently he got a call from the choreographer Justin Peck about creating costumes for a spring performance of the New York City Ballet. But what appeals to him now is making things not for runways but for culture. For example, when Heidi Bivens, the costume designer for "Euphoria," was working on the teen drama's first season, she sourced several outfits from Opening Ceremony. The "'Euphoria' effect" became a phenomenon, inspiring trends in fashion and beauty.
"I went to them, and I said, 'For Season 2, let's design this from scratch, so everything you see on 'Euphoria' is something we've never seen before,"' Mr. Leon said. Consumers could then directly buy the clothes they saw onscreen.
That pitch didn't work out, but it's an idea Mr. Leon still wants to explore.
'Trust Me'
In November, Mr. Leon showed me a video of his twin daughters at their 10th birthday sleepover. In matching pajamas, the girls recreated choreography from a "Dream Academy" mission. (Missions were essentially live music videos in which the trainees' singing and dancing skills were tested.) Five of the trainees had participated in a rump-shaking cover of "Buttons" by the Pussycat Dolls.
The twins had become invested in who would win the competition. So had fans around the world, some of whom paid for billboards in an effort to drum up votes for their favorites, like Sophia (20, Filipina) and Manon (21, Swiss-Ghanaian).
Still, during the 12 weeks that the competition unfolded on YouTube, "Dream Academy" did not exactly become an international phenomenon. Just three of the trainees' 15 missions cracked more than one million views -- somewhat underwhelming by K-pop viewership standards.
Next year, around the time the six winners will release music under their new name, Katseye, the project has another chance to break through. In summer 2024, Netflix will release a documentary series about the competition by Nadia Hallgren, who directed the Michelle Obama documentary "Becoming." This may be the ideal format for capturing the drama, major and minor, of the process.
Within just an hour on set, I watched a trainee in a silver paillette minidress with tendinitis in her knees fight back tears, take after take, while filming a video for an original song called "Dirty Water." I watched another in a tube top and reflective wide-leg pants be told to exert better control over her hair flipping.
I also watched the adults in the room engage in a delicate dance of evaluating, correcting and handling these young women, while trying to be sensitive to the fact that they were young women. (The youngest was 15.)
"Tell the girls it's us, it's not them," the director of one music video instructed an assistant during a technical delay.
In hiring Mr. Leon for the project, Ms. An hoped his experience raising two girls would help in this regard. His first self-appointed task was interviewing each contestant individually before making any decisions on their new looks.
"I wanted to look in their eyes," Mr. Leon said. "I wanted to ask them the hard questions about their upbringing."
He told the trainees who came in wearing heavy makeup to take it off. "I want you to look gorgeous and beautiful, and I want you to be yourself," Mr. Leon recalled saying.
"I think it's hard for people to see themselves," Mr. Leon continued. "You need somebody to tell you that you look amazing without much."
To assist in the makeovers, he brought in stylists who worked on the "The Idol" -- an HBO show about the relationship between a pop star and a cult leader. He brought in the hairstylist to Bella Hadid.
To the 14 trainees who didn't make the final group, he seemed to want to send a message: "I did the best thing I could for you. And you have to trust me."

Twitch Leaves South Korea, Saying Costs Are Prohibitive: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Twitch, once popular among South Korean gamers, will shut its business there in February. Streamers in South Korea would no longer be able to make money through Twitch.
Twitch, the popular video streaming service, will shut down its services in South Korea next year, the company said on Tuesday, after struggling for years with the "prohibitively expensive" costs of operating in the country.
Twitch was one of the most popular platforms for gamers in South Korea, even as it competed with domestic services like AfreecaTV and giants like YouTube, analysts say. The service, owned by Amazon, draws about 35 million visitors a day worldwide, according to the company.
"Twitch was once in the driver's seat among South Korean pro gamers for a while," said Ha Jae-pil, a professor of e-sports at Kookje University in South Korea. Some League of Legends, Overwatch and Apex Legends tournaments in the country were streamed exclusively on Twitch, he said.
Then a downgrade of video quality to a resolution known as 720p, which the company said reduced its operating costs, made text less legible and caused users to jump over to YouTube, he said. "Twitch's influence has been weakened since," he said.
Now, it plans to shut its South Korean business on Feb. 27, 2024. It was not immediately clear whether viewers in South Korea would keep their access to the platform. But the company said that streamers in the country would no longer be able to monetize through Twitch, and that viewers would no longer be able to make purchases on the platform.
"While we have lowered costs from these efforts, our network fees in Korea are still 10 times more expensive than in most other countries," the company said. "Twitch has been operating in Korea at a significant loss, and unfortunately there is no pathway forward for our business to run more sustainably in that country."
South Korea has charged higher network usage fees to foreign content providers, prompting controversy and legal disputes. Netflix recently sued a South Korean internet service provider, arguing that it had no obligation to pay network usage fees. In 2021, a court in Seoul upheld the provider's right to receive such fees.
"I don't understand the higher fees on foreign content providers," said Han Nam Hee, a professor of sports at Korea University, adding that the country should be giving more opportunities to content providers, not less. "This is an unnecessary disruption to streaming and e-sports in South Korea at a time when it needs to keep growing globally."
Daniel Clancy, Twitch's chief executive, said on social media that "this was a very difficult decision that we delayed for some time," adding that he was "aware that this will have a real impact" on Korean streamers.
Signs of struggle at Twitch have emerged gradually over the past year, as it has cut back its services in South Korea. After lowering the video resolution, Twitch in February began blocking South Korean streamers from posting video-on-demand footage, an archive of previously streamed content. In March, the company laid off more than 400 people.
Other than YouTube, Twitch has been the most widely used streaming service among South Korean gamers this year, according to Kiju Kim, an analyst at Hankook Research, a polling company based in Seoul. Twitch attracts about 300,000 South Korean viewers daily, about half of whom are men in their 20s.
Twitch said that it would help South Korean streamers on the platform migrate to alternative services by lifting the ban on broadcasting streams simultaneously on another platform, and by encouraging them to share links to their channels on other services.
"Twitch is the most established gaming and streaming community, and to be losing it is unfathomable," said Alexandria Brooks, an American graduate student in South Korea who has attracted more than 1,100 followers on Twitch while playing Pokémon, Lies of P and Baldur's Gate three times a week. "It hurts."
Ms. Brooks, 28, said that she was considering moving to YouTube, but worried about retaining her American viewers, for whom Twitch remains the dominant streaming service. She was expected to lose several hundred dollars in monthly revenue.
"No one wants to be uprooted from what they're used to," she said.

Much More Of the Same, By Design: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The long-running crime franchises "NCIS" and "Law & Order" continue to endure -- and even expand -- after decades on the air.
Waves slap gently against the shore along the southeast coast of Australia, the morning sun glittering on the horizon. A cheerful swimming teacher is giving her students instructions and then suddenly, panic: A shark appears. It soon swims off, but leaves something behind. Everyone panics again: It's a severed human arm.
This is the opening scene of a recent episode of "NCIS: Sydney," the fifth series in the long-running crime procedural franchise, which premiered on CBS earlier this month. But it could be the opening scene of almost any episode of any "NCIS" series, or of almost any episode of any network crime procedural, from "Law & Order" to "Bones" to "Criminal Minds." The genre is among the most steadfast in television, drawing in many millions of viewers each week with a format that has hardly changed in more than three decades. This new spinoff is more of the same, and that is entirely by design.
"There's definitely a template that I've managed to extract from watching hundreds of hours of the show, a kind of typical 'NCIS' structure," Morgan O'Neill, the creator and showrunner of "NCIS: Sydney," said in a video interview. "That's the overall architecture of the show, and it's always going to be that."
"It still works," O'Neill added. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
The popularity of these shows bears out this wisdom. Television has been in a near constant state of volatility and change in the two decades since "NCIS" premiered, in September 2003, a period that has seen the flourishing of reality and prestige programming, cord-cutting and the fading of cable, and the rise of streaming platforms and their more recent consolidation. Through it all, one constant has been the popularity of procedural franchises like "NCIS" and "Law & Order," which have thrived as purveyors of familiar predictability.
Even after 20 years and nearly 1,000 episodes across the entire franchise, the original "NCIS" remains extraordinarily popular. It has been the No. 1-rated broadcast drama for five seasons running and is one of TV's most-streamed shows. It is the most popular series on its home platform, Paramount+. It also has been among Nielsen's Top 10 most-streamed acquired shows, which refers to series that originate on other platforms, for 201 consecutive weeks as of Nov. 5, the most recent measurement available. (It is also on Netflix.)
"Law & Order" has had more ups and downs since the original debuted in September 1990. But the sex crimes spinoff, "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit," has been a cultural fixture for 24 seasons and counting on NBC, and this franchise, too, is still expanding. "Law & Order Toronto: Criminal Intent" is currently in production.
While early series like "Dragnet" established the police procedural as a reliable TV format, it was the original "Law & Order" that set the modern template that shows like "NCIS" continue to follow, to great success.
That structure is constructed around the "cold open teaser," or "body drop," in which the fresh corpse of the week's victim is discovered; three acts of investigation, broken up by commercial breaks; and a last-act race to catch the perp or secure the evidence to prove guilt "to re-establish order over chaos," O'Neill said. It is how "NCIS" has been written since its debut, and it is how all of the "NCIS" spinoffs, including "NCIS: Hawaiʻi" and "NCIS: New Orleans," are written as well.
"That's almost a relief," O'Neill said. "You don't have to reinvent the wheel every time. It's proved itself as a really fantastically functional structure." While the rigid format discourages experimentation, what is lost in novelty is gained in reliability.
"It's one of those shows that people love to tune in and watch when it airs on Monday nights, and it's been that way for a long time," Amy Reisenbach, the president of CBS Entertainment, said in a video interview. "But it's also one of those shows where you're sick in bed on a Saturday night, and you just pick a random episode and then keep going. We've got a ton of episodes on streaming."
Reisenbach described "NCIS" as "comfort food with a side of murder." Its consistent structure makes it accessible and undemanding, and its crimes, though often violent, are rarely if ever disturbing.
"It's not like 'Game of Thrones,' where it's shocking you with what family member is doing what with whom," Sara Netzley, a journalism professor at Bradley University who writes about "NCIS" for Entertainment Weekly, said in an interview. "There's a crime, we're going to solve the crime, we're going to make some dad jokes and then we'll see you again next week to do it all again."
You don't simply watch "NCIS," she added. You get "swaddled in the show's embrace."
That comforting feeling can be traced back to early "Law & Order," when the series lead Jerry Orbach was often praised for his reassuring warmth and deep inner calm. Like "NCIS," the franchise has maintained an enviable base line of popularity, with "SVU" and its stalwart star, Mariska Hargitay as Olivia Benson, remaining fan favorites even after the original "Law & Order" was canceled in 2010. Since 2021, Hargitay's former "SVU" partner Christopher Meloni has thrived with his own show, "Law & Order: Organized Crime."
The flagship was revived last year with its signature star, Sam Waterston as Jack McCoy, and drew impressive numbers. More than five million people tuned in to the first episode -- technically the Season 21 premiere -- in February 2022, while last year's three-way "Law & Order" crossover special was the most-watched and highest-rated program on the night it aired, on NBC.
"Dick Wolf used to say that 'Law & Order' is like high mass," Peter Jankowski, the president and chief operating officer of Wolf Entertainment and a producer on "Law & Order" and its many spinoffs, said in a recent video interview earlier this month. "You know what's going to happen. It will take you somewhere spiritually and at the end of the hour, hopefully you leave feeling a little more enlightened." (Wolf created the franchise.)
"Law & Order" puts a defining spin on the procedural template, following the cases further into the courtroom and mining drama from the district attorneys and their wrestling over ethical dilemmas. But Jankowski said writing to template doesn't make producing "Law & Order" any easier. Coming up with a new case each week and making the machinations of the case interesting "is like solving a math equation," he said. "It's a very hard thing to do. But when it works, it's magic."
Not every spinoff has been a hit. "Law & Order: Trial by Jury" and "Law & Order: LA" each only lasted a single season before being canceled. "Some things work and some don't, for myriad reasons," Jankowski said. (Other crime dramas under the Wolf Entertainment umbrella, including the multiseries "FBI" and "Chicago" franchises, have built enormous followings with slightly different spins on the procedural format.)
The less successful spinoff efforts suggest that while audience demand for these kinds of shows is high, there is still a risk of diluting the brand.
"It's imperative on us that we don't overtire the franchise," Reisenbach said. "We have to be thoughtful, calculated and specific about when and why we expand. We don't want to print them out like they're little widgets."
"NCIS: Sydney," in particular, was a bit of a fluke. Originally conceived and produced exclusively for Australian television, it was picked up by CBS for broadcast in the United States as a result of the recently ended guild strikes -- a savvy way to skirt the labor disputes and keep new content flowing outward from the network to audience screens.
"It was definitely not intended to be on CBS prime time from the get-go," Reisenbach said. "I can't tell you what would have happened if there hadn't been a strike, but it was like lemonade out of lemons. It fit so perfectly."
While it may not have been made specifically for American audiences, "NCIS: Sydney" still reliably offers the body drop, the investigations, the satisfaction of seeing the heroes solve the crime -- the things many viewers clearly still crave week after week.
"As much as you like to go out to a fancy restaurant now and again, you generally come home and you're still hungry," O'Neill said. "You drive past McDonalds and you think, 'I wouldn't mind that.' I think these shows have a real comfort food value, and there are whole generations of people who have grown up on that comfort food."

Wall Street Loses Ground Ahead of Key Reports on Job Market: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street gave back some of its recent gains Monday as stocks finished lower ahead of some key reports this week on the job market that might provide more insight into the Federal Reserve's thinking about interest rates.
The S&P 500 closed 0.5 percent lower. The benchmark index was coming off its best month in more than a year, and reached its highest level in more than a year on Friday.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1 percent, while the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.8 percent.
Treasury yields rose broadly, putting some pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, climbed to 4.25 percent from 4.21 percent late Friday.
Technology and communication services companies were the biggest weights on the market. Microsoft fell 1.4 percent, Nvidia dropped 2.7 percent, Meta Platforms slid 1.5 percent and Netflix lost 2.5 percent.
Alaska Air Group slumped 14.2 percent after announcing it will buy Hawaiian Airlines in a $ 1.9 billion deal, including the assumption of debt, a tie-up that would test the Biden administration as it fights consolidation in the airline sector.
Spotify surged 7.5 percent after announcing its third round of layoffs this year. Uber gained 2.2 percent after the ride-hailing service was named to join the S&P 500 index.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 24.85 points to 4,569.78. The Dow dropped 41.06 points to 36,204.44, and the Nasdaq gave up 119.54 points to 14,185.49.
Markets ended mixed in Europe and Asia.
U.S. crude oil prices fell 1.4 percent. Oil prices have been slipping recently, helping ease pressure on inflation.
Wall Street is coming off a solid week and a strong November on hopes that inflation is easing enough to allow the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates. Investors are also hoping that the economy remains strong enough to avoid a recession.
Investors will get several key updates on the economy this week, including reports on the services sector and the jobs market.
The Institute for Supply Management will release its November report on the services sector on Tuesday. The sector is a key component in the U.S. economy and accounts for the majority of the nation's jobs. The report could provide more insight into consumer spending and the jobs market.
Wall Street will get several reports this week that focus on the broader employment picture in the United States. The government will release its October update on job openings on Tuesday and a weekly report on applications for unemployment benefits on Thursday.
Investors will be closely watching the government's monthly jobs report for November, which is on Friday. Analysts polled by FactSet expect U.S. employers to have added 175,000 jobs last month. They forecast that the unemployment rate remained steady at 3.9 percent.
The labor market has remained strong in the United States even as the Fed has raised interest rates sharply in order to fight inflation by slowing the entire economy. Inflation has been falling since the middle of 2022. The central bank paused raising rates after its most recent increase in late July.
Wall Street expects rates to remain steady into early 2024, when the Fed could begin cutting interest rates back from their highest level in two decades. The Fed's next decision on rates will follow the close of their next two-day meeting on Dec. 13.
"We're expecting to have a quiet, or at least a consensus outcome, from the Federal Reserve meeting and therefore the trends that are in place are likely to have more likelihood to continue," said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

At Ease Playing A Princess: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: In "The Crown," the story of Diana, Princess of Wales, could only ever end one way. For Elizabeth Debicki, who played Diana in Seasons 5 and 6 of the Netflix series about the British royal family, the scenes that anticipate the inexorable tragedy in a Paris tunnel were both easy and terrible to shoot.
The terrible part was the responsibility. Diana had been a real person, a mother. She had really died in just this way, in a high-speed crash while fleeing a horde of paparazzi. Debicki, who took over the role from Emma Corrin, felt that she owed it to the viewers, many of whom remember Diana, to play the role with perfect accuracy and heart.
The ease came from having already played the character for a whole season. In Season 6, the voice, the gestures -- those came naturally. Debicki, who grew up in Melbourne, Australia, employed a coastal metaphor. "By that time, I was in the water," she said. "Like, I'm here. Let's swim."
The current was with her. Throughout Season 6 there are scenes of Diana and her new boyfriend, Dodi al-Fayed (Khalid Abdalla), fleeing the paparazzi. "It's quite literally hours and hours and hours spent inside cars with people yelling and banging on the windows," she said. "Pulling up, getting out, the absolute roar of sound, into the building, door shut, safe. And then we do it all again."
It felt exhausting, it felt frightening, it felt very real. When it came time to shoot Diana's final evening, Debicki wasn't acting so much as reacting, she said, letting her body respond to the banging, to the roar of stunt-driven motorcycles gunning past.
"A lot of making this show, it's just a surrender," Debicki said. "This part of the story was really dark and difficult. I just thought, I just have to go there."
Debicki, chic in a corduroy pantsuit and flats, was speaking on an afternoon in mid-November, just after the release of the first part of the sixth and final season of "The Crown." At 6-feet-3-inches she is even taller than Diana and much less diffident. She looks at a person directly, not sideways or upward through her lashes. Still, she and Diana share a gently wicked sense of humor. "They both enjoy teasing," Abdalla, her co-star, said in a recent phone interview.
Sometimes Debicki turns the teasing on herself, as she did that afternoon, stretched out, fitfully, on a sofa at a downtown hotel. (Unlike her onscreen personae, she is more fidgety than languorous.) She was considering how "The Crown" is the third project (after "The Night Manager" and "Tenet") to have cast her as a sad, elegant woman who spends a lot of time on boats. "Me and boats," she sighed. "Me and the boat."
She never properly auditioned to play Diana, on land or on a yacht. After the first season of "The Crown," she read for a guest role. She didn't get it. But her agent told her that the show might want her later on for Diana. Debicki didn't trust it. She didn't see the resemblance and she has never played an ingénue-type role. Even as a 17-year-old drama school student, she played widows, wives and mothers, women who were older and worldlier. Once Corrin was announced as Diana in Season 4, she gave up on the role entirely.
But Peter Morgan, the creator of "The Crown," had always intended for Debicki to play an older Diana. "She was only ever in a group of one for me," he wrote in a recent email. "If she had turned us down, I'd have had no option but to write the show differently." They met at Morgan's house, just before the pandemic shutdown. Debicki was so flustered that she accidentally walked out with one of Morgan's books. Morgan insisted that she keep it.
Debicki then set sail on "this endless sea of research," she said, reading through boxes of documentation, examining photographs, watching videos. Perfecting Diana's specific dialect and cadence -- soft, aristocratic, often stronger at the beginning of the sentence than the end -- was of supreme importance. She also had to master the princess's gait and gestural language. Then she had to do the hardest work, building the personality and memories that would make a person move and speak that way.
"As an actor studying a character, there's nothing more you could ask for than the challenge of blurring the real life and the imaginary," she said. The Diana she created is glamorous, wounded, playful, knowing.
She gave a lot of herself to that creation, but Diana, she believes, gave back. "Playing this character let me love people around me," she said. "Maybe it sounds really corny or something, but I gave myself full permission to just absolutely love these people."
Diana was perhaps the most beloved of the royals and as Debicki began to shoot Season 5, she absorbed some of that adoration. On location people would often come up to her as if she were Diana, asking to speak to her, wanting her to hold her baby. But in the scripted scenes, which mostly had to do with her separation and divorce from Prince Charles (Dominic West), she experienced the converse, a sense of isolation.
That made Season 6, at least at the start, something of a relief. Having the CCTV footage of Diana and Fayed on the night they died, she and Abdalla agreed that they saw a real intimacy there, maybe even real love.
Was Debicki's Diana easy to fall in love with? "Absolutely," Abdalla said. "We both wanted to find that tenderness and that sense of fun."
The scenes on Fayed's father's yachts and the scenes with Diana's sons, these were mostly a pleasure. Determined to play against the end, Debicki said she discovered "these really delightful moments where she's having a lovely, lovely time and things are really easy and carefree and actually the future is like very bright."
Debicki is lucky enough to have never been stalked by the paparazzi. "I'm not particularly interesting in that way," she demurred. The scenes of them pursuing Diana hit her hard, and that pursuit intensifies until, at the end of the third episode, Diana has nowhere left to run.
Morgan opted to show neither the crash nor Diana's eventual death in a hospital, a choice with which Debicki agrees. "I don't think it's at all necessary," she said. "You must proceed with enormous respect and caution because this was a real person and a profound and horrific tragedy."
Even so and even though the great majority of her scenes wrapped a year ago, she doesn't feel that she has entirely escaped the character or that tragedy. To play Diana meant taking on the love and adoration and exquisite vulnerability, and also the pain. None of which has washed away. She is still in the water, still swimming.
"I'm still maybe a bit emotionally stuck in," she said. "I don't really think I've left it is the honest answer."

Beyoncé Takes the Stage As More Than Just a Star: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: She is essentially one on the new film, but she has also demonstrated throughout her career just who is in charge of her art.
"I'm excited for people to see the show," Beyoncé says early in "Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé," based on her recent world tour and seventh studio album. "But I'm really excited for everyone to see the process."
I've long wanted to understand her process better, too, especially because she has taken to rarely giving interviews. Instead she has let her art speak for itself, a risky venture when critics do the interpreting without her input. My interest in her approach is partly scholarly. I regularly teach courses on her and want my students to learn from her observations. But my enthusiasm is also speculative. I often wonder whether our ignorance of her creative practice has minimized and denied her innovation, ingenuity and individual contributions to her own body of work.
If "Renaissance" was only a film about her beaming audience, dazzling performances and the making of the tour, that would be more than enough. However, it's clear early on that Beyoncé is not entirely interested in fetishizing her "process" to validate her artistry. Instead, the movie deconstructs its subject to expand our understanding of her. More poignantly, it critiques how race, gender and genre have limited our ability to see her talent and, by doing so, liberates her from ever again having to prove her singular impact on American culture.
It does so by quickly establishing her creative control. The concert itself reveled in Beyoncé's simultaneous mastery of dance, music, fashion and live performance, which makes her unparalleled among artists today. On the other hand, the film shows her working backstage and sometimes even underneath it. As the tour director, executive producer and creative director, she oversaw everything from hiring and salaries to musical selections, marketing, choreography, costumes and video.
But what makes "Renaissance" unique among other great concert films is that she did not just star in it the way the Talking Heads did in Jonathan Demme's classic "Stop Making Sense" or Madonna in Alek Keshishian's provocative "Truth or Dare." Beyoncé also wrote, directed and produced the film. In fact, she has created some of the past decade's most memorable cinematic musical experiences and should be considered an auteur -- in terms of both this film and her career.
In this way, "Renaissance" is the culmination of her film projects, beginning with the visual albums "Beyoncé" (2013) and "Lemonade" (2016); her intimate documentary "Life Is but a Dream" (2013); the 2019 Coachella concert film "Homecoming"; and "Black Is King" (2020), the visual companion she and Blitz Bazawule made for the soundtrack "The Lion King: The Gift." But by offering the most in-depth document of her vision, preparation and personal sacrifice, the new film goes further than these productions.
The film opens with Beyoncé commanding our attention in a black gauzy dress, her hair blowing as she belts "Dangerously in Love 2." She later revisits that moment through a flashback showing her at work with her production team. Via voice-overs and close-ups of her in far more casual clothing, we watch as she gives her team notes about camera angles, lighting and the speed and direction of the mechanical fans. If only we could rewind to that first performance to better appreciate all the technical components that went into making that moment appear so flawless.
In another scene in which the entire sound system cuts out as she sings "Alien Superstar" in Glendale, Ariz., the tension really mounts. She and her dancers leave the stage immediately. That's all the live audience knows. But as a film director, she has the cameras follow her backstage to capture her audio team's update ("It will be back on in three minutes"). Within that short period, she convinces the wardrobe department she has enough time for a quick costume change, then, in a new outfit, meets with her head of music production to test a new transition to the next song. It is an exhilarating sequence that makes her seamless comeback to the stage even more admirable and shows her remarkable sense of timing and tension as a storyteller and filmmaker.
These moments pose the question of why it took her so long to exhibit such a thrilling illustration of her leadership. And then I realized: We were the problem; we just hadn't listened to her.
Beyoncé has spent most of her career telling us she was in charge. As far back as 2004, "Beyoncé: Live at Wembley," a concert film about her first solo tour, featured the artist at 22 as well as its creative director, Kim Burse, and choreographer, Frank Gatson, discussing how the headliner had helped conceive the show and chose its costumes, songs and choreography. Subsequent documentaries like the short "Beyoncé: Year of 4" and "Life Is but a Dream" focused even more intensely on her artistic independence after she split from her father and longtime manager, Mathew Knowles, and started her own company, Parkwood, to manage herself.
She returned to this theme of independence again in "Homecoming," when, cinéma vérité-style, she shares the inspiration she found in the Battle of the Bands of historically Black colleges and universities; her use of three different sound stages to rehearse with the band, the dancers and her production team; and her intricate collaboration with Balmain's Olivier Rousteing to design more than 200 outfits for the show. "In the rehearsals, I am directing and watching the show," she says in "Homecoming" and notes, "I'm in the audience, and I'm able to be on the stage and kind of see the stage at the same time."
And yet even in "Homecoming," she points out how her team tried to ignore her directives in the lead-up to Coachella. At one point, she expresses her frustration to a film crew that isn't listening to her when she describes what it will take to translate the energetic performances from the stage to the screen. "Until I see some of my notes applied," an exasperated Beyoncé warns, "it doesn't make sense for me to make more."
But in "Renaissance," she explains her crew's dismissiveness. "Communicating as a Black woman, everything is a fight," she says, and adds, "I constantly have to repeat myself." In back-to-back scenes, she shows what that looks like when she tries to buy two pieces of camera equipment to film her show. A team member informs her that a lens is unavailable, only to eventually admit that he can find it after she doubts him. In the next scene, she readies herself for the pushback. When someone else tells her a camera track does not exist, she reveals she has already found it online, so it just needs to be purchased. While this exchange is humorous, it is not minor. It is the frequency that makes the second-guessing larger-than-life and, unfortunately, far too relatable, especially for many Black women in positions of authority.
Management is one challenge; motherhood is far more demanding. The film pivots to Beyoncé's ambivalence in allowing her older daughter, Blue Ivy, to perform with her on tour, only for Beyoncé to witness her growth as a young artist. And when we watch Beyoncé thank her mother, Tina Knowles, for protecting her from the more vicious aspects of the music industry, we realize not only that Ms. Tina is her maternal template, but also that Beyoncé herself considers her three children, including the twins, Rumi and Sir, fuel for her creative process rather than fully outside of it.
After these exchanges, "Renaissance" opens up more and allows its star to reject the idea of solitary genius. Through archival footage, photographs and shots of dancers onstage, Beyoncé showcases the Black queer ballroom culture that inspired her album and concert choreography. She also pays homage to iconic Black women like Diana Ross and Tina Turner, who influenced her career, and to her hometown, Houston, where she was a founding member of the girl group Destiny's Child. By exploring her indebtedness to a people and place, she confidently embraces her own contributions alongside those of her community and her collaborators. The payoff: She paints a more transparent portrait of the creative process.
Whether "Renaissance" will dampen criticism regarding her generous sharing of credits or drive a new appreciation of her artistry remains to be seen. By the end, Beyoncé declares she is ready for the next phase of her life and finally feels free.
May this film be the last time she has to repeat herself.

A 'Life of Contrasts' and Renewals: [Style Desk]

Full text: This month, writer Suleika Jaouad revisits her second bone marrow transplant in the documentary "American Symphony."
In the months following Suleika Jaouad's second bone marrow transplant, her TikTok algorithm started serving her videos of bearded dragons shedding their skin. For a writer whose work deals in ambiguities, that metaphor was tidier than she'd have preferred.
Ms. Jaouad quotes Joan Didion and Emily Dickinson in casual conversation. She is the author of "Between Two Kingdoms: A Memoir of Life Interrupted," a best seller which documents her first bone marrow transplant and its aftermath. Diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in 2011, Ms. Jaouad recorded the experience in real time for a column in this paper.
"Why am I drawn to these?" Ms. Jaouad, now 35, wondered of the reptilian videos. She posed the question while settling into the crook of her couch at her home in Brooklyn, with a lunch spread laid out over a low table in front of her. Her dog River ogled some baba ganoush from the perch near her feet.
More than time-tested sonnets and snippets of Buddhist wisdom, it was molting bearded dragons that seemed to tell the truth about what Ms. Jaouad called, "the experience of forced renewal." She too had molted -- twice now. And like the lizards, she had no choice but to be vulnerable. "I was so stripped bare, I felt larval," said Ms. Jaouad.
This month, Ms. Jaouad will revisit the raw period of her cancer recurrence and second transplant when the feature documentary "American Symphony" premieres on Netflix in collaboration with Barack and Michelle Obama's production company, Higher Ground. The work follows Ms. Jaouad and her husband, the musician Jon Batiste, as the couple faces what Ms. Jaouad has called their "life of contrasts." Both Ms. Jaouad and Mr. Batiste serve as executive producers.
Just how stark are the contrasts? In November 2021, Ms. Jaouad learned her cancer had returned. That same week, Mr. Batiste earned 11 Grammy nominations -- the most of any artist. The night before Ms. Jaouad checked into the hospital for her transplant, the two -- who met as middle schoolers at band camp and later reconnected -- married at home and swapped twist-tie rings.
Meanwhile, Mr. Batiste continued both to serve as bandleader on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" and to compose a one-time performance at Carnegie Hall in New York (also called "American Symphony") that would distill the whole of American history into sound. In her sterile room, Ms. Jaouad started to paint and papered her walls in vibrant, sometimes gruesome watercolor.
None of this was supposed to happen.
As in the lead-up to her initial diagnosis, Ms. Jaouad had been negotiating persistent fatigue for months when she went to see her doctors for tests.
It had been over a decade since Ms. Jaouad's first bone marrow transplant. Her own medical team was so convinced of her durable health that the biopsy she insisted on was deemed a kind of indulgence. Minutes before the procedure, a nurse told her she didn't have to do it. "I felt embarrassed," Ms. Jaouad said. "I felt like I was being a hysterical, melodramatic hypochondriac." She almost backed out, but the writer Elizabeth Gilbert -- a friend and mentor -- had driven her to the appointment. She didn't want Ms. Gilbert to feel she had wasted her time.
Doctors ground into Ms. Jaouad's spine to extract a sample of her marrow. Ms. Gilbert stood watch, calling the ordeal "grisly as hell." The relapse "simply wasn't supposed to happen," she wrote in an email. "There was no template for it, which was why nobody was looking for it."
"I was right to push for the biopsy," said Ms. Jaouad. "I wish I hadn't been."
The filmmaker Matthew Heineman had already started production on what would become "American Symphony" when Ms. Jaouad's results came in. Mr. Heineman, who directed "Cartel Land" and "A Private War," had been interested in shadowing Mr. Batiste as he devised the Carnegie Hall piece. Ms. Jaouad's recurrence necessitated -- as Mr. Heineman put it -- a "pivot."
Ms. Jaouad was not sure she wanted to function as a plot twist.
"I never want to be flattened into 'the sick girl,"' Ms. Jaouad said of her deliberations. "I said to Matt outright, 'I don't want to be the dramatic counterpoint to Jon's meteoric success."' Mr. Heineman insisted he too was uninterested in the tropes of the illness plot. In "American Symphony" no one feels an errant lump. Ms. Jaouad doesn't have a dramatic phone call with her oncologist. Viewers discover she has cancer in the middle of a fierce snowball fight in which Ms. Jaouad -- struck and faux-outraged -- protests: No hitting the girl with leukemia.
Ms. Jaouad came around on the project as she did on "Between Two Kingdoms." Then too, she had been hesitant. Ms. Jaouad recalled an encounter with the writer Cheryl Strayed not long after her first transplant. She told Ms. Strayed she wanted to write a book, but not one about illness. Ms. Strayed told her she had once been determined to avoid writing about the death of her mother. Then she turned in the manuscript for "Wild: Lost and Found on the Pacific Crest Trail."
"It's about the hike, but it's all about her dead mother," Ms. Jaouad said with a smile.
Ms. Jaouad's book, and to some extent, "The Isolation Journals," a popular newsletter she launched at the outset of the pandemic, explores how to re-enter the world after devastation. "American Symphony" follows up: How to keep going when there's no straightforward "after."
So when it came time to watch an initial cut of the film (drawn from 1,500 hours of footage), Ms. Jaouad queued it up alone. "I feel a bit desensitized to it now," she said. "That specific time is not representative of how I live or who I am." But she has "no qualms" about her depiction or the decision to let Mr. Heineman film the crucial appointment three months post-transplant in which she would learn if her transplant worked. Mr. Heineman thus found out at the same time she and Mr. Batiste did that the procedure had been a success -- and that Ms. Jaouad would have to be in treatment to outwit her cancer for the rest of her life.
"To describe it as a roller coaster would be an insult to roller coasters," Ms. Jaouad said of her emotional whiplash. "The idea of indefinite treatment thrust me into a whole different kind of in-between place, and it's one that I'm still learning to swim in."
"She's able to transform darkness, alchemize darkness, and transmutate darkness into light," Mr. Batiste said in a phone interview. (He called hours after still more Grammy nominations. This year, he earned six, including one for "Butterfly" -- the song that plays in the "American Symphony" trailer and which he wrote for Ms. Jaouad.) "She's able to look into what she's facing and see not only how she can find God and find healing through it, but also provide that insight to hundreds of thousands and millions of other people out there whom she's never met."
Necessary Optimism
After the film premiered at the Telluride Film Festival, Ms. Jaouad recalled that someone in the crowd approached her and said how relieved she was: "You're still here."
"When it comes to illness stories, we tell them from the vantage point of having survived," Ms. Jaouad said. In that sense, "American Symphony," which stops short of a white-text-black-screen epilogue and offers no update on Ms. Jaouad's health, is a corrective. "It wasn't clear that I was going to survive the shooting period of this," she said. The credits roll, but there is no neat ending for Ms. Jaouad and Mr. Batiste.
"None of us know if we're going to exist in the future, but I have a heightened fear of not existing in the future," Ms. Jaouad said.
In "Between Two Kingdoms" Ms. Jaouad writes about her exchanges with a man named Quintin Jones. Mr. Jones, who introduces himself to her as "Lil GQ," read her columns while on death row. He'd written from a place of recognition -- one trapped person to another. After her transplant, she visited him in prison. But the week her book was released, he was given an execution date. Ms. Jaouad was devastated. She threw herself into the movement to get his death sentence converted into a life sentence. It didn't work.
On the morning of his execution, Mr. Jones was granted four hours of phone calls. He spent them with Mr. Batiste and Ms. Jaouad. "It was unbelievable because we were talking in the future tense, knowing that the future wasn't going to come to pass," Ms. Jaouad said. "He talked about coming to visit us, hanging out in our garden. We were all just choosing to live in that space." She tried to explain the suspension. Their conscious decision to be outside of time.
Lately, Ms. Jaouad is forcing herself to make plans. She sees it as an act of "necessary optimism" that she has committed to write two more books. One will be a work of painting and prose that Ms. Jaouad has titled "Drowning Practice." The second will be a book about journaling, incorporating writing prompts. She will show her work at the art center ArtYard next summer.
A few weeks ago, Ms. Jaouad traveled to Seattle and was walking outside, suddenly under a torrential rain. Someone rushed to offer her an umbrella. "I was like, 'No, I'm good,"' Ms. Jaouad remembered. She wanted to feel the rain on her face. Back in New York, she let herself fantasize. Not about prizes or red carpets, but about some unspecial rainstorm a decade from now. How incredible it would be not to feel new, she said. "If I'm around, I'll want the umbrella."

Full text: Shortly after meeting online, Julia Elbaba traveled from New York to Virginia to see Matthew Nevulis. When the Covid lockdown began, seven days extended into three months of living together.
When Julia Margaux Elbaba and Dr. Matthew George Nevulis matched on Bumble in early 2019, neither was in a position to make a long-distance relationship work. Dr. Nevulis lived in Charlottesville, Va., where he was completing his medical residency at the University of Virginia. Ms. Elbaba was traveling the world as a professional tennis player, with a home base in Oyster Bay, N.Y.
The two chatted on the app, but dropped it with, "If you're ever in New York ..."
Months later, in December 2019, Dr. Nevulis was in New York. He was driving back to Virginia from visiting his family in Albany, N.Y., and texted Ms. Elbaba. He could meet her on Long Island.
In fact, he could meet her for even longer. He had matched for his fellowship at a hospital in New York City. He'd be moving closer to her in June 2020 and wondered if they might work out after all.
"I tell him to this day that the text message means so much to me," Ms. Elbaba said.
The couple met at Bar Frites in Greenvale, N.Y., and had a great conversation. "It was a deep connection," Ms. Elbaba said.
She planned a visit to Charlottesville in February 2020. A graduate of the University of Virginia herself, where she earned a bachelor's degree in media studies, Ms. Elbaba said her weeklong trip was to see her former tennis coach and friends. But she admits a big motivation was to see Dr. Nevulis for seven back-to-back dates.
Seven days turned into three months. Covid lockdown commenced while she was in Virginia, and she didn't feel comfortable getting on a plane back to New York. The two quickly fell into a routine: cooking dinner, running errands, taking picnics on hikes and cozying up with Netflix.
Ms. Elbaba said it was a seamless transition. But as a traditionalist at heart, she didn't know if she should be living with someone she had just met so soon. When Covid restrictions were lifted, the couple went back to living separately in the New York City area. Dr. Nevulis, now a doctor with NYC Health & Hospitals, moved in June 2020 for a fellowship in pulmonary critical care at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. He is a graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and attended medical school at New York Medical College.
Ms. Elbaba then made a personal decision: She was ready to move on from professional tennis and settle down. At the time, she was recovering from an athletic injury and began reporting on high school sports part-time for Newsday. Ms. Elbaba said she wanted a relationship and family, but realized that she needed to be less nomadic, so she decided to lean into a career as a journalist.

By September 2022, the couple felt "things fell into place very easily," Ms. Elbaba said. They formed close bonds with each other's friends and family. Ms. Elbaba was by then working as a digital editor for NBCUniversal, where she continues to cover sports. Dr. Nevulis was finishing his medical training and sensed the time was right in their professional lives and their relationship for the next step.
"When you're playing a chess match well, things just flow," Dr. Nevulis said. "When you're not, you have to force things. I looked at it from that standpoint, and it was a no-brainer."
Ms. Elbaba was busy covering the U.S. Open, so he treated her to lunch on her one day off. The couple ate at Harvest on Hudson, in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and then took a walk along the water in Tarrytown, where he proposed.
The couple now lives in Tarrytown, and "serendipitously" can see their proposal spot from their apartment window.
Ms. Elbaba, 29, and Dr. Nevulis, 32, married on Nov. 18 at Hempstead House, in Sands Point, N.Y. The couple's friend, Anthony Foggia, who is a Universal Life Church minister, officiated. The couple took advantage of the unseasonably warm weather and hosted an outdoor ceremony in the afternoon sunshine with their 125 guests and performed a choreographed first dance at the reception to Elton John's "Can You Feel the Love Tonight."
"Our love is like a tennis match," Ms. Elbaba said. "We're scoring in time and serve is on. We don't have to force the game to win."

'Mistake' in Tell-All Reignites Royal Racism Furor in Britain: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The rollout of "Endgame" caused a scandal after a quickly withdrawn translation named family members said to have asked about the skin color of Prince Harry and Meghan's future son.
As book rollouts go, the one for Omid Scobie's latest offering about the British royal family, "Endgame," has been a hot mess -- splashy, gaudy, tantalizing but ultimately a bit withholding -- which is to say, par for the course for a putative tell-all account of the world's most covered, least decoded family.
The withholding part involves an unconfirmed, thoroughly radioactive nugget that turned up in the Dutch edition of Mr. Scobie's book, published on Tuesday: the identity of two members of the royal family who once reportedly expressed concerns about the skin color of the unborn child of Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan.
Mr. Scobie's Dutch publisher, Xander, quickly withdrew the book from shelves and online sites in the Netherlands at the behest of the author and his agent, citing an unspecified "mistake" that it said would be corrected in time for the book to go back on sale on Dec. 8. The family members are not identified in either the British or American editions, which were published by imprints of HarperCollins.
But the uncorrected version of "Endgame" was out long enough in Amsterdam and other cities for readers to buy it and for one name to circulate widely on social media (the second royal name appeared elsewhere in the book, though it was less directly attached to the reported incident). It all led to a nursery school's worth of peekaboo headlines in London tabloids on Wednesday.
"Book Names 'Royal Racist,"' said The Daily Mirror. "Scobie Book Pulled for Naming 'Royal Racist' by Mistake," added The Daily Mail. "Royals United Against 'Mischief Making Smears,"' proclaimed The Daily Express, helpfully adding a photo of King Charles III and his elder son and heir, Prince William.
None of the British papers initially published the name, referring only to a "senior royal." But anyone equipped with an iPhone and Google could figure it out in less than 30 seconds. On Wednesday evening, the broadcaster Piers Morgan finally spilled the beans on his aptly named show, "Piers Morgan Uncensored." The royals in question, he said, were Charles and Catherine, Princess of Wales.
Mr. Morgan said that British taxpayers, who support the royal family, deserved to know what Dutch readers knew, expressing hope that his disclosure would prompt "a more open debate about this whole farrago." Mr. Morgan, whose antipathy for Meghan is well-documented and was on display again on Wednesday, said he did not believe that "any racist comments were made by any member of the royal family."
On Thursday afternoon, The Guardian became the first British paper to publish the names on its website. The fact that the British press has been so reluctant, despite the names being broadcast on TV and all over the internet, attests to both Britain's stringent libel and privacy laws and to the leverage that the royal family exerts over the press. The Mail said on its front page on Thursday that Mr. Morgan's unveiling would cause "outrage."
Buckingham Palace declined to comment, as did Kensington Palace, where William and Catherine, his wife, have their offices.
The tempest is a revealing media story but it is also the long tail of a family psychodrama that stretches back to the sensational interview Harry and Meghan gave to Oprah Winfrey in March 2021. In it, Meghan, a biracial, American former actress, said Harry had been in conversations about his future son, Archie, in which family members voiced concerns about "how dark his skin might be when he's born."
Meghan declined to say who, though Ms. Winfrey later ruled out Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip. In a carefully worded response at the time, the palace said "recollections may vary," and promised to address Meghan's concerns privately.
The couple has seemed eager to play down the incident ever since. It was not mentioned in a six-part Netflix documentary, "Harry & Meghan," that aired plenty of other dirty laundry. Harry steered clear of it in "Spare," his otherwise unsparing memoir, and he denied suggestions of racism in his family. There is a difference, he said in an interview last January, "between racism and unconscious bias."
This latest eruption captures one of the odd paradoxes of royal coverage in the social media age. While Harry and William have lashed out at relentless, often inaccurate, coverage by the tabloid press, some of the ripest morsels about the House of Windsor never surface in the papers. They lurk in the murky depths of Facebook or X, formerly known as Twitter, widely shared and easily accessible, but lacking the Fleet Street imprimatur that the royal family both loathes and covets.
In this case, the story is further complicated by Mr. Scobie, whose previous book, "Finding Freedom," which he co-wrote with Carolyn Durand, earned him a reputation as being very close to Harry and Meghan. Meghan, it emerged later, had authorized an aide to brief him about her side of the couple's bitter rupture with the family.
In "Endgame," Mr. Scobie styles himself as a lone wolf who operates outside what he calls the "self-regulated pack of journalists, who just like the White House press pool, shadow the family on their various endeavors." He added, "Parts of this book will burn my bridges for good," which seems like a good bet.
Mr. Scobie did not answer two requests for comment.
In an interview with Dutch television, he said he did not identify family members as making comments about skin color and had no idea how the names wound up in the Dutch translation. The book does refer to letters between Meghan and Charles, then the Prince of Wales, in which the two discussed the issue, and which Mr. Scobie said resulted in the couple not raising it again.
The publication of the names was brought to light by Rick Evers, a Dutch royal reporter, who said he came across them as he was reading the book. He posted a screenshot of one page, along with an English translation, on his X account, which refers to letters between Meghan and Charles. A later reference to the Princess of Wales being involved in conversations about Archie is less specific.
The managing director of the publisher, Anke Roelen, said it would investigate how the names ended up in the book. "It was an extremely precise process that took months," she said. "So, we are very careful with drawing any conclusions."
Dutch publishing executives were skeptical that a translator would have added the names. "The only thing I can think of that could have happened is that the translator translated from an early pass" of the manuscript, said Willem Bisseling, a literary agent at Sebes & Bisseling. "But that's just a guess."
Some speculated that the libel laws had handcuffed Mr. Scobie as tightly as the press. Daniel Taylor, a media lawyer at the London firm Taylor Hampton, said the author and his publisher were at risk of a defamation suit if the people who made the comments "were deemed to be racist in posing the question" about the child's skin color.
"If the names were included in the book by mistake without sufficient evidence to back up who made the allegation or the circumstances in which it was made," Mr. Taylor added, "that may have led to a decision to pulp the copies."
Legal peril aside, the hubbub is a bookseller's dream for Mr. Scobie, especially after his book received a ho-hum critical reception.
"Readers hoping for a final death blow of gossip will be disappointed," The New York Times said in its review. "We've heard much of it before. From Fergie, from Diana, from Charles, from Harry, from Harry, from Harry again."

Full text: Our TV critic recommends an adorable kids' show, a standup showcase and a renovation show with intriguing projects.
This weekend I have ... a half-hour, and I swear it gets dark by lunchtime.
'Shape Island'
When to watch: Now, on Apple TV+.
This gentle show for the nursery-school set has a new holiday special in which Triangle and Circle attempt to cheer up Square with a celebration of "Yeti Night." Sure, they have invented the holiday as an antidote to their pal's precocious seasonal depression, but who doesn't love an excuse to bake muffins? "Shape" has a chic, perhaps even aspirational aesthetic, but this episode reminds me of the dreamy poetics of the shaggier "Fraggle Rock," whose characters also celebrate a faux holiday and express themselves with a startling poignancy. "The Winter Blues" arrives Friday, and the previous nine episodes of "Shape Island" are just as darling.
... two hours, and variety is the spice of life.
'Verified Stand-up'
When to watch: Now, on Netflix.
This two-part stand-up showcase features 10 different comedians who cover a range of style and ability, even if the premises they draw on are often weirdly similar. (Rosebud Baker is among the breakouts, with a set about the horrors of pregnancy.) "Verified" seems like a contemporary recapitulation of "Premium Blend" or "Def Comedy Jam," series in which emerging comics step a little closer to the spotlight. But unlike in those shows of yore, there is no bigger star anchoring the proceedings in "Verified," so there is also a feeling akin to flipping through TikTok, watching highlights. If you like being an early adopter, watch this.
... several hours, and I watch lots of barn stuff on YouTube.
'Restoration Road With Clint Harp'
When to watch: Now, on Discovery+ and Max.
Season 4 of this amiable lifestyle series, hosted by Clint Harp, is now streaming (and airing on Tuesdays on Magnolia). As with previous installments, it features intriguing projects -- reassembling grain silos as cottages! turning an Ohio barn into a Texas wedding venue! -- with lots of cool tidbits about history, joinery and the history of joinery. The final reveals here are often the least compelling part (no, I do not think that garage looks like it was always part of that church, thank you very much), but the processes are uniformly interesting. If you've ever disassembled something and thought "I should probably keep very careful track of exactly which piece is which ....eh, I'm sure either I'll remember or it won't matter," and then that plan did not work out, watch this.

American Symphony: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This portrait of the musician Jon Batiste and the author Suleika Jaouad follows an artistic couple through ambition and adversity.
Partway through "American Symphony," the musician Jon Batiste pokes gentle fun at the coverage he received in advance of the 2022 Grammys. The breadth of his 11 nominations, which bridged pop, jazz and classical categories, made him tough to label. He ultimately fended off Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish to win album of the year.
This documentary, directed by Matthew Heineman, is likewise deceptively tricky to peg. In the broad strokes, it is a process film, following Batiste, who grew up in the New Orleans area and trained at Juilliard, as he prepares a wildly original symphony that shares a title with the movie. "My ambition for composing this symphony is massive," he says. "I'm trying to expand the canon of symphonic music, break through long-gatekept spaces."
(Ben Sisario, writing in The New York Times, described the piece, which premiered at Carnegie Hall in 2022, as a "Whitmanesque canvas of funk, Dixieland jazz, operatic vocals and Native American drums.")
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
But this is also a movie about two artists, their love, their creative attitudes and how, as a couple, they approach living a "life of contrasts." That description comes from the writer Suleika Jaouad, Batiste's partner (they marry during the film), whose best-selling memoir, "Between Two Kingdoms," was published in 2021 and who, before college, studied at Juilliard herself, with a specialization in double bass.
As Batiste gets ready for his Grammy and Carnegie Hall coups, Jaouad undergoes a bone marrow transplant after a recurrence of cancer. (She received her first leukemia diagnosis at 22, and from 2012 to 2015 wrote in The Times about her experiences.)
While some of the backstage material has an official feel (Batiste and Jaouad are listed among the many executive producers, along with Barack and Michelle Obama), the documentary does not shy from showing private moments. It captures Batiste hiding his head under a pillow as he talks on the phone with his therapist and sits in with the couple as a doctor discusses the open-ended course of chemotherapy he is recommending. When it comes to the music, too, the film is unafraid to dwell on a drawn-out silence or phrase.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In Todd Haynes's latest, Natalie Portman is an actress studying the real-life model for her character, (Julianne Moore), a woman with a tabloid back story.
Much of Todd Haynes's sly, unnerving "May December" takes place in and around a picture-perfect home, that favorite movieland setting for American dreams turned nightmares. This one comes wrapped in a dappled, hazy light that blunts hard lines and brightens every face, so much so that characters sometimes look lit from within. Even the evening has an inviting velvetiness, as if all of life's shadows have been banished. In characteristic Haynes fashion, though, nothing is as it first seems in this shimmering Gothic, including the light that becomes more like a queasy, suffocating miasma.
"May December" is the story of two women and their worlds of lies. They meet when a TV actress, Elizabeth (Natalie Portman), visits Gracie (Julianne Moore), the inspiration for her next role. Gracie lives in a large waterfront house in Savannah with her husband, Joe (Charles Melton), their teenage twins and two Irish setters. They have another kid in college, jobs they seem to enjoy and a complicated history that's summed up by the box Elizabeth finds at their front door, and which Gracie opens with a shrug of familiarity. It's feces, she explains coolly, and this isn't the first such package.
That box is a blunt metaphor for the ugliness at the core of "May December" -- years ago, Gracie became tabloid fodder after she was caught having sex with Joe when he was in seventh grade -- a setup that Haynes brilliantly complicates with his three knockout leads, great narrative dexterity and shocks of destabilizing humor that ease you into the story. The first time I watched the movie, I almost clapped my hand over my mouth during one absurd moment, unsure if I was supposed to be laughing this hard. Of course I was: Haynes is having fun, at least for a while, partly to play with our expectations about where the movie is headed.
A progenitor of the New Queer Cinema movement of the early 1990s, Haynes likes to dig into that space between the world that exists (or we believe exists) and the world of appearances. He's a virtuoso of paradoxes. That partly explains why he's drawn to the woman's film, with its focus on ordinary life, its domestic spaces, moral quandaries, political dimensions and tears. These films evoke what the critic Molly Haskell once described as "wet, wasted afternoons" and reveal what lies "beneath the sunny-side-up philosophy congealed in the happy ending." She might as well have been talking about this movie.
Written by Samy Burch -- it's her first produced screenplay -- "May December" is a woman's picture in a distinctly Haynesian key. As he has in some of his earlier films ("Far From Heaven," "Carol"), Haynes at once embraces and toys with genre conventions. He uses beautiful images (and people), bursts of lush music, pointed metaphors and floods of feeling to provide the familiar pleasures of a well-told, absorbing narrative film, even as he picks it apart at the seams. This can create an uneasy dissonance, and there are instances when it seems as if you're watching two overlaid movies: the original and its critique, a doubling that works nicely in "May December," which soon becomes a labyrinthine hall of mirrors.
Gracie's character is loosely based on Mary Kay Letourneau, a teacher who in 1997 was arrested for having sex with one of her sixth-grade students, abuse that started when he was 12. She pleaded guilty to child rape and eventually served time in prison, where she gave birth to their first two children. (They later married.) The case generated a predictable tsunami of grotesque media slavering and found putatively serious journalists referring (and continuing to refer) to the sexual assault as a "tryst" and "forbidden love," language that prettied up the crime as a passionate romance.
Gracie rationalizes her relationship with Joe on her own terms, which emerge as Elizabeth gathers intel. As Elizabeth plays detective -- she scans old tabloids, interviews family and friends -- she helpfully establishes the back story. Gracie isn't a teacher, and she and Joe met in a pet store, a seemingly incidental detail that takes on poignantly metaphoric resonance as the story unfolds. At one point, Elizabeth also accompanies Gracie and her daughter Mary (Elizabeth Yu) on a shopping trip. When the girl tries on a sleeveless dress, Gracie tells Mary she's "brave" for baring her arms and not caring about "unrealistic beauty standards." Mary looks crushed, Gracie oblivious and Elizabeth a bit stunned but oh-so fascinated.
At this stage in her process, Elizabeth has begun to imitate Gracie's gestures and expressions, a turn that Haynes expresses in the tricky shot that opens the shopping scene. As Mary tries on dresses, the women sit side-by-side facing the camera, two mirrors flanking them like drawn curtains. Because of the angles of the mirror, Elizabeth looks as if she's seated between Gracie and Gracie's reflection. It takes a beat to read the image and figure out why there are two Gracies, although as Elizabeth slips into character, suddenly there are three.
Moore and Portman's synced performances give the movie much of its weird comedy. Elizabeth guides you into the story, and you're tagging along when she pulls up to her Savannah digs and later to Gracie and Joe's home. Portman gives Elizabeth the studied agreeability of someone who has to work to present a friendly front, an effort that will be familiar to anyone who's ever interviewed a bored film star. Elizabeth is quick to smile, but Portman shows you the character's brittle affect, so that you see the flickers of hesitation in her eyes and twitches around her mouth. Mostly, you see that Elizabeth isn't a very good actress. (Presumably that's why when she tries out Gracie's lisping voice, she evokes Madeline Kahn.)

Gracie doesn't need to put up a false front because her existence is nothing but a fully committed, melodramatically rich performance that Moore supplely delivers with alternating eerie calm and impressive histrionic mewling and caterwauling. Gracie has embraced her roles as a loving wife and doting mother, and seems to be living in a profound state of denial about what these roles have cost her husband and children, a lack of understanding (and remorse) that establishes the story's inaugural moral crisis. It's not at all clear, at first, if Gracie is lying to herself, blissfully self-unaware or just another garden-variety sociopath playing at the American dream, uncertainty that gives the story a frisson of mystery.
Gracie and Elizabeth dominate the first half of "May December." Then, almost imperceptibly, the focus shifts to Joe, and the story grows ever more serious, heavy and very, very sad. Moore and Portman are tremendous, but it's Melton's anguished performance that gives the movie its slow-building emotional power. A stunted man-child with a hulking, ponderous body, Joe too has multiple roles as a father and husband, an object of desire and exoticized other. Yet none fit as persuasively, and he's most at ease in the scenes of him with the Monarch butterflies he raises in little cages. It's a sweet pastime and a potentially blunt metaphor, one that Haynes handles with enormous, moving delicacy, never more so than when these beautiful creatures emerge from their chrysalises and Joe tenderly watches them take flight.

Family Ties Slashed in Real-Life Stories: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: Four picks from television, films and podcasts that show blood is not always thicker than water.
Family secrets, tumult and trauma are at the heart of so many -- if not most -- true crime stories, and breed some of the most bizarre betrayals. Here are four picks including podcasts, television and films that explore unforgettable crimes involving families, all of whom prided themselves on presenting a perfect image until the truth came crashing through the facade.
"Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal"
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Watching a true crime documentary that is following events that are presently unfolding -- where those telling the tale also have no idea of what's to come -- is particularly gripping. And this tale of greed, corruption, outlandish cover-ups and murder in the lowcountry region of South Carolina is a doozy. It is, as the New York Times television critic Mike Hale put it, an "unbeatable crime story."
The first three-episode season, on Netflix, premiered midway through the trial of the family's patriarch, Alex Murdaugh: the disgraced personal injury attorney and an heir to the area's legal dynasty, who was accused of killing his wife, Maggie, and son Paul in 2021. The second season picks up from there, covering the march to the verdict. Both seasons were released this year.
The series incorporates interviews with friends, employees and acquaintances of the Murdaughs as well as with police, and incorporates a lot of home video footage of the family. Prepare to be stunned by how brazenly they move through their community, and the shamelessness with which they wield their power.
There are other deaths, surrounding the family that are hard to shake: that of Mallory Beach, who perished in a boating accident in 2019, while a drunken Paul was behind the wheel; Stephen Smith, a teenager who was found dead in 2015 along a road about 10 miles from the Murdaugh home; and Gloria Satterfield, the Murdaugh's longtime housekeeper who fell at their home in 2018 and died shortly after from her injuries. But perhaps it is technology's undeniable influence on the outcome of Alex Murdaugh's trial that is the most jaw-dropping -- for now.
"American Scandal" Season 44:
"The Kidnapping of Patty Hearst"
What "American Scandal," from Wondery, does best is to give every story it tackles the time it needs for a full telling with the required context. Until I listened to this season, every revelation I'd learned over the years about what happened to Patty Hearst -- an heiress to the William Randolph Hearst media empire, who, in 1974, at age 19, was kidnapped from her home by a radical group called the Symbionese Liberation Army -- left me more bewildered than I'd been before.
It's an involved, twisty American story that spiraled into a national spectacle. And members of the tremendously influential Hearst family are found everywhere, starting with their influence on Patty, who moved to strike out on her own after growing disillusioned with their wealth and lifestyle, to the family's public negotiations with her captors.
"American Murder: The Family Next Door"
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Not unlike the Murdaugh series, this heartbreaking film, from the director Jenny Popplewell, uses home videos, text messages, law enforcement recordings and police body-cam footage to profound effect. In fact, this documentary is constructed nearly entirely out of archival footage, and the horrors that unfold are presented without much influence or input from others.
In 2018, a pregnant Shanann Watts, 34, and her two young daughters seemingly vanished from their home in Frederick, Colo. -- though her purse, keys and phone were found there. Her husband, Chris, tried to spin their sudden disappearance into something it wasn't. There is much to be sad about here, starting with the opening scene: a joyful video Shanann had posted on Facebook of herself with her girls and their dog. Through the awfulness of what comes to light, bigger questions are probed. As a film critic for The Times put it: "It is a thematic film about marriage and the deception of social media, as well as a piercing examination of domestic violence constructed with care and undeniable craft."
"Mommy Dead and Dearest"
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
I was unable to finish Hulu's Emmy-winning mini-series "The Act," a dramatized version of the strange, disturbing story of Gypsy Rose Blanchard and her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard. Perhaps because I'd already seen this 2017 documentary from Erin Lee Carr, which uses home video, news clips and interviews to tell the story of how the elder Blanchard inflicted mental and physical distress on her daughter for most of her life -- seemingly to gain sympathy, as well as money and gifts, from strangers. It was labeled a case of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder in which a parent or caregiver induces an illness in a child to get attention.
But the plot here gets much more complicated when Dee Dee is killed in 2015 in Springfield, Mo., and her daughter and daughter's boyfriend at the time, Nicholas Godejohn, are suspected.
"Things are not always as they appear," we hear Jim Arnott, the sheriff of Greene County, Mo., say early in the documentary. As The Times's film critic said in his review of "Mommy Dead and Dearest," that assertion is "a candidate for understatement of the year."

After Abuse, U.K. Limits Monitoring Of Weight: [Sports Desk]

Full text: Athletes also must be allowed to hydrate regularly when practicing and be permitted visits to the restroom.
The weighing of gymnasts will be restricted under new British rules after a report detailed abuse in the sport, particularly of women and girls.
Gymnasts who are 11 and older in Britain may now be weighed only with their permission and with the permission of a parent if they are under 18. The weighing must be done by sports science or medical practitioners and it must have a "scientifically valid rationale."
Gymnasts 10 and under will no longer be permitted to be weighed at all in a gymnastics setting.
In addition, the new rules require that gymnasts be given opportunities to hydrate regularly when practicing and be allowed visits to the restroom when needed. They also require that children under 12 not be made to practice during normal school hours and that older children can miss class time only under "exceptional circumstances."
An independent investigation in 2022 found that the well being of gymnasts "has not been at the center of British Gymnastics' culture."
The report found many instances of physical abuse by coaches, like urging athletes to practice with injuries; emotional abuse, like name calling; and sexual abuse, like inappropriate touching.
More than a quarter of gymnasts surveyed said their weight had been monitored excessively. Gymnasts said that coaches controlled what they ate and publicly announced their weights.
The report said the problems primarily affected female gymnasts.
"While practices have moved on a long way, we know there has been poor practice in these areas," Sarah Powell, the chief executive of British Gymnastics, said in a statement announcing the new rules.
Gymnastics, particularly for women, has been troubled for years with problems involving eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia. Gymnasts have frantically tried to lose weight, often with the encouragement of their coaches, to improve their performances, only to develop unhealthy relationships with food and body image.
Christy Henrich, a world-class American gymnast, died in 1994 at age 22 from multiple organ failure caused by starvation. Although her death prompted a reckoning in the gymnastics world, progress has been slow. Female athletes in the intervening decades have often said that coaches make remarks about their weights and closely monitor their food intake.
British gymnasts have said that a push to change the sport was sparked in part by the 2020 Netflix documentary "Athlete A," about the harrowing experiences of American gymnasts abused by a longtime team doctor, Larry Nassar, which prompted a #MeToo movement of sorts among gymnasts.
Catherine Lyons, a former top junior competitor for Britain, was one of many gymnasts who spoke out about abuse. She said coaches harassed her about her weight, and shut her inside a cupboard when she cried at age 7 or 8.
Voices like hers helped prompt the 2022 investigation into abuse by coaches.
Issues with weight and female athletes are hardly unique to gymnastics. In figure skating, the American Olympic medalist Gracie Gold said that after a coach made a remark about her weight she cut her food intake to a few hundred calories from 2,000 a day. While she initially felt the weight loss helped her skating, after some setbacks she plunged into a binge-purge eating cycle, she said, which derailed her career.
Mary Cain, the fastest young middle-distance runner in the United States, said the famous track coach and marathoner Alberto Salazar and his all-male staff had pushed her to become thinner. She was weighed in front of her teammates and was shamed if she did not reach a weight goal, she said.
"I was emotionally and physically abused by a system designed by Alberto and endorsed by Nike." She developed Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport, or RED-S, and stopped having her period for three years.
After her revelation, other Olympic-level track athletes said they too had faced weight shaming.
"These new policies make clear that what matters most in gymnastics is the welfare of those involved," Ms. Powell said on Monday. She said the new policies would "ensure everyone understands what is OK and what is not OK."

Outcry Follows True-Crime Deal For Wife of Gilgo Beach Suspect: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Rex Heuermann is accused of killing three women. Where some saw depravity, others saw a chance to make a show.
After Rex Heuermann was arrested in July and accused of slaughtering women found bound in burlap and buried along a desolate stretch of Gilgo Beach, his family was left reeling and destitute.
With their dilapidated Massapequa Park ranch house turned inside out by investigators, Mr. Heuermann's wife, Asa Ellerup, and their two grown children were left to sleep on mats and cook on a grill in the front yard in full view of news crews and true-crime gawkers. Things got so bad that the daughter of a West Coast serial killer created an online fund-raiser.
But where some saw evil, depravity and tragedy, media companies saw pay dirt, swooping in with lucrative bids to turn the whole thing into content.
Peacock, the streaming service owned by NBCUniversal, is paying the family to participate in a documentary series covering the family through Mr. Heuermann's trial, which is likely to begin next year.
The intense bidding for Ms. Ellerup's story and the payment caused an outcry from relatives of women whose remains were found in the Gilgo Beach area, including those of Shannan Gilbert, whose disappearance several miles from Gilgo in 2010 led to the recovery of the other victims.
"Disappointed, disgusted, flabbergasted, frustrated are a few words that come to mind right now," her sister Sherre Gilbert wrote in a social media post. "The way that the media will buy stories to further re-victimize, re-traumatize, and exploit the families & victims of serial killers is evil!"
Peacock officials declined to comment on the planned documentary or disclose how much they were paying Ms. Ellerup. As long as none of the money flows to Mr. Heuermann, the arrangement would skirt New York laws that prohibit defendants from selling their stories to the media.
As Ms. Ellerup's financial fortunes have lifted, so has her profile. Recent weeks have seen her visiting Mr. Heuermann in jail for the first time and making her debut appearance at a court hearing with a Peacock film crew in tow, as it has been at her home. Ms. Ellerup herself appears more composed than the figure she cut upon returning to the house that overnight had become a notorious landmark.
Prosecutors say Mr. Heuermann, 60, a Manhattan architect and suburban father, killed three women he hired as escorts and wrapped them in burlap for burial at Gilgo Beach on Long Island's South Shore more than a dozen years ago. The grisly details shocked the public and reopened wounds for relatives of 11 people whose remains were found along the same stretch of oceanfront.
Ms. Ellerup, 59, had filed for divorce days after the arrest and distanced herself from Mr. Heuermann, avoiding his pretrial hearings and declining to visit him in jail.
She was not charged and investigators have said she was away on trips when the killings happened. Her lawyer, Robert Macedonio, said she knew nothing about the killings and that "the only thing she knows about the charges is what's been reported by the media."
"She wants to believe that the spouse she's been married to for 27 years wasn't capable of these crimes," he said. "She wants to see and hear the evidence as it plays out in the courtroom."
Many people do. True crime is a booming category of entertainment that encompasses documentaries, scripted series and audio. The genre makes up 24 percent of the nation's most popular podcasts, according to the Pew Research Center.
Serial killers constitute a popular subgenre of their own. The Gilgo Beach case alone has already inspired numerous television shows. "Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story," a scripted series, surpassed a billion hours in viewing time and became one of the most watched series on Netflix last year. With a ravenous market to satisfy, huge payouts for exclusive interview deals have become common.
"It's driven by demand," said Ed Hersh, a former television executive and current industry consultant on true crime programming. "Streaming is all about building buzz and keeping subscribers paying from one month to the next," he added, "and since viewers are always looking for some details that move this story forward, a service like Peacock can potentially really promote this."
While the Peacock deal helps Ms. Ellerup's finances, it poses some complications.
The commercialization of such a depraved case, combined with Ms. Ellerup's payday and her decision to tempt legal fate by going on camera before the trial, has rankled victims' families and law enforcement officials.
Rodney Harrison, Suffolk County's outgoing police commissioner -- who upon Mr. Heuermann's arrest called him "a demon that walks among us" -- said in an interview that the deal was "a smack at the family members who lost a loved one."
Prosecutors say Mr. Heuermann went to lengths to hide his activity from both his wife and the authorities by using disposable burner phones to contact escorts and access brutal pornography.
He has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail at a Suffolk County jail, with his next pretrial court date in February. His lawyer did not return a request for comment.
Prosecutors continue to seek more evidence and investigate him as the prime suspect in the death of a fourth woman and possibly others found buried in the Gilgo area and elsewhere.
Ms. Ellerup, who could be called to testify in his trial, could play a crucial role in the case.
Last month, the police said, detectives interviewed a woman who claimed to have met Mr. Heuermann and Ms. Ellerup while visiting their Massapequa Park house in 1996 for a sex party along with a woman named Karen Vergata, who was working as an escort and disappeared around that time. Ms. Vergata's skull was found near Gilgo Beach in April 2011.
Investigators say that strands of Ms. Ellerup's hair, perhaps transferred inadvertently from their home, helped link her husband to the bodies in his case.
The Suffolk County district attorney, Ray Tierney, said in an interview that Ms. Ellerup's involvement with the documentary was "going to affect her credibility."
"She's trying to capitalize on her husband's notoriety and make herself marketable," he said. "But the truth isn't always marketable and the money itself could be a motivation to lie."
For Ms. Ellerup to speak about Mr. Heuermann to a film crew carries the inherent risk that "what she says can be used against her criminally," said John Ray, a lawyer who represents relatives of Ms. Gilbert and of Jessica Taylor, whose remains were found in the Gilgo area.
"They are all walking on extremely thin legal ice," said Mr. Ray, who called it implausible that Ms. Ellerup knew nothing about her husband's deeds and said that she "should be considered a suspect and investigated accordingly."
"She's still within the circle of suspicion in this case, and so are the children," he said. "Anything she says is very dangerous."
Mr. Ray said the deal was a crass commercialization of a case in which coverage has fixated on the accused man and largely ignored the humanity of the victims, partly because they were working as escorts.
Ms. Ellerup's personality seems ripe for the camera. Like Mr. Heuermann, she grew up mostly in Massapequa Park, a working-class suburb, and can hold her own against pushy reporters and other interlopers. When she returned home two weeks after her husband's arrest, she greeted photographers with a lewd gesture and then settled into bantering from afar with reporters but ignoring substantive questions.
The size of Ms. Ellerup's payment for participating is unconfirmed. The NewsNation network reported that she would receive $ 1 million. It said Mr. Macedonio was getting $ 400,000 and a lawyer for the children, Vess Mitev, was getting $ 200,000. Neither would comment on the amounts.
Mr. Macedonio said the Peacock project would be developed partly by the rapper 50 Cent's production company, G-Unit, but declined to speak further about the deal.
Ultimately, Mr. Tierney said, the Peacock series would most likely be irrelevant to the case, partly because it was unlikely that Ms. Ellerup knew, or at least would divulge to cameras, culpable information about Mr. Heuermann.
"The decision will be made by the jury based on the facts of the case as presented in court, not on a documentary," he said.

The Gothams Kick Off the Awards Season: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The movie prize season kicks off with honors for the A24 drama and for the star of "The Unknown Country" (who's better known for "Killers of the Flower Moon").
"Past Lives," the elegiac drama about a young Korean immigrant and the romantic path not taken, won best feature at the 33rd annual Gotham Awards, which were handed out Monday night at Cipriani Wall Street in New York.
The A24 film from the writer-director Celine Song stars Greta Lee as a married writer in New York who reconnects with her childhood sweetheart from South Korea, a meeting that has her contemplating the Korean concept of inyeon, about fated connections between different people.
"Thank you for believing in me when all I had was a script written in two languages," Song said to the cast and crew members lined up behind her during her acceptance speech. "Everybody on this stage is my inyeon."
Considered the first notable awards ceremony of Oscar season, the Gotham Awards have the advantage of corralling contenders while they're still fresh, before the thank-you lists in their acceptance speeches become rote and the golden dreams of some nominees have been ground into dust.
This year's show was particularly well-positioned since the actors' strike had, until recently, thwarted many contenders from full-scale campaigning. At the Gothams, A-list attendees like Margot Robbie, Leonardo DiCaprio and Adam Driver were finally permitted to partake in an unabashed, shoulder-rubbing schmoozefest.
As a harbinger of future Oscar success, the Gothams can be a mixed bag. Two of their last three best-feature winners, "Everything Everywhere All at Once" and "Nomadland," went on to win top honors at the Academy Awards, but the Gothams are chosen by small juries that consist of a handful of film insiders, while the Oscars are voted on by around 10,000 people.
The Gothams also tend to lean indie: Though the $ 35 million budget cap for eligibility was waived this year, jurors only found blockbuster representation for "Barbie" star Ryan Gosling, nominated for outstanding supporting performance. The Gothams' adoption of gender-neutral categories have reduced the acting races from four to two -- here, there are only categories for lead and supporting performance -- while also expanding the list of nominees in each acting category from five to a somewhat unruly 10.
Still, it never hurts to be seen winning, and the Gothams offer contenders a high-profile place to break out of the pack and deliver a memorable speech.
One unique example of that was the Gothams win for Lily Gladstone, who triumphed in the lead-performance category not for Martin Scorsese's "Killers of the Flower Moon," her big-budget breakthrough, but for her role in the indie "The Unknown Country," about a woman who embarks on a road trip after the grandmother she was caring for passes away.
"At the heart of it, we have Native voices, because Morrisa shot reality," said Gladstone, praising writer-director Morrisa Maltz. "You listened, like Marty did."
The supporting-performance award went to an overcome Charles Melton, the former "Riverdale" star at the burning heart of the Todd Haynes drama "May December." The Korean American actor was one of many Asian winners at the Gothams, which also handed out TV awards to the Netflix limited series "Beef" and one of its lead performers, Ali Wong.
"Anatomy of a Fall," the Justine Triet courtroom drama that won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, took home best international feature and best screenplay for its examination of a marriage after a man dies in a family's remote home in the French Alps. The award for breakthrough director went to A.V. Rockwell, the filmmaker behind the mother-son drama "A Thousand and One."
"I really did not see this coming," Rockwell said, tearing up as she talked about the fight to make her first film as a Black woman. "Just to be frank, it is very hard to tell a culturally specific story when you look like this."
Though most of the show ran smoothly, presenter Robert De Niro was visibly irritated when a portion of his speech during a tribute to "Killers of the Flower Moon" was "cut out, and I didn't know about it," the actor said. Peeved not to find it in full on the Telepromptr, he doubled back and read it on his own.
"In Florida, young students are taught that slaves developed skills that could be applied for their personal benefit," De Niro said. "The entertainment industry isn't immune to this festering disease: The Duke, John Wayne, famously said of Native Americans, 'I don't feel we did wrong in taking this great country away from them. There were great numbers of people who needed new land and the Indians were selfishly trying to keep it for themselves."'
De Niro also used his speech to criticize Donald Trump, a frequent bête noire of the actor: "Lying has become just another tool in the charlatan's arsenal," he said. "But with all his lies, he can't hide his soul. He attacks the weak, destroys the gifts of nature and shows disrespect, for example, by using 'Pocahontas' as a slur."
De Niro noted that he had planned to wrap his speech by thanking the Gothams and Apple, the studio behind "Killers of the Flower Moon," but had now changed his mind: "I don't feel like thanking them at all for what they did. How dare they do that, actually."
In addition to the competitive honors, the Gothams paid tribute to Ben Affleck, Bradley Cooper, Greta Gerwig, Michael Mann and George C. Wolfe.
Here is a complete list of winners:
Best feature: "Past Lives"
Outstanding lead performance: Lily Gladstone, "The Unknown Country"

Exploring Black Cocktail History: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The author of "The Jemima Code" has distilled 200 years of African American drinking know-how into her new "Juke Joints, Jazz Clubs and Juice."
While many in the world of cocktails are familiar with Tom Bullock, renowned for his juleps and long considered the first African American bartender to publish a cocktail manual, fewer know the work of Atholene Peyton, a home economics teacher whose 1906 "Peytonia Cook Book" predated Bullock's by a decade.
Peyton's story is just one told in Toni Tipton-Martin's new book, "Juke Joints, Jazz Clubs and Juice: Cocktails From Two Centuries of African American Cookbooks," a chronicle of the ways in which Black people contributed to American cocktail culture.
"This is really a work of investigative journalism. It's not just a book of cocktails," said Ms. Tipton-Martin, a James Beard award-winning author of several cookbooks and the editor of Cook's Country magazine, who pored through centuries' worth of published recipes for her new work.
The book is a continuation of her 2015 book, "The Jemima Code: Two Centuries of African American Cookbooks," which credited Black women for much of the country's culinary history, and her 2019 follow-up, "Jubilee: Recipes From Two Centuries of African American Cooking."
"What Toni has done here is essentially create a mixologist's parallel to what she did in 'Jubilee,"' said Jessica B. Harris, the author of "High on the Hog: A Culinary Journey From Africa to America," which has been adapted as a Netflix series. "The two books become a diptych of the food of African Americans, as revealed through their cookbooks."
Ms. Tipton-Martin owns a vast collection of old cookbooks by Black authors from as early as 1827, and has used that foundation to propel the research and historical context her books are famous for.
For her new book, she relied on cookbooks published by early Black bartenders like Bullock in 1917 and Julian Anderson in 1919. But she also uncovered the contributions of Peyton, a teacher born in Louisville, Ky., whose "Peytonia Cook Book" included a chapter on drinks, with recipes for juleps, gin fizzes, eggnog, a whiskey sour and a manhattan. (Ms. Tipton-Martin discusses Peyton's Champagne punch in her new book.)
"I can hear the voice of the cook or bar master claiming their intellectual property," Ms. Tipton-Martin said.
"Juke Joints, Jazz Clubs and Juice" is organized chronologically by craft, which gave Ms. Tipton-Martin the space to write about "all of that Black drink history." She starts with teaching readers how to brew beer and ferment wine; enslaved and free Black women made those drinks and built beverage enterprises during the antebellum era. Punchbowl drinks tell the stories of Black caterers and food entrepreneurs.
Other chapters are dedicated to the Black bartenders who made layered drinks at taverns in the late 18th century. She ends the book with a section on how some Black people today reference liquor as a form of empowerment, especially in rap lyrics. Beverages like gin and juice -- which Snoop Dogg immortalized in song in the 1990s -- have deep roots: Similar concoctions appeared in the 1930s in books like "Burke's Complete Cocktail and Drinking Recipes," published in 1934. The drink's origins begin in Africa, Ms. Tipton-Martin said, where people macerated oranges and allowed them to ferment.
Recipe: Gin and Juice
The book goes far beyond cocktails in exploring African American history. Places like juke joints, strategically located near agricultural communities, served as sites where African Americans could escape the daily indignities of segregation. But their clientele were often stereotyped as lazy gamblers, unlike white Americans, whose drinking was portrayed more favorably. This double standard led to a notable absence of writing about drinks by African American authors from the mid-20th century until the 1970s, she said.
"It was surprising and fascinating to me to learn that as part of my ancestors' desire to be respected, appreciated and valued by the larger society, they just stopped discussing alcohol consumption," Ms. Tipton-Martin said, likening those stereotypes to the way Black female cooks were mocked with the Mammy character.
She dug just as deep for her recipe research, pulling several historical references and testing each adaptation before completing the recipes for publication. She explains how people served these drinks decades ago, which offers readers ideas for customizing the recipes.
Ms. Tipton-Martin came to her work with little cocktail experience, so she leaned on two consultants: her son Brandon Tipton, a formally trained bartender, and Tiffanie Barriere, a master mixologist and educator in Atlanta. Ms. Barriere said she taught Ms. Tipton-Martin techniques like knowing how long to shake a drink. She also offered some modern alternatives to older methods like shaping ice with a pick and mallet (use pebbled ice cubes or an ice mold instead).
"The beverage community has been waiting for a book like this," Ms. Barriere said, adding that Black people have long known that their ancestors made an impact on cocktails. "It's just another 'aha' moment."

—RECIPE:
Gin and Juice
Recipe from Toni Tipton-Martin
Adapted by Christina Morales
Toni Tipton-Martin spent three years writing her latest cookbook, “Juke Joints, Jazz Clubs and Juice: Cocktails From Two Centuries of African American Cookbooks” (Clarkson Potter, 2023), which gives Black people credit for their contributions to the American cocktail canon. But through her research, she found that Black people were disparaged for their drinking, which led to a large gap in published recipes. Alcoholic beverages like gin and juice were referenced in rap lyrics, namely Snoop Dogg’s hit from his debut album. Though gin and juice needs only two ingredients, this one gains extra depth from the use of vermouth and bitters. Similar combinations of gin, orange juice, vermouth and bitters were traced back to several cookbooks, including some that were published more than a century ago.
Yield: 1 drink
Total time: 10 minutes
Ingredients:
Ice cubes
1 1/2 ounces gin (preferably Tanqueray)
1 ounce fresh orange juice
1/4 ounce sweet (red) vermouth
1/4 ounce dry (white) vermouth
1/4 ounce Cointreau (optional)
2 dashes Angostura or blood orange bitters
1 mandarin, tangerine or orange wheel
Preparation:
1. Fill a cocktail mixer halfway with ice and add all liquids. Stir for 20 seconds, until cold.
2. Rub the rim of a rocks glass or lowball with the citrus wheel. Strain the cocktail into the glass, garnish with the citrus wheel and serve right away.

Wife of Gilgo Beach Suspect Gets a Documentary Deal

After Rex Heuermann was arrested in July and accused of slaughtering women found bound in burlap and buried along a desolate stretch of Gilgo Beach on Long Island’s South Shore in New York, his family was left reeling and destitute.
With their dilapidated Massapequa Park ranch house turned inside out by investigators, Heuermann’s wife, Asa Ellerup, and their two grown children were left to sleep on mats and cook on a grill in the front yard in full view of news crews and true-crime gawkers. Things got so bad that the daughter of a West Coast serial killer created an online fundraiser.
But where some saw evil, depravity and tragedy, media companies saw pay dirt, swooping in with lucrative bids to turn the whole thing into content.
Peacock, the streaming service owned by NBCUniversal, is paying the family to participate in a documentary series covering the family through Heuermann’s trial, which is likely to begin next year.
The intense bidding for Ellerup’s story and the payment caused an outcry from relatives of women whose remains were found in the Gilgo Beach area, including those of Shannan Gilbert, whose disappearance several miles from Gilgo in 2010 led to the recovery of the other victims.
“Disappointed, disgusted, flabbergasted, frustrated are a few words that come to mind right now,” her sister Sherre Gilbert wrote in a social media post. “The way that the media will buy stories to further re-victimize, re-traumatize, and exploit the families & victims of serial killers is evil!”
Peacock officials declined to comment on the planned documentary or disclose how much they were paying Ellerup. As long as none of the money flows to Heuermann, the arrangement would skirt New York laws that prohibit defendants from selling their stories to the media.
As Ellerup’s financial fortunes have lifted, so has her profile. Recent weeks have seen her visiting Heuermann in jail for the first time and making her debut appearance at a court hearing with a Peacock film crew in tow, as it has been at her home. Ellerup appears more composed than the figure she cut upon returning to the house that overnight had become a notorious landmark.
Prosecutors say Heuermann, 60, a Manhattan architect and suburban father, killed three women he hired as escorts and wrapped them in burlap for burial at Gilgo Beach more than a dozen years ago. The grisly details shocked the public and reopened wounds for relatives of 11 people whose remains were found along the same stretch of oceanfront.
Ellerup, 59, had filed for divorce days after the arrest and distanced herself from Heuermann, avoiding his pretrial hearings and declining to visit him in jail.
She was not charged and investigators have said she was away on trips when the killings happened. Her lawyer, Robert Macedonio, said she knew nothing about the killings and that “the only thing she knows about the charges is what’s been reported by the media.”
“She wants to believe that the spouse she’s been married to for 27 years wasn’t capable of these crimes,” he said. “She wants to see and hear the evidence as it plays out in the courtroom.”
Many people do. True crime is a booming category of entertainment that encompasses documentaries, scripted series and audio. The genre makes up 24% of the nation’s most popular podcasts, according to the Pew Research Center.
Serial killers constitute a popular subgenre of their own. The Gilgo Beach case alone has already inspired numerous television shows. “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,” a scripted series, surpassed 1 billion hours in viewing time and became one of the most watched series on Netflix last year. With a ravenous market to satisfy, huge payouts for exclusive interview deals have become common.
“It’s driven by demand,” said Ed Hersh, a former television executive and current industry consultant on true crime programming. “Streaming is all about building buzz and keeping subscribers paying from one month to the next,” he added, “and since viewers are always looking for some details that move this story forward, a service like Peacock can potentially really promote this.”
While the Peacock deal helps Ellerup’s finances, it poses some complications.
The commercialization of such a depraved case, combined with Ellerup’s payday and her decision to tempt legal fate by going on camera before the trial, has rankled victims’ families and law enforcement officials.
Rodney Harrison, Suffolk County’s outgoing police commissioner — who upon Heuermann’s arrest called him “a demon that walks among us” — said in an interview that the deal was “a smack at the family members who lost a loved one.”
Prosecutors say Heuermann went to lengths to hide his activity from both his wife and authorities by using disposable burner phones to contact escorts and access brutal pornography.
He has pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail at a Suffolk County jail, with his next pretrial court date in February. His lawyer did not return a request for comment.
Prosecutors continue to seek more evidence and investigate him as the prime suspect in the death of a fourth woman and possibly others found buried in the Gilgo area and elsewhere.
Ellerup, who could be called to testify in his trial, could play a crucial role in the case.
Last month, police said, detectives interviewed a woman who claimed to have met Heuermann and Ellerup while visiting their Massapequa Park house in 1996 for a sex party along with a woman named Karen Vergata, who was working as an escort and disappeared around that time. Vergata’s skull was found near Gilgo Beach in April 2011.
Investigators say that strands of Ellerup’s hair, perhaps transferred inadvertently from their home, helped link her husband to the bodies in his case.
The Suffolk County district attorney, Ray Tierney, said in an interview that Ellerup’s involvement with the documentary was “going to affect her credibility.”
“She’s trying to capitalize on her husband’s notoriety and make herself marketable,” he said. “But the truth isn’t always marketable and the money itself could be a motivation to lie.”
For Ellerup to speak about Heuermann to a film crew carries the inherent risk that “what she says can be used against her criminally,” said John Ray, a lawyer who represents relatives of Gilbert and of Jessica Taylor, whose remains were found in the Gilgo area.
“They are all walking on extremely thin legal ice,” said Ray, who called it implausible that Ellerup knew nothing about her husband’s deeds and said that she “should be considered a suspect and investigated accordingly.”
“She’s still within the circle of suspicion in this case, and so are the children,” he said. “Anything she says is very dangerous.”
Ray said the deal was a crass commercialization of a case in which coverage has fixated on the accused man and largely ignored the humanity of the victims, partly because they were working as escorts.
Ellerup’s personality seems ripe for the camera. Like Heuermann, she grew up mostly in Massapequa Park, a working-class suburb, and can hold her own against pushy reporters and other interlopers. When she returned home two weeks after her husband’s arrest, she greeted photographers with a lewd gesture and then settled into bantering from afar with reporters but ignoring substantive questions.
The size of Ellerup’s payment for participating is unconfirmed. The NewsNation network reported that she would receive $1 million. It said Macedonio was getting $400,000 and a lawyer for the children, Vess Mitev, was getting $200,000. Neither would comment on the amounts.
Macedonio said the Peacock project would be developed partly by rapper 50 Cent’s production company, G-Unit, but declined to speak further about the deal.
Ultimately, Tierney said, the Peacock series would most likely be irrelevant to the case, partly because it was unlikely that Ellerup knew, or at least would divulge to cameras, culpable information about Heuermann.
“The decision will be made by the jury based on the facts of the case as presented in court, not on a documentary,” he said.

Summertime in the Country, and the Living Is Queasy: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: From upstairs to downstairs and the challenging moments in between, a walk through a particular subgenre of films ripe for dramatic tension.
If "Promising Young Woman" was Emerald Fennell's darkly comic take on the rape-revenge thriller -- one that rode a zeitgeisty wave of discourse onto a best original screenplay Oscar in 2021 -- "Saltburn" is the writer-director's entry in the country house canon. The film (in theaters) is the latest in a subgenre ripe for dramatic tension: upstairs versus downstairs; invited versus interloped; public versus private. Away from prying eyes, characters in these tales tend to revel in their idyllic surroundings as unseen, often sinister, forces work against them, resulting in an unforgettable stay.
In "Saltburn," Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan), a shy Oxford student, accepts an invitation to spend the summer at the family estate of a wealthy classmate, Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). While there, Oliver's adoration for the charming aristocrat reveals itself to be much more than an innocent infatuation.
With its covetous double helix of class consciousness and homoeroticism, "Saltburn" fits in nicely alongside literary classics like "Brideshead Revisited" and "The Talented Mr. Ripley" (and their many screen adaptations). Here are five other films where summering at a country house leads to significant power imbalances and lifelong consequences.
'The Go-Between' (1971)
Stream it on the Roku Channel.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Joseph Losey, whose 1963 film, "The Servant," is its own masterpiece of queer-coded dominance, works once again from a Harold Pinter screenplay to direct this quintessentially British period drama. Young Leo (Dominic Guard) is invited by a wealthy friend to spend the summer at his family's country house. But when his friend is quarantined with the measles, Leo must devise another way to pass the time. He soon finds himself the fraught messenger for his friend's beautiful sister (Julie Christie) and her secret lover, the tenant farmer (Alan Bates). Stunning shots of the property's fertile grounds fuel this Palme d'Or winner with a sense of freedom that its owners are quick to curtail; when the film catches up with Leo decades later, his loss of innocence can be pinpointed back to that fateful summer.
'Cries and Whispers' (1972)
Stream it on Max.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The silence of God, humanity's inability to connect, the secret grudges that quietly tear families apart: all themes the Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman saw fit to set against the peacefulness of a summer house no less than a half dozen times. Here, it's a searing look at the final days of a woman dying of cancer at her family's opulent mansion, and her two sisters' painful attempt to thaw out years of estrangement. As they struggle against the clock to process their emotions, the house's maid shuffles in saintly servitude. Sven Nykvist's Oscar-winning cinematography places the white-clad women -- including the Bergman regulars Liv Ullmann, Harriet Andersson and Ingrid Thulin -- against richly saturated crimson walls, bringing out piercing performances from their icy exteriors.
'Grey Gardens' (1975)
Stream it on Max.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
One of the most consequential documentaries of all time serves as a cautionary tale about what happens when you don't pack it up at summer's end. When Albert and David Maysles were hired by Jacqueline Kennedy's sister Lee Radziwill to make a film about their family, the documentarians' attention quickly shifted to the women's eccentric cousins: "Little Edie" and her mother, "Big Edie" Beale. The erstwhile socialites had boarded themselves up for nearly 20 years in their decaying home in East Hampton, N.Y., the stench of garbage and cat urine undergirding their peculiar relationship. With a distinctly American blend of can-do and laissez-faire, the Beales continue their business as usual, impervious to the changing tides of the outside world.
'Chinese Roulette' (1976)
Stream it on the Criterion Channel.
Born in Germany in 1945, Rainer Werner Fassbinder made films that emerged from a deep-seated mistrust of humanity. But he gave a despairing, devilish wink in even his cruelest works, like this bleak psychological thriller where two cheating spouses accidentally take lovers to their country estate on the same weekend. When their resentful young daughter arrives, she manipulates the foursome, the housekeeper and her son into playing the titular game, a sort of diabolical truth or dare, over dinner. Michael Ballhaus's cinematography constructs a claustrophobic ballet around the house's mirrored interiors, tightening reflective nooses around each of its deeply guilty guests.
'Call Me by Your Name' (2017)
Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
James Ivory picked up the country house torch and ran through the '80s and '90s with hits like "A Room With a View" and "The Remains of the Day," all of which were produced by his partner, Ismail Merchant. But it was for adapting André Aciman's novel "Call Me by Your Name" that he won his first Oscar -- becoming the oldest-ever winner at 89. The director Luca Guadagnino bathes the film in its Northern Italian setting, where a bookworm teen learns of the wounding and healing powers of sexual attraction after a graduate student arrives at his family's lush villa.

For a Time Lord, 60 Is Just a Number: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The British sci-fi show is celebrating its 60th anniversary with three specials featuring some familiar faces.
It's rare for a television show to celebrate its 60th anniversary. It's even rarer for a show to be entering a new era on its 60th anniversary.
But "Doctor Who," the British sci-fi show that began airing on the BBC in 1963, is in a period of expansion. Three upcoming specials, celebrating the show's latest milestone, will arrive weekly on Disney+ in the United States from Saturday, as part of a deal between the streamer and the BBC.
And then a new season, starring Ncuti Gatwa ("Sex Education") in the title role, will arrive next year on Disney+ (and the BBC in Britain) following an extra Christmas Day episode. Russell T Davies, who relaunched the show in 2005, is the showrunner for them all.
"Doctor Who" has decades of adventures, villains and complex story lines for dedicated fans to immerse themselves in. But if you're new to the show, here's what you need to know before tuning into the upcoming specials.
A Quick Recap
The Doctor is a Time Lord from a planet called Gallifrey, who travels across time and space in a Tardis, an unassuming spacecraft that looks like an old British police box, which members of the public used to call the authorities. His mission is to protect Earth, and the humans who live there, from a variety of threats.
"The Doctor is the nerd, the well-read misfit, who isn't particularly physical, who still wins the day," said Toby Hadoke, an actor who hosts a podcast dedicated to the show. "The Doctor always offers hope for the person who feels slightly left out."
David Tennant, who played the Doctor between 2005 and 2010, and will be back as the star of the 60th anniversary specials, said that he thought the show's appeal was "the way the domestic and the simplistic and everyday meets the fantastical and the absurd." In the show's world, "the most extraordinary things become very relatable," he said.
The show's longevity is partly thanks to the fact the Doctor can "regenerate," meaning a new actor can step into the role, but the show also experiments with genre, and the same season can include a historical drama one episode and a modern political satire the next.
"Every time the Tardis door opens and the team steps out to a new planet, or a new time, or a new story, then it begins again," Davies, the showrunner, said.
The Doctor usually travels with a regular human companion, who in the 60th anniversary specials is played by the comedian Catherine Tate.
Where Are We With the Plot?
At the end of the last season, Jodie Whittaker, the 13th incarnation of the Doctor, regenerated.
Traditionally, a new actor plays each incarnation, and Gatwa is confirmed to be the 15th Doctor. But for the upcoming 60th anniversary episodes, Whittaker has turned back into Tennant, who was the 10th Doctor from 2005 to 2010, and then again for a 50th anniversary special in 2013.
Rather than reprising the 10th Doctor, in the upcoming specials, Tennant will portray a 14th Doctor, the first time an actor has played two distinct Doctors. (Keeping up?)
"Who is to say you can't do this?" Davies said. "There's absolutely no doubt that it can happen."
Tate will also reprise her role as Donna Noble, the Doctor's companion. But in their last adventure together, which aired in 2008, the Doctor wiped Donna's memory, and with it all recollection of their time together. If Donna remembers him, she will die. And yet they will reunite in the upcoming specials.
"I had left our heroes in a tragic situation separated forever, unable to ever be happy again," Davies said. "That's begging for a final act, isn't it?"
How to Watch in the U.S.
While "Doctor Who" has aired in the United States for a number of years, including on PBS, the Sci Fi Channel and BBC America, the new international distribution deal with Disney+ could make the show more accessible to a casual audience. For new viewers, the 60th anniversary specials will begin with a prologue recapping the Doctor and Donna's story.
If you would like to dive deeper into the back catalog, older "Doctor Who" episodes are available to stream in the United States on Max or BritBox.
An Inclusive Sci-Fi Show
"Doctor Who" has long been notable among sci-fi franchises for its onscreen diversity. Whittaker became the show's first female Doctor in 2017, and in 2020, Jo Martin played an incarnation of the Doctor known as the Fugitive Doctor, the show's first Black doctor. And Yasmin Finney, a trans actor who played Elle in the Netflix show "Heartstopper," is also joining the cast.
"The show has always been good at appreciating inclusivity, and cherishing the different," said Tennant, who added that he grew up as a "skinny bloke with specs in Scotland, who didn't feel like the coolest person in the room."
But "the Doctor celebrates uncoolness," he added. "And that was something I appreciated."

Exploring Mysteries, Role to Role: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The actor has worked steadily since breaking out as a young Princess Diana in "The Crown." Corrin's latest role is as an amateur sleuth in "A Murder at the End of the World."
"I have no idea what I like," Emma Corrin said.
This was on a recent Friday afternoon at the Mysterious Bookshop, a Manhattan emporium dedicated to thrillers, detective stories, spy stories and noir classics. Corrin, who uses they/them pronouns, had flown in from London the day before and seemed overwhelmed by the selection, spinning a display of pulp paperbacks, picking up and putting down a new translation of a Pier Paolo Pasolini novel. The real mystery? Which book to choose.
Corrin appealed to the store's manager, Tom Wickersham.
"Go for it," Corrin said. "What's the best thriller?"
Corrin, 27, had taken this last-minute trip, which coincided with the end of the actors' strike, to promote "A Murder at the End of the World," the moody, brooding FX limited series that began on Nov. 14. They play Darby Hart, an amateur detective who becomes a true-crime author after solving a case involving unidentified women in the Midwest. "A Murder" had filmed two scenes at the shop, which (appropriately) bookend the series.
"We spent all day and all night here," they said. Between setups, Corrin would read aloud from selected books, including a collection of erotica. "It was very funny."
On the series, Darby sports pink hair, layered hoodies and a watchful, wounded expression. Another character, the guerrilla artist Bill Farrah (Harris Dickinson), describes Darby as "really tough and really fragile at the same time." In person, Corrin, who wore a brown suede jacket and black pants, their brown hair sleekly buzzed, was sprightlier, less wary, sliding from shelf to shelf in black flats.
Corrin had spent the strike in London, with Spencer, their cockapoo named for Princess Diana, whom Corrin played in the fourth season of "The Crown." "I honestly hadn't really stopped working for the last three or four years, so it was a really nice chance to be with family and friends and dog," they said.
Had Corrin taken up any hobbies during the strike? No. "I found that so intimidating during Covid," they said, laughing. "I'm not making bread. I refuse."
After a few months, relaxation had palled and Corrin seemed delighted to be back to work, even if work meant a whirlwind promotional tour. "I like talking about the work," they said. "I like celebrating it."
Corrin paused at a row of true-crime books, as though expecting to see Darby's book, "Silver Doe," among them. Pulling out Helen Garner's "This House of Grief," Corrin mentioned a pair of genre favorites: Janet Malcolm's "The Journalist and the Murderer" and Maggie Nelson's "The Red Parts."
"It's so good," Corrin said of the latter book. "I found that such an interesting study of humanness in this arena."
Darby is also a study in humanness. A different sort of detective, she is young, female and despite her perpetual scowl, she is, as her name suggests, all heart. "She takes it upon herself to become the voice of the voiceless," Corrin said. "That rests very, very deep inside her, that need to help those people."
One of the show's prescient themes is the increasing dominance and sophistication of artificial intelligence. Darby remains skeptical of technology, even as she uses chat boards and online searches in pursuit of her investigation. Corrin shares that skepticism.
"I will always prioritize human connection over artificial connection," they said. "That's where it begins and ends for me."
In some respects, Corrin felt quite far apart from Darby. "She's far more cynical than I am," Corrin said. "I quite naïvely look for the best in people, probably to a fault, and I can be quite gullible." But Corrin identified with Darby's empathy and drive. "She likes rising to a challenge, and she likes a problem," Corrin said. "I share that as well. I'm pretty fearless."
The actor's past roles, which have also included starring turns in "My Policeman" and "Lady Chatterley's Lover," have been largely period and largely romantic, the better to exploit Corrin's English rose looks. Darby is the least femme screen role Corrin has played (onstage, the actor starred in an adaptation of Virginia Woolf's gender-fluid "Orlando"). And though "A Murder" is in part a love story, gender and sexuality don't particularly define Darby.
"The modern aspect was a real tick for me," Corrin said. "Playing someone more androgynous was a real tick for me."
Because Corrin has spent the whole of their young adulthood onscreen, the actor's identity and relationships have been the source of much unwanted attention. Corrin described this corollary of fame as "that poisoned chalice thing," as well as "grim" and "inescapable." Maybe this has made them even more motivated to disappear into fictional people or to make choices that the public might not anticipate. It was recently announced that Corrin will next play a young scammer in the mercenary comedy "Peaches," set in Hong Kong.
"I surprised myself by being so into it," they said.
So Corrin does have some idea of what they like, just not when it comes to mysteries and thrillers. Stumped, Corrin appealed again to Wickersham.
"Do you think that John Grisham is the absolute master?"
"I liked those books when I was a kid," he said diplomatically.
Corrin considered one of Maurice Leblanc's Lupin novels, a Len Deighton, a Charles Willeford, a mystery cowritten by the prime minister of Iceland. "A Murder" had shot for a month in Iceland, which lent some verisimilitude to the chillier scenes. (Maybe too much verisimilitude. Brit Marling, one of the creators, experienced hypothermia on the shoot's first day.)
"The elements we were shooting in were just so intense," Corrin said. Even when the production moved inside, to sound stages in New Jersey, "you still could feel that in your body," Corrin said. "Being that freezing."
Still, Corrin couldn't choose a book. "I'm experiencing real indecision," they said. "Crippling indecision. I'm so bad at making decisions."
Finally, with their publicist murmuring about a subsequent appointment, Corrin was nudged toward Dorothy B. Hughes's "In a Lonely Place," a classic of California noir. The blurb on the back described it as a page turner, and Corrin nodded in approval.
"That's very exciting," they said, happy with the choice. "I'll need to do a lot of flying soon. So I need a good book."

X May Lose Up to $75 Million as Advertisers Flee: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Internal documents show companies like Airbnb, Coca-Cola and Microsoft have halted ads, or may do so, after Elon Musk's endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory.
X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter, could lose as much as $ 75 million in advertising revenue by the end of the year as dozens of major brands pause their marketing campaigns after its owner, Elon Musk, endorsed an antisemitic conspiracy theory this month.
Internal documents viewed by The New York Times this week show that the company is in a more difficult position than previously known and that concerns about Mr. Musk and the platform have spread far beyond companies including IBM, Apple and Disney, which paused their advertising campaigns on X last week. The documents list more than 200 ad units of companies from the likes of Airbnb, Amazon, Coca-Cola and Microsoft, many of which have halted or are considering pausing their ads on the social network.
The documents come from X's sales team and are meant to track the impact of all the advertising lapses this month, including those by companies that have already paused and others that may be at risk of doing so. They list how much ad revenue X employees fear the company could lose through the end of the year if advertisers do not return.
On Friday, X said in a statement that $ 11 million in revenue was at risk and that the exact figure fluctuated as some advertisers returned to the platform and others increased spending. The company said the numbers viewed by The Times were either outdated or represented an internal exercise to evaluate total risk.
The advertising freezes come during the final three months of the year, which is traditionally the social media company's strongest quarter as brands run holiday promotions for events such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In the last three months of 2021 -- the last year the company reported fourth-quarter earnings before Mr. Musk took over -- the company recorded $ 1.57 billion in revenue, of which nearly 90 percent came from advertising.
Since Mr. Musk's $ 44 billion acquisition of Twitter last year, some brands have been hesitant to advertise on the platform, concerned with Mr. Musk's behavior and content moderation decisions, which have led to a rise in incendiary and hateful content. U.S. advertising on the platform is down nearly 60 percent this year, prompting the company to try to woo back advertisers in an effort its chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, is spearheading. X is also campaigning for advertisers to return during the holiday period to make up for revenue shortfalls earlier in the year.
The documents, however, reveal that has not been going to plan. More than 100 brands are shown as having "fully paused" their ads while dozens of others are listed as "at risk." Many paused on or after Nov. 15, when Mr. Musk wrote in a post on X that the conspiracy theory that Jews supported the immigration of minorities to replace white populations was "the actual truth."
Leesha Anderson, the vice president of digital marketing and social media at the advertising agency Outcast, said its clients steadily stopped spending on X after Mr. Musk took over and had found alternatives on platforms like LinkedIn and TikTok.
"In today's dynamic marketplace, brands have a plethora of platform choices at their disposal for precise audience targeting," she said. "Therefore, it is imperative for the stewards and proprietors of social platforms to exercise deliberate discretion in all aspects, be it their personal beliefs or political stances, as these choices will inevitably undergo public scrutiny."
The organizations that have paused their ads on X range from political campaigns to fast food chains to tech giants, according to the documents. Airbnb, for example, halted more than $ 1 million of advertising, while Uber cut back on ads worth more than $ 800,000, halting campaigns in U.S. and international markets. Both tech companies declined to comment.
Other large brands, including Jack in the Box, Coca-Cola and Netflix, paused some of their campaigns. Netflix's halted ads were worth nearly $ 3 million, according to X's estimates. Jack in the Box, Coca-Cola and Netflix did not respond to requests for comment.
Various subsidiaries of Microsoft have also stopped advertising -- leading to a potential loss of more than $ 4 million in revenue for X's fourth quarter, based on the documents -- as have Amazon's units for books and music and one subsidiary of Google. The search giant and some other brands that have paused spending, including NBC Universal, have continued to post content on the platform without paying X to ensure it reaches a broad audience.
Google and Microsoft declined to comment. Amazon did not return requests for comment.
On the NBC program "Meet the Press" last Sunday, the Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie called Mr. Musk's comment part of a recent outpouring of an "outrageous type of hate."
"Whether it's Elon Musk, whether it's professors on our college campuses or students that they are misleading, or whether it's individuals who are speaking out in an antisemitic way on the streets of our cities," he said.
Two days before Mr. Christie's appearance, a super PAC supporting him, called Tell It Like It Is, pulled its advertising from X, according to the documents. A representative for the political fund-raising group did not respond to a request for comment.
In an internal meeting with employees at X this week, Ms. Yaccarino cut a defiant mood. She made no mention of Mr. Musk's endorsement of the antisemitic post and attributed the company's problems to a report by the left-wing media watchdog group Media Matters, which showed that ads on X from companies like IBM and Apple appeared next to posts promoting white nationalist and Nazi content.
On Monday, after Mr. Musk called Media Matters "an evil organization," X sued the group and argued that its report, which was published after Mr. Musk's statement, "manipulated the algorithms governing the user experience on X to bypass safeguards and create images of X's largest advertisers' paid posts adjacent to racist, incendiary content." Ms. Yaccarino has blamed the Media Matters report for X's declining ad sales.
"Kowtowing to external criticism or pressures is simply not how X will ever operate," she wrote in an email to X employees on Wednesday that was seen by The Times. "The people at X are free speech defenders. We stand in solidarity with those who believe in this fundamental right and the critical checks and balances of a thriving democracy."
Earlier this week, Mr. Musk spent time celebrating companies that have continued to advertise on X, including the National Football League. Using a heart emoji, X's billionaire owner said he loved the N.F.L. (The New York Times largely stopped marketing on the platform in early 2023, though the company's sports publication, The Athletic, has continued to purchase ads, according to a spokesman.)
Mr. Musk also noted that the company would donate "all revenue from advertising & subscriptions associated with the war in Gaza to hospitals in Israel and the Red Cross/Crescent in Gaza." The funding will include revenue from ads bought by charity groups, news organizations and other groups that advertised content related to the conflict.
Following her boss, Ms. Yaccarino added to Mr. Musk's original post with a plea.
"Lean in and help," she wrote on X.

Russian Pop Star Exiles Face a Creative Climb: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Before Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Monetochka was on her way to becoming a superstar in Russia.
She had released two hit albums of lyrical pop, secured ad deals with brands including Nike and Spotify, and was set to appear and sing a new song in theopening scene of Netflix's first original Russian drama, a lush adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina."
But President Vladimir V. Putin's military action derailed everything.
Netflix shelved the series. The big ad deals, which once constituted more than half of Monetochka's income, disappeared. And, after making a raft of antiwar statements and fleeing Russia, she was branded a foreign agent in January.
Yet the 25-year-old singer-songwriter -- who now lives in Lithuania and is scheduled to perform at the Melrose Ballroom in New York on Sunday as part of a U.S. and European tour -- said exile had removed the burden of worrying about what she says, and was worth the cost.
"You can scream, yell, rant, write any songs or poems you want -- and this, of course, means a lot to me," said Monetochka, or "Little Coin," whose real name is Liza Gyrdymova. "For me, this is such an important feeling, as an artist and a lyricist: freedom of expression."
She is just one of the many Russian music stars rebuilding their careers outside their homeland after taking a moral stand against the invasion of Ukraine. Now forced to operate at a distance from most of their fan bases and, in many cases, labeled traitors by their government, they are adopting touring schedules that hew to the new geography of the Russian diaspora as they try to keep their careers moving forward.
Michael Idov, a Latvian-American writer and director who has worked with top Russian singers and has directed a music video for Monetochka (pronounced moh-NYET-och-ka), said that those musicians faced several dilemmas abroad, even though in most cases Russians can still stream their music on YouTube and Yandex Music, a Russian streaming platform.
"The basic question is: Can you write new hits in this situation, or are you automatically a nostalgia act, even if the nostalgia is for the year 2021?" he said.
There was also the question of how to create a sustainable future. "After you have played every new Russian enclave five times, what do you do after that?" Mr. Idov added. The musicians could break into new markets through collaboration with non-Russian artists, Mr. Idov noted, but few had tried that approach, or put out much new music.
So far, the millions of Russian speakers outside Russia have been sustaining the performers. Last Saturday, at a Monetochka concert in Zurich, the hall was packed with nearly 700 fans, including middle-aged couples bopping along and screaming young women taking selfies -- some of them with their hair done up in the singer's trademark double buns. Everyone was speaking Russian.
Onstage, Monetochka acknowledged that things had changed. "For all these songs and these views and beliefs, folks, they gifted me the rank of foreign agent," she said. The crowd erupted in cheers, and the singer launched into a song criticizing Russian internet censorship.
Her tour, which kicked off in Barcelona last month, has faced logistical challenges. This week, Monetochka had to postpone a concert in London and cancel one in Miami because she didn't get visas in time. And figuring out the right size and type of venues has involved some guesswork.
To widen their appeal, some exiled artists, including Face, a Russian rapper, have considered switching to English. Yet only a couple of Russian acts, such as the girl group t.A.T.u., have ever landed a hit on the American charts.
Monetochka, who rocketed to fame in part because of the poetry of her subversive lyrics, said she couldn't imagine achieving a similar depth of expression in a language other than Russian. She plans to release a new album in the spring, which she said would reflect her rage and alarm about the war, but also the hopeful feelings she had felt since becoming a mother last year. She said she felt she needed to leave listeners with something positive, too.

Other exiled Russian stars have soured on living abroad. Morgenshtern, a popular Russian rapper who moved to Dubai last year and was also labeled a foreign agent, recently told a Russian interviewer that he missed home and wanted to return to Russia but was too scared for his safety, including the possibility of being sent to the front as retribution. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, later said no one would give Morgenshtern "guarantees that everything will be fine."
While Russian musicians who backed the war and embraced the accompanying nationalist fervor have found themselves rewarded with growing popularity and riches, the acts who left have felt financial impacts, even if they already had large followings outside the country.
Sonya Tayurskaya, a member of a rave band called Little Big, who moved to Los Angeles from Russia just days after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, said that the group had to go "back to the beginning."
Rebooting their career had been a test of character, said Ilya Prusikin, Little Big's main songwriter. "What we've learned is that money is not important," he said.
Monetochka said she knew her finances would suffer when she left Russia. She is now touring more and playing smaller venues than she did there. She said she was also considering moving beyond music, to stage theatrical performances that would be subtitled for non-Russian speakers, to try to reach new audiences.
But for now, she said, she was still making enough from concerts and streaming to produce new music -- and that was what matters.
"If you're still dreaming of some kind of big concert in Moscow, some sort of solo performance at the Olympic stadium, then it's going to be hard for you," she said. "You have to make the decision to go down a few notches and start building it up again."
"It doesn't take much time to get on your feet and understand how you can earn money," she added. "Everyone I know after this move feels a surge of inspiration. And again, this is the most important thing -- not money, but songs."
With young, tech-savvy music listeners in Russia always a step ahead of government censorship, she said she never expected to fully lose access to her fans in Russia. Her antiwar stance had also gained new fans in Ukraine, including among her nearly two million TikTok followers.
But even before the war, Monetochka had faced political pressure. After she released a video in support of L.G.B.T.Q. rights, Russian state television went after her, she said, and the authorities called music festivals to get her removed from lineups. She said she had come to shrug off Russia's branding her as a traitor with humor and "accept that people love to hate someone, they really need it -- and when the state encourages this, they reach untold heights."
Toward the end of her concert in Zurich, Monetochka tried to impart some of that resilient spirit as she prepared to play her 2020 song, "Will Survive," an anthem many of her fans have adopted amid the war.
"All of this nonsense, all of this nastiness and filth," she told the audience. "We will survive."

Deal Between Taiwan's Opposition Parties Cracks: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The split over a proposed joint ticket bolsters the governing party candidate's chances in the coming presidential election. That won't please Beijing.
For weeks, Taiwan's two main opposition parties were edging toward a coalition, in a bid to unseat the island democracy's governing party in the coming presidential election, an outcome that Beijing would welcome. The election, one elder statesman from Taiwan's opposition said, was a choice between war and peace.
This week, though, the two parties -- which both argue that they are better able to ensure peace with China -- chose in spectacular fashion to go to war against each other. An incipient deal for a joint presidential ticket between the long-established Nationalist Party and the upstart Taiwan People's Party unraveled with the speed, melodrama and lingering vitriol of a celebrity wedding gone wrong.
A meeting that was opened to journalists on Thursday seemed to have been meant as a show of good will within the opposition. But it featured sniping between rival spokesmen, a long-winded tribute to the spirit of Thanksgiving by Terry Gou -- a magnate turned politician trying to cajole the opposition toward unity -- and mutual accusations of bad faith between the two presidential candidates who had been trying to strike a deal: Hou Yu-ih of the Nationalist Party and Ko Wen-je, the founder of the Taiwan People's Party.
Mr. Gou tried to break the icy tensions at one point by saying that he needed a bathroom break.
"I don't want a silent ending on this Thanksgiving Day," he later told journalists after Mr. Hou and his two allies had left the stage. "But unfortunately it looks like it will be a silent ending."
Friday was the deadline for registering for Taiwan's election, which will be held on Jan. 13, and by noon both Mr. Hou and Mr. Ko had officially registered as presidential candidates, confirming that there would be no unity ticket. Mr. Gou, who had also thrown his hat in the ring, withdrew from the race.
Taiwan's young, vigorous democratic politics has often included some raucous drama. Yet even experienced observers of the Taiwanese scene have been agog by this week, and baffled as to why the opposition parties would stage such a public rupture over who would be the presidential candidate on a unity ticket, and who would accept the vice presidential nomination.
"It really defies theories of coalition building," Lev Nachman, a political scientist at National Chengchi University in Taipei, said of the week's bickering. "How do you tell undecided voters 'still vote for me' after having a very publicly messy, willfully uninformed debate about who ought to be first and who ought to be second?"
The collapse of the proposed opposition pact could have consequences rippling beyond Taiwan, affecting the tense balance between Beijing -- which claims the self-governing island as its own -- and Washington over the future status of the island.
The situation also makes it more likely that Taiwan's vice president, Lai Ching-te, the presidential candidate for the governing Democratic Progressive Party, or D.P.P., will win the election -- a result sure to displease Chinese Communist Party leaders.
Mr. Lai's party asserts Taiwan's distinctive identity and claims to nationhood, and has become closer to the United States. China's leaders could respond to a victory for him by escalating menacing military activities around Taiwan, which sits roughly 100 miles off the Chinese coast.
A victory for the Nationalists could reopen communication with China that mostly froze shortly after Tsai Ing-wen from the Democratic Progressive Party was elected president in 2016. And a third successive loss for the Nationalists, who favor closer ties and negotiations with Beijing, could undercut Chinese confidence that they remain a viable force.
Taiwan's first-past-the-post system for electing its president awards victory to the candidate with the highest raw percentage of votes. Mr. Lai has led in polls for months, but his projected share of the vote has sat below 40 percent in many surveys, meaning that the opposition could claw past his lead if it coalesced behind a single candidate. Mr. Hou and Mr. Ko for months sat around the mid- to high 20s in polls, suggesting that it could be hard for either to overtake Mr. Lai unless the other candidate stepped aside.
"This may scare off moderate voters who might have been into voting for a joint ticket for the sake of blocking the D.P.P.," Mr. Nachman said of the falling out between the opposition parties. "Now those moderate voters will look at this team in a different light."
For now, many Taiwanese people seem absorbed -- sometimes gleeful, sometimes anguished -- by the spectacle of recent days. "Wave Makers," a recent Netflix drama series, showed Taiwanese electoral politics as a noble, if sometimes cutthroat, affair. This week was more like the political satire "Veep."
Last weekend, the Nationalist Party and Taiwan People's Party appeared poised to settle on a unity ticket, with each agreeing to decide on their choice of joint presidential nominee -- Mr. Hou or Mr. Ko -- by examining electoral polls to determine who had the strongest shot at winning.
But teams of statistical experts put forward by each party could not agree on what polls to use and what to make of the results, and the parties became locked in days of bickering over the numbers and their implications. At news conferences, rival spokespeople brandished printouts of opinion poll results and struggled to explain complex statistical concepts.
The real issue was which leader would claim the presidential nominee spot, and the quarrel exposed deep wariness between the Nationalists -- a party with a history of over a century that is also known as the Kuomintang, or K.M.T. -- and the Taiwan People's Party, which Mr. Ko, a surgeon and former mayor of Taipei, founded in 2019.
"The K.M.T., as the grand old party, could never make way for an upstart party, so structurally, it was very difficult for them to work out how to work together," said Brian Hioe, a founding editor of New Bloom, a Taiwanese magazine that takes a critical view of mainstream politics. On the other hand, Mr. Hioe added, "Ko Wen-je's party has the need to differentiate itself from the K.M.T. -- to show that it's independent and different -- and so working with the K.M.T. would be seen by many of his party membership as a betrayal."
Ma Ying-jeou, the Nationalist president of Taiwan from 2008 to 2016, stepped in to try to broker an agreement between his party and Mr. Ko. Hopes rose on Thursday when Mr. Hou announced that he would be waiting at Mr. Ma's office to hold negotiations with Mr. Ko.
But it quickly became clear that Mr. Ko and Mr. Hou remained divided. Mr. Ko refused to go to Mr. Ma's office, and insisted on talks at another location. Mr. Hou stayed put in Mr. Ma's office for hours, waiting for Mr. Ko to give way. Eventually, Mr. Hou agreed to meet at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Taipei, and party functionaries announced with solemn specificity that the talks would happen in Room 2538.
Dozens of journalists converged on the hotel, waiting for a possible announcement. Expectations rose when Mr. Hou entered a conference room where the journalists and live-feed cameras waited. But he sat with a fixed smile for about 20 minutes before Mr. Ko arrived, glowering. Mr. Gou, the magnate, opened proceedings with his tribute to Thanksgiving and calls for unity, recalling his wedding ceremony in the same hotel. But it soon became clear that Mr. Hou and Mr. Ko were no closer.
On Friday, Taiwanese people had shared images online and quips ridiculing the opposition's public feuding. Photographs of Room 2538, a suite at the Grand Hyatt, circulated on the internet. Some likened the spectacle to "The Break-up Ring," a popular Taiwanese television show that featured quarreling couples and their in-laws airing their grievances on camera.
Some drew a more somber conclusion: that dysfunction on the opposition side left Taiwan's democracy weaker.
"In a healthy democracy, No. 2 and No. 3 will collaborate to challenge No. 1," said Wu Tzu-chia, the chairman of My Formosa, an online magazine. "This should be a very rigorous process, but in Taiwan, it's become very crude, like buying meat and vegetables in the marketplace."

The Food Is Virtual. The Feeling Is Real.: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Full text: By asking players to cook and eat virtual food, game designers are finding resonant ways to tell personal stories.
Food in video games is often referred to as a "consumable," a resource that confers health or another perk on the player. But in Venba, a narrative cooking game, food is something more: It's something to labor over, to infuse with rich emotions, to savor.
In one scene, an immigrant mother cooks a meal for her son, expecting him home from university. Chicken drumsticks simmer in a sticky sauce; a whole fish sizzles in a frying pan; an unctuous golden curry bubbles. But the son does not show up, and as the afternoon light fades, the bountiful platter of delicately spiced food goes cold.
This was the first idea the designer Abhi Swaminathan had for Venba, which traces the challenges of an Indian family that has immigrated to Canada in the 1980s. The concept germinated while he was at his mother's home in Toronto as she was "fussing over dinner." He recalled immediately sending a text to the game's lead artist, Sam Elkana, who was coincidentally breaking bread at a nearby restaurant with his own "amma" (a word for mother in India).
Despite Venba's three-year development phase, this scene of prepared-yet-uneaten food made it into the final game essentially untouched. It contains almost the entire thematic thrust of the indie title: Cooking is fundamentally an act of care, and generational and geographic distance can produce unsettling melancholy.
"For South Asian women who have been put in the role of the family caregiver, cooking is a very big deal," Swaminathan said. "If you say no to a meal, or you don't show up for a meal, it affects them very strongly. For me, the thought was, Why is that?"
By foregrounding food in a touching diasporic story, Venba, released in July, sits apart from arcade takes on cooking like the Cooking Mama and Cook, Serve, Delicious! franchises. It does not grade your dishes, or ask the player to complete a culinary task by repeatedly tapping buttons.
Venba is interested instead in food's emotional resonance, putting it in conversation with video games like Thirsty Suitors, Tet and the forthcoming Consume Me and Nainai's Recipe, as well as recent books like Michelle Zauner's memoir, "Crying in H Mart," and Bryan Washington's novel "Family Meal."
The first project from Visai Games, a Toronto-based studio, Venba features light puzzles that require the player to piece together recipes in the correct order, using the faded and food-splattered directions written down by the protagonist's own mother. Importantly, there are no repercussions for failing -- you simply start over, as the caring cook would.
"Making a bad meal is canonically impossible in the story," said Swaminathan, who added that he hopes to impart genuine cooking knowledge to enthusiastic players. "Even something as simple as putting onions and aromatics in before the tomatoes -- there's a reason for that. It's about getting players to think about the steps instead of blindly following directions."
Venba's vivid re-creation of Tamil cuisine, which includes a hearty rasam soup and savory crepes called dosas that are made from a fermented batter, is powerful. Swaminathan cooked each of the game's recipes himself, painstakingly documenting each step with photographs that were then reimagined by Elkana in a lightly animated, hand-drawn visual style. The game's sound designer, Neha Patel, was similarly exacting, capturing each popping mustard seed and sautéing onion with a suite of microphones arranged around her cooker.
Like so many other virtual takes on real-world pursuits, cooking in video games is both an abstraction and an impression.
The gastronomic scenes in the narrative-adventure game Thirsty Suitors, released this month, are as much about people -- particularly the protagonist, Jala, and her judgmental mother -- as they are about the food. "Editing down to the emotional beats of the relationship was the important thing for us," said Chandana Ekanayake, the game's creative director.
While the player is busied with the essentials of making an Indian flatbread called paratha -- twirling an analog stick to mimic the mixing of oil, flour and water; rapidly pressing a button as if shaking a frying pan -- dialogue between Jala and her mother plays out.
"For lots of us, doing something with your hands, or doing a joint activity with your parents is a way to open up a conversation you might not want to have otherwise," said the narrative lead, Meghna Jayanth, who drew on mealtime experiences with her South Asian family.
Help Jala nail a recipe and she'll inspire a "Ratatouille"-esque flashback in her parents, catapulting them through space and time to their previous life in India. But even after such a transcendent experience, Jala's mother retains her cool, emotionally distant demeanor: "It tastes ... decent," she says of her daughter's nearly immaculate paratha.
Family, celebration and belonging are the central ingredients of Venba and Thirsty Suitors, but anxiety and compulsion lurk in the darker Consume Me, an upcoming game from Jenny Jiao Hsia and AP Thomson. Taking inspiration from Lucas Pope's bureaucratic puzzle simulator Papers, Please, it uses the numeric, computational foundations of video games to explore Jiao Hsia's own experience of dieting in high school.
"I was obsessed with the numbers on the scale, the calorie counts," she said.
Assuming the role of Jenny herself, the player completes a series of WarioWare-style mini-games centering on activities like yoga, makeup application and what its creators call "food Tetris." If one of the needs meters you must manage -- energy, mood or guts, which applies to both your stomach's health and how brave you're feeling -- falls to zero, Jenny experiences nightmarish visions and the game ends.
Jiao Hsia, who said in an interview that she "engaged in disordered eating" as a teenager, worries that the game's brightly colored take on intense subject matter might be misinterpreted as a guide for people seeking to control their weight. But it was an intentional choice for the events to unfold without an overtly didactic message.
"The game doesn't present solutions to these problems," Thomson said. "We're showing you how this went down for Jenny in her own life, and it doesn't necessarily resolve in a way that's clean or satisfying."
Telling authentic cultural stories is gaining importance in video games, which Ekanayake explicitly addressed while courting publishers and investors for Thirsty Suitors. His current television obsession, K-drama, has exploded in popularity in recent years.
"Part of our pitch was the idea of how broader media and culture is starting to show, not just South Asian stories, but stories from other cultures through the globalization of platforms like Netflix and Amazon," said Ekanayake, who hopes that games that treat food seriously will not merely be a flash in the pan.
On the day Venba was released, Swaminathan was delighted to see a cohort of Tamil YouTubers playing the game, including one whose amma sat alongside him to helped him complete the puzzles. "Every reference, every detail that I put in there, they caught all of it," he said.
Games like these are among the most visible ways that creators are pushing beyond the action-hero power fantasies starring white male protagonists. Jayanth, the narrative lead for Thirsty Suitors, stressed that food in video games can be both an affirmation for those familiar with its sights, smells and sounds, and an invitation to those who are not.
"Immigrant food is the lifeblood of cuisine" in the United Kingdom, said Jayanth, who also spends time in India. "It's an easy way to get people to come into your culture. But, you know, if you're going to eat our food, get to know us, too. We're just as big and vibrant."

Full text: Thanks to a splashy relaunch on Hulu, new generations have their first encounter with the soapy, sax-heavy legal drama that made its debut in 1986.
"L.A. Law," an Emmy-winning NBC drama that generated almost constant buzz during its run three decades ago, returned to the cultural spotlight this month when Hulu rereleased its 172 episodes in remastered high-definition format.
Until the streaming relaunch, the show was hard to find, existing in DVDs at junk shops and in the depths of Amazon Prime Video. And so, unlike "The Golden Girls," "Friends," "Seinfeld" and a few other series from the 1980s and 1990s, it had remained all but unknown to anyone born in the last 40 years or so.
In recent days the Styles journalists Melissa Guerrero, Sadiba Hasan, Callie Holtermann and Louis Lucero -- all members of the Millennial or Gen Z generations who had never seen "L.A. Law" -- watched the first three episodes on Hulu. They shared their observations with the editors Minju Pak and Jim Windolf, who were fans of the show in its heyday.
Produced by Steven Bochco and Terry Louise Fisher, and starring Harry Hamlin (Michael Kuzak), Corbin Bernsen (Arnie Becker), Jill Eikenberry (Ann Kelsey), Jimmy Smits (Victor Sifuentes) and Susan Dey (Grace Van Owen), "L.A. Law" made its debut in September 1986. It was the subject of workplace conversation and countless think pieces, and it won 15 Emmys before the final gavel in 1994.
So how does it hold up for viewers in the 2020s? Is it just a time capsule of the Reagan-Bush-Clinton years, or something more? The conversation below has been edited for length and clarity.
Louis Lucero It's "Law & Order," minus the order. Doozies abound. "You didn't need a lift -- you hardly had anything to drink!" I was thrilled to encounter that charming line at the end of the third episode.
Jim Windolf Buzzed driving was apparently not drunken driving in the 1980s.
Minju Pak Did anyone else notice the saxophone and all the silk?
Callie Holtermann Sorry, I was too busy learning about smoking indoors.
Melissa Guerrero And car phones. Someone please bring them back, if only for the aesthetic.
JW The sax in the opening credits really sets a mood. Along with the vanity plates.
LL That saxophone should be licensed by the A.T.F.!
Sadiba Hasan The theme song alone made me want to turn off the TV.
MP I do love the depiction of L.A. traffic, which is now decidedly worse. Can I ask the younger people here, was there anything about the show that you liked? Did the office politics horrify you?
LL To the second question, a hard yes, obviously. But in spite of myself, there was a lot that I found delightful. It's always intoxicating to see an analog office, for starters -- the visual equivalent of ASMR for the Slack-addled millennial brain.
JW It's hard to imagine what people did in their offices when there's no computer on the desk.
LL People running around with manila envelopes and little slips of paper that say who called? Literally unimaginable. Too cute for words! Did people realize how adorable they were being?
JW They did not.
MP I did find that network television moved really quickly.
MG I appreciated how, from the initial scene onward, the show made the characters' fatal flaws very apparent.
JW The first few episodes pack in a lot of issues we're still dealing with. There's a "doozy" factor in how they're treated, but they're there. A trans woman; a woman denied a promotion after she sleeps with a partner; bosses botching workplace diversity; and heartless insurance companies. How did all that strike you?
SH I was worried that an '80s law show would have aged terribly, but many of the issues that came up are still very much relevant, like victim blaming in sexual assault cases and racism in the workplace. And while there are lawyers at the firm who are greedy and seemingly heartless, there are also lawyers with a conscience.
MG Truthfully, I held my breath when some of these themes came up. It played into the assumption that old TV shows wouldn't address this well.
CH At one point Kuzak says something like, "I don't always believe my client, but I have to believe in the system." Every generation rails against "the system" in a way it believes is unique, but I doubt that line is going to draw in Gen Z viewers.
LL At least once an act break in the first three episodes, I was reminded that today's progressivism may prove to be tomorrow's cringe. Obviously, the reveal of Georgia's trans identity was played for shock, but it's not difficult to imagine the writers patting themselves on the back for affording the character a nominal bit of dignity of explaining herself on several occasions.
JW Before "L.A. Law," that kind of thing was played for laughs. I'm thinking of Klinger on "M*A*S*H," or Flip Wilson as Geraldine on "The Flip Wilson Show." Can we take a look at the style? Did any of the fashion jump out at you?
SH So much blonde hair. Blonde hair everywhere.
LL And in such different arrangements!
MP Did people age worse back then? Or maybe they just dressed old.
JW The men's suits were incredibly roomy.
MP I kept hoping for a good tailor to show up.
MG Susan Dey's character reminded me of C.C. Babcock from "The Nanny." The blonde bob! The pantsuit! The power! Iconic.
CH I Googled some of the actors to see if any of them were the Jacob Elordi of their day. And Harry Hamlin was People's Sexiest Man Alive in 1987!
LL Harry Hamlin was a reveallllll. To me, he has always been Lisa Rinna's unseen, Godot-like husband. The fact that he was as '80s-hot as promised? Bless up.
MG I'm sorry to Jimmy Smits, but he will always be Senator Organa to me -- Princess Leia's adoptive father.
JW What does an old show need to make an impression now? Why have "Friends," "Seinfeld," "The Golden Girls" and a few others from decades ago hung on in the streaming age?
SH A big part of that is, it just needs to be a sitcom. A show that makes you laugh stands the test of time.
CH I want to put forth the "Suits" theory. Netflix just had a huge hit with resurging interest in the 2010s legal drama. So I think Hulu tried to say, Hey, we have an even older legal drama. But "Suits" has the advantage of Meghan Markle taking the LSAT over and over.
LL Speaking of Jimmy Smits, I just wrapped my second rewatch of "The West Wing."
MP Smits is one of those actors who's the same in every character he plays, but it works. A cop, a lawyer, the president. He always has the same haircut, which I've never been able to describe. Is it a mullet? Is it feathered?
LL What it certainly is, on this show, at least, is a few inches above a stud earring.
MP Yes! Truly subversive.
MG I would describe that haircut as, "My Tito's haircut when they stop caring about their hair and decide they want a motorcycle for their 50th birthday."
LL For the number of micro-, macro- and in-between aggressions poor Victor put up with, he should've been able to have his septum pierced, if he wanted.
MP Can I ask the younger folks here, what are some of the older shows you're watching?
SH I always turn to "Girlfriends" and "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." Sitcoms! My comfort shows!
MG I'm diving into "The Nanny." I grew up watching that show with my mom, but we didn't have the luxury of streaming, and the story line was completely out of order.
JW So what's the verdict on "L.A. Law"?
CH I liked it more than I thought I would. There are parts that made me go, "Yikes!", but it helped me understand where soapy dramas, "Succession" included, come from. I doubt I'll watch more but I don't feel like "L.A. Law" and its schmaltzy saxophone should be swept into the dustbin of time.
LL It's an artifact. A trapped-in-amber, predictably problematic, genuinely funny artifact, one that I'm leaning toward giving a few more episodes. Even if only to see more memos being jotted down for people "leaving word"!

Fact vs. Fiction on Season 6 of 'The Crown': [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The final season of the royal drama series opens in 1997, just weeks before Princess Diana's death. Here's how The Times covered the fatal car accident and its aftermath.
Since its premiere in 2016, Netflix's "The Crown" has followed the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, blending fact and fiction as each season inches closer to the present day. Last year, after complaints about the show's historical inaccuracies, Netflix added a disclaimer that "The Crown" is a "fictional dramatization."
The show's sixth and final season, the first four episodes of which arrived on Thursday, opens in 1997, eight weeks before the death of Diana, Princess of Wales (Elizabeth Debicki), in a car crash in Paris, along with her boyfriend, the Egyptian film producer Emad Mohamed al-Fayed, known as Dodi (Khalid Abdalla). (The driver, Henri Paul, was also killed.)
The accident, as the couple was pursued by paparazzi, shocked the world, and 30 million people in the United States alone watched the funeral of "the people's princess" on television.
But the public wasn't privy to the private conversations between Diana and the people close to her in the weeks leading up to her death, which "The Crown" imagines. In the first four episodes -- the final six will land on Dec. 14 -- Diana is navigating co-parenting with her ex-husband, Charles, uncertain about her future and her relationship with Dodi as the press follows the couple's every move.
So how accurate is the show's depiction of the period leading up to the accident, and the subsequent fallout?
Here is a look at how The Times and other news outlets reported on this period at the time. You can find more in the TimesMachine archive browser. (Warning: This feature contains spoilers for Season 6 of "The Crown.")
Episode 1, 'Persona Non Grata'
Diana's budding relationship with Dodi Fayed and her desire to make real change in the world through charitable work is a particular focus in Episode 1.
As Diana moves away from her unsuccessful relationship with Prince Charles (Dominic West), he is focused on his partner, Camilla Parker Bowles (Olivia Williams), being accepted by the royal family and the British public. While Charles throws a 50th birthday party for Camilla, Diana takes Prince William (Rufus Kampa) and Prince Harry (Fflyn Edwards) on a holiday to Saint-Tropez, where they vacation on a yacht owned by the Egyptian businessman and father of Dodi, Mohamed al-Fayed (Salim Daw).
On July 15, 1997, The Times reported on coverage in the British news media that Camilla and Charles wanted to marry. "For the last several weeks, newspapers, even respectable, conservative-leaning ones like The Daily Telegraph, have been quoting unnamed 'friends' as saying that the couple would very much like to marry and hope that the stern British public will eventually sympathize," Sarah Lyall reported.
In that same paper, as part of a regular column that often provided short snippets of celebrity news, Elaine Louie wrote that, despite being notified of Diana taking the children to France, "it is not clear whether the queen knew that Diana's host would be Mohamed al-Fayed, the Egyptian billionaire who was a figure in recent political scandals."
Episode 2, 'Two Photographs'
This episode follows two photographers taking very different images of "The Crown" characters.
On the show, al-Fayed asks his staff to find "the best photographer on the Mediterranean" to take paparazzi shots of Dodi and Diana. Mario Brenna (Enzo Cilenti), a photographer known for his celebrity portraits, captures the couple kissing on a yacht in Italy. These photographs were bought and published by The Sunday Mirror, with The Daily Mail and several international publications also paying hefty sums to reproduce them.
"London newspapers have been filled with articles about the Princess of Wales on a six-day Mediterranean cruise off the coast of Italy with Dodi Fayed," The Times's Chronicle column noted on Aug. 8, 1997. "In a change of pace, the princess is scheduled to fly to Bosnia today to call attention to the damage caused by land mines and to meet with land mine victims."
The Los Angeles Times reported in September 1997 that Brenna was said to have earned $ 5 million for selling the first paparazzi images of the couple worldwide.
"Money like that creates an international tabloid feeding frenzy," Steve Coz, the then-editor of the National Enquirer, told the newspaper. "Anything can happen when the stalker paparazzi think a photograph can win them the lottery."
In 2008, The Guardian reported that al-Fayed took a British celebrity photographer, Jason Fraser, to court for taking photos of the couple on a yacht in Italy days before they died. The Guardian's report stated that Fraser had been ordered by a French court to pay al-Fayed £3,900, equivalent to $ 5,000, in damages, after it ruled the images breached the couple's privacy.
In "The Crown," to counteract the glamorous images of Diana and the hubbub surrounding her new relationship, Prince Charles's publicist suggests a wholesome shoot featuring Charles, Harry and William. A Scottish photographer enamored with the royal family, the fictional Duncan Muir (Forbes Masson), is trusted with the task.
In reality, the photographs of the royal men posing on the river bank near Balmoral Castle, in Scotland, a residence of the British royal family, have been attributed to many royal photographers since they were published, including Arthur Edwards, Tim Graham and Kent Gavin.
Episode 3, 'Dis-Moi Oui'
In this episode, the rising intensity of the paparazzi attention while Dodi and Diana are on a holiday in the South of France has the pair agreeing to return home to London. But Dodi convinces Diana to stop briefly in Paris with him, where he plans to propose with a ring she had shown interest in during their trip.
To Dodi's surprise, Diana rejects the proposal in their suite at the Ritz, explaining that, while she knows the world is wondering if they will wed, "that's not a reason to actually do it," adding: "I'm nowhere near ready for another marriage, and you've barely untangled yourself from the last person you proposed to." The pair agree to leave through the back of the hotel to stay the night in Dodi's apartment.
According to The Guardian in 2007, grainy CCTV footage from the day of the accident showed Dodi at the Repossi jewelry store in Paris, near the Ritz, inspecting rings. Later, a Ritz staff member took an item in a bag from the shop to the couple's suite at the hotel. After the couple's death, a ring bearing the inscription "Dis-moi Oui" ("Tell Me Yes") was recovered from that suite, The Guardian reported.
On Sept. 1, 1997, the day after the fatal crash, The Times also noted that a person close to Dodi believed the film producer wished to propose. Hassan Yassin, a Saudi businessman and a cousin to Dodi's late mother, is quoted as saying, "He told me last night he was going to marry her."
Episode 4, 'Aftermath'
The final episode of Part 1 breaks down the days following the car crash, as Diana and Dodi's families are informed of the incident. While Dodi died instantly, Diana is taken to a hospital for surgery before dying soon after. Al-Fayed hopes the tragedy will bring him closer to the royal family, but he soon learns that the queen still has no interest in being in contact with him.
On the day of Diana's death, The Times reported that she had been "killed shortly after midnight today in an automobile accident in a tunnel by the Seine." The article noted that a spokesman for the Prefecture of Police in France said: "The car was being chased by photographers on motorcycles, which could have caused the accident." Several motorcyclists were detained for questioning after the crash.
"Diana lived in a remote universe of glamour and fashion, but her death is a shock because she made a genuine emotional connection with those outside her world," a Times editorial, published Sept. 1, said. "She did so by dint of her mesmerizing beauty and her intense personal struggles."
In "The Crown," the royal family discusses the intricacies of how they should handle the funeral of a former princess, with Prince Philip telling the queen they should not follow the special measures provided for the death of a royal family member. "Diana was no longer royal," he said. "We must be seen to be doing this by the book."
In reality, in the days following Diana's death, Britain's tabloid newspapers published front pages demanding the queen do the opposite, and break with protocol: On Sept. 4, the headlines read: "Show Us You Care" (The Express); "Your People Are Suffering, Speak To Us Ma'am" (The Mirror); and "Where Is Our Queen? Where Is Her Flag?" (The Sun), referring to the tradition of flying a flag at half-mast to honor a high-profile death.
Peter Morgan, the creator of "The Crown," also explored this public anger with the royal family in the wake of Diana's death in his 2006 film "The Queen," in which Helen Mirren played a Queen Elizabeth II out of step with the intensity of her nation's grief.
Diana's funeral took place on Sept. 6, and the BBC reported that more than a million members of the public lined the funeral procession's route through central London to pay their respects to Diana.
"Britain discovered feelings this week it never knew it had," The Times wrote in a front-page story the day after the funeral, adding that the intensity of the British public's grief felt more like "the American belief in the value of letting it all hang out at moments of personal and national stress."
In the show, we see the day mostly from William and Harry's perspectives as they march behind their mother's coffin, passing by crowds of wailing members of the public. "Why are they crying for someone they never knew?" William asks Philip. He replies, "They're not crying for her. They're crying for you."
The Times's report on Diana's funeral noted that "Dr. Carey, the Archbishop, asked that the congregation pray for Emad Mohamed al-Fayed, Diana's companion, known as Dodi, and for Henri Paul, who were also killed in the crash last Sunday. Mr. Fayed's father, Mohamed, was in the audience."

Full text: "Squid Game: The Challenge" keeps the slick design of the dystopian drama but loses the point.
Late in the first season of Netflix's "Squid Game" -- two-year-old spoiler alert, I guess -- an elaborate, deadly contest among 456 needy contestants is revealed to be an entertainment for the viewing pleasure of a handful of crass, wealthy "VIPs," who watch the gruesome proceedings wearing golden animal masks.
You could look at that situation and see a dramatization of the way a decadent system exploits desperate souls. Or you could look at it and say: All that production effort and they couldn't monetize the show for a bigger audience?
For everyone in the latter group, there is now "Squid Game: The Challenge." The reality spinoff, whose first five episodes premiered Wednesday on Netflix, keeps the drama's kaleidoscopic set design, its outfits and many of its competitions. It gets rid of the messy murder business -- sort of -- along with most of the uncomfortable ideas.
What's left is a beautifully designed but empty game box, a creepy dystopia cosplay, an answer to the question of what happens when you take a darkly pointed TV satire and remove its brains.
The worldview of the original "Squid Game," written and directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk, was as subtle as a gunshot. Debtors, criminals and sundry other last-chancers are recruited by a mysterious organization to compete in scaled-up versions of playground games. One player will win a life-changing sum; the penalty for losing is death.
Through the protagonist, Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), we confront the question of whether one can survive the game, and by extension a ruthless economic system, and still keep one's soul. The commentary could be blunt and obvious; "there's a difference between making reference to something and actually illuminating it," my colleague Mike Hale wrote. But the show had something to say and said it with style.
"The Challenge" keeps the style, with the copycat precision of an A.I. image generator. It opens with a montage of colorful re-created "Squid Game" sets and the singsong of the giant robo-doll that presided over the opening game of Red Light, Green Light.
That game opens "The Challenge," with the full mob of contestants, dressed in familiar green track suits, stop-start racing to a finish line. Those who fail, by moving when they are supposed to be frozen, are eliminated faux-execution-style; tiny squibs explode under their shirts, spattering them with black ink. (Apparently a simulated shooting massacre is tasteful as long as you don't use red.) They fall "dead," like war re-enactors. The survivors are brought to a re-creation of the cavernous prison-dorm and burst out in cheers. "Best slumber party ever!" one says.
The stakes are real, if not life-or-death. For every player fake-murdered, $ 10,000 is added to the prize pot, represented as in the drama by a giant piggy bank, up to $ 4.56 million.
The idea of basing a real game on a brutal fake one isn't inherently bad. (The reports of "inhumane" filming conditions are another matter; Netflix has said that "all appropriate health and safety measures were taken.") Plenty of great reality shows gamify deadly situations. "Survivor" is a stylized shipwreck. "The Traitors," from the same studio as "The Challenge," is essentially a murder mystery.
The problem with "The Challenge" is symbolized by those little pops of black "blood." It's painfully literal, yet colorless.
It doesn't want you to forget for a second that you're visiting the wonderful world of "Squid Game" -- that I.P. is too valuable to abstractify. Besides rebuilding the sets, it tries to reproduce characters from the series, finding contestants to fill the roles of hard villains, doomed softies and sympathetic elders. One group of allies dub themselves the "Gganbu Gang," using the Korean word for a close friend that was a key term in the series.
But "The Challenge" shies away from everything in "Squid Game" that cut to the jugular -- in particular, the commentary about how capitalism pits ordinary people in gladiatorial combat. Like a lot of reality shows, it peppers in interviews with players who want to win the prize to support family or achieve dreams. But the competition is cast as opportunity, not exploitation. "The Challenge" does not want to bum you out.
Why does it matter? Great games don't just have good mechanics. They have ideas, like Monopoly, the family rainy-day pastime originally conceived to disseminate Georgist concepts about land use and equity. Reality shows have ideas, too, uplifting or cynical or even satirical. A game's rules are an expression of values; the kind of play that works in a certain game says something about the kind of behavior that works, or should work, in the world.
So if you take a reality competition -- even a fictional one -- and keep its aesthetics while stripping its foundational ideas, you're left with, in this case, a well-produced, boring version of "Big Brother." There's a lot of generic conflict, a lot of stultifying downtime in the bunk room and way too many characters to try to build investment in.
And because "The Challenge" wants to reproduce the look and gameplay of "Squid Game" while staying all in good fun (a producer likened it to a theme-park ride based on a movie), it's a tonal mess.
At times, it offers a bleak view of human nature. Players are disdained for cracking under pressure and one contestant, an early "villain" in the narrative, says, "sympathy, it's only a weakness." Other times, it is stickily sentimental and heartwarming. Sometimes the show encourages, or at least allows, cooperation; sometimes it forbids it.
"The Challenge" does pull off some exciting set pieces. There's a wicked twist to set up the pairings in the one-on-one marble game (which was also the dramatic high point of the original series). It even manages to improve on the glass-bridge hopscotch game. (Other events, like a board-game-based replacement for the drama's tug of war segment, feel interminable.) But even at its best, you're always conscious of watching an escape-room simulacrum of a famous TV show.
And that's where there is a kind of message in "Squid Game: The Challenge," if an inadvertent one: It is an object lesson in how entertainment can appropriate any artistic or political statement. There is no dystopia so chilling that, with the right production values, you can't sell it back to the audience as escapist fun.
Since "The Challenge" does depend on being escapist fun, though, it can't embrace this meta idea either. Maybe the biggest loss in this adaptation is the tension between the players and the competition itself. In the original drama, the game was the ultimate villain, and we saw the hero finally rebel against its shadowy makers.
In the reality show, I'd expect no such satisfaction. The only way to win is not to watch.

Subscription Culture Turned Us Into Spendthrift Zombies: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In recent years, much of my life as a consumer has shifted to what I like to call background spending. As I've subscribed to more apps and streaming platforms, significant sums of my money tend to drift away each month without my ever thinking about it. It's as if it were a tax being taken out of my paycheck, one spent on something silly or indulgent like a subscription box of international snacks instead of -- I don't know -- basic public infrastructure.
Think of it as automated capitalism. Spending without the hassle of spending. Acquisition without action. Or thought.
But while this swell of subscriptions was sold to me on the premise it would make my life more hassle-free, there was a certain sticker shock I felt upon discovering how much I was spending without realizing each month ( $ 179.45) -- after I'd already spent it, of course.
I can't help feeling I'm being conned just a little. I admit I had forgotten I was paying monthly for the privilege of Apple TV+ after being hooked by the first season of "Ted Lasso," then quickly falling off the bandwagon. When I reopened the app for the first time in eons, I was confronted with dozens of shows I've never heard of but to whose production budgets I've been contributing generously.
You see, the thing about background spending is it tends to happen, well, in the background without your full attention. And therein lies the point.
"Hand over your credit card details and let us take care of the rest," these companies assure us. But by agreeing to this trade, we've become passive consumers who are allowing the balance of capitalism to tilt away from us. We have ceded one of our key powers as individuals: our agency.
And this laziness breeds more laziness because most of us can't be bothered with conducting regular reviews of our subscription spending. Indeed, economists estimate that buyers forgetting to cancel subscriptions can increase a business's revenue by as much as 200 percent. It's no wonder these companies feel that they can jack up the prices. We're too lazy or busy to even notice or cancel!
I know it's not just me who is suddenly living life as a smooth-brained subscriber. The average consumer spends $ 273 per month on subscriptions, according to a 2021 poll of 2,500 by digital services firm West Monroe, which found this spending was up 15 percent from 2018. Not a single person polled knew what his actual monthly spending was.
It's understandable why this model is so alluring for businesses. As companies questioned traditional advertising models (especially on social media platforms and digital publishers), subscriptions offered the promise of "selling once and earning forever." (In a sign of the times, even social media companies like Meta and X, formerly Twitter, are now offering subscriptions.) And while subscription services have been around for decades (think Wine of the Month Club), more customers have been willing to sign up thanks to the prevalence of smartphones and the increasing ease of home delivery.
Demand is so high that the investment bank UBS has estimated the entire subscription economy will grow to $ 1.5 trillion by 2025, more than doubling the $ 650 billion it was in 2020.
But while these subscriptions promise ease and happiness, not all of us are satisfied. Last year, the Kearney Consumer Institute found 40 percent of consumers believe they have too many subscriptions. Almost half of us also think we pay too much for streaming video-on-demand subscriptions, in particular, while roughly a third intend to reduce the number of such subscriptions, per an April report from Deloitte Insights.
There's also evidence we are spending way more on subscriptions than we even realize. Last year, C+R Research asked 1,000 people to estimate what they fork over in subscription costs before having them itemize this spending. They found the average monthly spend was $ 219 -- more than 2.5 times the $ 86 that people guessed.
It's no wonder we've lost track of this spending given how subscriptions have consumed almost every aspect of our lives. Consider this: On a typical day, you might wake up and meditate, perhaps using the Calm app (yearly subscription: $ 69.99), before getting ready using makeup from your Birchbox ( $ 20 per month). Then, as you eat breakfast, don't forget to log your meals on your weight loss app Noom ( $ 209 annually). After that, it's just a quick Citi Bike ride to work ( $ 205 annual membership) to your local Equinox gym (starting at around $ 200 per month) where, instead of forking out for a personal trainer, you decided you could save money by opting instead to use an app like Fitbod ( $ 12.99 per month).
During the workday, you might get a Sweetgreen salad for lunch (whose premier loyalty program costs $ 10 per month) or perhaps just a coffee from Pret ( $ 40 per month loyalty program). When you get home after a commute spent listening to music on Spotify ( $ 10.99 per month), be sure to check your lobby to see if any Amazon packages have been delivered ( $ 14.99 per month for Prime membership). And don't forget to pick up your Hello Fresh groceries (roughly $ 70 for three two-person meals) or your wine subscription box from SommSelect ( $ 99 per month for four bottles) or your new pet toys from Barkbox ( $ 20 per month for a year's subscription).
After dinner, it's time to unwind by watching ad-free streaming sites like Netflix ( $ 15.49 per month for a standard plan) or Hulu ( $ 17.99 per month) or Disney+ ( $ 13.99 per month) or Paramount+ with Showtime ( $ 11.99 per month) or Peacock ( $ 11.99 per month) or Apple TV+ ( $ 9.99 per month). And if you somehow can't choose what to watch on any of those, maybe see what's airing live on YouTube TV, which is similar to TiVo and cable but costs $ 72.99 each month.
Finally, as you get some shut-eye using your Whoop health and sleep tracker ( $ 239 per year), you can rest assured any photos you took on your cellphone will quietly update to the extra storage you pay for in the digital cloud ( $ 2.99 per month for a standard Google One account).
You see, we've automated almost every element of spending in our lives! I'm almost convinced that somewhere in Silicon Valley a V.C.-funded tech bro is sitting in a room trying to imagine a subscription service for funerals that might overcome the central problem that we tend to only die just once.
And while it's not supposed to feel exhausting or overwhelming, there's a part at the back of my brain where it almost feels like it. I'm plagued by a buzzing anxiety that I could be saving money by consolidating or canceling some of these subscriptions, were it not for the nagging guilt that I have that, truthfully, I've lost track of what I'm paying for.
If we're going to rebalance the wheels of capitalism just a little, we could do worse than to support a recently proposed rule from the Federal Trade Commission. In March, the agency suggested a "click to cancel" provision that would require companies to make it just as easy to end a subscription as to sign up for one. No more being forced to go into the gym to end your membership if you were able to join online! (For apps, Apple does already have a version of this cancel button buried within its App Store.)
Additionally, under this extra layer of consumer protection, businesses would need to remind subscribers annually about their membership before these are automatically renewed. This rule would mean any background spending would, if only just for one moment a year, be at the forefront of your mind.
If all that doesn't work, I have another idea: an app designed to keep track of your various subscriptions and background spending so you can better control your finances. Oh wait, those already exist -- for a recurring fee, of course.

Coldblooded Creature Enchants a Classroom: [Review]

Full text: Adam Sandler plays a gruff old lizard who dishes out advice to fifth graders in this animated comedy.
Adam Sandler stars in "Leo" as a grumpy lizard who has spent his entire life in the terrarium of a fifth-grade classroom. He's been joined by a turtle named Squirtle (Bill Burr), and the two are mostly content to stare out the glass, year after year, commenting like Statler and Waldorf on the various tween archetypes that show up on the first day of school: the motormouth, the class clown, the kid with helicopter parents who's allergic to everything. But the bubble bursts for Sandler's Leo when he realizes that he's approaching 75 -- the average life span for his species -- and has hardly gotten to live out his dreams as a free lizard.
Leo sees an opportunity with the arrival of a no-nonsense substitute teacher, Ms. Malkin (Cecily Strong), after the usual instructor goes on maternity leave. Along with implementing a stricter disciplinary system, she assigns her students at the Florida school to take turns bringing Leo home, caring for him as their own pet. The kids are dismayed, until one of them, the chatty Summer (voiced by Sandler's daughter Sunny), discovers that the seemingly docile lizard can talk, and begins to open up to him about her problems. Leo, finding fulfillment in his new task, takes on the role of therapist each week, dishing out advice and convincing each student that they're the only one who can hear him speak.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Leo" is the second animated film from Sandler's creative house Happy Madison Productions and his newest release for Netflix. Unlike the company's first foray into animation, the raunchy 2002 Hanukkah flick "Eight Crazy Nights," "Leo" aims for wholesome family entertainment, combining themes like the challenges of growing older with a healthy dose of G-rated toilet humor (and a few double entendres that will go over kids' heads).
Sandler does a fine job as the voice of Leo, delivering a good mix of gruffness and sweetness into an absurd scenario. The kids in "Leo" confide in him their desire to be understood by their parents and peers, and the film drives home the overdone but nonetheless true message that everyone faces this struggle -- even popular girls like Jayda (played by Sandler's other daughter, Sadie). These tender moments are punctuated by several original songs -- yes, "Leo" is a full-blown musical -- and a plethora of running gags, like portraying the school's kindergartners as wide-eyed bobbleheads crashing into walls.
Written by Sandler, Paul Sado, and Robert Smigel (who also directed the film with Robert Marianetti and David Wachtenheim), "Leo" sometimes has trouble identifying its audience. The musical sequences aren't particularly interesting visually and will drag on for adults, yet it's hard to imagine children sitting through Leo and Squirtle's extended riffs on divorced parents or the courtship behaviors of reptiles and not getting a little bored. But with the holidays rolling around and families gathering, this will undoubtedly work as something to put on in the background for everyone.
Leo
Rated PG. Running time: 1 hour 42 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

Stamped From The Beginning: [Review]

Full text: The documentary, based on Ibram X. Kendi's 2016 book, looks at the ugly history of anti-Black ideology.
The documentary "Stamped From the Beginning," based on the 2016 book by Ibram X. Kendi, begins with a trick question and ends with a sage retort.
"What's wrong with Black people?" asks the director Roger Ross Williams of the film's heady roster of Black female scholars as they consider the ways in which the slave trade created anti-Black racism and, as Kendi argues, not the reverse. The formidable interviewees include the novelist Honorée Fanonne Jeffers; the historian Elizabeth Hinton; and the activist and scholar Angela Davis. When Davis discusses the work "not done" at slavery's end to retool "the entire society so that it might be possible for previously enslaved individuals to be free and equal," her words are as muscularly poignant as they are pointed.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The subtitle of Kendi's book is "The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America." And Williams employs several methods to distill the National Book Award-winning tome's ambitions as it moves from the president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, back to the Portuguese enslavement of Africans and forward to the rise of Trumpism in reaction to the presidency of Barack Obama.
In addition to interviews and archival images, film clips and news footage, Williams ("Cassandro" "Life, Animated") leans into animation. In an engaging gambit, the director utilizes a mix of visual effects, painting and collage to tell the stories of the poet Phillis Wheatley; the author Harriet Jacobs and the journalist and anti-lynching pioneer Ida B. Wells. In a film brimming with visual gestures, these mini portraits of anti-racists are among its most memorable.
Stamped From the Beginning
Rated R for some violent content, language, drug content and nude images. Running time: 1 hour 31 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

Frybread Face and Me: [Review]

Full text: An 11-year-old boy from San Diego goes to live with his Navajo grandmother and spends time with his cousin.
"Frybread Face and Me" is set in 1990, when its protagonist, Benny (Keir Tallman), reluctantly goes to live on a Navajo reservation with his maternal grandmother (Sarah H. Natani). Having grown up in San Diego, the 11-year-old Benny has more experience with action figures, SeaWorld visits and Fleetwood Mac tunes than with rug weaving, sheep herding and bull riding. Over the kind of indelible summer beloved by screenwriters, he will receive an introduction to all three.
It helps that Benny is quickly joined at his grandmother's by a cousin of a similar age; she is widely known by the nickname Frybread Face (Charley Hogan). Fry acts as a translator with their grandmother (who has refused to learn English), teaches Benny a few Navajo concepts and even gives him a driving lesson. The cultural exchange goes both ways: Fry is enthused to learn that Benny can visit the orca Shamu at SeaWorld whenever he wants.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Some complexity is introduced through one of Benny's uncles, Marvin (Martin Sensmeier), who cruelly needles Benny for not being enough of a man (and whose own toughness is called into question after he is hurt in a riding mishap).
But "Frybread Face and Me," written and directed by Billy Luther, who has previously made documentaries and worked on AMC's "Dark Winds," declines, to its credit, to overplay that hand. It's more interested in sharing on details so specific (a meal of Spam and potatoes; repeated viewings of a "Starman" videotape) they seem drawn from memory. The movie is overfamiliar and earnest, but you can't accuse it of not being heartfelt.
Frybread Face and Me
Not rated. In English and Navajo, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 23 minutes. Watch on Netflix and in theaters.

At Las Vegas Race, Big Stars Outshine the Cars: [Style Desk]

Full text: "If this was an R-rated comedy, and they put all these set pieces together like the poker, and the cars, and the Vegas of it all, no one would buy this movie," said Hamish Linklater, an actor and playwright.
It was Friday night in Las Vegas and Mr. Linklater was standing inside Lavo, a dark, chandelier-filled lounge at the Venetian Resort. About a hundred people had gathered for a star-backed charity poker and blackjack tournament hosted by Ben Affleck -- with Jennifer Lopez at his side -- during the Formula 1 Grand Prix Weekend, an event that culminated with one of the nearly two dozen similar races that determine Formula 1's world champion.
Organizers spent $ 500 million on the Las Vegas race, which was the first of its kind in the city in decades. The race -- which was won by Max Verstappen -- drew celebrities, athletes, and moneyed spectators to watch drivers zoom around the famed Las Vegas Strip turned racetrack, and attend extravagant parties. Between the roaring cars, marquee names, and lucrative branding opportunities, it was over the top, as Mr. Linklater suggested, even for Las Vegas, a city founded on diversion.
The tournament opened with a reception at Lavo, and then moved upstairs to a side room for the games. Guests, who included Jon Hamm, Jimmy Kimmel, Colton Underwood, James Marsden and Tobey Maguire, spent about an hour drinking champagne (served by a woman dressed as a peacock) and eating Wagyu sirloin and Australian rack of lamb.
The guests then played rounds of poker before stepping out to a terrace at about midnight to watch racecars hurl down the Strip during the qualifying round of the F1 race. (Proceeds from the tournament benefited the Eastern Congo Initiative, a charity founded by Mr. Affleck, which provides humanitarian assistance for the people of Congo.)
Mr. Affleck said he was struck by the influx of people. "I've never seen Las Vegas like this, so full," he said, after posing for pictures. "I've never had so many celebrities and high-rollers be like, 'Can you get me a room?"' said Mr. Affleck, who frequently visits Las Vegas.
Mr. Hamm, standing with his wife Anna Osceola, said he got into F1 as a child. "I loved collecting all the cars," he said, adding, "Americans are just now discovering it, even though it's been around for so long."
Mr. Kimmel, the television host, however, found the entire affair to be a headache, a sentiment echoed by some locals. Ubers and taxis couldn't get to some locations, and crossing the street near the Strip was difficult.
"It's a little crazy out there," he said referring to the Strip, which was shut down for long stretches during races and practices. "The driver who picked us up from the airport had no idea where to take us."
But Mr. Kimmel said he is not really familiar with F1. "I am sure I would get into F1 if I watched three episodes of the Netflix show, but I'm really busy," he said, referencing "Formula One: Drive to Survive," the documentary series that follows F1 drivers, which many attribute to fueling American interest in the sport.
Despite the popularity of F1, however, there were questions about how the weekend would be received. The eventual winner, Mr. Verstappen, had critiqued the event as "99 percent show and one percent sporting event." (After his win, he changed his tune, chanting "Viva Las Vegas" in his racecar.) Early ticket sales did not meet expectations, and an early practice round had to be canceled because of a hazard on the track, which led to a lawsuit from ticket holders.
But the fans, brands and public figures still showed up. More than 300,000 people attended, and Formula 1 estimated that the event would have an economic impact of $ 1.2 billion to Las Vegas. American Express gave out F1-themed friendship bracelets and fanny packs to cardholders, Sotheby's hired James Corden to help auction off used F1 racecars, and T-Mobile branded the Las Vegas Sphere. Patron had a booze-fueled party headlined by Fisher, the Australian D.J., at the nightclub Hakkasan.
About four hours before the race was scheduled to begin, huge crowds of people, including Rihanna, David Beckham, Brad Pitt and Gordon Ramsay, packed into the Paddock, the working area of F1 next to the track where the cars are kept, drivers prepare for the race, and the engineering teams are based. The Paddock also had a premium hospitality area known as the Paddock Club with a rooftop deck with wide views of the track and private, premium suites.
Celebrities and sponsors inspected the cars up close and watched engineers run through practice drills like changing a tire in seconds. Bars set up outside the track served espresso martinis and champagne, and an Elvis impersonator conducted weddings and vow renewals in a makeshift chapel. Nearby, couples posed for pictures with a racecar decorated with the sign, "Just married."
"Everything is a shock to me right now," said Will Claye, an Olympic track and field athlete. "My mind is blown. I thought they just drove, but there are all these people managing all these details and everything is thought of in terms of milliseconds."
Other F1 events have been held in similarly opulent destinations and Mr. Claye said the locations of the races are part of the appeal. "You have Miami, you have Monaco, you have Vegas, these are places you want to go regardless," he said. "So when they have F1 with these cars, and how much they cost, you're like I'm going."
Taylor Zakhar Perez, an actor who starred in the romantic comedy "Red, White, & Royal Blue," said being around these sophisticated cars was nothing new. "My dad has a body shop, and I grew up in body shops, so this is very normal for me," he said.
But seeing them race around a place like Las Vegas was new. "You just hear zoom, zoom when the cars go past you, and it's so sick," he said.
He was with Madeleine White, a social media influencer who has more than 4 million followers on TikTok. "I attended the Ferrari fashion show in September and got to know the team, and they asked if I wanted to come to Vegas with them," she said. "Of course, I said yes."
The race began about 10 p.m., and celebrities, like Patrick Dempsey, Paris Hilton and Usain Bolt, filed into suites to watch the main event while drinking from an open bar and dining on items like lobster and steak.
While most of the notable names were spectators, some were enlisted in the festivities. Donny Osmond sang the national anthem and Justin Bieber stood at the finish line and waved the black and white checkered flag.
Kylie Minogue, the Australian singer who was performing at a party over the weekend at Voltaire, one of Las Vegas' newest nightlife venues, where she is also doing a residency, had the opportunity to ride around the track at speed, before the race.
"I was screaming my head off. Tiny me in that car!" she said. "I was safely buckled in, but I was being thrust around, and it was a real thrill."
It gave her a chance to take in all the crowds around the course. "It was a lot of a lot, which is Vegas."

The Complex Zeal of an American Striver: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As director and star, Bradley Cooper delivers an intimate portrait of the composer and his many private and public selves.
"Maestro," Bradley Cooper's intimate portrait of Leonard Bernstein, takes flight with a terrific whoosh of exuberance. The young Bernstein (played by Cooper) has just gotten the phone call that will change his life. He's been asked to step in for an ailing guest conductor and lead the New York Philharmonic; it will be his conducting debut. Overjoyed, Lenny, as he's often called, jumps up, throws open a curtain and then sprints out of his apartment to race, bathrobe flapping, into his dazzling, very public future as an American genius.
The real Bernstein was 25 and an assistant conductor with the Philharmonic when he took the Carnegie Hall stage on Nov. 14, 1943, to polite applause. The program opened with Schumann, ended with Wagner, and by the time it was over, the house, as Bernstein's brother, Burton, put it, "roared like one giant animal in a zoo." The next day, The New York Times ran a story about the concert on the front page. A few days later, The Times followed up on the concert with a small item that likened Bernstein's debut to a young corporal taking charge of a platoon when the officers are down: "It's a good American success story."
In "Maestro," Cooper explores the definition -- and brutal toll -- of that kind of success with deep sympathy, lushly beautiful wall-to-wall music and great narrative velocity. In outline, it's a familiar story of a classic American striver. Bernstein was the son of Jewish-Russian immigrants who escaped a dire fate in the family business (the Samuel J. Bernstein Hair Company) to become a 20th-century cultural force. He conducted and composed, wrote for the ballet, the opera and Broadway, and was a fixture on TV. He had gold and platinum albums, was on the cover of Time and Newsweek, and won slews of Grammys and Emmys.
It was a big juicy life, one that Cooper -- who wrote the script with Josh Singer -- has condensed into two eventful, visually expressive hours. "Maestro" is as ambitious as Cooper's fine directorial debut, "A Star Is Born," but the new movie is more self-consciously cinematic. Some of the choices -- different aspect ratios as well as the use of both black-and-white and color film -- nod at the look of movies from earlier eras. The visuals also convey interiority, swells of mood and feeling, as does Lenny's explosive, at times ecstatic physicality, the full-bodied intensity of his conducting style and the orgasmic rivers of sweat that pour off him.
"Maestro" is a fast-paced chronicle of towering highs, crushing lows and artistic milestones, most delivered in a personal key. Cooper packs a lot in without overexplaining the era or its titans (Brian Klugman plays the composer Aaron Copland, one of Bernstein's closest friends); years pass in an eyeblink, events slip by obliquely or go unmentioned. Cooper is more interested in feelings than happenings, though part of what makes the movie pop and gives it currency is how he complicates the familiar Great Man of History template. Bernstein is rightly the main event in "Maestro," but crucial to the film's meaning is his relationship with his family, especially his wife, Felicia Montealegre Cohn Bernstein (a brittle Carey Mulligan).
Theirs was a fraught, decades-long relationship that begins in the 1940s when they meet at one of those fabulously glamorous New York parties that mostly exist in old Hollywood films or in biographies of very important dead people. There, amid a boisterous crowd of revelers wreathed in cigarette smoke and bobbing together on an ocean of booze, Lenny and his pals Betty Comden and Adolph Green (Mallory Portnoy and Nick Blaemire) are lighting up the room. Lenny and Felicia make their introductions, tuck into a quiet corner to flirt and laugh, their heads and bodies soon listing toward each other. By the time the night is over, they're walking side by side, seemingly destined for a happily ever after.
It didn't turn out exactly that way for assorted reasons, including Bernstein's overshadowing brilliance. He was also gay, though maybe bisexual; the movie nimbly avoids labeling him. (In her memoir "Famous Father Girl," his daughter Jamie refers to him as both.) Instead, with roundelays of teasing and desiring looks as well as in asides and conversations (including a faithful restaging of an Edward R. Murrow interview), "Maestro" expresses the complexities of Lenny's private and public selves. After Lenny receives that call to conduct the Philharmonic, for one, he playfully taps drumlike on the discreetly covered rear of his lover, David Oppenheim (Matt Bomer). And then Lenny rushes out the door alone.
The opener introduces the idea of Lenny's life as a performance, which becomes the film's controlling metaphor. Cooper underscores this idea repeatedly, including when Felicia takes Lenny to the empty theater where she's an understudy and where they playfully act out a love scene they seal with a Hollywood kiss. Sometime later, in an energetic swerve into surrealism, Felicia grabs his hand, and they sprint from an outdoor meal with friends and into another theater where three dancers in white sailor uniforms are waiting onstage. As with Lenny's dash out of his bedroom and into Carnegie Hall, Cooper stages this sprint with the camera pointing down at the characters, as if it were running on an overhead catwalk.
As Felicia and Lenny race into the theater, they look like performers hitting their marks and a bit like dollhouse runaways. The dancers start performing "Fancy Free" -- Bernstein and Jerome Robbins's ballet about sailors on shore leave in New York -- then move into its musical adaptation, "On the Town." With Felicia and Lenny watching, the sailors begin moving to the infectiously alive, jazzy music, their snaky hips and tight uniforms emphasizing the choreography's muscular eroticism; and then a sailor beckons Lenny to join in the fun.
Here and elsewhere, Cooper makes a point of showing Felicia watching Lenny first with what seems to be admiration, then love and later something darker, sadder and despairing. He's already a name when they meet and already taking up a lot of room; soon, he is the star around which everything and everyone orbits, including Felicia and the three children they have together. He's a bigger-than-big personality (flamboyance is a favorite adjective of Bernstein biographers), with a buzzing, heady vitality that feels like a life force or a painfully addictive high. It's easy to see why she's pulled in, but the exhilaration that initially lifts the film is a harder sell once Felicia and Lenny begin to fall in love.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The movie makes the case that their love was genuine, even if Cooper and Mulligan never convincingly sync up. This disconnect doesn't seem intentional, but it also serves the story and characters, including early on when Lenny's and Felicia's heightened emotions and smiles can feel forced, like an act of mutual will. Even so, you believe they love each other, however differently; and because Cooper spends a lot of time on Felicia, you grow to understand that she knows she'll never be enough for Lenny. Yet in focusing so much on Felicia, whose light dims the brighter his blazes, stressing what it costs her to play a role in this performance of happy heterosexuality, Cooper also inadvertently shortchanges Lenny.
Although Cooper makes Felicia the linchpin of his Great Man revisionism, the film's most deeply felt scenes involve Lenny with his children and his close male friends. One centers on an anguished encounter he has with David. The other unfolds at Lenny and Felicia's country home after the birth of one of their children and finds him walking across the lawn, the newborn in his arms. Lenny drifts over to Aaron Copland, who's sitting under a tree on a swing with a smile. Lenny joins him and gently holds the baby so that Aaron can see the baby's face. Lenny nuzzles the infant, and the two men just sit quietly as the tenderness of the moment -- and the overwhelming cruelty of this world and all its terrible lies -- knocks you flat.

Holiday Movies Add Europe to the Formula: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: More and more of the cozy Christmas movies on Hallmark and Lifetime are set on the continent. But onscreen, it's a Europe doused in holiday magic.
Christmas is magical. Christmas is inescapable.
And, according to an increasing number of holiday movies, it's in Europe.
Browse Hallmark and Lifetime's channels, and you will find a Christmas in Rome. In Vienna. In Switzerland. In Scotland. In Notting Hill. We're having a Belgian Chocolate Christmas. A jolly good Christmas. A merry Scottish Christmas and even a merry Swissmas. You can enjoy a Heidelberg holiday and a Joyeux Noel (that one's in France).
Europe, with its cobblestoned streets (a nightmare in heels), old buildings (no central heating) and Christmas markets (those can be as good as they look onscreen), provides the perfect setting for a magical holiday adventure.
"Hallmark fans get to experience these incredible destinations through the eyes of our character," said Ali Liebert, the director of one of the network's 2023 offerings, "Christmas in Notting Hill."
In many of these films, an American girl is undervalued at her big city job. She leaves the city and finds a rugged local, who embodies all the wholesome values of a small town. Sometimes her love interest is a widower. Sometimes he has an adorable child, or he may have a dog. (If he lives in Scotland, the dog's name may be Hamish.)
Certain European spots have been deemed more appropriately Christmassy than others. (We're yet to see "My Barcelona Christmas," despite the December temperatures there being pretty similar to London.) In these films, Europe is awash with eligible princes from royal families presiding over countries with names like Aldovia or Cordinia, which you would be hard pressed to find on a map.
And for those holiday movie fans expecting a white Christmas in England, it's more likely you'll get a drizzly one. The last time Britain saw a festive blanketing of snow for the holiday, the way Charles Dickens intended, was in 2010.
But none of that matters. Christmas movies let you vicariously live your best European Christmas, which may be significantly better than the holidays experienced by actual Europeans.
And as far as snow goes -- there are visual effects for that.
Hallmark is releasing 42 new holiday movies this year, with a catalog of many more, and shooting some in European locations "gives us more cultural traditions to dig into," said Lisa Hamilton Daly, the head of programming at Hallmark Media. "Our audiences love to travel with us."
Daly is already looking ahead to next year's Christmas, she said, adding that Hallmark crews will probably be returning to Europe for the network's 2024 holiday movie slate.
And for viewers, getting to Europe -- whether it's because of pandemic delays, high ticket prices or general travel stress during the holidays -- has not gotten any easier.
"U.S. audiences may not always be able to go to these exotic foreign lands," said Dustin Rikert, the director of the new Hallmark film "A Merry Scottish Christmas," which centers on estranged siblings in a castle in Scotland.
American audiences seem to enjoy watching stories set in the beautiful Scottish countryside. In Netflix's 2021 film "A Castle for Christmas," a best-selling author (Brooke Shields) ends up in a Scottish village and falls in love with a local duke.
In Lifetime's 2020 film "Christmas at the Castle," a big city girl is sent to the Scottish Highlands to find a rare fragrance. She, too, falls in love with a local.
These stories and settings are pure escapism, according to David Lumsden and Toby Trueman, the director and an executive producer of "Christmas in Scotland," a 2023 movie streaming on Plex and Xumo.
"We never have white Christmases, it's always a gray Christmas," Trueman, who lives in Edinburgh, said. "This is not a realist film."
Lumsden has also directed other genres, including horror, and he has enjoyed the switch to holiday content. "My family rarely gets to see the stuff I do," he said, because it's "too scary for my niece or nephew." Christmas movies, he added, can be watched by everyone.
Movies set around the holidays have long been popular, and in the 2000s, festive romance films like "Love Actually" and "The Holiday" made big money at the box office, before joining films like "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Home Alone" in the rotation of classic holiday movies.
Over the past few years, Hallmark and Lifetime have bet big on cheesy, formulaic Christmas movies with a guaranteed happy ending, releasing dozens of new titles every year.
These movies' predictable and cozy nature fuels their popularity. "The formula exists for a very good reason," Daly said. "It makes people happy."
At the end of a Christmas movie, you know that the beautiful Scotsman (or Germanic prince or English soccer star) will end up with the ambitious American blonde (or brunette). They will kiss -- and nothing else! Hands where I can see them! -- at the exact moment soft snowflakes start falling.
Our American heroine may even make a permanent move to that drafty old castle without modern amenities. But I digress. What happens after the credits roll is not important.

Stories of Food, Resistance and Black Legacy: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: In Season 2 of the Netflix series, Stephen Satterfield explores generational conversations among Black people through food.
When Georgianne Thomas, 80, an author and adjunct professor of humanities at Clark Atlanta University, pushes aside the yellow bracelet adorning her wrist to reveal a burn mark, the table of people she's dining with are stunned. The mark, decades old but still visible, was left by a Ku Klux Klan member putting out a cigarette on her arm during a protest in Atlanta when she was a 17-year-old freshman at Spelman College in 1960.
"It did something to me, but it didn't stop me," Dr. Thomas says, as Stephen Satterfield, 38, the writer and founder of Whetstone Media, wipes tears from his eyes across the table from her.
The conversation is part of the second season of Netflix's "High on the Hog," a docuseries exploring African American influence on cooking and cuisine in the United States. Over a meal at Paschal's, a longtime soul food restaurant in Atlanta, Dr. Thomas, Charles Black and Marilyn Pryce Scott, all in their 80s, talk to a visibly moved Mr. Satterfield about joining a protest led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. demanding service at the segregated Rich's Department Store.
"These are histories that cannot be understood by even reading a textbook, and I feel that presence and historical significance being with you all here today," Mr. Satterfield says to the group.
The scene is one of many intergenerational conversations that act as anchors in the second season of the show, scenes of honest and vulnerable communion, speaking to what can happen when African Americans of different ages spend time together over a meal.
Inspired by Jessica B. Harris's 2011 book of the same name, the first season of the show focused on stories and dishes illustrating how enslaved Africans contributed to and shaped much of America's cooking, tending not only to soil that grew crops that fed the nation, but also being "the hand in the pot," bringing cooking techniques and West African-inflected dishes to a new continent. "Much of the first season was about folks who have gone on to become ancestors, folks who didn't necessarily speak for themselves but spoke through their work or descendants," said Dr. Harris, who appears in three of this season's four episodes.
The second season, which traces the sprawling legacy of Black cooking through Reconstruction and along the routes of the Great Migration, presents more firsthand accounts of African Americans who have shaped cooking and dining in this country. "This season the folks who made the dish, or made that change are on camera and that's a very big difference," Dr. Harris said.
Profound moments are found at tables like the one Mr. Satterfield shared with activists in Atlanta, where he is able to connect dots for himself. In a Chicago-focused episode, he speaks with Benjamin Gaines Sr., a 99-year-old former porter on luxury railway Pullman cars, who moved to the city from Kentucky. Mr. Satterfield's own grandfather, who died before he was born, was also a Pullman Porter, moving to Chicago in the 1940s.
Listening to Mr. Gaines, who died in April, tell stories about working on train cars, providing luxury food and hospitality to white patrons, the "fuming anger" he felt when guests would disrespect him or even harm him physically, Mr. Satterfield felt like he saw part of his own family story that was once unavailable to him. "I was humbled to have a conversation with them that could have easily been missed," he said in an interview. "We have to understand the context and through living ancestors who are embodying these stories."
The experiences have changed him and how he engages with history and how Black people specifically share our stories, as what he calls "ancestors in training."
"You don't belong to just yourself," Mr. Satterfield said. "We're all ancestors already whether we acknowledge it or embrace it."
In an emotionally charged scene with Elvin Shields, a retired mechanical engineer who grew up on a plantation as the child of sharecroppers, the topic of shame comes up. Mr. Shields and Mr. Satterfield discuss how so many young people don't want to think about this past, or even feel discomfort with the word "plantation."
"Plantation is ours, don't make it a bad word. My ancestors lived and died here," Mr. Shields says, adding, "now all of a sudden we should fear it or hate it or scorn it? No, we own it. We made it. We own it."
Roger Ross Williams directed three episodes of the first season and executive produced the second. (The second season was directed by Erik Parker and Kamilah Forbes.) He said that the show's topics and conversations have become more pressing since it debuted in 2021.
"The massive erasure of Black history, book bannings and protests about critical race theory are going on right now," he said.
For Mr. Williams, having a series that lays out, plainly and earnestly, how African Americans "continue to nourish America" is about making sure future generations know this history. "It's a more gentle way of educating Americans about Black contributions to American food and history. You can't ban Netflix."
For Dr. Harris, the promise of the show is in these conversations, where ideas, experiences and history can flow between each participant openly. "You can talk across generations at the table," she said. "It's distressing that we don't see that more often. That used to be Sunday dinner."
On how she hopes people engage with the series, she added: "We've come a long way but we still have far to go. And as we continue we're learning more about our history and the stories that have shaped who we are. That African hand in the pot is almost more profound than I thought it was when I wrote the book."

Full text: We are overpaying for phone plans from Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile. Budget wireless services, similarly fast and robust, can save thousands.
Americans have long been conditioned to believe that when they buy a cellphone, the next step is to pick a wireless plan from one of the big carriers: Verizon, AT&T or T-Mobile. With their plans ranging from $ 60 to $ 200 a month for individuals and families, the price of a phone is soon eclipsed by the recurring service bills.
What if I told you that it no longer had to be this way?
Your phone bill could shrink to as little as $ 25 a month if you picked a wireless plan from a lesser-known service provider known as a discount carrier. The cheaper plans, based on my tests, offer sufficiently fast internet speeds and reliable phone service. It takes some courage and technological know-how to make the switch, but the potential savings outweigh the downsides.
On the surface, these budget carriers, which include Cricket Wireless, Straight Talk, Boost Mobile, Mint Mobile and Visible, lack a cool factor. They do not operate their own cell networks; instead, they lease wireless services from the big carriers and market them toward retirees. The no-frill plans often have trade-offs, including slower download speeds, since Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile subscribers have priority access to faster network performance.
Yet in the past few years, so much has changed that I can now confidently recommend discount phone plans for most people, including white-collar professionals and Instagram-obsessed youths. Here's why:
Cellular networks have peaked. Newer 5G and 4G cell technology is so fast that even budget carriers can provide very fast download speeds -- zippy enough to stream video, load maps and download apps -- even if they are somewhat slower than what the Big Three provide.
The shift to hybrid work. Office workers who used to spend more time commuting and had to rely on their cellular network now have their commute time cut in half and are relying more on the Wi-Fi connection at their home or office cubicle for making video calls and sending messages. That means slower cellular performance on a budget carrier may be unnoticeable.
You can try a discount carrier without breaking up with your big carrier. The eSIM, the digital version of the SIM card that carries your phone number, is now common on many modern smartphones. It lets you immediately activate an extra phone line without needing to insert a physical SIM card, which makes experimenting with an off-brand wireless service easier and less intimidating.
Once you have converted to a discount phone plan, the savings add up quickly. A family of four buying new iPhones with a Cricket phone plan would spend $ 3,762 over two years, $ 1,311 less than they would spend with Verizon, according to an analysis by WalletHub, a personal finance research firm.
"The negative perception around budget plans is fading," Cassandra Happe, an analyst for WalletHub, said. "Now they're seen as a smart choice for everyone. People are realizing you can get a great phone plan without spending a fortune."
To put discount phone carriers to the test, I activated three services -- Visible, Cricket and Straight Talk -- on an iPhone. In various locations in California, I ran speed tests, made phone calls and used apps like maps, YouTube and TikTok. For comparisons, I ran the same tests on my Verizon connection.
The discount carriers were, on average, up to 46 percent slower than my Verizon connection. That sounds like a lot, but in real-world tests, I didn't notice a difference -- my apps worked fine, and videos streamed smoothly.
Here's how the setup and testing process went.
Buying and activating a discount phone plan
Consumers can sign up for discount phone plans by buying a physical SIM card from a website or retail store, though I recommend eSIM as the way. The digital SIM card saves time -- and because you can install multiple eSIMs at the same time, you can try a discount carrier and compare it with the performance of your big carrier before deciding on a plan.
The steps for setting up an eSIM vary somewhat from carrier to carrier, but the process is fundamentally consistent: You buy a phone plan through a brand's website or app and click a button or scan a bar code to activate the service.
Visible charged $ 25 a month for a plan that included unlimited data; Straight Talk charged $ 35 a month for a plan with 10 gigabytes of high-speed internet; and Cricket charged $ 40 -- $ 10 to activate the eSIM and $ 30 for a monthly plan that included five gigabytes of data.
Visible, which is owned by Verizon, had the smoothest setup. Its mobile app let me buy a phone plan using Apple Pay and tap a few buttons to activate service. With Straight Talk and Cricket, I perused the websites to find their eSIM offerings. I ran into problems with Cricket, which emailed a broken web link to activate my plan; it took me about 20 minutes to find a tool on its website to manually activate my service.
Test, test
My iPhone could hold up to eight eSIMs, so I installed all three plans and toggled among them for each test.
I drove to 10 locations, including hiking trails, shopping centers and wineries, in California. At each location, I used the Speedtest app to test each carrier's internet speed, and I called my very patient wife and streamed video on apps like TikTok and YouTube.
Broadly speaking, the discount phone services performed fine. They were occasionally sluggish when loading videos on TikTok, but my Verizon connection had similar delays.
Based on the results measured with the Speedtest app, Cricket and Visible had comparable performances, with download speeds of 154 megabits per second, on average. Straight Talk delivered speeds of 279 megabits per second -- similar to my Verizon connection, which delivered download speeds of 287 megabits per second.
What do those numbers mean? To stream video through apps like Netflix and Hulu, you need a minimum of 25 megabits per second, according to AT&T. So the budget carriers gave me more than enough speed to handle some of the most data-intensive tasks.
Taking the leap
Among the three discount carriers, my favorite was Visible because of its smooth setup process and consistent network performance. Visible was also more transparent with its billing in emailed receipts. Straight Talk never emailed me a receipt. I was turned off by Cricket's clunky website and the $ 10 fee for activating an eSIM, which was not a charge the other two carriers required.
Angie Klein, president of the Verizon Value organization, which oversees Visible, said its budget plans were designed for tech-savvy customers who wanted a single line, and Verizon's traditional wireless plans were a full-service experience with more perks. Straight Talk and Cricket did not respond to requests for comment.
On the whole, I don't have a one-size-fits-all recommendation. As with the big carriers, cellular performance for each discount carrier will vary depending on the network's coverage where you live and work.
But because eSIM technology makes it easy to switch to another network -- and the discount phone plans are cheap -- it would be foolish to pass on the opportunity to give a budget phone plan a try.
Last year, Robin Phillips, a 54-year-old Seattle resident who works in food distribution, broke up with Verizon to try Visible. He ran into hiccups. The wireless service initially would not activate, and the customer support agents, available only through a chat app, were unhelpful.
But he said he didn't regret the switch. Visible's service began working after a day, and he pays $ 25 a month, down from the $ 70 that he used to pay for a Verizon plan. His wife also converted.
"Is it worth it?" he said. "We're saving about $ 1,000 a year. I'll deal with the hassle for that."

Top Off the Big Meal With a Classic: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: If you're looking for something to watch with your family after the meal, pick from one of these seasonal selections.
From a nostalgic, black-and-white 1947 classic to a romp about animated, time-traveling turkeys, plenty of options abound when it comes to picking a Thanksgiving movie to watch with your kids during the holiday. Our writers picked their favorite Thanksgiving themed movies and specials that are currently streaming. Expect singing mice, dogs in chef's hats and goth girls burning down a Thanksgiving pageant. The stories span the last 76 years, but as the decades roll by, each one still feels timeless.
'Miracle on 34th Street' (1947)
How to watch: Stream it on Disney+; rent or buy it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
For those who enjoy watching the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade broadcast, this classic matches up nicely: It begins at that very event, where "Kris Kringle" (Edmund Gwenn) shames a sloppy-drunk Santa and is hired on the spot as his replacement. (It would take more than a half century for a sloppy-drunk Santa to find proper onscreen representation in the form of Billy Bob Thornton as "Bad Santa.") The premise of "Miracle" -- that a department store Santa is actually the real thing -- was so juicy that the film was remade twice, but neither recaptured the charm and magic of this initial offering. It's a film that truly earns its classic status, continuing to enchant viewers young and old. -- JASON BAILEY
'Free Birds' (2013)
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Critics didn't exactly gobble up this computer-animated film about two turkeys (voiced by Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson) who take a time machine back to the first Thanksgiving in a history-altering quest to prevent turkey from becoming the traditional holiday dish. ("Is Hollywood scheming to turn your little ones into strident vegetarians?" panicked The New York Post.) The movie, directed by Jimmy Hayward, also got mixed reviews for its marketing partnership with Chuck E. Cheese's and its questionable treatment of Native American characters.
Despite the criticism, this PETA-approved film has a soft spot in the hearts of parents who opt for a meat-free Thanksgiving, and who won't mind a bedtime chat about where meat comes from. Like a movie about a killer Santa Claus, "Free Birds" scores points for a "Babe"-like rebellious message -- who needs turkey for Thanksgiving? -- that calls out a hallowed holiday tradition with kid-friendly sass. It's a misfit film that's a great pick for families -- carnivores and vegans alike -- who would enjoy, as one critic put it, "one of the strangest and most unlikely family entertainments in a long, long time." -- ERIK PIEPENBURG
'Addams Family Values' (1993)
How to watch: Rent or buy it on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.
If you find yourself sharing the couch with the family's disaffected emo youth, introduce them to the O.G. (Original Goth): Wednesday Addams, brought to uproarious life by Christina Ricci in two early '90s big screen adaptations by the director Barry Sonnenfeld. This second chapter, released in 1993, is not only a rare example of a sequel that's more than equal to the original. It is also holiday appropriate, as little Wednesday takes over the re-enactment of the first Thanksgiving pageant at summer camp and quite literally burns it to the ground. Keep an eye out for Christine Baranski as one of the cheery (and thus suspect) proprietors of "Camp Chippewa." (Also available for rental: "Edward Scissorhands," a seasonal favorite from the goth godfather Tim Burton.) -- JASON BAILEY
'An American Tail' (1986)
How to watch: Stream it on Starz or Spectrum; or rent on Vudu, Google Play or YouTube.
The traditional Thanksgiving children's play fell out of favor around the time Wednesday Addams vowed to scalp those pesky pilgrims in "Addams Family Values." No loss. That simplistic history lesson had already been bested by Don Bluth's "An American Tail," the most unsentimental cartoon to ever star a singing mouse. Make that a family of mice -- the Russian-Jewish Mousekewitzes -- who flee the feline persecution of their homeland for 1880s New York, where they've been promised mouse holes in every wall, bread crumbs on every floor, and most importantly, no cats. This, of course, is a lie. Young Fievel Mousekewitz is disillusioned to discover that his new country is a predatory land of rat-owned sweatshops and cat-run gangs. Upon the movie's release, critics like Roger Ebert were taken aback to see a kiddie flick with a "bleak view of a cold and heartless universe." But wisecracking cockroaches aside, it's a true vision of the American dream that idealistic newcomers like Fievel struggled to attain -- then and now -- to make the Statue of Liberty live up to her sales pitch. -- AMY NICHOLSON
'A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving' (1973)
How to watch: Stream it on AppleTV+
Long before Friendsgiving was a thing, Charlie Brown and the Peanuts gang bucked tradition, ditched the parents and created a Thanksgiving feast with their crew. This Emmy-winning special first aired on CBS fifty years ago this month. It's a fun throwback that starts with Lucy coaxing Charlie to fulfill an age-old (sort of) Thanksgiving tradition and kick a football. When she pulls the ball away before gullible Charlie can make contact, Lucy laments that some traditions just don't last.
Like most Peanuts specials, this one is a little melancholy, but there are enough pranks and pratfalls to entertain children who are used to faster-paced fare like "Spy Kids" and "Elemental." When Charlie tries to host his friends, Peppermint Patty is scandalized that her plate is full of popcorn, toast and candy instead of turkey and pumpkin pie. All is resolved when Charlie's grandmother invites the gang for a traditional holiday meal. It's about friendship, teamwork and making your own traditions. The soundtrack by the jazz composer and keyboardist Vince Guaraldi is a classic. -- DINA GACHMAN

Full text: The final season of Netflix's royal drama opens in 1997, on the cusp of one of the most analyzed periods in recent British history.
The images are joltingly familiar, even after all these years.
In one, reproduced with eerie accuracy in the new season of "The Crown," Diana, the Princess of Wales sits on a diving board off the deck of a yacht, her long legs dangling above the water. In another, she embraces her new boyfriend, Dodi Fayed. And in a third, taken from a security camera, the couple rides in an elevator at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, en route to their car late one August night. We know too well what happened next.
The sixth and final season of "The Crown" begins here, in 1997, on the cusp of one of the strangest and most bewildering periods in recent British history. That is when Diana (played here by Elizabeth Debicki) and Dodi (Khalid Abdalla), an unlikely couple thrown together by circumstance, were killed in a crash in an underpass as they drove across Paris, followed by a pack of photographers. Diana was just 36, and her death sent Britain into a paroxysm of grief at her loss and rage against the royal family.
Over the last five seasons, "The Crown" has been unspooling decade by decade, producing an epic portrait of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, starting with her marriage to Prince Philip in 1947. The earlier episodes could sometimes feel quaint and far away, repackaged history from a semi-distant past.
But the new season, which begins a year after Diana has divorced Prince Charles (Dominic West) and ends with Charles's wedding to his longtime girlfriend, Camilla Parker Bowles (Olivia Williams) in 2005, eight years later, is a different thing entirely.
The first four episodes of the season (a second batch will arrive on Dec. 14) explore the lead up to and fallout from the 1997 accident. By devoting so much attention to this period, the production risks clashing not just with viewers' own memories, but also with countless earlier depictions of the same events -- a seemingly never-ending stream of books, dramas and documentaries. To name just two, there's "Diana," the 2013 film about the princess's final two years, starring Naomi Watts, and "Diana and Dodi: The Princess and the Playboy," a documentary about the couple that was released earlier this year.
Peter Morgan, the creator and writer of "The Crown," is also competing with his own 2006 film, "The Queen," which covers the same period. It starred Helen Mirren as a bewildered, wrong-footed Queen Elizabeth grappling with the raw emotion and almost feral anti-royal rage that erupted across Britain after Diana's death. With its intimate scenes of conversations between members of the royal family and public figures like the then-Prime Minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), "The Queen" was a preview of Morgan's approach in "The Crown" -- a blend of history and fiction, a muddying of the line between the public and the private.
The new season of "The Crown" can't help but revisit the themes of the 2006 movie. It shows Elizabeth (Imelda Staunton, deftly channeling the sound and cadence of Elizabeth's voice) fretting about whether to stay in Scotland with her grandsons after Diana's death, as she would prefer, or to travel to London and address the nation, as the tabloids and the prime minister are urging (and which she ends up doing).
But the show gives time, too, to the story of Mohamed al-Fayed (Salim Daw), Dodi's father, a once-impoverished and now wildly rich and ambitious Egyptian businessman whose holdings included not just the Ritz in Paris but also Harrods department store, a symbol of upper-crust opulence, in London.
In scenes that have already caused some chatter online and in the British tabloids, Dodi's ghost returns to talk to his father after his death, while Diana's ghost briefly appears in conversations with Charles and Queen Elizabeth.
How accurate are the non-ghostly scenes in this latest depiction of the Dodi-Diana romance? Annie Sulzberger, the head of research for the show -- she is also the sister of The Times's publisher, A.G. Sulzberger -- said that the research team was mindful of the delicacy around resurrecting a story in which so many participants are still alive.
"People who lived through Diana's death feel a sense of ownership over that history, a sense of participation, which can color their perception of it," she said in an interview. "With recent history, you're constantly battling with people's intimate and personal perspectives."
Sulzberger said that the research team turned to multiple sources to depict the events of 1997, including memoirs, documentaries and the official government inquest into the couple's deaths in the car along with a third victim, Henri Paul, the driver.
"If there's a documentary, we watched it; if there's an article, we read it; if there's a book, we have it," she said.
One particularly valuable source of information was a far-reaching police inquiry known as Operation Paget, which investigated claims by an increasingly unhinged Mohamed al-Fayed that Diana was pregnant with Dodi's baby and that the couple had been murdered by the British security services at the behest of Prince Philip, among others. (Diana was not pregnant, the report found, and the deaths were an accident.)
The inquiry's final report included testimony from friends and employees of the couple, revealing how Diana described their romance to the vast circle of confidants she spoke to by telephone from France.
Lady Annabel Goldsmith, a friend of Diana's, told the inquiry that they had talked on Aug. 29, two days before the princess's death. Goldsmith testified that when she asked Diana whether she was considering marrying Dodi, Diana said: "Annabel, I need marriage like a rash on my face."
Richard Kay, a longtime royal reporter for The Daily Mail and a close friend of Diana who spoke to her the day she died, said that nobody could say for sure what happened between Dodi and Diana in those final hours.
"This is in the realm of fantasy," Kay said in an interview. "It's just -- what can I say? -- it's speculation," he said of the program's depiction of a last conversation between Dodi and Diana.
While he agreed that it was unlikely that Diana was considering marrying Dodi, Kay said that Diana was "clearly very taken with him," in part because Dodi was the first man she could date openly since her separation from Charles, several years before their divorce.
"Dodi was a quite gentle, sweet sort of man, and I suspect he was very attentive," Kay said. "It wasn't just the trappings that made him attractive -- the jets and the yachts -- but Diana quite liked the ordinariness of the family life al-Fayed had with his second wife and younger children."
As always in "The Crown," there is an underlying tension not only between what might be real and what might be imagined, but also how that could color the public's perception of the truth. Last year, after a wave of criticism from real-life participants of made-up scenes, the series added a disclaimer. It was, it said for the first time, a "fictional dramatization" that was "inspired by real events."
That gives the production high cover and protection from potential lawsuits from aggrieved public figures. But still, "entire generations are getting their understanding of the modern British monarchy from the drama," the broadcaster and political commentator Andrew Marr wrote recently in The Times of London, comparing the phenomenon to the way Shakespeare's dramas have shaped public interpretations of history ever since.
There are many ways "The Crown" could have portrayed Diana's state of mind in those last weeks, and it chose a particularly gentle interpretation of her relationships with both her former husband and her new lover.
More than 25 years later, it is hard to say definitively whether Diana had indeed found a measure of emotional peace after so much turmoil. Morgan's is just the latest in a long line of interpretations. But as "The Crown" moves past the Diana era, perhaps it's the one that brings the most comfort.

It's Kurt Russell to the Rescue: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The MonsterVerse franchise adds a series on Apple TV+ and brings a classic leading man back to the small screen.
Among entertainment series based on extra-powerful intellectual property, Legendary Pictures' so-called MonsterVerse is a latecomer and a lightweight. Beginning with "Godzilla" in 2014, it has generated four films, unexceptional beyond their special effects (and middling performers at the box office, by franchise standards), and an animated Netflix series. Not exactly a rampage.
Modesty can eventually have its virtues, though. Against the backdrop of Marvel's recent multiversal inability to tell a coherent story, Legendary Television's new series "Monarch: Legacy of Monsters" (premiering Friday on Apple TV+) can feel like a breakthrough, or at least a welcome respite. Putting impressive visual effects at the service of a relatively straightforward, earthbound story, it has just enough nostalgic charm to invoke a more innocent era -- say, mid-70s to mid-90s -- of adventure filmmaking. (A gratuitous "Goonies" reference indicates that this is what the show's creators, Chris Black and Matt Fraction, were trying for.)
Reinforcing that nostalgia is the casting of Kurt Russell, now 72 and making his first onscreen appearance in a scripted TV show in more than 40 years. Russell is as bright-eyed and sharply alert as ever, if a bit slower moving than we're used to, in the role of Lee Shaw, an Army officer attached to a scary-monster-hunting organization called Monarch.
Russell shares the part with his son Wyatt -- Kurt Russell plays Shaw as a supposedly burned out, comfortably imprisoned renegade in the show's present, in 2015, while Wyatt Russell plays the younger Shaw, who is chasing titans (the term for Godzilla and its planet-threatening compatriots) during the 1950s. The resemblance is stronger, in every way, than the usual double casting. Through the eight of 10 episodes available for review, the show doesn't bend time to bring the two Russells together, but a quick scene involving a grainy home movie provides a touching juxtaposition.
The show's two time tracks are given nearly equal weight, increasing the visual variety and the opportunities for cliffhangers and reversals at the cost of character development and emotional involvement. In the past, Shaw is attached to a pair of scientists: the excitable Bill Randa (Anders Holm in a younger version of the role played by John Goodman in "Kong: Skull Island") and the formidable Keiko Miura (Mari Yamamoto). These three flirt, track titans and lay the groundwork for Monarch in scenes that dance in and out of the narrative established in the films; Godzilla is once again baited into a close encounter with a nuke at Bikini Atoll in 1954, and an expedition to Kazakhstan forecasts later developments.
Much of the fun of "Monarch" is in those flashback scenes, which are shot with a retro Hollywood glow and benefit greatly from Yamamoto's physical presence and flinty-sexy charisma. The modern story, set just after the destruction of San Francisco by Godzilla in the first film, starts out well but settles into a rut that's more formulaic, in terms of the adventure story, and more melodramatic, in terms of family dynamics.
That track features Cate (Anna Sawai) and Kentaro (Ren Watanabe), half-siblings and the adult grandchildren of the monster hunters Keiko and Bill -- their father, also a titan tracker, maintained separate families in America and Japan. The show opens with their discovery of each other, and there is some comedy and poignancy in their mutual disdain and distrust.
As they join forces with a young hacker, May (Kiersey Clemons), and the elder Shaw to go in search of their father, however, the show makes a mistake: It keeps playing the young characters on the same notes of anger, alienation and cynicism for too long. It's not that their behavior isn't believable -- and the writers may have been trying to reflect the current unhappy zeitgeist -- but they are too humorless, as written, to be very interesting, and the young actors, with the occasional exception of Clemons, aren't able to overcome that. When Kurt Russell is onscreen with them, his wit gives you something to hold onto; when he's not, it can be pretty heavy going.
When you are able to drum up some feeling for the characters, it can be hard to decide where to place it, especially in the modern story. The MonsterVerse -- with its origins in the pacifist, anti-imperialist ideas of the original Godzilla films and the pastoral, anticapitalist ones of "King Kong" -- has to carry out a more tricky thematic balancing act than other fantasy-adventure franchises: The corporation at its center is dark but not entirely evil; governments are harsh but not hapless or dictatorial; the monsters are terrifying and destructive, but just want to be left alone.
Through most of "Monarch," those contradictions are not balanced in a way that makes consistently satisfying narrative and emotional sense, perhaps because of the demands of maintaining suspense across 10 episodes. You can put the gnawing questions aside, however, when Yamamoto, Holm and Wyatt Russell are making classic movie-matinee moves in the flashbacks, and whenever the truly impressive monsters rear their scaly heads in any time frame.

The Life-Altering Effects of a Captured Clinch: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the show, Mohamed al-Fayed sends the photographer Mario Brenna to capture shots of Diana and al-Fayed's son, Dodi, on vacation. The portrayal is inaccurate, Brenna says.
It's summer 1997, and Princess Diana is flirting with Dodi Fayed, a globe-trotting playboy, on the Jonikal, a yacht floating on sparkling Mediterranean waters.
Diana, teasingly, says that she likes men who have lips that are "just the right temperature."
"Are mine the right temperature?" Dodi replies.
"I don't know," Diana says: "Need to check." Then, the couple kiss, blissfully unaware that just a few meters away, Mario Brenna, a slick Italian photographer, is on a boat, with a long-lens camera trained on the couple.
A few days later, Brenna's shots of the princess and her new beau are on the front pages of newspapers worldwide.
This is a central scene in the sixth and final season of Netflix's royal drama "The Crown" -- the first batch of episodes premiered on Thursday -- and a moment that signaled the start of a tabloid frenzy around the couple that many blame for their deaths on Aug. 31, 1997, in a car crash in Paris as they were chased by photographers.
Yet the depiction is far from accurate, according to Brenna, speaking in what he said was his first interview with an English-language newspaper.
For a start, "The Crown" has Mohamed al-Fayed -- Dodi's father, and a retail and hotel tycoon who died this year -- appearing to hire Brenna to take the shots, in an effort to push Diana and Dodi's relationship into the public eye, and cajole the pair to marry.
In an email, Annie Sulzberger, the head of research for the show -- she is also the sister of The Times's publisher, A.G. Sulzberger -- said that "there are a few theories about how Brenna managed to find the Jonikal moored somewhere in the Mediterranean Sea," but the one the team found most credible was that one of al-Fayed's employees leaked the boat's location to Brenna.
But Brenna said the idea that al-Fayed hired him was "absurd and completely invented," and that no one leaked information about the yacht's whereabouts to him. Every summer at that time, he was in Sardinia so he could take paparazzi shots of famous people, he said, and coming across Diana and Dodi was simply a "great stroke of luck."
On Aug. 1, 1997, Brenna said he approached Diana's yacht on a fast moving inflatable boat after mistaking a blonde woman making a telephone call on its upper deck for an old acquaintance. As he got closer, he was stunned to realize it was the princess.
Bruno Malka, Brenna's agent at the time who helped sell the images to Paris Match magazine, said in an email that he thought Brenna was familiar with the yacht, "without knowing it was Diana and Dodi" onboard that day. Brenna was successful, Malka added, because he had spent so many years working in the region.
After spotting the couple, Brenna said he spent the next few days stalking the boat, including climbing a cliff to get a better view. From that elevated position, about 400 meters away from Diana, he took several photos of Diana and Dodi in an embrace. The shots were almost blurred, Brenna said, because the heat haze meant he struggled to get the pair in focus.
Still, he knew immediately he'd secured "a historic photo." He'd also captured an image that "solved my personal and family problems," he said, at a time when he had recently divorced and so "was not swimming in wealth."
He unloaded the rolls of film from the camera, then buried them to make sure they didn't get exposed to the sun as he tried to take more images, and also as he feared a competitor might have seen him at work and try to steal his camera and so obtain the images every other photographer in the Mediterranean had been hoping to get first.
On Aug. 10, the Sunday Mirror, a British tabloid, splashed Brenna's image on its front page. "The Kiss," the headline read. Soon, Brenna said, he was selling the pictures worldwide. In the following six-to-eight months, he said, he made about 1.7 million pounds, or $ 2.1 million, from his photos of the couple.
Brenna's pictures -- and the prices news outlets paid for them -- sparked a frenzy. In 2013, Jason Fraser, a British photographer who helped Brenna sell his images, told The Daily Mail that after they were published, over 2,000 photographers arrived in the Mediterranean hoping to get their own snaps of Diana and Dodi. "I felt the whole thing was spinning out of control," Fraser said. Weeks later, the couple died.
In "The Crown," Brenna (portrayed by Enzo Cilenti) explains his methods to camera. To capture celebrities misbehaving, the fictional Brenna says, you have to take risks. Paparazzi also have to act like "hunters ... killers."
Brenna said in the email interview that he did not share this opinion of his work ("I do not identify with the term 'killer,"') and that he was never contacted by anyone from "The Crown" to learn about his experiences (Netflix did not respond to a request for comment).
After Diana and Dodi's death, al-Fayed sued Fraser, the British photographer, for taking photos of Diana and Dodi on a boat, saying it was an invasion of privacy. Brenna said he did not face any such action, adding his images were legal as they "were taken outdoors, in a public place." And he regretted the privacy crackdown that happened since, with governments and stars trying to stop the paparazzi from taking photos: "There is still the right to report," he said.
Today, Brenna lives near Lake Como, in Italy, where he said he's photographed celebrities including George Clooney, Miley Cyrus and Beyoncé, even as the dawn of social media had impacted his profession significantly, including its financial rewards.
Brenna said he and his family enjoyed the success of the photos throughout August 1997. But then, Diana died. When he heard the news, Brenna said, he "couldn't believe it" and cried, not least because he had two children himself and so could understand what her death would mean for Diana's boys. He made a decision "not to speak or disclose anything about the incident until William and Harry reached adulthood."
The mere thought that his images "could have contributed to fueling the hunt for Diana and Dodi obviously saddens me," Brenna said. But he did not think his work added significantly to the furor around the princess.
"If it hadn't been me," he added, "someone else would certainly have captured those images."

Full text: Heather Graham and Brandy play old friends who have a surprise reunion.
Holiday cheer stokes an old source of envy in "Best. Christmas. Ever!," the latest Netflix holiday film from the director Mary Lambert ("Under the Cherry Moon," "Pet Sematary").
Heather Graham stars as Charlotte Sanders, whose pleasantly normal suburban life is interrupted every December when her old frenemy Jackie Jennings (Brandy) sends out a diner-menu-size holiday newsletter boasting of her and her family's latest accomplishments. When a misunderstanding leads the Sanders family to end up on the Jennings family doorstep just before Christmas, Charlotte is forced to spend the holiday in close quarters with her rival -- and she uses that time searching for evidence that Jackie's seemingly perfect life is all a sham.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
At barely 80 minutes (and ending with a musical number from Brandy), "Best. Christmas. Ever!" resembles a television holiday special more than a feature film, and its plot follows the predictable Christmastime themes of love, acceptance, and being thankful for what you've got. Jackie's sizable McMansion abode, where most of the action takes place, exists in the Home Depot ad version of American suburbia: cozy yet indistinguishable, decked out in holly wreaths and reindeer-shaped lights.
Jason Biggs and Matt Cedeño turn in ho-hum performances as Charlotte and Jackie's husbands, but the focus remains on two women burying the hatchet on old grudges. As one might expect, there's some Christmas magic involved and, a bit more surprisingly, a hot-air balloon as well.
Best. Christmas. Ever!
Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 20 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

Full text: Colman Domingo carries this biopic of a March on Washington organizer, the first narrative feature from Michelle and Barack Obama's production company.
Every so often an actor so dominates a movie that its success largely hinges on his every word and gesture. That's the case with Colman Domingo's galvanic title performance in "Rustin," which runs like a current through this portrait of the gay civil-rights activist, a close adviser to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Pacifist, ex-con, singer, lutist, socialist -- Bayard Rustin had many lives, but he remains best known as the main organizer of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It was Rustin who read the march's demands from the podium, remaining near King's side as he delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech.
At once a work of reclamation and celebration, "Rustin" seeks to put its subject front and center in the history he helped to make and from which he has, at times, been elided, partly because, as an openly gay man, he challenged both convention and the law. His was a rich, fascinatingly complex history, filled with big personalities and tremendous stakes, one that here is primarily distilled through the march, which the movie tracks from its rushed conception to its astonishing realization on Aug. 28, 1963, when a quarter million people converged at the Lincoln Memorial. It was the defining public triumph of Rustin's life.
After a little historical scene-setting -- via images of stoic protesters surrounded by screaming racists -- the director George C. Wolfe, working from a script by Julian Breece and Dustin Lance Black, gets down to business. It's 1960, and King (Aml Ameen) is exasperated. Several activists have asked King to lead a mass protest against the forthcoming Democratic National Convention. Sighing, King directs his eyes upward as if beseeching a witness from on high and politely declines: "I'm not your man." A few beats later and his gaze is again directed up, but now at Rustin, who's towering above King, challenging him.
The protest, Rustin explains, will send a message to the party and its nominee, the front-runner John F. Kennedy. Unless the Democrats take a stand against segregation, Rustin says with rising passion and volume, "our people will not show up for them." His directness and body language nicely dramatize Rustin's gifts as a strategist, which reach a crescendo when he sits down, so that now it's him who's looking up at King. Swayed by Rustin's forceful argument, King agrees to lead the protest, enraging establishment power brokers like the head of the N.A.A.C.P., Roy Wilkins (a miscast Chris Rock), and the U.S. Representative for Harlem, Adam Clayton Powell Jr. (a ferocious Jeffrey Wright, taking no prisoners).
Five minutes into the movie, and you're hooked; everything works in this punchy opener. Yet while Domingo, the unfortunately underused Wright and most of the rest of the cast keep charging forward, the movie soon sags under the weight of its central personality and the monumental history it condenses in under two eventful hours. As it straddles the personal and the political, it struggles to do justice to Rustin, whose life story emerges in frustrating piecemeal, along with an anemic love affair, nods at past hurdles, hints of future milestones and appearances by various major players. Carra Patterson shows up as Coretta Scott King; a vivid Michael Potts pops in and out as the labor organizer Cleveland Robinson.
Powell and Wilkins succeed in derailing the 1960 protest, causing a rift between King and Rustin. The story picks up three years later shortly before Rustin begins organizing the 1963 march, shifting the movie into high gear with bustling characters, clacking typewriters and ringing phones. At their best, these scenes underscore how the civil rights movement was a titanic communal effort. Yet partly because the movie also wants to be a great-forgotten-man-of-history story, the larger movement fades amid the clamor of what can seem like a one-man show. It suggests, for one, that Rustin originated the idea for the march when, in a 1979 interview, he specifically credited his mentor A. Philip Randolph (Glynn Turman) -- whose March on Washington Movement dates to the 1940s -- with its creation.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The largest problem with the movie is that it's finally too conventional, formally and politically, to do full justice to the complexities of either the civil-rights movement or Rustin, a socialist whose activism was rooted in his Quakerism and was informed both by his moral beliefs and by economic analysis. When Rustin and other activists on the Left first planned the march, economics was at the fore. "The dynamic that has motivated" Black Americans in their own fight against racism, the plan read, "may now be the catalyst which mobilizes all workers behind the demands for a broad and fundamental program for economic justice."
Whatever its flaws, "Rustin" can't help but move you with its images of so many people joined in righteous harmony. The optimism of its moment feels very distant from the fractiousness of our own, yet it lifts you, as does Domingo's fantastically alive turn. From the second that Rustin sweeps into the movie, throwing open his arms to King -- and, by extension, welcoming the future they will help make -- the actor seizes hold of you. He grabs you with his expressive physicality and then pulls you closer with the urgency, yearning and luminous sincerity that openly plays across his face. It's such a lucid, persuasive, outwardly effortless performance that you may not even notice he's carrying this movie almost by himself.

Full text: Can good-looking guys be funny? The conventional wisdom is that men in comedy need to come across as relatable, not hot. But that may be changing.
My first thought upon seeing the stand-up comic Matt Rife, before knowing much of anything about him, was that I didn't like him. This wasn't a considered opinion, so much as a knee-jerk prejudice.
Critics should be transparent about their biases, so let me confess one: I am skeptical of hot men in comedy. And I'm not the only one.
To be clear, I'm not proud of this. Matt Rife can't help the fact that he has high cheekbones, which have played a role in both his meteoric rise and the grumbling in some comedy circles. Rife, who makes his Netflix debut on Wednesday with "Natural Selection," went viral on TikTok during the pandemic and then put out two specials on YouTube that together racked up nearly 30 million views, a staggering achievement. Of these three hours, he addresses his appearance most directly in the first, when he says it's tough to be handsome in comedy. Sure, he gets plenty of attention from women, he explained, but that doesn't help his confidence or anxiety. "I can't even hang myself because my jawline will cut the rope," he says, with an additional curse word.
It's my favorite of his jokes, a candid mix of self-pitying and boastful that takes you by surprise. But it also forces us to grapple with an uncomfortable question: Is it wrong to discriminate against hunks?
Comedy has been the rare field where square jaws and chiseled features can count against you. Bob Odenkirk once said that it was impossible for men to be funny and sexy. One problem discussing this subject is that you quickly face the eye of the beholder. The question of whether John Mulaney is handsome, it turns out, starts arguments. But the assumption in stand-up has long been that it's better to be relatable or ridiculous than ravishing. When Anthony Jeselnik got started, he quickly noticed that his looks prevented him from getting laughs at self-deprecating jokes, so he built a villain persona.
Attractiveness has entered the maw of the culture war because the stigma against beautiful men has been fading.
When Pete Davidson sang, "I guess I'm hot for dudes in comedy because it's an ugly industry" in a "Barbie" spoof on "Saturday Night Live" last month, the quip already seemed dated. An early sign of change may have been when the boyishly good-looking Jimmy Fallon took over as host of "The Tonight Show" in 2014. But you now see handsome men everywhere, even at small Brooklyn shows like the one where a comic introduced the endearingly cute Lucas O'Neil by citing not his credits but his cheekbones. The dimply Trevor Noah and Colin Jost -- comics stunning enough that no one is shocked that they dated movie stars and models -- are also part of what one annoyed late-night writer described on Twitter as Prom King Comedy, complaining: "You've let the popular kids appropriate the very art form that helped you deal."
Every year it seems a comic gets buff. Kumail Nanjiani most famously, but Chris Rock showing off his abs in The Hollywood Reporter took me more by surprise. When The Daily Beast runs the headline "I Regret to Inform You That Jerry Seinfeld Is Hot," it just goes to show that a new cultural anxiety has been born.
Nothing, however, represents this shift more than Matt Rife, whose sudden fame came not from the clubs or a festival spot but social media, where you're rewarded for looking gorgeous in a close-up. While the early fame of Eddie Murphy (in his leather suit era) and Dane Cook anticipated Rife's heartthrob stature, he feels like a new kind of cultural figure. His relationship with the audience, an integral part of the crowd work videos that built his celebrity, is closer than that of previous comics, and if some fans are responding to his attractiveness as much as his jokes, he doesn't seem to mind. He's not playing down or managing his looks. He's not spoofing or winking at it the way Alec Baldwin did on "Saturday Night Live" early in his career.
Rife leans into his sex appeal. You can see it in the swaggering way he poses for photos or shows off his biceps. Like a boy band star, he invites you to admire him -- and says from the stage that his audience is mostly women. Part of his charm is that he speaks like a Teen Beat cover boy, saying things like, "Homophobia is a massive pet peeve of mine." His debut special was called "Only Fans" and he flirts with the audience. He posted workout clips on social media and uses a topless photo for his Instagram avatar. His road manager is a male model. If Zoolander started doing open mics, he would act like Matt Rife.
This is touchy territory because we already live in a world where every young musical star is attractive, male politicians need to be tall to get elected president and the advantages for actors pleasing to look at are taken for granted. Now comedy too? Is the algorithm going to make the out-of-shape nebbish standup an endangered species?
Female comics, who face relentless amounts of sexist objectification, navigate an even thornier terrain than their male counterparts, but that's an altogether different discussion. Comedy is where a homely bald accountant like Bob Newhart could become a superstar. Many comics were first motivated to be funny to compensate for not being popular in school. On the "Too Far" podcast, Sarah Sherman said, "Do you know there are comedians who were not bullied now?"
Once again, none of this is the fault of Matt Rife, a hard-working stand-up with generic punchlines about cancel culture, the irritations of social media and girls who love crystals. Rife once joked that he identified as an ugly person. Put aside the overdone joke construction. What that tells me is he knows the double standard he is facing and wants to get ahead of it.
The idea that handsome people can't be funny is far too sweeping a generalization. Paul Rudd exists.
I judged Rife too harshly on first glance, but I'm no bigot. Some of my best friends are handsome men. To better empathize with their plight, I FaceTimed one, Misha Collins, an actor who is most famous for playing an angel on the hit show 'Supernatural" and who was my friend long before he became the subject of online lust and erotic fan fiction.
When I asked Collins about the hardships of the handsome, he looked more uncomfortable than I'd ever seen him. "I'd rather talk to you for a story on Gaza," he said, adding that there is nothing worse than an actor admitting that he thinks he's handsome. "Everyone wants handsome people to fail, including me," he said, flashing the sad but soulful eyes of a self-hating handsome man.
There was something poignant about hearing my friend grudgingly admit that he knows he's good looking. But as I started speculating aloud about the dangers of being attractive, I noticed him shaking his head and smiling as if I was saying the stupidest thing in the world. Don't get it twisted, he told me; being handsome is amazing. "You can coast on it in so many situations," he added, laughing off any sympathy from me.
It reminded me of a joke by Raanan Hershberg comparing getting romantic advice from a hot guy to being taught how to bowl by someone who has only done it using bumpers.
Resentment toward hot men is both unfair and understandable. Beauty is not the enemy of humor, but it is a rival. People always say that what they want most in a potential partner is a sense of humor, but who believes them?

At a Meeting of the Minds, Cracking a Killer's Code: [Review]

Full text: The story of death at a mogul's retreat (no, not "Glass Onion") has a few interesting ideas about tech within a familiar mystery scenario.
An eccentric tech billionaire invites a slew of notables to a private retreat, where a detective must solve a mysterious death. If the premise of "A Murder at the End of the World" jumps out at you, it may be because you not so long ago encountered it as the premise of Rian Johnson's "Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery."
Or it may jump out at you because "Murder" is the latest creation from Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij of Netflix's "The OA." That series was a poetic and baffling testament to the force of human connection, involving interpretive dance and a telepathic octopus. The murder mystery, in comparison, is among the most literal, plot-reliant of genres. Could Marling and Batmanglij really have made something that ... ordinary?
FX's "Murder," which begins Tuesday on Hulu, is neither as weird as you might hope or as conventional as you might fear. (Or vice versa.) It takes an Agatha Christie scenario and spins it into a chilly, stylized cyber-noir with ideas about artificial intelligence and some familiar Marling/Batmanglij themes of global consciousness. Think of it as "Glass OAnion."
The detective here is a relative newcomer. Darby Hart (Emma Corrin), an intense young computer hacker, tracked down a serial killer with Bill Farrah (Harris Dickinson), a moody amateur investigator she met online and fell in love with. Her true-crime memoir earns her some literary notice, as well as an invitation from Andy Ronson (Clive Owen), a tech magnate who is convening a meeting of "original thinkers" -- artists, entrepreneurs, an astronaut -- at a sleek, remote hotel that he had built in Iceland.
The purpose of this Arctic TED Talk is, ostensibly, to cogitate on the existential threat of climate change to humanity. Andy, however, has another intelligence at his disposal -- an advanced A.I. called "Ray" that manifests in the holographic form of a neatly goateed man in black (Edoardo Ballerini). Andy believes in the transformative power of this technology and others, but transformative to and for whom?
Darby questions whether and why she fits in with the luminaries at the gathering. But she accepts the invitation for the chance to meet a tech idol: Not Andy, but his wife, Lee Andersen (Marling), a renowned coder who dropped out of public life after a Gamergate-style harassment campaign and lives in seclusion with Andy and their young son (Kellan Tetlow).
But another guest grabs Darby's attention: Bill, now a famous artist, whom she has not seen since a falling-out at the end of their investigation. Before they have time to catch up -- don't say the title didn't warn you -- somebody turns up dead, and Darby's wiring for suspicion kicks in.
Misogyny and technology are the twin themes of "A Murder." Darby was drawn into the serial-killer case by her talent for hacking and her empathy for forgotten female victims. A common theme of her investigations is how little credibility she is granted as a young woman. When she pulls her hoodie over her head, yes, it is a universal visual symbol for "hacker," but she also might as well be drawing an invisibility cloak.
Then there's A.I., which pervades the story like it does Andy's icy retreat. In some cases technological reality has moved faster than the TV production process. A scene in which Ray produces a Harry Potter story in the voice of Ernest Hemingway astonishes the guests, for instance, but you've likely seen a dozen similar examples over the past year.
Still, "A Murder" has a multifaceted view of A.I., not just as a threat but as a possible helpmeet. On the one hand, Andy is another arrogant billionaire who looks to software to compensate for the deficiencies that annoy him in humans. But the surveillance features built into the retreat's setting, however creepy, are also a trove of clues. As Darby digs into the mysterious death, she finds herself using Ray as a source and even an aide -- part Sherlock Holmes's Watson, part IBM's.
The present-day whodunit isn't especially inventive, but Corrin carries the story with a nervy, febrile performance that invests Darby with the life that the dialogue sometimes fails to provide. And the series has atmosphere to spare, making the most of the stark volcanic beauty of its location in Iceland. (It also shot in Utah and New Jersey.)
The flashbacks to Darby and Bill's serial-killer chase, which take up much of the seven episodes, are emotional and involving; Dickinson gives Bill an open-wound vulnerability. But rather than adding resonance to the whole, these scenes end up outshining the long, talky story they're meant to flesh out.
"A Murder," in its main arc, feels like a bit of an artificial life form itself. The blandly drawn retreat guests get no more than a stroke or two of characterization and are weighted with self-serious dialogue. Andy mostly plays to bullying tech-mogul type. And while Marling always uses her enigmatic air as a performer to good advantage, Lee is more of a riddle -- how did a coding revolutionary become a tech tradwife? -- than a rounded character.
Marling and Batmanglij's work has often been more about the delivery of ideas and intangibles than plotting or naturalism, however. At its best, "A Murder" has grandeur, chilly beauty and intellectual adventurousness (and it pulls off a satisfying final twist). It might have been more effective if, as with so many limited series lately, it were tighter and shorter. In this sense, technology is the culprit: Streaming-TV bloat has its fingerprints all over this case.

Trying to Take Arabic Hip-Hop Across the Globe: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The 25-year-old has become a streaming star without releasing a full album. He just wrapped his first shows in the United States, and hopes to take his music even further.
On the ninth stop of his first world tour, the Egyptian rapper Wegz finished soundcheck at the Howard Theater in Washington, D.C., and relaxed on a worn black leather couch wearing a gray Carhartt fleece jacket and cream New Balance 990 sneakers. In his unflashy attire, passers-by might not have recognized one of the biggest artists in the emerging Arabic music scene calmly awaiting his set time.
"That's what I'm trying to do," Wegz, 25, said. "Just revert people back to minimalism."
His numbers, however, have been growing. Wegz has been the most-streamed artist on Spotify in Egypt since 2020. In 2022, he was named the most-streamed artist on the platform across the entire Middle East and North Africa, and became the first Egyptian artist to perform at the FIFA World Cup final. He sold out concerts in London and Berlin before arriving in the United States last month as the first Arab artist with a global tour backed by the concert giant Live Nation.
"He has been one of the pioneers who have taken Egyptian rap to a different place," Salam Kmeid, head of content marketing at the regional music platform Anghami, said in a video call from Dubai. (Wegz's track "El Bakht" is now the most streamed song of all time on the service.) "As an Arabic hip-hop movement, he has taken it to a different scale."
In the middle of his current tour -- after the European leg had wrapped up but before his first dates in North America -- the war between Israel and Hamas began. Wegz, who has been outspoken in support of Palestinians, has made it clear that he has no intent of soft-pedaling his views as he works to reach a broader global audience. He recently posted a video on Instagram of a pro-Palestinian rally in New York City, and announced that a portion of the proceeds from his tour will go to relief efforts in Gaza.
"I will raise awareness about the cause along the way and condemn the dehumanizing and killing of Palestinians," Wegz said in an interview. "I'm hoping to try to heal from all the horrific images I've seen in order to start seeing a better life so we can sing and dance and get back to enjoying what we do."
His rise has coincided with a wave of attention and appreciation for Arabic music. The Palestinian-Algerian rapper Saint Levant's "Very Few Friends" and the Palestinian-American Lana Lubany's "The Snake" both went viral on TikTok. On television, shows like Hulu's "Ramy," Netflix's "Mo" and Disney+'s "Moon Knight" heavily feature Arabic music in thoughtful ways.
"I think there's a lot of talented people around the globe," Wegz said, speaking in English. "I might be very talented as well."
Since his debut single "Batalo Fake" (Arabic for "No Longer Fake") arrived in 2017, with an appearance from his fellow Egyptian M.C. Hesham Raptor, Wegz has been praised for his lyrics, which exude self-confidence while exploring themes around identity and the socioeconomic reality for youth in Egypt's urban neighborhoods. While hip-hop with trap beats remains his foundation, his tracks also dabble in dancier production and Afropop. His most successful song to date, the uncharacteristically vulnerable "El Bakht" ("The Luck"), features a melodic rap about a brokenhearted lover over a syncopated beat, strings and plucked acoustic guitar.
Despite his strong streaming numbers, Wegz still hasn't released a full album, though he insists he's working on one that he plans to put out after his tour. He attributes his success as a singles artist to being a lifelong student of his craft -- a voracious listener nerding out about global music cultures.
"I see myself as someone who's here to show people things they might not have known about because my passion is the research of things, basically," he said. "I want to know how you guys started this. I just keep digging and digging."
Born Ahmed Ali and raised in the coastal Egyptian city Alexandria, Wegz grew up in a modest area with his father, a math teacher, and his mother, a nurse and head of a children's foster home. He has six siblings -- some from different marriages -- and last year told the Emirati entrepreneur and interviewer Anas Bukhash that he moved frequently as a child but made new friends fast. He added that he had been eager to take risks when his family urged caution (though his mother encouraged him to explore, which expanded his worldview).
He developed a love of books at an early age, and wrote short stories and poems. His first exposure to music came from being surrounded by religious anthems, but as a teenager he branched out on his own, seeking secular music.
"I tried to go online and go to internet cafes and listen to YouTube," he recalled in the basement of the Washington venue. Wegz has said he grew up listening to American rappers including Young Thug, Future and the duo Mobb Deep, as well as the Egyptian singers Ahmed Adaweyah, Dalida, and Mohamed Mounir, and the Algerian musician Cheb Mami.
His taste is eclectic, he pointed out, noting that he has "had a phase of every type of music in my life at least once." (His current passion? Yemeni music, which emphasizes narratives: Even if an artist is "just staring at the tree, there's a song for it where you can actually tell us how you feel about this tree and how you feel about being outside today.")
After some attempts at writing music, Wegz recorded his first song at 17 to have something private he could "share on his phone" with a handful of his friends. Working in a studio for the first time "was amazing," he said. "It was what I wanted."
Just a few years later, he was getting attention in Egypt with "T.N.T.", a haunting track produced by fellow Alexandrian rapper L5VAV that blends heavy trap percussion with Egyptian mahraganat, a style that combines low-fi, minimalist synths and edgy, heavy bass. ("I'm a big boss shaking up this great hall/I go heavy on that beat like I'm Rick Ross," Wegz boasts in the song.) In 2020, "Dorak Gai" ("Your Time Is Coming") -- an aggressive but subtle diss track produced by the powerhouse Egyptian musician Molotof -- put Wegz on the map throughout the Middle East and North Africa.
Wegz gave credit to L5VAV, a frequent collaborator who appears on their hit "Khod w Hat" ("Take and Give"), for helping him hone his lyrical skills and navigate his early rise. "He helped me take music seriously," Wegz said, with affection. "It was very motivating being around such an inspiring character."
Now he's set his sights on reaching listeners beyond the Arabic-speaking world while still emphasizing genuine Arabic sounds and rhythms in ways that push the culture forward. "If the global eye is on you right now," he said, there's an opportunity to spotlight "the old things that we always had."
Kmeid, of the streaming service Anghami, said Wegz plays a vital role in Arabic music, and beyond. "He is actually the voice of his generation," she said. "We do see how the Egyptian scene specifically sees Wegz as that young artist who came out of whatever background or history he had, a very simple person who really believed in his dream."
Wegz has plans to expand his brand beyond music, looking toward designing merchandise and a career in acting. Arabs have a rich history as traders, he explained, and that's something he's always kept in mind.
"For now, I'm making music because I really love it and I have fun doing it," he said. "People have fun listening to it, and I'm making money out of it. This is amazing."
"Overall," he added, "I hope to always use my voice for good as long as I live."

WASHINGTON — On the ninth stop of his first world tour, Egyptian rapper Wegz finished soundcheck at the Howard Theater in Washington and relaxed on a worn black leather couch wearing a gray Carhartt fleece jacket and cream New Balance 990 sneakers. In his unflashy attire, passersby might not have recognized one of the biggest artists in the emerging Arabic music scene calmly awaiting his set time.
“That’s what I’m trying to do,” Wegz, 25, said. “Just revert people back to minimalism.”
His numbers, however, have been growing. Wegz has been the most-streamed artist on Spotify in Egypt since 2020. In 2022, he was named the most-streamed artist on the platform across the entire Middle East and North Africa, and became the first Egyptian artist to perform at the FIFA World Cup final. He sold out concerts in London and Berlin before arriving in the United States last month as the first Arab artist with a global tour backed by concert giant Live Nation.
“He has been one of the pioneers who have taken Egyptian rap to a different place,” Salam Kmeid, head of content marketing at the regional music platform Anghami, said in a video call from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. (Wegz’s track “El Bakht” is now the most streamed song of all time on the service.) “As an Arabic hip-hop movement, he has taken it to a different scale.”
In the middle of his current tour — after the European leg had wrapped up but before his first dates in North America — the war between Israel and Hamas began. Wegz, who has been outspoken in support of Palestinians, has made it clear that he has no intent of soft-pedaling his views as he works to reach a broader global audience. He recently posted a video on Instagram of a pro-Palestinian rally in New York City, and announced that a portion of proceeds from his tour will go to relief efforts in the Gaza Strip.
“I will raise awareness about the cause along the way and condemn the dehumanizing and killing of Palestinians,” Wegz said in an interview. “I’m hoping to try to heal from all the horrific images I’ve seen in order to start seeing a better life so we can sing and dance and get back to enjoying what we do.”
His rise has coincided with a wave of attention and appreciation for Arabic music. Palestinian Algerian rapper Saint Levant’s “Very Few Friends” and Palestinian American Lana Lubany’s “The Snake” both went viral on TikTok. On television, shows such as Hulu’s “Ramy,” Netflix’s “Mo” and Disney+’s “Moon Knight” heavily feature Arabic music in thoughtful ways.
“I think there’s a lot of talented people around the globe,” Wegz said, speaking in English. “I might be very talented as well.”
Since his debut single “Batalo Fake” (Arabic for “No Longer Fake”) arrived in 2017, with an appearance from his fellow Egyptian M.C. Hesham Raptor, Wegz has been praised for his lyrics, which exude self-confidence while exploring themes around identity and the socioeconomic reality for youth in Egypt’s urban neighborhoods. While hip-hop with trap beats remains his foundation, his tracks also dabble in dancier production and Afropop. His most successful song to date, the uncharacteristically vulnerable “El Bakht” (“The Luck”), features a melodic rap about a brokenhearted lover over a syncopated beat, strings and plucked acoustic guitar.
Despite his strong streaming numbers, Wegz still hasn’t released a full album, though he insists he’s working on one that he plans to put out after his tour. He attributes his success as a singles artist to being a lifelong student of his craft — a voracious listener nerding out about global music cultures.
“I see myself as someone who’s here to show people things they might not have known about because my passion is the research of things, basically,” he said. “I want to know how you guys started this. I just keep digging and digging.”
Born Ahmed Ali and raised in the coastal Egyptian city of Alexandria, Wegz grew up in a modest area with his father, a math teacher, and his mother, a nurse and head of a children’s foster home. He has six siblings — some from different marriages — and last year told Emirati entrepreneur and interviewer Anas Bukhash that he moved frequently as a child but made new friends fast. He added that he had been eager to take risks when his family urged caution (though his mother encouraged him to explore, which expanded his worldview).
He developed a love of books at an early age, and wrote short stories and poems. His first exposure to music came from being surrounded by religious anthems, but as a teenager he branched out on his own, seeking secular music.
“I tried to go online and go to internet cafes and listen to YouTube,” he recalled in the basement of the Washington venue. Wegz has said he grew up listening to American rappers including Young Thug, Future and the duo Mobb Deep, as well as Egyptian singers Ahmed Adaweyah, Dalida, and Mohamed Mounir, and Algerian musician Cheb Mami.
His taste is eclectic, he pointed out, noting that he has “had a phase of every type of music in my life at least once.” (His current passion? Yemeni music, which emphasizes narratives: Even if an artist is “just staring at the tree, there’s a song for it where you can actually tell us how you feel about this tree and how you feel about being outside today.”)

Full text: How a disappearing act became the default ending to so much human interaction.
Horror movies are always a good reflection of the culture that created them. In the 1980s, as if in response to the repressive evangelical movement gaining hold in American politics, grotesque body horror ("The Fly," "Society") became a defining genre, along with a succession of gratuitously violent slasher films in which hormonal teenagers meet gruesome ends, usually just beyond the sphere of adult supervision ("The Burning," "Friday the 13th," "Sleepaway Camp"). In the 1990s, horror films grew more excessive, with bigger budgets, but some added irony and self-awareness to speak to a generation of jaded young viewers who had seen it all: The potential victims in Wes Craven's "Scream" (1996) display a deep knowledge of horror film tropes.
The 2020s, in contrast, may seem to be defined by nothing at all. Horror films have everything from monsters and cannibals to psychotic hillbillies and even beloved children's characters (this year's "Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey").
And yet this era can best be understood by its proliferation of ghost stories. In "Talk to Me," one of the better recent horror films, a group of Australian teenagers discover an unsettlingly easy way to communicate with the dead, including one character's mother, whose sudden presence calls into question her ostensibly accidental demise. Films in which a ghost preys on an unsuspecting family in the supposed comfort of their home aren't new, but they've become as common today as slashers were in the '80s. "The Conjuring," a 2013 low-budget sleeper about two ghost hunters who try to rid domestic spaces of paranormal demons, has since ballooned into the eight-film-strong Conjuring Universe -- the highest-grossing horror franchise of all time.
Why are we so interested in ghosts these days? One clue can be found in the latest definition of the word in the Oxford English Dictionary: a verb meaning "to ignore or pretend not to know a person." The O.E.D. cites the following sentence, from a 2016 interview in Toronto Life, as an example of usage: "I was dating someone I met on Tinder when she all of a sudden 'ghosted' me." What began as an almost inevitable result of the detachment afforded by dating apps and social media has mutated into what a writer for The Cut recently described as "an epidemic of unsatisfactory conclusions and unexplained rejections." Ghosting is the silent treatment for all eternity -- and, it seems, our default method of disengagement.
As they do for so many social phenomena, the internet and the pandemic share much of the blame. Online existence had already offered many new and easy ways to ignore or avoid a person, but all the time spent in isolation made it worse. As everyone's lives became both smaller and more difficult to manage, casual friendships were cast off without a word. The social contract broke down, and all rules of propriety -- an obligatory "good luck," or even "I never want to see you again" -- became relics of the past. Ghosting now seems to be happening in realms in which disappearing without a trace is harder to pull off -- in offices, where colleagues don't bother returning several emails in a row, opting to risk an uncomfortable elevator run-in instead, or among friends who share a social circle and can't withdraw as easily as they once did on the internet.
All of this has made us more preoccupied with a possible vanishing than ever before. The act of a person seemingly evaporating into thin air, never to return, has fueled our cultural imagination, bordering at this point on cliché. It's the plot of Joyce Carol Oates's 2023 novel, "48 Clues Into the Disappearance of My Sister," and the Apple TV+ mini-series "The Last Thing He Told Me" starring Jennifer Garner. Netflix has created a cottage industry of true-crime documentaries, including some centering on cold cases of those who puzzlingly disappear; among these is the 2020 revival of the popular television series "Unsolved Mysteries." And we maintain a deep curiosity about artists who explore the psychic trauma of absence, as does Jasper Johns, who made some of his most effective works -- his remarkably dreary gray paintings, from 1961 -- the year he and his former friend and lover Robert Rauschenberg became estranged. Others, from the novelist Thomas Pynchon to the conceptual artists Cady Noland and David Hammons, have made ghosting their audiences a focus of their work, or at least of their personas, either by declining interviews and photographs or by refusing to explain their aesthetic decisions.
It's not as if the 21st century invented the concept of unceremoniously cutting ties -- only that we've now connected that act to a primal fear. Ghosts are by definition lingerers, and they've been a fixture of popular culture going back millenniums. The Babylonians produced what may be the world's oldest rendering of a ghost on a clay tablet around 1500 B.C., as well as instructions for vanquishing an unwanted spirit to the underworld. In works ranging from the "Iliad" to the tragedies of Shakespeare to the newest entry in the Conjuring Universe -- a 2023 stinker called "The Nun II" -- a ghost represents unfinished business, something important left unresolved. In the simplest terms, it's an overwhelming regret. To be haunted by a ghost is to be possessed by something you can't accept, from which you can't move on. It won't let you.
But as scary as a ghost can be, a ghoster is even more vexing: What do you do when someone suddenly no longer acknowledges you exist? What can you do, besides take all the sadness and anger that will never be recognized by its source and find a way to live with it all by yourself? No ghost hunter or exorcist will help you. Ghosting, as we understand it today, is the worst kind of haunting because the burden of the disappearance is left entirely on the shoulders of the haunted. It makes you long for an old-fashioned demonic possession. At least in horror films, the ghost, however unwelcome, still bothers to make an appearance.

Full text: I am a reporter for The Times covering India and South Asia. Clean air is a luxury I realized after relocating to New Delhi. These are some of the things I've been watching, reading or listening to after shutting the doors and turning on air purifiers.
Paatal Lok
In this gritty Prime Video drama, a disillusioned police officer investigates a failed assassination attempt on a journalist, a pursuit that leads him to India's heart of darkness and the lives of four criminals, including one who loves dogs but attacks humans with a hammer.
The Light at the End of the World
I am hooked on Siddhartha Deb's new novel, "The Light at the End of the World." Its four novella-length sections connect India's two previous centuries with its about-to-collapse future, even as the country endlessly tries to free itself.
Scoop
Years ago, I read "Behind Bars in Byculla," written by a reporter sent to prison on false charges -- not unusual in India -- for murdering another reporter. "Scoop," streaming on Netflix, is a stunning retelling of that real-life crime involving police, media and criminal gangs in Mumbai.
Stringer
When Anjan Sundaram's book "Stringer: A Reporter's Journey in the Congo," was published, I wasn't a journalist, but it helped me make the transition. Part memoir, part reportage, with terrific storytelling that reminds me of V.S. Naipaul, "Stringer" tries to address endless brutalities in the African country. I am reading it for the third time.
Stolen
I fell in love with long-form podcasts like "Stolen: Surviving St. Michael's." In this eight-part series by Spotify, Connie Walker investigates the abuse her father and many other Indigenous people experienced as children at a residential school in Canada.

'Living the Dream' and Making a Statement: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Alan van Capelle said he was "living the dream" with his husband and two children, a life he once thought was out of reach for someone like him.
Alan van Capelle spends a lot of time trying to foster equality and a sense of belonging as the executive director of Friends of the High Line, the nonprofit that oversees the park's operations.
"There are very few places in the city where everyone can be surrounded by museum quality art, botanical gardens and performance space, regardless of their economic means," said Mr. van Capelle, 48, who is responsible for raising $ 20 million annually so that more than seven million people can visit the 1 ½ mile-long West Side public park each year, free of charge.
He grew up on Commack, Long Island, and is now living a life he never thought possible as a Jewish, biracial, gay man. "You either died early of AIDS or were alone, abandoned by family," he said. "I'm living the dream because I never knew I could have a husband and two kids."
Mr. van Capelle was one of the lead architects of the marriage equality campaign in New York, and is married to Matthew Morningstar, 48, an executive vice president at LPL Financial, a financial services firm in Manhattan. They live in a two-bedroom on the Lower East Side with their sons Patrick, 9, and Ethan, 12, whom they adopted at birth.
Rise and Snooze I'm an anxious person and a creature of order. I feel life favors the prepared. During the week I'm up at 5:45 a.m., so I give myself an extra 30 minutes on Sundays to sleep, which is a treat. Matt snuggles me for eight minutes until the snooze alarm on my iPhone goes off. Every morning I look at Matt, then at the sky and say, "Amen."
Coffee, iPads, Cheerios Matt stays in bed. I get the papers -- The New York Times, The Daily News and The Wall Street Journal, which are at our front door. Then I down a double shot of Paris Espresso made on our Nespresso. The kids get up at around 7:30. There are hugs and requests to use their iPads since they don't use them during the week. We start with Cheerios peppered with chocolate chips, or I'll pick up pastries or scones from Ost Cafe. Matt wakes up at 7:45 or 8. I'll make him a coffee.
Worship and Waffles By 8:30 we're in our white Chevy Traverse, and we head to St. Francis Xavier, our bi-denominational church on 16th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. I'm Jewish; Matt was raised Catholic. One of my favorite moments is the statement we make walking in together as a gay family so people can't deny we exist.
We haven't had a real breakfast, so we go to the Hollywood Diner. It's super convenient because it's across the street. Sometimes our niece or friends join. The boys have waffles or pancakes. Matt has a healthy egg white thing. I vacillate with an egg white, spinach and mushroom omelet, or turkey burger.
Hot Pink Inspiration If we're not running errands for the kids -- Paragon Sports or arts supplies at Blick -- we do a cultural activity, the Cloisters or MET, but usually it's the Whitney. I love contemporary art. My shoulders come down when I'm there. I live for the moment when I look at art and feel something. It's like a drug. I love watching my kids look at art, which prompts and inspires good conversations. "What's the girl in the picture thinking?" "What's her relationship to the other person in the picture?"
We might get a snack for the kids and a glass of wine for us. Then we hit the High Line. I'm currently in love with Swiss born artist Pamela Rosenkranz's "Old Tree," which we just unveiled. It's hot pink and breathtaking.
Reading, Then Games We're home by 3. I'll do laundry. Matt goes online. The kids like comic books and graphic novels. Ethan is reading the "Star Wars: Dark Droids" series and Patrick is into the Marvel Comics series. Since Ethan doesn't have a soccer game or track meet right now, Matt will take him to Luther Gulick Park, which is around the corner, to play basketball. Patrick and I might play Uno, Rummikub or Spinners, which is a tile game. I wasn't a game person growing up, but Matt converted me.
Candlelight Dinner Around 6 we order steamed pork dumplings, chicken and broccoli, and an egg roll from Wa Lung Kitchen, our local Chinese restaurant. When one of us goes to pick up the food, we get Patrick -- who is allergic to peanuts -- pepperoni pizza from Alphonso's. We set the table kitchen and I light candles. We currently have 10 candles going. I'm a big fan of Pomegranate + Currant from Paddywax.
Drinks and Calendars After dinner, the boys take a bath or shower and put on their PJs. Matt and I make cocktails. It's ritualistic and needed. Right now we're drinking Manhattans, perfect, equal parts of iced cold sweet and dry vermouth, with a Luxardo cherry. I'm a lot easier with one because we're going to do our "calendaring" conversation. There's negotiating and horse trading as we go through our schedule -- when each of us is traveling, who has a work event, what projects or activities do the kids have, do we need an extra sitter. We are more Lucy and Ethel in the chocolate factory as we try to organize the next two weeks.
The Shows At 8 we pause and watch TV with the kids. Right now it's "Modern Family" reruns. Then the kids say their prayers, which we do together. Once they're in bed, Matt and I finish calendaring. Then we watch TV. We finished the Julia Child mini-series on Netflix, which was great, and we're almost done with "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel."
Books and a Puzzle By 10:00 I say good night to Matt, who is still watching TV. I take out the kids' clothing for Monday so it's ready for them, make sure the school iPads are charging and set the table for breakfast. I get in bed and pick up a book. I just finished "In Memoriam" by Alice Winn. It's spectacular. Now I'm reading "The Great Money Reset" by my friend Jill Schlesinger. Matt comes in with the paper. I get a second wind. He does The Times' crossword puzzle. He's the lead, but he asks me questions so I'm brought into that.
Good Luck, and Good Night By 11:00 it's lights out. There's more snuggling. Each night we have a ritual. I take his hand, which is on my head, and he taps my head five times, one for each of us and one for good luck. I'm not sure how it started or why, but I'm so grateful for having that, and him, and this life with our kids.

A Former Goldman Sachs Trader Reorders Greek Politics: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The rapid ascent of Stefanos Kasselakis, a former Goldman Sachs trader and Greece's first openly gay party leader, has gripped the nation. But his leadership is dividing the country's main opposition party.
Stefanos Kasselakis was virtually unknown in Greece just six months ago when he was a no-chance election candidate with Syriza, the country's main opposition party.
These days, thanks to an electoral drubbing of that party, a meteoric ascent fueled by a skillful social media campaign, his status as a former Goldman Sachs trader and a gay politician, along with his movie-star looks, he is seemingly all anyone in Greece can talk about.
Improbably, he is now the leader of Syriza, having essentially come out of nowhere to defeat a former minister for the top role a month ago. But his leadership has sent the leftist party into a tailspin, and is expected to result in one influential faction breaking away at a top-level party meeting this weekend. It has also signaled both a reorganization of leftist politics in Greece and, some analysts say, a shift in the style of the country's politics to rely more on appearances and less on substance.
"His election is the product of the rightward drift of the previous leadership," said Seraphim Seferiades, a professor of politics and history at Panteion University in Athens, who pointed to a similar trend across Europe and beyond where the left has strayed from some of its core principles to gain broader appeal.
"Kasselakis is a prime example of this trend, the main idea being that the adoption of sheer imagery -- not just gay, but also young and energetic -- will do the trick," Mr. Seferiades added. "Well, it won't. It will exacerbate the crisis within Syriza."
A 35-year-old former Goldman Sachs trader who took over a party that just a decade ago blamed the global financial system for devastating Greece's economy, Mr. Kasselakis lived for 20 years in the United States, including in Miami and New York, before breaking into politics in his homeland. He is Greece's first openly gay party leader, and recently wed his long-term partner, Tyler McBeth, an American emergency-room nurse, in Brooklyn while pressing for the legalization of same-sex marriage in Greece.
Greek television channels have lapped it up, covering his trips to the gym with his partner and the couple's walks with their dog, Farlie, as much as his political speeches. (The newlyweds' Cartier rings were a recent focus of discussion.) But the obsession with Mr. Kasselakis' personal life has vexed party stalwarts.
Last month, five of its prominent politicians defected within a few days, several other high-profile stalwarts have since signaled their intention to leave, and a document signed by 1,300 party members that was made public on Thursday accused Mr. Kasselakis of "bullying and insolence" for trying to eject critics and moving the party away from the left. Other prominent members have referred to a "state of emergency" and "toxic climate" in the party before a meeting of its central committee this weekend.
Stelios Kouloglou, a member of the European Parliament with Syriza since 2015, last month decided to go independent rather than remain in a party that he said "has become a Netflix series."
Mr. Kasselakis has defended himself against accusations of arrogance, saying from the outset that the public put him where he is. "I'm not a phenomenon -- I'm the voice of a society," he declared after his victory in late September.
On Friday, he pledged in a video statement posted on the social media platform X not to "betray" those who had voted for him to change the party. "I won't back down," he said, adding that he would ask Syriza's central committee to approve a referendum by party members on the dismissal of four party stalwarts who he said had "brutally offended" him and the party. One of the four quit shortly after the video was released.
Mr. Kasselakis did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.
He was basically unknown before May, when -- still a resident of Miami -- he stood as an "at large" candidate on Syriza's ticket in Greece's general elections. Although that endeavor was bound to fail, given his low ranking on the ballot, it nonetheless set the scene for the next one, when Syriza's one-time firebrand leader, Alexis Tsipras, resigned after the party suffered an electoral crush by the conservative New Democracy party of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
In a July opinion essay, Mr. Kasselakis outlined his vision for a Greek version of the United States' Democratic Party, which he has supported with donations and as a volunteer for Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s 2008 presidential bid. Then, in a frank campaign video, he threw his hat into the ring for the Syriza leadership.
He told of a comfortable upbringing in one of the Greek capital's most affluent suburbs followed by a relocation to the United States at age 14 when his father's shipping business collapsed, of a three-year stint at Goldman Sachs and the creation of his own shipping firm.
He promised tax relief for workers, a separation of Greece's powerful Orthodox Church from the state and the abolition of compulsory military service.
When critics took aim at him over his policy pledges, which were thin on detail, over his banking background and over old articles in which he criticized Mr. Tsipras and praised Mr. Mitsotakis, he hit back with snappy videos saying that he had become a leftist after witnessing the inequalities sown by the banking system.
Mr. Kasselakis' sexual orientation also became a talking point in a society that remains one of Europe's most socially conservative. He reported being swamped by hate mail during his campaign, and his expression of a wish to have two sons via surrogacy fueled a furor, including a homophobic rant by a prominent mayor that is now the subject of a Supreme Court investigation.
Despite all of the media exposure, many still wonder what he stands for, apparently confused by his banking background and the fact that he is backed both by close aides to his predecessor and disaffected Syriza supporters eager for change.
Only 6 percent of 1,100 respondents to a recent poll said they viewed him as leftist, with 14 percent regarding him as right-wing. Another poll, of about 1,300 people, found that only 16 percent viewed him positively.
"This blur and contradictory identity, the lack of solid political content and discourse, as well as the fact that he had no attachment to the radical left whatsoever is what prevents him from attracting public opinion," said Lamprini Rori, a professor of political analysis at the University of Athens.
Mr. Kasselakis' ascent has come at an unsettled time in Greek politics. Despite Mr. Mitsotakis' resounding electoral victory, local elections last month suggested that his family's grip on power might be loosening, given that his nephew was unseated as mayor of Athens amid broader losses for New Democracy.
The Syriza leader rushed to herald "the first major crack in the Mitsotakis regime." But with New Democracy still holding a comfortable majority in Parliament and Syriza polling below 13 percent, that appears to be wishful thinking.
Some have attributed Mr. Kasselakis' rise to a protest vote by disgruntled Syriza supporters desperate for new blood. But whether he is a force for renewal or a catalyst for the end of a party in crisis remains to be seen.
"Kasselakis must be a unique case in the global history of politics," said Thodoris Georgakopoulos, a prominent commentator. "There have been many cases of nonpolitical celebrities cashing in their fame to gain political power. This is not such a case. The members of a political party voted a random stranger to lead it. It is beyond bizarre."

As Israel Battles in Gaza, Germany Is Curbing Pro-Palestinian Speech: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The country's authorities have banned many protests in the name of fighting antisemitism. Critics say such restrictions are discriminatory.
Since fleeing Syria a decade ago, Wafa Mustafa has spoken out for political prisoners at the United Nations, held vigils outside war crimes trials and chanted in solidarity with Iranians protesting their authoritarian government.
Her activism won attention and praise in Germany, her adopted country -- until she took it to a protest in support of Palestinians.
Last month, Ms. Mustafa said the police approached her and a fellow activist in Berlin as they stood on the sidelines of a protest, which the authorities had banned, against the Israeli bombardment of Gaza. The two were not demonstrating, she said, but wore the black and white Palestinian scarf known as the kaffiyeh. The police pushed her friend to the ground, pinned him down for several minutes and arrested him.
She filmed the episode while demanding an explanation. Instead of getting an answer, she, too, was briefly detained, accused of resisting the police.
"What I saw in their eyes is similar to what I saw in the eyes of Assad regime forces," Ms. Mustafa said, referring to Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian dictator. "I know it's not the same, but that is how I felt," she said. "When you look into their eyes, there is nothing. You cannot talk with them, you cannot discuss with them. You cannot ask them, 'What are you doing?"'
Since Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks on Israel and Israel's subsequent bombardment of Gaza, governments across Europe have grappled with how the conflict has played out in their own countries. Some, citing security fears, have imposed stiff restrictions on pro-Palestinian protests in particular or banned them altogether, raising concerns about the violation of civil liberties.
The authorities tried to prohibit pro-Palestinian protests in Austria, Hungary and Switzerland, where some cities took the approach of banning protests of any kind. In France, a court dismissed a blanket ban on pro-Palestinian demonstrations, but they can still be banned case by case.
Even where protests have not been banned, some government officials strongly discouraged pro-Palestinian demonstrations, or harshly condemned them.
Nowhere has the debate over what is legal and legitimate expression of dissent been more fraught than in Germany, where it has struck at the heart of how the nation defines itself, and prompted questions about which values should be prioritized at the cost of others.
Germany sees severely restricting criticism of Israel as a necessary part of atoning for the Holocaust. But many in its immigrant communities -- Arabs, and also many progressive Jews and Israelis -- say the restrictions not only violate free speech, but are discriminatory as well.
In recent weeks, Hamburg banned protests -- or restricted the number of Palestinian flags that could be waved. In Berlin, officials authorized schools to bar students from wearing the kaffiyeh or the Palestinian flag or its colors.
The police in Berlin said they had blocked over half of the 41 scheduled Gaza solidarity protests, sometimes on the grounds that they would "emotionalize" residents of Palestinian origin. These included a children's demonstration to mourn the Palestinian children killed by Israeli strikes in the past month. Permitted protests were banned from using slogans such as "stop the war" and "free Palestine."
The Berlin police prohibited the protests based on "an imminent danger that the gatherings would lead to incitement to hatred, antisemitic statements, glorification of violence, incitement to violence and thus to intimidation and violence," a spokeswoman said.
Asked for comment about Ms. Mustafa's video and account, the police would only confirm that two people were detained, and gave no explanation.
Activists blame the authorities for incitement: In Berlin, a police officer stomped out candles at a vigil for Gaza's dead. The police said that a video of the episode was too short to determine context, but that the officer was required to extinguish the candles because they were on the street.
Among those present was a spokesman for the activist group Palestine Speaks, who asked not to be identified over concerns about hate mail. He has lost 19 family members in the strikes on Gaza. For over two decades, he felt at home in Berlin, where he is a pediatric surgeon. But in recent years, he has felt alienated by what he said was an increasingly hostile stance toward Palestinians and any criticism of Israel.
He recalled how the city had embraced the protests he joined to support Ukrainian hospitals under Russian bombardment. The contrast to how Germany is restricting protests over the suffering of Palestinian civilians, he said, was painful: "I feel discriminated against. I feel second class. I feel traumatized."
Germans defending the restrictions note that the country has a less permissive stance on free speech than many democracies for subjects beyond Israel, a legacy of World War II and how the Nazis exploited the democratic process to seize power. Holocaust denial is illegal, for example, as are slogans that directly avow National Socialism.
"The consensus in Germany is that in spite of the great democracy we have, there are certain things which are not accepted at all in our society, and that limits the political discourse," said Felix Klein, Germany's antisemitism commissioner. "Antisemitism is bad anywhere, but it has this other dimension which it doesn't have in any other country."
Those who support Germany's measures point out that antisemitic incidents have surged since the Israel-Hamas war, including in Berlin, where firebombs were thrown at a synagogue. No information has been released about the perpetrators of the synagogue episode.
More recent Berlin protests have been banned before they could even be held, making it hard to assess how incendiary they would be. Many activists say their protests are being unjustifiably equated with antisemitism.
"I feel so stupid that I have to say this all the time -- but our fight is not against Jews," Ms. Mustafa said.
Jewish and Israeli protests have been canceled, too. Last month, the police detained a woman standing in a Berlin square after she refused to put down a poster that read, "As a Jew and Israeli: Stop the genocide in Gaza."
They also prohibited a demonstration by the progressive Jewish group Jüdische Stimme.
Explaining their reasoning on the Jüdische Stimme protest, the police told The New York Times that the demonstration was "explicitly open to participants of Palestinian origin," and said organizers coordinated with protesters whose demonstrations were banned over concerns about antisemitic incitement.
Udi Raz, one of the protest organizers, said the police decision was "heartbreaking" and "anti-democratic in its essence."
Over 100 Jewish writers, artists and academics signed a letter condemning Germany's practices: "If this is an attempt to atone for German history, its effect is to risk repeating it."
Among them was Deborah Feldman, whose memoirs were the basis of the Netflix series "Unorthodox," about fleeing her Hasidic community in New York. She was raised by Holocaust survivors and now lives in Berlin.
"They seem to be trying to pave the way, in a sense, to criminalize the public expression of Palestinian identity," she said.
Some critics argue that the restrictions are linked to growing hostility toward migrants and the rising popularity of the far-right party Alternative for Germany, now the second most popular party in the polls.
A planned modernization of the naturalization law includes a provision for denying citizenship to people convicted of racism or antisemitism.
Such steps have had a chilling effect on free speech, leaving many worried for their citizenship or jobs, given Germany's increasingly expansive definition of antisemitism. A well-known German talk show last week said it was unable to get any Arab guests because of these anxieties.
At the same time, critics say, German natives with exposed past Nazi sympathies have faced little accountability.
In August, childhood classmates of Bavaria's finance minister, Hubert Aiwanger, said he once distributed an antisemitic flier and gave Nazi salutes -- accusations he either dismissed as youthful defiance or denied.
He was re-elected anyway, and amid growing Gaza protests has been quoted broadly in the German news media warning of "imported antisemitism" by immigrants.
Government statistics show, however, that registered antisemitic attacks are mostly from the far right, which committed around 84 percent of them last year.
"Germany is pushing antisemitism onto migrants," said Tomer Dotan-Dreyfus, a novelist and a signatory of the protest letter. "It allows Germans to not deal with homemade antisemitism, which is way more dangerous than antisemitic sayings and demonstrations for Palestine."
For Arab residents, the problem is larger than what many see as hypocrisy -- to them, the health of Germany's democracy is at stake.
"This is about the freedom of speech of every single person in this country," Ms. Mustafa said. "If I am banned today, you will be banned tomorrow."

Union Board Backs Contract, Which Now Goes to Actors for Vote: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The SAG-AFTRA board voted on Friday to send the agreement with studios to its members for a ratification process that will end in early December.
The union that represents movie and television actors said on Friday that its 76-member national board had voted with 86 percent support to send a tentative contract with studios to members for ratification.
The ratification process will start on Tuesday and end the first week in December. Actors can go back to work immediately, however.
Members are expected to approve the contract, which Fran Drescher, the union's outspoken president, valued at more than $ 1 billion over three years. She highlighted the "extraordinary scope" of the agreement, noting that it included protections around the use of artificial intelligence, higher minimum pay, better health care funding, concessions from studios on self-taped auditions, improved hair and makeup services on sets, and a requirement for intimacy coordinators for sex scenes, among other gains.
"They had to yield," Ms. Drescher said at a news conference during a 28-minute monologue that touched on Veterans Day, Bela Lugosi's Dracula costume, her parents, the Roman Empire, studio stubbornness, Buddhism, Frederick Douglass and her dog.
The union, SAG-AFTRA, which represents tens of thousands of actors, and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios, reached the tentative agreement on Wednesday. It followed a bitter standoff that contributed to a near-complete shutdown of production in the entertainment industry. At 118 days, it was the longest movie and television strike in the union's 90-year history.
The tentative deal was also historic, according to the studio alliance, which said it reflected "the biggest contract-on-contract gains in the history of the union." In a statement, the alliance said it was "pleased" that SAG-AFTRA's board had recommended ratification.
"We are also grateful that the entire industry has enthusiastically returned to work," the alliance said.
The actors' strike, combined with a writers' strike that started in May and was resolved in September, devastated the entertainment economy. Hundreds of thousands of crew members were idled, with some losing their homes and turning to food banks for groceries. Some small businesses that service studios -- costume dry cleaners, prop warehouses, catering companies -- may never recover.
The dual strikes caused roughly $ 10 billion in losses nationwide, according to Todd Holmes, an associate professor of entertainment media management at California State University, Northridge. While the big studios are based in Los Angeles, they also use soundstage complexes in Georgia, New York, New Jersey and New Mexico.
Kevin Klowden, chief global strategist with the Milken Institute, an economic think tank, was more cautious with his estimate, putting losses at more than $ 6 billion. He said it "may take a while" to know the true size.
On Friday, the SAG-AFTRA board, which includes Sharon Stone, Sean Astin and Rosie O'Donnell, made public a summary of the tentative contract's contents. While not receiving everything it asked for, the union achieved significant gains.
The final sticking point involved "synthetic fakes," or the use of artificial intelligence to create an entirely fabricated character by melding together recognizable features from real actors. The union won consent and compensation guarantees.
"You could imagine prompting a generative A.I. system that's been trained on a bunch of actors' performances to create a digital performer, for example, who has Julia Roberts's smile," Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, SAG-AFTRA's executive director, said in an interview. "Before this agreement, there wasn't any contractual or legal basis to require consent or prohibit that. Now there will be."
But this strike was never about stars. A-listers like Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Pitt negotiate their own contracts (or, more precisely, their agents do). The tentative contract covers minimums, or what actors who don't have any clout get paid.
SAG-AFTRA had demanded an 11 percent raise for minimum pay in the first year of a contract. Studios had insisted that they could offer no more than 5 percent, the same as had recently been given (and agreed to) by unions for writers and directors. In the end, the union was able to win a 7 percent first-year raise.
"This is really important because it sends a very clear signal to other unions," Mr. Crabtree-Ireland said. "I'm not aware of anyone ever being able to break the pattern before, because it's always been that the A.M.P.T.P. establishes a number and everyone gets held to it."
SAG-AFTRA failed in one regard. It had gone into negotiations demanding a percentage of streaming service revenue. It had proposed a 2 percent share -- later dropped to 1 percent, before a pivot to a per-subscriber fee. Ms. Drescher had made the demand a priority, but companies like Netflix balked, calling it "a bridge too far."
Instead, the studio alliance proposed a new residual (a type of royalty) for streaming programs based on performance metrics, which the union, after making some adjustments, agreed to take. It is similar to what the Writers Guild of America achieved in its negotiations: Actors in streaming shows that attract at least 20 percent of subscribers will receive a bonus.
Unlike the Writers Guild, however, SAG-AFTRA also got the studio alliance to agree to a system in which 25 percent of the bonus money will go into a fund that will be distributed to actors in less successful streaming shows.
"I felt like, is this a win or a loss?" Ms. Drescher said. "But we're getting the money. We opened a new revenue stream. What matters is that we got into another pocket."

Strikes End, But Studios See a Future Of Austerity: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Celebratory feelings are competing with resentment over the work stoppage and worries about the business era that is coming.
It should be a rapturous time in Hollywood.
Writers have been back at their keyboards for a month, having negotiated a strike-ending deal so favorable that it seemed to leave even them a bit gobsmacked. On Wednesday, the actors' union said it had negotiated a tentative contract of its own, all but ending its 118-day strike and clearing a path for the film and television business to roar back to life for the first time since May.
Champagne for everyone!
Instead, the mood in the entertainment capital is decidedly mixed, as celebratory feelings compete with resentment over the work stoppage and worries about the business era that is coming.
"People are excited -- thrilled -- to be getting back to work," said Jon Liebman, co-chief executive of Brillstein Entertainment Partners, a venerable Hollywood management firm. "But they are also mindful of some sobering challenges that lie ahead."
Analysts estimate that higher labor expenses will add 10 percent to the cost of making a show, and studios are expected to compensate by cutting back on production.
"Companies are not going to increase their budgets accordingly," said Jason E. Squire, editor of "The Movie Business Book" and host of a companion podcast. "They will compensate by making less. The end."
Hulu, for instance, expects the number of new shows it makes in 2024 to fall by about a third from 2022.
The Directors Guild of America also has a new contract that guarantees raises. And two more union contracts, both covering crews, come due in the next few months. Studios will either have to pay up or risk another shutdown. "READY for our contract fight next year," Lindsay Dougherty, lead organizer for Teamsters Local 399, recently said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Her branch represents more than 6,000 Hollywood workers, including truck drivers, location managers and casting directors.
Even before the strikes, Hollywood was swinging from boom times to austerity. Peak TV, the glut of new programming that helped define the streaming era, ended last year as Wall Street began pressuring streaming services to put a priority on profit over subscriber growth. TV networks and streaming platforms ordered 40 percent fewer adult scripted series in the second half of 2022 than they did in the same period in 2019, according to Ampere Analysis, a research firm.
Put another way, 599 adult scripted series were made last year. Some analysts predict that, by 2025, the annual number will be closer to 400, a roughly one-third decline. Even the most modest series employs hundreds of people, including agents, managers, publicists and stylists, who in turn fuel the broader economy.
"With the strike over, we're all staring down the barrel of a painful structural adjustment that predates the strike," Zack Stentz, a screenwriter with credits like "X-Men: First Class" and "Thor," wrote on X. "A lot of careers and even entire companies are going to go away over the next year." (He added, on a glass-half-full note: "This is also a time for clever little mammals to survive and even thrive in the new landscape. Your job is to be a clever mammal.")
The streaming profitability problem remains largely unsolved. Netflix and Hulu make money, and Warner Bros. Discovery has said its Max service will turn a profit by the end of the year. But Disney+, Paramount+, Peacock and others continue to lose money. Peacock alone will bleed $ 2.8 billion in red ink in 2023, Comcast said last month.
Most analysts say that there are too many streaming services and that the weakest will ultimately close or merge with bigger competitors.
The entertainment industry's underlying cable television and box office problems also remain dire, in some cases growing worse during the five months it took to restore labor peace.
Fewer than 50 million homes will pay for cable or satellite television by 2027, down from 64 million today and 100 million seven years ago, according to PwC, the accounting giant. In July, Disney announced that it was exploring a once-unthinkable sale of a stake in ESPN, the cable giant that has powered much of Disney's growth over the past two decades. Paramount Global's once-venerable cable portfolio, centered on Nickelodeon and MTV, has also been pummeled by cord cutting; Paramount shares have dropped nearly 50 percent since May.
The film business is also unsettled. Movies now arrive in homes (either through digital stores or on streaming) after as little as 17 days in theaters, compared with about 90 days, which had been the standard for decades.
Audiences have finally started to tire of Hollywood's prevailing movie business strategy -- endless sequels, each more bloated than the last -- with lackluster results for the seventh "Mission: Impossible" film, the fifth "Indiana Jones" installment and 11th "Fast & Furious" chapter as evidence.
Theaters are not dead, as blockbuster turnout for "Five Nights at Freddy's," "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour," "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" has shown. But ticket-buying data suggests a worrisome trend: People who were going to six to eight movies a year before the pandemic are now going to three or four. Even the most ardent fans of big-screen entertainment are paring back.
Cinemas in North America sold about $ 7.7 billion in tickets this year though October, a 17 percent decline from the same period in 2019.
There is more competition for leisure time; TikTok has 150 million users in the United States, a majority of them younger than 30, and the average time spent on the app is growing quickly.
Everywhere you look in Hollywood, or so it seems, businesses are trying to cut costs. Citing the strikes and "volatile larger entertainment marketplace," Anonymous Content, a production and management company, laid off 8 percent of its staff last month. United Talent Agency also trimmed its head count, as did several competing agencies.
DreamWorks Animation recently eliminated 4 percent of its work force, while Starz, the premium cable network and streaming service, is reducing head count by 10 percent. Netflix is restructuring its animation division, which is expected to result in layoffs and fewer self-made films.
Consider what is happening at Disney, which is widely considered the strongest of the old-line entertainment companies, partly because it is the largest.
Before the strikes, Disney had about 150 television shows and a dozen movies in production. But worries about streaming profitability and the decline of cable television have battered Disney's stock price. Shares have been trading in the $ 80 range, down from $ 197 two years ago. Sorting out ESPN's future is Disney's first priority, but the company is also selling holdings in India and weighing whether to part with assets like ABC; the Freeform cable channel; and a chain of local broadcast stations.
Disney is so vulnerable that the activist investor Nelson Peltz has made it known to The Wall Street Journal that he intends, for the second time in a year, to push for board seats. Disney fended off Mr. Peltz in February, partly by saying it would cut $ 5.5 billion in costs and eliminate 7,000 jobs. On Wednesday, Disney said that, in the end, it had cut $ 7.5 billion and more than 8,000 jobs. It added that it would continue to tighten its belt.
Phil Cusick, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, said of Disney in a note to clients in late September, "The company plans to make less content and spend less on what it does make."

Full text: Pop culture has conditioned us to believe that a meet-cute that doesn't happen in a bookstore is hardly worth having. But is being an avid reader truly essential to romance?
One of the first questions men ask Angela Liu on dating apps is "What are you reading?" The question is a softball for Ms. Liu, a self-proclaimed lover of literature. "I really care about the human condition and emotions and stuff," she said.
What she has noticed, however, is that many men aren't into those kinds of books, and a question that may have been intended to screen her often ends up backfiring.
"I can't stand dudes who just read self-help books or things specifically related to the job that they're doing and that's all they read," Ms. Liu, 27, said on Friday at a book club for singles in Manhattan.
There's something flirty and magnetic about a physical book that tablets and smartphones can't really capture -- the idea of meeting someone in a library, in the aisle of a bookstore or while reading on the subway, for instance, remains stubbornly high on the list of many people's romantic fantasies. Although there might be more romantic activities a single person could do on a Friday night in New York City, very few beat potentially stumbling into your next bibliophile boo while surrounded by shelf after shelf of sweet prose.
"I love when people have bookshelves, because I just go there immediately and stare at what they have," Ms. Liu said.
At a meeting of McNally Jackson's new After Hours Book Club (tag line: "Read, flirt, sip"), single attendees including Ms. Liu gathered at the bookseller's location in South Street Seaport, a former maritime hub turned shopping district in Lower Manhattan, for an evening of wine, beer and discussion about "Dogs of Summer," a novel by Andrea Abreu.
More than 20 people, a majority of them women, chatted in small groups about the book, a coming-of-age story of two girls in a working-class neighborhood of the Canary Islands during the summer of 2005. They were encouraged by the event's host, Mikaela Dery, to switch tables every 20 minutes or so to meet and interact with others. They also shared their thoughts on the connection between reading and romance.
Michael Hoang, 28, said he was motivated to attend the After Hours discussion partly because of the book selection and partly because of the event's name. He hasn't put much effort into dating, Mr. Hoang said, but the few people he has gone out with have not shared his interest and taste in books. As someone who reads mostly for beauty and occasionally for escapism, he considers himself biased toward fiction readers in terms of compatibility.
"Reading is a pretty decent self-selection in terms of mutual interest," he said. "So interactions with folks that I enjoy, romantic interest or otherwise, have usually been pretty good if there's a reading factor."
A fondness for books is a trait that many seek in a prospective romantic partner, almost to the point of cliché. It's the glue that connects the rival bookstore owners turned lovers in the romantic comedy "You've Got Mail"; it's present in the tiny bookshop where a bumbling Londoner charms a movie star in "Notting Hill"; it's part of what draws a love-struck stalker to imprint on his first victim in the Netflix thriller "You." Considering how pop culture has been spoon-feeding us this fantasy for decades, it's little wonder there's an appetite for it in real life.
Megan Mueller, a 24-year-old graduate student in architecture at Cornell University, said she usually she spent her Friday evenings hanging out with classmates. But they had the day off from school, so she took the opportunity to do something she ordinarily wouldn't after hearing about the After Hours Book Club on Instagram.
She said that a love of reading was preferable but not quite nonnegotiable when dating.
"I think I would have more to talk about and I would get along with them a little bit better," she said, "but it's not a deal breaker."
Ms. Mueller recalled a man she dated more than three years ago while she was an undergrad. After going to his apartment (it was "like a frat house," she said), she discovered he had no books. It didn't completely faze her, but it was something she noted.
"Everyone has different interests," she said over a glass of red wine and cocktail napkins printed with conversation starters. "I have friends that don't like to read or they'd rather listen to audiobooks or podcasts and stuff."
Still, the connection between reading and sex is well established. A popular tote bag from the Strand, a New York bookstore, advises, "If You Go Home With Somebody & They Don't Have Books," don't throw them a bone (though, as the line is attributed to John Waters, the full quotation uses spicier language). And we can't forget Instagram pages like @HotDudesReading, which once captivated the internet and was later turned into a book.
"There's a lot of cruising in bookstores," said Tom Rothacker, a college theater professor. "The Strand, the Drama Book Shop -- and it's predominantly women and gay men."
Kendall Erickson, an attendee of the After Hours Book Club who is an art director and has already logged about 50 books on her Goodreads account this year, said that, "just for fun," she maintained a list of books that she spotted people reading on the subway. This summer, she was riding the B62 bus from Whole Foods back to her home in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn when she noticed a man staring at her reading "Penance" by Eliza Clark and appeared to be into her, but neither of them made a move, so it was a missed connection.
"It was like, OK, we're still on the bus together for like 10 stops," she said. "And then finally he got off the bus. He was very cute." (In case he's reading this article, she added that he was wearing a beanie and was "kind of blond.")

Full text: A talk with the directors Jennifer Tiexiera and Camilla Hall about their film that checks in on the subjects of high-profile documentaries.
Being a documentary subject can be a thankless kind of stardom, without much control over how your life story is told. In "Subject," Jennifer Tiexiera and Camilla Hall went back to five famous documentaries and asked their stars about their experiences: "Hoop Dreams," "The Staircase," "Capturing the Friedmans," "The Square" and "The Wolfpack."
Rather than a "where are they now" update, Tiexiera and Hall investigate the unexpected personal ramifications and ethical quandaries that arise. Arthur Agee of "Hoop Dreams," for example, speaks of earning around $ 500,000 through profit-sharing.
I spoke with the filmmakers about what they learned, and their dauntingly extensive efforts at making "Subject" a full collaboration with their subjects. Below are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Whose documentary experience surprised you most?
JENNIFER TIEXIERA: I would say Margie's [as the daughter of a man tried for murder, Michael Peterson]. When you watch "The Staircase," you're caught up in the story and you're not thinking about this young girl whose face is now everywhere. She's truly been defined by that series for the last 20-some years now. Her story has been told and sold over and over and over again.
CAMILLA HALL: I think Margie got a comment saying the acting was better on the HBO show [the true-crime mini-series starring Colin Firth and Toni Collette] than the Netflix show [the documentary series]. I think Ahmed's journey in "The Square" is also so dramatic. Where Ahmed [Hassan] comes from in Cairo is a very underprivileged neighborhood. And he became the face of the Egyptian revolution!
Were there positive effects to participating in a documentary?
HALL: Susanne [Reisenbichler, the mother of the nearly housebound family in "The Wolfpack"] talks of how letting somebody in from the outside was the first time she fully understood her level of despair. I think she had just been living in this bubble for so long. That intervention had an enormously positive impact on her life and has led to her total independence. Now she's a domestic abuse support adviser.
Arthur was able to use the "Hoop Dreams" brand and has his own line of merchandise. Ahmed is an Emmy-winning cinematographer as a result of "The Square," and we were able to get him a visa to move to America because of that award.
How did you get people to open up?
HALL: I think we created a platform where their voice was the most important at the end of the day. They had final say over how they would be presented in "Subject." They were able to watch the rough cut of the film and give feedback. And there wasn't much coaxing. They knew exactly what they were doing -- it was almost like Margie directed her own scenes.
TIEXIERA: And they're co-producers, by D.P.A. [Documentary Producers Alliance] standards. When it came to what was very important to them, we adjusted their agreements to reflect that. Jesse [the son in "Capturing the Friedmans" who served 13 years in prison on child sexual abuse charges] wanted to be aware of the distribution: where this is going to go and who's going to see it.
We did reach out to a few people for "Subject" who weren't ready to go back into that place but still loved the idea. For example, Carole and Howard from "Tiger King" became supporters of "Subject." And Mark Borchardt [of "American Movie"] was a great sounding board.
Did you cut anything from "Subject" based on feedback from participants?
TIEXIERA: The biggest hurdle was when Susanne and [one of her sons] Mukunda agreed to be part of "Subject," and Mukunda's brothers did not want to be. They had had a different relationship and experience and didn't want to be on camera. I want to say it was a couple of weeks before our premiere, it came back that they did not want to be part of the archival [material]. So we had to re-cut the entire "Wolfpack" section and keep them out, except for one of the brothers who was OK with it. Legally, sure, we could have kept that. But it's just not what we were doing.
We also feature 112 films and series [in montages], and people have been able to see it and say, I don't like where my film is placed. We've been able to go back and take it out or move it to a different location.
Would you ever participate in a documentary about your life?
HALL: So, we are considering that in the series that we're developing at the moment.
TIEXIERA: If you would ask me this last year, I would say absolutely not. But as we develop the series with Time Studios, it's come up a few times. In the spirit of "Subject," the series would be a collaboration between the participants [in documentaries], and we would have the time to bring the directors' voices into it, and then we also reflect on the process while we're making it. It's very meta!

Actors Reach Tentative Deal To End Strike: [National Desk]

Full text: The agreement all but ends one of the longest labor crises in the history of the entertainment industry. Union members still have to approve the deal.
One of the longest labor crises in Hollywood history is finally coming to an end.
SAG-AFTRA, the union representing tens of thousands of actors, reached a tentative deal for a new contract with entertainment companies on Wednesday, clearing the way for the $ 134 billion American movie and television business to swing back into motion.
Hollywood's assembly lines have been at a near-standstill since May because of a pair of strikes by writers and actors, resulting in financial pain for studios and for many of the two million Americans -- makeup artists, set builders, location scouts, chauffeurs, casting directors -- who work in jobs directly or indirectly related to making TV shows and films.
Upset about streaming-service pay and fearful of fast-developing artificial intelligence technology, actors joined screenwriters on picket lines in July. The writers had walked out in May over similar concerns. It was the first time since 1960, when Ronald Reagan was the head of the actors' union and Marilyn Monroe was still starring in films, that actors and writers were both on strike.
The Writers Guild of America, which represents 11,500 screenwriters, reached a tentative agreement with studios on Sept. 24 and ended its 148-day strike on Sept. 27. In the coming days, SAG-AFTRA members will vote on whether to accept their union's deal, which includes hefty gains, like increases in compensation for streaming shows and films, better health care funding, concessions from studios on self-taped auditions, and guarantees that studios will not use artificial intelligence to create digital replicas of their likenesses without payment or approval.
SAG-AFTRA, however, failed to receive a percentage of streaming service revenue. It had proposed a 2 percent share -- later dropped to 1 percent, before a pivot to a per-subscriber fee. Fran Drescher, the union's president, had made the demand a priority, but companies like Netflix balked, calling it "a bridge too far."
Instead, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of entertainment companies, proposed a new residual for streaming programs based on performance metrics, which the union, after making some adjustments, agreed to take.
At 118 days, it was the longest movie and television strike in the union's 90-year history. SAG-AFTRA said in a terse statement that its negotiating committee had voted unanimously to approve the tentative deal, which will proceed to the union's national board on Friday for "review and consideration."
It added, "Further details will be released following that meeting."
Shaan Sharma, a member of the union's negotiating committee, said he had mixed emotions about the tentative deal, though he declined to go into specifics because the SAG-AFTRA board still needed to review it.
"They say a negotiation is when both sides are unhappy because you can't get everything you want on either side," he said, adding, "You can be happy for the deal overall, but you can feel a sense of loss for something that you didn't get that you thought was important."
Ms. Drescher, who had been active on social media during the strike, didn't immediately post anything on Wednesday evening. She and other SAG-AFTRA officials had come under severe pressure from agents, crew member unions and even some of her own members, including George Clooney and Ben Affleck, to wrap up what had started to feel like an interminable negotiation.
"I'm relieved," Kevin Zegers, an actor most recently seen in the ABC show "The Rookie: Feds," said in an interview after the union's announcement. "If it didn't end today, there would have been riots."
The studio alliance said in a statement that the tentative agreement "represents a new paradigm," giving SAG-AFTRA "the biggest contract-on-contract gains in the history of the union."
There is uncertainty over what a poststrike Hollywood will look like. But one thing is certain: There will be fewer jobs for actors and writers in the coming years, undercutting the wins that unions achieved at the bargaining table.
Even before the strikes, entertainment companies were cutting back on the number of television shows they ordered, a result of severe pressure from Wall Street to turn money-losing streaming services into profitable businesses. Analysts expect companies to make up for the pair of pricey new labor contracts by reducing costs elsewhere, including by making fewer shows and canceling first-look deals.
For the moment, however, the agreements with actors and writers represent a capitulation by Hollywood's biggest companies, which started the bargaining process with an expectation that the unions, especially SAG-AFTRA, would be relatively compliant. Early in the talks, for instance, the studio alliance -- Netflix, Disney, NBCUniversal, Apple, Amazon, Sony, Paramount, Warner Bros. -- refused to negotiate on multiple union proposals. "Rejected our proposal, refused to make a counter" became a rallying cry among the striking workers.
As the studio alliance tried to limit any gains, the companies cited business challenges, including the rapid decline of cable television and continued streaming losses. Disney, struggling with $ 4 billion in streaming losses in 2022, eliminated 7,000 jobs in the spring.
But the alliance underestimated the pent-up anger pulsating among the studios' own workers. Writers and actors called the moment "existential," arguing that the streaming era had deteriorated the working conditions and compensation for rank-and-file members of their professions so much that they could no longer make a living. The companies brushed such comments aside as union bluster and Hollywood dramatics. They found out the workers were serious.
With the strikes dragging into the fall and the financial pain on both sides mounting, the studio alliance reluctantly switched from trying to limit gains to figuring out how to get Hollywood's creative assembly lines running again -- even if that meant bending to the will of the unions.
"It was all macho, tough-guy stuff from the companies for a while," said Jason E. Squire, professor emeritus at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts. "But that certainly did change."
There had previously been 15 years of labor peace in Hollywood.
"The executives of these companies didn't need to worry about labor very much -- they worried about other things," Chris Keyser, a chair of the Writers Guild negotiating committee, said in an interview after the writers' strike concluded. "They worried about Wall Street and their free cash flow, and all of that."
Mr. Keyser continued: "They could say to their labor executives, 'Do the same thing you've been doing year after year. Just take care of that, because labor costs are not going to be a problem.' Suddenly, that wasn't true anymore." As a result of the strikes, studios are widely expected to overhaul their approach to union negotiations, which in many ways dates to the 1980s.
Writers Guild leaders called their deal "exceptional" and "transformative," noting the creation of viewership-based streaming bonuses and a sharp increase in royalty payments for overseas viewing on streaming services. Film writers received guaranteed payment for a second draft of screenplays, something the union had tried but failed to secure for at least two decades.
The Writers Guild said the contract included enhancements worth roughly $ 233 million annually. When bargaining started in the spring, the guild proposed $ 429 million in enhancements, while studios countered with $ 86 million, according to the guild.
For an industry upended by the streaming revolution, which the pandemic sped up, the tentative accord takes a meaningful step toward stabilization. About $ 10 billion in TV and film production has been on hold, according to ProdPro, a production tracking service. That amounts to 176 shows and films.
The fallout has been significant, both inside and outside the industry. California's economy alone has lost more than $ 5 billion, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Because the actors' union prohibited its members from participating in promotional campaigns for already-finished work, studios pulled movies like "Dune: Part Two" from the fall release schedule, forgoing as much as $ 1.6 billion in worldwide ticket sales, according to David A. Gross, a film consultant.
With labor harmony restored, the coming weeks should be chaotic. Studio executives and producers will begin a mad scramble to secure soundstages, stars, insurance, writers and crew members so productions can start running again as quickly as possible. Because of the end-of-year holidays, some projects may not restart until January.
Both sides will have to go through the arduous process of working together again after a searing six-month standoff. The strikes tore at the fabric of the clubby entertainment world, with actors' union leaders describing executives as "land barons of a medieval time," and writers and actors still fuming that it took studio executives months, not weeks, to reach a deal.
Workers and businesses caught in the crossfire were idled, potentially leaving bitter feelings toward both sides.
And it appears that Hollywood executives will now have to contend with a resurgent labor force, mirroring many other American businesses. In recent weeks, production workers at Walt Disney Animation voted to unionize, as did visual-effects workers at Marvel.
Contracts with powerful unions that represent Hollywood crews will expire in June and July, and negotiations are expected to be fractious.
"It seemed apparent early on that we were part of a trend in American society where labor was beginning to flex its muscles -- where unions were beginning to reassert their power," said Mr. Keyser, the Writers Guild official.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Scottish standup went viral for being the sole comic to go on the record in support of Russell Brand's accusers. He's made a career of finding humor in "things that we should not be laughing at."
The Scottish comedian Daniel Sloss likes to flout conventional humor.
His earliest Netflix special, "Dark," in 2018, was about the death of his younger sister when he was 8. He also has material about disability (his sister had cerebral palsy), mental illness and sexual assault. "I think there's ways for everything to be funny," he said in a video interview this week, before quickly clarifying, "I don't think everything should be joked about in every way."
Brutality on its own doesn't make a good punchline, he said. "The art is making the audience laugh at things that we should not be laughing at."
Sloss, 33, was the only comedian to speak on the record, using his real name, in the Channel 4 documentary about Russell Brand and in the accompanying newspaper investigation which detail the sexual assault allegations made by four women against the British actor and comic. That Sloss was the only performer to acknowledge the comedy scene's long-running rumors about Brand left him shaken, he said. (Brand has denied the allegations.)
In his 2019 HBO special "X," Sloss describes learning that a female friend of his was raped by another friend, part of a group of guys he had long been buddies with. The special -- in which he mostly jokes about his own shortcomings -- becomes an impassioned plea for all men to do more to call out and prevent misconduct. (He workshopped it with survivors of assault.) After the Brand investigation, clips from the show went viral.
Sloss, who performs at the New York Comedy Festival on Friday, grew up in an erudite household: His mother is a scientist who consults for the U.N. around clean energy, and his father is a programmer who also designs robotics. He started performing in clubs at 17, quickly rising through the ranks at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe to become an international touring star. He lives in Edinburgh with his wife and 21-month-old son, and now, much to his chagrin, does jokes about fatherhood.
Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
The way you talk about your upbringing, it seems like your family expressed love by roasting each other.
Yeah. That's just a very Scottish thing. The way you talk about yourself is self-deprecating. You have to take yourself down in Scotland, because if you don't, society will do it for you. Tall poppy syndrome exists here -- if you stick your head too far up and you're too proud. I've been brought down by the Scottish public several times over my career.
You found success early.
I was marketable: young, white, accent. Arguably good looking. I was confident. And I was decent. But a lot of it was right moment, right time, given opportunities that other people deserved.
How did you decide to turn to different material?
I think it was my fourth Fringe show when I decided to do darker jokes, stuff that wouldn't make it on television. And I think every day of that run, I watched about 15 or 20 people leave. That was never fun, but I was fine with it because I'm like, I stand behind everything I'm saying now. I will defend that this is funny.
The best standup, for me, is the sort that makes you think. I remember the first time I saw Jim Jefferies do his gun control routine. It's so funny, but it's made me think profoundly about it. And I could see it making people in the audience think.
You can get away with some of these things because people believe that you have a moral center.
Yes. I think there's something about being vulnerable to people -- it's honesty, and I think they see goodness in that.
When I did "Dark," the feedback was really good. I loved the silences. I loved the challenge of it. How am I going to make people laugh with the death of a 6-year-old disabled girl? How can you pull humor out of that? And the answer is the same way that my family pulled humor out of it. You don't laugh at the tragedy itself. You acknowledge the tragedy. And while looking around it, you can find things to make fun of, because the most powerful thing in the world is to laugh in the face of death.
You talk in "X" about learning the stats on how common, and underprosecuted, sexual assault and rape are after your friend, who gave you permission to discuss it, disclosed what happened to her. Did you wonder why more men don't learn about that? What made you want to talk about it?
Because me and the group of friends, we felt so stupid, man. He admitted it the second we confronted him -- which blew our minds. Looking back, there were plenty of signs, which we chose to ignore, because we put it down to banter, like, "Hey, he's just saying things that we all say."
Whenever "X" goes viral, I hate it, because it destroys the message of the show. They just take that 90-second clip, where it's me yelling at men. You cannot make men learn anything if you yell at them. And that sucks. It would be so nice if yelling at men worked; we could fix all of the problems. But it never works.
So I made sure the show is bringing men in. The whole point is that I'm a deeply flawed man. I have toxic traits; I've been toxic in the past. I am completely and utterly imperfect. But that doesn't make me a predator. I believe most men are good, and I want them to listen to me.
When we toured "X," I was really expecting some backlash from men. I was expecting walkouts. And every single night, without fail, I got DMs, emails, messages from men, like, "I sat beside my wife, I sat beside my daughter, my sister, my girlfriend. And when you started talking, I didn't realize how ignorant I had been, and I was mortified. And then after the show I spoke to the women in my life. They told me a story which broke my heart." It was so many men just coming to the same realization as me.
What did you make of the response to the Brand exposé and the fact that you were the only voice from the comedy world speaking in support of women?
I didn't know I was the only one. I'd seen the clip with me in it. But they hadn't shown me the context [that no one else came forward]. Devastating. I'm still processing it. To be honest with you, I'm still angry.
The focus should never have been about me, ever, at any point. The only reason was because I looked brave. And I was only brave by omission. I was only brave because other people were cowards.
Let's be honest: I did the bare minimum. I acknowledged a rumor that we had all heard. So that's why I thought so many people would do the bare minimum. They didn't, and then they just continued being like, "I wasn't asked." Well, you can still say something now. Like, just because you missed the starting pistol doesn't mean you don't finish the race. Join in!
You've said that becoming a father has made you a better person and a worse comedian.
Yes, but that's true for everyone. I don't know what it is. I think maybe it's such a higher level of empathy than you had before that it actually blunts your edges. I mean, I like pushing boundaries. But before I would certainly say callous things just for the sake of saying callous things.
I used to have a joke that would split the audience down the middle, and I loved that. And I now realize that it's because the joke was about harm happening to children. Before I was a parent, I found the joke very, very funny. And now I don't. And that makes me hate myself, because that means I'm a comedian who's offended by one of his own jokes.

Amid Mideast Violence, Food Can't Offer a Route to Peace: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A recent petition signed by nearly 900 food professionals calling for a cease-fire raises, once again, questions of contested cuisines.
Theirs was an unlikely friendship.
Reem Kassis, who was born in Jerusalem and lives in Philadelphia, left high-paying work as a management consultant to write cookbooks. She is Palestinian, and her book "The Palestinian Table," which she published in 2017, broke open a new national conversation about both the cuisine and the appropriation of its recipes.
Michael Solomonov, a chef who was born near Tel Aviv, was cooking Italian food in Philadelphia when a sniper killed his 21-year-old brother, an Israeli soldier who was patrolling on Yom Kippur. Mr. Solomonov, who is Jewish, dedicated himself to Israeli cuisine and opened Zahav in Philadelphia in 2008. The restaurant brought both him and Israeli food to national prominence, and he has since opened more than 20 restaurants.
Ms. Kassis nervously sent him a copy of her book. It shifted his perspective. The two became close friends, cooking together at his restaurant and in each other's homes. They appeared together in magazine articles about cooking for the holidays and at events examining the role of food in national identity.
But now, they aren't speaking.
"If anything," Ms. Kassis said, "my experience of late has confirmed for me that food diplomacy does not work and that you cannot solve problems like the Israeli occupation of Palestine over the proverbial plate of hummus. Anyone who claims that is deflecting from the real work that needs to be done, first of a cease-fire, but in general, freedom for and equal rights for all Palestinians."
Mr. Solomonov's restaurant and a handful of others that offer Israeli cuisine have been targeted for a boycott by a group calling itself the Philly Palestine Coalition, a new organization whose only public profile is on Instagram. (Ms. Kassis is not affiliated with the group.) He is not speaking publicly about the issue.
The war between Hamas and Israel has divided American cultural institutions, and now it is spilling into the food world. In this fraught moment, dishes like hummus have become weaponized like never before.
American scholars of Jewish food describe the country's cuisine as an amalgam of recipes brought to Israel by the global Jewish diaspora and merged with Middle Eastern food cooked by local Jews and Arabs. Some supporters of Palestine argue that Israeli cooks are colonizers who have adopted certain Arabic dishes as their own, and thus contribute to the erasure of Palestinian culture.
Nearly 900 chefs, farmers and others in the American food business have signed a pledge with an organization called Hospitality for Humanity, which a group of Palestinian chefs and political organizers began in October to push for a cease-fire and the end to U.S. support for Israel. They want to use a boycott of Israel-based food businesses and culinary events that promote Israel as one way to apply pressure.
Among the signatories are farmers, prominent chefs like Mason Hereford of Turkey and the Wolf in New Orleans, and food writers, including Helen Rosner of The New Yorker; the cookbook author and former New York Times food columnist Samin Nosrat; Stephen Satterfield, the founder of Whetstone magazine and the host of Netflix's "High on the Hog"; and Ms. Kassis, who has written for The Times.
Palestinian food businesses in the United States report having been flooded with one-star reviews online, and Israeli restaurants in a few cities beyond Philadelphia have been tagged for boycotts on social media.
"We tend to think of food as humanizing but when there is conflict, food becomes part of the conflict," said Ari Ariel, an associate professor at the University of Iowa who has written about and lectured on what he calls the Hummus Wars. The battle began in 2009, when Lebanon claimed Israel was trying to steal its national dish, turning the dip of sesame paste and chickpeas into an avatar of hostilities in the Middle East.
Lebanese officials sought to have the word hummus declared a protected designation in the European Union like Champagne or Parmigiano-Reggiano, and the tensions were made literal in a contest between Israel and Lebanon to make a tub of hummus big enough to break a world record. Lebanon took the title after spreading a 23,042-pound serving onto a giant ceramic plate in 2010.
"We have this romantic idea that if we eat the same food and break the same bread somehow we can come together, but that doesn't seem to be the case here," said Dr. Ariel, who is currently researching the origins of falafel.
Indeed, any hope for reconciling differences in what has been called hummus diplomacy appears to have been dashed.
Lia Ronnen is the publisher and editorial director of Artisan Books and Workman Publishing, whose catalog is heavy with design and cooking books. The argument that Israeli food is stolen Palestinian food is a false narrative about the myriad origins and traditions of Israeli food, she said. And, she added, targeting American businesses that serve Israeli food is dangerous and has antisemitic implications.
"The food community is enforcing a narrative that is factually wrong and fomenting violence against Jews in America. That is totally tragic," she said. "The food community is supposed to be a place that celebrates humanity and celebrates caring and celebrates truth."
In the wake of social justice movements like Black Lives Matter, questions about cultural appropriation, who owns a recipe and who can profit from certain cuisines have forced conversations and reflections in restaurant kitchens and food media.
The war has made these questions especially urgent, said Reem Assil, the Bay Area chef and speaker who has family in Gaza and started Hospitality for Humanity with other Palestinian chefs and political organizers who were feeling isolated and grieving.
In addition to applying economic pressure, the organization is encouraging people who make their living through food to speak out against the bombings and American aid to Israel.
"The culture follows food," Ms. Assil said. "Using food as a conduit for culture is a very powerful way of re-humanizing us."
Samir Mogannam, the chef and owner of Beit Rima in San Francisco, describes his restaurant as Arab comfort food. He joined Hospitality for Humanity, but said he doesn't support boycotting American restaurants serving Israeli food, pointing out that appropriating food from other cultures has happened throughout history.
"But if you are going to appropriate our food, give us credit," he said. "If you say Israeli cuisine is an eclectic cuisine that pulls inspiration from the Jewish diaspora and local Palestinians, that is more respectable. But appropriating our food and erasing our existence are two different things."
Naama Shefi, founder of the Jewish Food Society which archives recipes and the stories behind them as a way to preserve Jewish identity, has her doubts about whether food can build bridges at such a scary and dangerous junction.
"People need to educate themselves about the different cuisines, history and cultures of the region," she said. "I am trying to stay optimistic. I am a believer in the power of food to educate and connect and I will keep being a believer because if not, I don't know what's left for us."

So Many Strands of Streisand In Memoir Long in the Making: [Review]

Full text: MY NAME IS BARBRA, by Barbra Streisand
Hello, enormous.
Of course Barbra Streisand's memoir, 10 years in the making if you don't count the chapter she scribbled in longhand in the 1990s and then lost, was going to approach "Power Broker" proportions.
For one thing, she is -- fits of insecurity notwithstanding -- a bona fide power broker: tearing down barriers to and between Broadway, Hollywood, the recording industry and Washington, D.C., like Robert Moses on a demolition bender.
For another, as Streisand writes in "My Name Is Barbra," a 970-page victory lap past all who ever doubted, diminished or dissed her, with lingering high fives for the many supporters, she does tend to agonize over the editing process.
After adding back material to her version of "A Star Is Born" for Netflix in 2018 -- "I think I made it better. But did I? I'm never quite sure"-- she fantasized about new, fuller cuts of both "Funny Girl," which made her a movie star on arrival, and "Yentl," her debut as director. Planning her wedding to the actor James Brolin in 1998, she tried to winnow down a long list of desserts before deciding "We'll just have them all ... why not?"
It doesn't take a psychiatrist -- though Streisand, 81, has consulted many, played one in "The Prince of Tides" and even incorporated the therapeutic framework into one concert tour -- to figure out why she has taken such a big bite out of life. As recounted before in a flotilla of biographies, none authorized (and at least one tell-all by an early roommate, who was promptly ghosted), she grew up deprived both economically and emotionally in a housing project in Flatbush, Brooklyn. Instead of a doll she carried a hot-water bottle -- "I swear it felt more like a real baby than some cold doll" -- for which a sympathetic neighbor knitted a pink hat and sweater.
Such details may be familiar to fans, but for the most part they ring out more resoundingly in Streisand's chatty, ellipses-strewn telling. She may possess megawatt fame -- "a hollow trophy," she assures us -- but between these covers she's just Bubbe Barbra at a kitchen table, talking about fabrics and fellows who got fresh and "my first fur coat, sold to me as 'Zorina,' a.k.a. 'Alaskan sable,' but in reality ... skunk."
Her father, an educator from an Orthodox Jewish background, died at 35 after a head injury when Barbara, as they spelled it then, was 15 months old and her brother was 9. (She still has her father's copy of "Tales From Shakespeare" for children on her bedside table: "Who knows? Maybe he had bought it to read to me.")
Her mother remarried a man named Kind who was anything but, gave birth to another little girl, and had distinct Madame Rose undertones, crooning into a broomstick microphone and so forth. "Where are my presents?" she screamed at a Christmas gathering in 1964, by which time her older daughter had released the Top 40 hit "People" and appeared thrice in Vogue. "I'm the mother! She's nothing without me!"
That the film rights to "Gypsy" have slipped from Streisand's grasp after a prolonged tease seems one of showbiz's prosecutable crimes. (She even gobbles egg rolls, Mr. Goldstone!) Another: This book, which is adorned with more boldface names than there were sequins on the Arnold Scaasi pantsuit she wore to the Oscars in 1969, has no index. You kind of want to resurrect Spy magazine to make one, as it did for "The Andy Warhol Diaries."
Little Barbara suffered from undiagnosed tinnitus, possibly a bug God planted in her ear urging her to run the hell away from her family's dysfunction. She vowed to become a performer after seeing Susan Strasberg, the Method guru Lee's daughter, in "The Diary of Anne Frank" at the Cort Theater, later contriving a meeting with Strasberg Sr., who didn't intimidate her in the slightest. ("He reminded me of my uncle Irving.")
She also was swooning at the movies near Erasmus Hall High, where she was an honors student; her schoolmate Bobby Fischer, the future chess prodigy, "looked like some sort of deranged pilot from a 1940s movie," she presciently noted.
Streisand collected mentors who introduced her to books and records, and scratched up the money for classes in acting, pantomiming a chocolate chip and reading from Jean Anouilh's "Medea": "Why have you made me a girl?" Though she hates to fly, she longed to escape, and would become an expert criss-crosser of centuries and cultures onscreen.
But it was her shimmery, almost wholly intuitive singing, first at a gay bar and then at the Bon Soir supper club in Greenwich Village, that would first dazzle the public. She found the spotlight "warm and comforting," quickly lopped off that second "a" from her first name, and reminds us now that the second "s" in Streisand is soft, telephoning Tim Cook to get the pronunciation corrected on Siri.
The author salts "My Name Is Barbra," the title recycled from her 1965 TV special that itself cribbed the name of a Leonard Bernstein song, with Yiddishisms: tchotchkes (she likes pig ones); gonif, or thief (her ex-boyfriend Jon Peters); fakakta (what her then-agent David Begelman called the Isaac Bashevis Singer short story that was the basis for "Yentl").
Then there are the generous dollops of chutzpah. Besides sassing Strasberg, she somehow managed to resist all the advisers who told her to bob her long nose, ditch the thrift-store clothes and choose more standard numbers than, say, Harold Arlen's "A Sleepin' Bee," with lyrics by Truman Capote.
Nobody put Barbra in a corner. She clashed early with the prickly playwright and director Arthur Laurents, insisting she perform the secretary Miss Marmelstein's eponymous solo in "I Can Get It for You Wholesale" from a swivel chair."You're never going to make it, you know," he snarled at her, though the audience went wild for the sequence. "Never!" (They'd reunite later, on the massively successful picture "The Way We Were.")
A lot of men seemed to resent her drive. "I have more talent in my farts than you have in your whole body!" Walter Matthau told her on the set of "Hello, Dolly." Mike Wallace called her "totally self-absorbed" and made her cry on "60 Minutes."
But many more fell at her feet, including Marlon Brando, who rubbed them. The king of England has sipped Constant Comment from her cup. Pat Conroy, the "Prince of Tides" author, compared her to the goddess Athena. (Athena on Conroy's dancing: "Boy, he could really fling that tush around!") Stephen Sondheim rewrote lyrics for her.
Tabulating all the boyfriends and admirers -- "I thought we were going to have an affair," the married Mandy Patinkin tearily implored her during "Yentl," she writes -- might require a second index.
Though she has a reputation for being controlling (basically the definition of being a director), Streisand here stresses, convincingly if somewhat exhaustively, her spontaneity. Contra Ethel Merman, who famously declared herself Miss Bird's Eye when presented with new lyrics in rehearsals of "Call Me Madam," she believes "to freeze something is to kill it."
She wanted to print the words "this is a work in progress" on the back of her 1976 lieder album -- Glenn Gould loved it! -- an example of her dogged refusal to stay in one lane. "Come to think of it, I should put it on this book, too...."
Future editions, then, might excise some of the long block quotes of praise from her peers, like the one purportedly from Tennessee Williams collected by an interviewer whose veracity was questioned by Helen Shaw in The New Yorker. Not to get too Laurents about it, but Streisand maybe could have used a trusted collaborator, a J.R. Moehringer or even a J.J. Hunsecker, to rein in some indulgences, like long lists of boldface friends at later-career concerts.
There's something exuberant and glorious, though, about Streisand's photo dump of self-portraits and party pics. Indeed about this whole dragged-out banquet of a book. You might not have the appetite to linger for the whole thing, but you'll find something worth a nosh.
There are just so many scintillating Streisands to contemplate over so many years: singer, actress, director, producer, philanthropist, activist, lover, mother, wife, friend, autobiographer. "I would make a very good critic," she suggests at one point, and as I struggle to put a button on this, all I can reply is: Barbra, be my guest.

Perhaps the best advice ever given in a western came courtesy of a journalist in John Ford's "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance": "When the legend becomes fact, print the legend." The words ring particularly wise when verifiable facts are scarce, as is the case with the subject of the new series "Lawmen: Bass Reeves" (premiering Sunday on Paramount+).
Reeves, a Black deputy U.S. marshal, became, well, a legend policing the Indian Territory (most of which is now Oklahoma) and neighboring areas, including Texas and Arkansas, following the Civil War. Did he once shoot off an outlaw's belt buckle? That sure sounds cool. Might he have been the inspiration for "The Lone Ranger"? Reeves, played in the series by David Oyelowo, wore a mask, had a Native American sidekick, and was known to pass out silver dollars, rather than silver bullets. Some like this theory; others see it as a pile of convenient coincidences.
For Chad Feehan, who created the series under the umbrella of Taylor Sheridan's production empire, such questions were a challenge, as he looked to fill in details of the hero's under-documented life. They were also an inspiration, fuel for Feehan's imagination as he looked to weave a ripping western yarn around a man whose feats were remarkable, even though only some can be fact-checked.
Feehan said he heard stories about Reeves when he was growing up in Fort Worth. "They were campfire-esque tales akin to the dime-novel hero, the gunslinging lawman pursuing the most hardened outlaws in the Wild West," he said in a video interview from his Los Angeles office. "Then there was the fact that he was one of the first Black law enforcement officials in this country. It was all wrapped up in the myth of the man, and those stories never left my brain."
Reeves was born into slavery in Arkansas, and he accompanied George Reeves, the son of his owner, into battle as a body servant when George fought for the Confederacy. He is said to have beaten up George Reeves in a dispute over a card game -- an incident dramatized in the series -- and fled to begin life as a farmer. Much like Nathaniel (Natty) Bumppo, the hero of the frontier novelist James Fenimore Cooper's "Leatherstocking Tales," Reeves built a reputation as a man who knew Native Americans; in the first few episodes of the series we see Oyelowo's Reeves converse in Creek and Choctaw.
We also see him use a rifle like an extra limb; as Feehan puts it, "he was the Michael Jordan or Tom Brady of marksmanship." Reeves won so many turkey shoots he was eventually barred from competing. His skills as a communicator and gunman, and his reputation for integrity and unflappability, led Federal Judge Isaac C. Parker (played by Donald Sutherland) to enlist Reeves as a deputy U.S. marshal, apprehending outlaws in some of the most treacherous parts of the Southwest, primarily in the former Indian Territory.
"During the Civil War, Bass learned the lay of the land of the Indian Territory like a cook knows their kitchen," said Art T. Burton, author of the Reeves biography "Black Gun, Silver Star: The Life and Legend of Frontier Marshal Bass Reeves" (which is where the Lone Ranger theory took root). "He learned all types of techniques of tracking, and he mastered rifle and pistol during that time," Burton said. He added that Reeves also learned the language and culture of many Native American tribes. In Episode 3 of "Lawmen," Bass arrests the young Cherokee outlaw Billy Crow (Forrest Goodluck) and takes a liking to him, later making him his assistant, or posse man.
Burton heard stories of Reeves when he would visit relatives in Oklahoma, and he became determined to learn more. Reeves has that effect on people. Curiosity spikes at the mention of a Black lawman living by his rifle and his wits during Reconstruction. Reeves wasn't the first or only Black marshal of the period, but he became the most famous.
Sidney Thompson caught the Reeves bug when he saw Morgan Freeman describing Reeves as his dream role in a TV interview. (It was widely reported last year that Freeman was developing his own Bass Reeves series, "Twin Territories," for Amazon.) "I didn't really know African Americans were even allowed to touch a gun in the 1800s," said Thompson, who teaches creative writing and African American literature at Texas Christian University. Thompson -- like Burton, like Freeman -- became obsessed, and his obsession led him to write the trilogy of novels that became the basis for "Lawmen: Bass Reeves."
For Jewel Coronel, who wrote the second episode of the season, the offer to help tell Reeves's story was almost too good to be true. Coronel, who traces her family tree back to 17th-century Virginia, saw the series as an opportunity to honor her ancestors.
"For Black people, whenever we're able to historically contextualize these largely hidden historical figures in the modern day, be it in mythology or reality, it's inspiring," she said in a video interview. "As a Black woman, being able to tell this story with Taylor Sheridan is a big deal. My ancestors would almost see that as handing me a badge."
Throughout the process loomed the challenge of shaping fact and myth into a coherent whole. Though depictions of Reeves are more popular than ever -- he was a supporting character, played by Delroy Lindo, in the 2021 Netflix western "The Harder They Fall," and Jamal Akakpo portrayed him in HBO's 2019 series "Watchmen" -- he made his name at a time when Black westerners were often written out of history books. It seems telling that the series is based on a work of historical fiction, a genre that isn't required to dot every "i" and cross every "t."
Burton recalled trying to get information on Reeves from a historical society in Muskogee, Okla., the city where Reeves died, only to be told the organization did not keep records of Black people. Burton's book is deeply researched, yet its most memorable lines ring like tall tales passed down through generations. (One interviewee told Burton that Reeves "could shoot the left hind leg off a contented fly sitting on a mule's ear at a hundred yards and never ruffle a hair.")
For Coronel, navigating the line between fact and fiction was part of the fun.
"It's nice to have that breadth of unknown because it allowed us all to have a perspective," she said. "I enjoy a little bit of unknown because you have to make it dramatic. You have to make it a little messy."

Full text: I'm a technology reporter based in Washington, D.C. In a time of fast technological change, I am indulging in art and ideas that slow down the world and remind me of what makes us human. Here are the five things I've read, watched, heard and seen.
The Overstory
I've been listening while walking to this sweeping Richard Powers novel on our relationship to trees. In my opinion, this is the best way to take in the book's themes of humanity, belonging and our place in nature. I'm now looking at the towering old-growth oaks and maples in my neighborhood with new curiosity.
Desert Island Discs
I discovered this BBC radio staple during the pandemic and haven't stopped listening. The clever conceit -- what recordings would you bring to a desert island and why -- has gotten Yoko Ono, Daniel Radcliffe, Steve McQueen and hundreds of others to reveal details about their lives and what moves them.
Normal People
I didn't even think of picking up my phone while watching this gorgeous adaptation of Sally Rooney's novel. It moved me with its unadorned dialogue, slow pacing and the chemistry between its lead actors. The themes are common ones: love, class, belonging. But its beauty is in its spareness and patience.
Hidden Brain
I get into the geeky social-science takes on human behavior in this podcast hosted by Shankar Vedantam. It tries to apply research and data to nebulous ideas like why no one ever feels rich (even the rich) and why marriage has become so difficult. I'm not always convinced, but it can challenge my assumptions.
Ali Wong
Seeing her at the Kennedy Center was a totally different experience from watching her Netflix shows. Now divorced, Ali Wong puts it all out there, including unfiltered details of her dating life. This was my first live comedy show in years and I was reminded how much I love being in a loud and joyous audience. IRL, try it.

Actors' Union Receives 'Best and Final' Offer From Studios: [National Desk]

Full text: SAG-AFTRA, which has been on strike for 114 days, did not give a timeline for when it would respond.
The negotiating committee of the actors' union, SAG-AFTRA, told its members on Saturday that it had received a "Last, Best and Final Offer" from the major entertainment studios as a strike that has brought much of Hollywood to a standstill continued for a 114th day.
"We are reviewing it and considering our response within the context of the critical issues addressed in our proposals," the negotiating committee said. They did not say when they would respond to the offer, which came after an hourlong video conference call that included top studio executives.
Included in the offer was a wage increase that could be the highest in four decades, according to a person familiar with the offer who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. The studios also offered the actors a new way to determine residuals for streaming programs based on performance metrics, and protections on artificial intelligence, including consent and compensation requirements. The studios also offered an increase to the pension and health funds.
The virtual meeting on Saturday featured the largest group of top entertainment executives yet to engage with the negotiating committee, underscoring the urgency with which the studios want to return to work in an effort to salvage the fall television season and ensure next summer's theatrical box office will not be disrupted.
Four executives have spearheaded the talks: NBCUniversal's Studio Group chairwoman and chief content officer, Donna Langley; the Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos; the Disney chief executive Robert A. Iger; and Warner Bros. Discovery's chief executive, David Zaslav. They were joined by the Paramount Pictures chief executive Brian Robbins; the co-chairs of entertainment for Disney, Dana Walden and Alan Bergman; Mike Hopkins and Jennifer Salke from Amazon Studios; the Sony Pictures chairman Tony Vinciquerra; and Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg of Apple Studios.
The entertainment business has been at a standstill for months because of strikes by writers, who walked out in May, and actors, who joined them in July. The writers' strike was resolved a little over a month ago, but the actors' work stoppage has continued to grind on, leaving thousands out of work for close to six months.

Work From Home Isn't Always Good: [Letter]

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "The Five-Day Office Week Is Over," by Nicholas Bloom (Opinion guest essay, Oct. 22):
Mr. Bloom writes that Americans work about one-third of their workdays at home and that remote work has become normal. He names benefits: savings of time and money spent getting to work and flexibility for parents.
But this is true only for a fraction of Americans; many essential kinds of work cannot be done remotely as effectively or at all. Consider teachers (which I am), health care providers, people who work in service jobs and many others.
Economic and status hierarchies that pervade our society are widened by the sharp divide between those who can do their work remotely and those who cannot. I wonder also about the continued erosion of the social fabric as people interact less across differences and spend more time in their own environments.
As helpful as Zoom is, it is no substitute for being in spaces with others across the day. Even when interacting with others in person is challenging, without it we are likely to become more and more isolated and sealed in narrower circles of relationships and communication.
When we look around at what is happening in this country and around the world, is this really a good direction to be heading?
Deborah Loewenberg Ball
Ann Arbor, Mich.
To the Editor:
Nicholas Bloom gushes that the work-from-home revolution is "profoundly positive for the majority of America's businesses and workers" and that "remote work has been good for almost everyone involved."
But he ignores the greatest losers in this game of empty office chairs: the commercial property owners and their lenders who are sitting with partly empty buildings in almost all major U.S. cities.
More and more office users are reducing their office space requirements, new leasing has slowed to a crawl, and even when leases are consummated they come with large landlord concessions that drive down the net effective value of the leases.
When combined with rising interest rates, tightened lender requirements and dropping cash flow, the reduced office occupancy is pushing commercial real estate to the wall. If this leads to a spate of loan defaults and owners handing over the keys to lenders we will see a number of banks and other real estate lenders in grave economic danger, which will have a significant effect on the wider economy.
When seen from the perspective of commercial real estate owners and lenders, work-from-home is hardly the "win-win-win" that Mr. Bloom so blithely extols. Like the bank defaults of times past, this could turn into a losing proposition for all of us.

The Mideast Carnage Continues
To the Editor:
The carnage continues in the Middle East, and both Israel and Hamas have vowed to exterminate each other, which are unrealistic goals. As long as the leadership of both sides show no will whatsoever to work for peace, peace will be an elusive pipe dream.
Both sides need new leadership, new direction, new perspective. Right now they can't even agree to a pause or a cease-fire to help with humanitarian aid.
Moderate voices from both sides are needed, and until they can work toward a true two-state solution, well, it's continued senseless carnage, ad nauseam.

Punishing Lawyers for Misconduct
To the Editor:
Re "Trump's Lawyers Should Have Known Better," by Jesse Wegman (Opinion, nytimes.com, Oct. 27):
Mr. Wegman correctly describes the recent history of legal ethics in the United States, dating to Watergate. However, I must disagree with him and Prof. Stephen Gillers that lawyers rarely face punishment for their transgressions.
Every state has adopted a written code of ethics and established an independent professional responsibility board. Supported by annual bar dues, these agencies investigate and prosecute cases of lawyer misconduct, and they do so robustly and impartially. The days of the legal "club" are long over.
Joseph Berman
Boston
The writer is general counsel for the Board of Bar Overseers of Massachusetts and former president of the National Council of Lawyer Disciplinary Boards.
To the Editor:
The headline on Jesse Wegman's excellent article obscures one critical thing. Donald Trump's lawyers did know better, as did Nixon's. The problem was not that they did not know; it was that they did not care.
That is the problem that the legal profession and the public face.
Don Doernberg

Trump Fraud Trial
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Son Denies Ties to Reports on Finances" (news article, Nov. 2), about Donald Trump Jr.'s testimony in a fraud case:
I ask you ... where can I find a job as an executive vice president of a company without having to know anything about the company's financial statements?

Health Care Burnout
To the Editor:
Re "Burnout Among Health Care Workers Soared After Pandemic Hit, C.D.C. Finds" (news article, Oct. 26):
We appreciate the growing recognition that supporting the mental health and well-being of the health care work force has reached a crisis point and requires both individual and systemic interventions. Fortunately, there are concrete actions that individuals and organizations can take.
For example, one of the often cited reasons health care workers express hesitation in seeking mental health services is perceived professional repercussions.
Many health care leaders and state medical boards are removing stigmatizing language regarding mental health care from health system credentialing and state licensure applications to help address this -- but not enough.
We encourage every individual, licensing board and health system that has made public commitments to supporting health care work force well-being to review, and revise as necessary, how questions related to seeking mental health care are asked within their organizations and by their state medical board.
We believe that this action would remove at least this specific barrier to seeking mental health care for a vast number of physicians and nurses in the United States.

Hasan Minhaj, Truth and Comedy
To the Editor:
"Hasan Minhaj Addresses Embellished Stories Detailed by The New Yorker" (Arts, nytimes.com, Oct. 26) covers the backlash to Mr. Minhaj's artistic liberties in his comedy specials. While I understand getting mad, doing so misses the point. When I buy a ticket at a stand-up show, I'm not paying for news. I'm paying to laugh.
Mr. Minhaj changed some details about real-life events to make difficult stories understandable and entertaining. Critics cite his participation in "The Daily Show" and the Netflix show "Patriot Act," but this doesn't mean that every performance of his must be factual news. In stand-up, if it's funny, it's fair game. They're different formats, and audiences can tell the difference.
When poets or authors or painters evoke emotional responses to real-life issues as effectively as Mr. Minhaj did, they're celebrated for their brilliance. Why is it suddenly wrong when it's a comedian?

Full text: This documentary from Thom Zimny tracks Sylvester Stallone's life and career, though focuses too much on "Rocky" and "Rambo."
"An actor is what he looks like," Sylvester Stallone told The New York Times in 1976, and more than most stars, Stallone has been viewed as an action figure come to life. In "Sly," the director Thom Zimny excavates the acts of self-creation behind a career that minted two indelible titular characters in "Rocky" and "Rambo" -- whose underdog narratives proved highly influential.
"Sly" kicks off with Stallone, now 77, lamenting how life whizzes by, followed by a montage set to Gang of Four's sizzling "To Hell with Poverty." Made in collaboration with Stallone's production company, Balboa Productions, the film doesn't go on to become an exposé. But it does dwell on his being the son of a violently abusive father, growing up in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan before a series of moves.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
His resulting desire for approval is par for the course among star biographies, but that hurt and his father's vicious jealousy become the most poignant aspects in the film's increasingly predictable path. Stymied in the 1970s by stereotypes about his looks and voice, Stallone essentially became his own hero by writing screenplays, soon manifesting success when "Rocky" (1976), which he wrote, won the best picture Oscar over "Taxi Driver," "All the President's Men," "Network" and "Bound for Glory."
What ensues in this documentary is largely a pop-psychologized tour through the "Rambo" and "Rocky" sequels, with the odd outlier. Quentin Tarantino, a Stallone superfan; Frank Stallone, Sylvester's brother; Talia Shire (Adrian herself); and Wesley Morris, a Times culture critic, offer commentary -- with Arnold Schwarzenegger (who also recently got the Netflix documentary treatment) playing hype man.
But Stallone's flair for words -- and his references to Arthur Miller's "A View from the Bridge" and the 1968 dynastic drama "The Lion in Winter" -- make one wish he'd talked about much more than his greatest hits and misses.

Full text: A feisty Adèle Exarchopoulos does the heavy lifting in this otherwise uninspired action-comedy set in France.
"Wingwomen" is the rare French action movie directed by a woman, Mélanie Laurent, the breakout star of "Inglourious Basterds" turned filmmaker in her native France. Laurent's seventh feature, a girl-power spectacle, purports to be a naughtier version of "Charlie's Angels" -- its leading three ladies party, smoke and have vigorous libidos -- so it's too bad these spicier elements are muted by the film's flat tone and derivative style.
Laurent also stars as the film's veteran thief, Carole, a steely, chiseled blonde. Her bestie, and No. 2, is Alex (Adèle Exarchopoulos), an expert sniper and an unabashed flirt whom the older Carole recruited years ago for a diamond heist. Now a seasoned crime team, Carole is the brains, Alex the muscle. The duo eventually gains a third leg with Sam (Manon Bresch), a racecar driver.
Among the three gals, Alex does the heavy lifting on all fronts: She performs most of the kills, and she's also -- thanks to a feisty, potty-mouthed Exarchopoulos -- the source of the film's grit, sensuality and humor. In one scene, she bluntly fast-tracks a flirtation into a romp in the sack, which evolves into a moonlit fight scene with a peeping-Tom hit man. Alex gets bruised and bloodied, but so does the meathead baddie. It's one of the few moments when the film's feminist beatdowns feel genuinely triumphant: Alex shifts seamlessly from coy playgirl to seasoned killer, and she's deliciously blasé about her body count, in both senses of the word.

Yet "Wingwomen" isn't just about Alex, which is a problem because Exarchopoulos is the only player whose charisma shines through the plot's mechanical proceedings. Carole discovers she's pregnant and wants out of the crime life, triggering the conflict: Godmother, a Sapphic mob boss played by Isabelle Adjani, says she will grant Carole her exit only if the ladies head to Corsica to steal a painting.
Competent, unremarkable action scenes -- a low-stakes motorcycle chase off the island coastline, a brief shootout in a woodland fortress -- come together with ironic comic beats and snippy back-and-forths among the women. (The comedian Philippe Katerine occasionally steps in, too, as the Bosley-like intermediary Abner.)
There's something about the Netflix touch, especially in action-comedies (see "Gunpowder Milkshake," "Red Notice" or "Spenser Confidential"), that zaps the life out of even the silliest kinds of fun -- and the curse clearly extends to its overseas productions, too. The Frenchwomen twist on the supersquad action movie has its charms, but it's not enough to eclipse the script's uninspired angles. In one subplot, Alex takes revenge on the Serbian hit men who killed her bunny (echoing the pet vengeance in "John Wick"); and Carole's connection to Godmother is mildly erotic, like a dozen other contract criminals who can't shake their obsessive bosses.
Using tropes isn't necessarily a bad thing, but "Wingwomen" fails to employ them creatively and on its own terms. Change the dubbing to English, and the movie could be any other Hollywood blockbuster.

Stubborn and Valiant in a Swim Cap: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Annette Bening plays the long-distance swimmer Diana Nyad as a woman who doesn't pity herself. Neither does the film.
"Nyad" is about an athlete creating her own lore. Diana Nyad (Annette Bening) is proud that her last name stems from the naiads of Greek mythology. "My ancestors! The nymphs that swam in the lakes and the rivers and the ocean," Diana trumpets to everyone in earshot. A record-breaking long-distance swimmer, she's got the lung capacity of a real blowhard. Her ever-patient best friend, Bonnie (Jodie Foster), spends this exuberant and enervating biopic cutting Diana off mid-crow. Braggadocio takes you far in politics or business; jocks, however, have to prove it in sweat. And so, at 60, Diana vows to conquer the challenge that bested her at age 28. She'll swim nonstop from Cuba to Florida -- over two days of sharks, storms, stinging jellyfish and hallucinatory exhaustion. For most of this riveting crowd-pleaser, she fails.
"I'm either a stubborn fool," the real Diana Nyad wrote in "Find a Way," her 2015 memoir, "or I'm a valiant warrior." The film, in its first minutes, prefers the latter, opening with a rat-a-tat montage of her many successes: author, linguist, Phi Beta Kappa scholar. I groaned. Please, not an inspirational advertorial about women and aging and grit -- the artificial saccharine Diana had to use to peddle her story to corporations who might sponsor her repeated attempts.
To my relief, the directors Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, working with the screenwriter Julia Cox, trace Diana's mythic roots not just to the naiads, but to zealots like Captain Ahab. Vasarhelyi and Chin specialize in documentaries ("Free Solo, "Meru") about extreme outdoorsmen whose feats require a misery threshold, and a self-centered monomania, that few can understand. Chin, a mountaineer himself, gets that mind-set -- and Vasarhelyi, his longtime filmmaking partner and wife, also knows the strain these adventurers put on the loved ones providing emotional support. Cheerleading can tip over into feeling complicit in their potential death.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Bening, who has a convincing sidestroke, shows us a woman willing to endure Hell. I've never seen a performance with this little vanity in service of a character drowning in her own ego. "Everyone should have a superiority complex," Diana says, but the line comes at a point in the film where her superiority looks a lot like martyrdom. We've already witnessed her skin blistered by sunburn, her eyes and lips swollen into monstrous bulges, her face and neck lashed with tentacle burns, and her body, coiled on the floor, vomiting -- or worse, still in the surf, but so weak and semiconscious and sleep-deprived that she's paddling in place, suffering agonies without an inch of progress. Hubris keeps her afloat. But it also forces her to jump back into the water.
Diana doesn't pity herself, so neither does the film. Instead, the audience's empathy is rerouted to Diana's support team, particularly her weary navigator, John (Rhys Ifans), forever crouched over a map of sea currents, and the film's second lead, Bonnie, her head coach who is, in essence, a temperature-controlled Jacuzzi overlooking Hurricane Diana. A former racquetball champion and, briefly, Diana's ex, Bonnie has long since forgiven her friend's flaws. Their scenes together capture decades of camaraderie in effortless shorthand. Though this is Vasarhelyi and Chin's first narrative feature, they're good with actors -- although, in fairness, casting Bening and Foster (and their four Oscar nominations each) is like arriving at the poker table with a pair of aces. You get everything about the pair in an early scene when Bonnie throws her best pal the surprise birthday party that she swears she doesn't want (but, of course, does) only to be ratted out at the door when Diana squints, "Did you blow-dry your hair?"
The film switches tones choppily. There's a scene where a character coughs once and immediately announces that they're terminally ill. When the swimming is rough, the editing froths into a horror movie with Diana haunted by visions of her sexually abusive childhood coach, Jack Nelson (Eric T. Miller); later, in a halcyon stretch, the film becomes a semi-animated phantasmagoria with Diana posing under the waves like Esther Williams above an imaginary Taj Mahal, colorful fish swirling about her ankles. Diana wants our respect -- and by the end of the movie, she's earned it. While she's one of the prickliest protagonists you'll see this year, she's so raw and earnest and unapologetically herself that you adore her anyway -- from the safe distance of the screen. But weep for her neighbors, who she wakes up every day at dawn with a bugle blast of "Reveille."

Full text: Our TV critic recommends an lush nature documentary, an aesthetically ambitious comedy special and a distinctive Swedish dramedy.
This weekend I have ... an hour, and I want something nutritious.
'Planet Earth III'
When to watch: Saturday at 8 p.m., on BBC America or AMC+.
When "Planet Earth" premiered in the United States in 2007, it was a huge deal -- I still remember walking home one night and noticing every TV that glowed through a window seemed to be tuned to the same ocean episode. Since then, sumptuous, epic nature documentaries have proliferated, and televised opportunities to be hypnotized by the majesty of nature abound. Now the third installment is here, as gorgeous and immersive as ever, and reaffirming the franchise's spot at the top of the genre. Things kick off with "Coasts" -- "coasts are on the front line," David Attenborough says -- and segments include seals collectively ganging up on a shark, a turtle resting its head on a rock and drooling in exhaustion and a vulnerable flock of flamingos.
... an hour and I want stand-up.
'Zainab Johnson: Hijabs Off'
When to watch: Now, on Amazon.
This new stand-up special from the comedian Zainab Johnson covers the difficulties of dating, the role of candy in child abduction, how Harlem has changed and the perils of keeping a journal in a household with 13 children. She has a patient rhythm that belies the tightness of each segment and adds levity to some dark topics. This is also one of the more aesthetically ambitious specials in recent memory; Johnson performs in the round, and the lushness of the visual language creates a sense of a festive grandeur.
... two hours, and I want something happy-sad.
'Tore'
When to watch: Now, on Netflix.
William Spetz created and stars in this Swedish dramedy (in Swedish, with subtitles, or dubbed) about Tore, a 27-year-old with a failure to launch, though he says he's perfectly happy living at home and working at his father's mortuary. But in the first episode, his beloved father dies, and now he has to launch wether he wants to or not. Tore bounces between wild denial (working extra hard, avoiding caring for his father's dog) and broad attempts to spread his wings (befriending a drag queen, cultivating a crush on a cute florist). If you like distinctive delayed-coming-of-age stories, watch this.

Turning Heads in Mystery, Not Another Pretty Face: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ewa Juszkiewicz's paintings depict well-dressed women whose faces are hidden by mushrooms, textiles and wild hairdos.
Ewa Juszkiewicz was staring at a portrait of Katarzyna Starzenska, a Polish aristocrat and social fixture, completed in 1804.
"She had many romances," Ms. Juszkiewicz said. "She was partying a lot. She was basically an influencer."
"Other women all wanted to dress like her," she said.
The small painting by François Gérard, which presents Starzenska in a black dress and red shawl, was displayed at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, a museum that was once the home of Polish monarchs.
"I think her black dress is velvet," Ms. Juszkiewicz said. "The red shawl -- probably cashmere? Cashmere had become popular at that time."
Ms. Juszkiewicz, 39, a surrealist painter, had come to the museum on a morning in late September to get another look at the likeness of Starzenska, whose life Ms. Juszkiewicz had studied before painting her own version of the portrait, though not exactly.
At almost 10 feet tall, Ms. Juszkiewicz's version is much larger than the original. And in it, Starzenska's head is wrapped entirely in white, black and red fabrics, with a sprig of leaves sticking out of the top.
The piece, "In a Shady Valley, Near a Running Water (after François Gérard)," is one of nine new oil paintings by Ms. Juszkiewicz in a solo exhibition opening on Nov. 3 at the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills, Calif. Most are re-creations of specific paintings of women from the 18th and 19th centuries.
While Ms. Juszkiewicz has faithfully reproduced many aspects of the older paintings, including their subjects' clothes, she has obscured the faces of the women in her portraits. Some appear swathed in fabrics, while others are covered by plants or phantasmagoric hairdos that are inspired by the elaborate hairstyles and wigs worn in the eras when her source material was originally produced.
The paintings Ms. Juszkiewicz is showing at Gagosian are part of a series of portraits she has made. Some, like "Ginger Locks" (2021), which shows a woman in a teal dress with a Gordian-knot-like mass of copper hair covering her face, are not based on specific paintings.
In October, Louis Vuitton started selling a $ 10,500 bag bearing a print of "Ginger Locks." The original painting was bought by the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami. (Louis Vuitton declined to provide the terms of its contract with Ms. Juszkiewicz for the bag.)
Ms. Juszkiewicz said her approach is meant to heighten what she called "the absurdity" of period portraiture of women, particularly the way in which female subjects were often depicted with similar features, like polite eyes, pink cheeks, porcelain complexions and perfect coifs.
Ms. Juszkiewicz described those features as a sort of "mask" that brought uniformity, not individuality, to period portraits. She said that by covering the heads of subjects in her paintings with textiles and hair -- or sometimes with fungi, fruit or bugs -- she is asking viewers to consider women as individuals and as more than pretty faces.
Derek Blasberg, 41, the executive editor of Gagosian Quarterly, a magazine published by the gallery, said Ms. Juszkiewicz's paintings are "saturated in style." Their owners include Giancarlo Giametti, a founder of Valentino.
Mr. Blasberg, a regular at fashion events, compared her portraits to other stylized historical reinterpretations, like Sofia Coppola's film "Marie Antoinette" and the Netflix series "Bridgerton."
"They are both sort of celebrating and also critiquing that era and definitely that moment in fashion," he said of Ms. Juszkiewicz's paintings and of "Bridgerton."
Ms. Juszkiewicz said her work has required her to study fashion across periods of time. Occasionally, she has incorporated contemporary clothing and accessories into paintings, like a pair of goldtone hoop earrings that she bought secondhand.
In her studio in Warsaw, she uses reference materials including a 100-year-old copy of "The History of French Women's Costume: Fashions of the Middle Ages," the catalog from the Brooklyn Museum's 2014 exhibit "Killer Heels: The Art of the High-Heeled Shoe," and books on Frida Kahlo, Annie Leibovitz and Cindy Sherman.
Ms. Juszkiewicz also studies the runway. "I look at details," she said. "The fabrics, their textures, the silhouettes." A pink dress embellished with a flowing red ribbon from Simone Rocha's spring 2024 collection recently caught her eye, as did the inverted tulle gowns from Viktor & Rolf's couture show in January.
She also cited the designers Alexander McQueen, Iris van Herpen and Rei Kawakubo as inspirations, all of whom, Ms. Juszkiewicz said, had a knack for "deconstructing classics."
Two of Ms. Kawakubo's dresses for a recent Comme des Garçons collection, she noted, were made with fabric printed with period portraits of women and girls, including "Portrait of a Girl Dressed in Blue," a painting by the Dutch artist Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck. That work was the basis for Ms. Juszkiewicz's 2013 painting "Girl in Blue," in which she hid the young female subject's face behind a cluster of grayish mushrooms.
Ms. Juszkiewicz said that as a young girl she felt sure she would become a painter. She was born in Gdansk, Poland, a city about four hours by car from Warsaw, and has a master's degree in painting from the Academy of Fine Arts in Gdansk, as well as a Ph.D. in painting from the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow.
While pursuing her doctorate she became fascinated by the career of Elisabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun, a French portrait artist in the 1700s and 1800s who was the official court painter for Marie Antoinette.
As a female artist in a field then dominated by men, Vigée Le Brun was far from the norm, Ms. Juszkiewicz said, adding that her portraits, which mostly featured women, showed their subjects' personalities through facial expressions as well as clothes and accessories.
A self-portrait of Vigée Le Brun, which shows the artist holding paint brushes and a palette dotted with paints, inspired what would become the first portrait, in 2012, in Ms. Juszkiewicz's series of paintings based on previous works.
That painting, "Straw Hat (after Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun)," shows Vigée Le Brun with her face replaced by two sections of hair divided by a scarlike part. Last year, it sold at auction for about $ 1 million. (The Gagosian Gallery would not provide prices for the current show.)
"I knew I'd begun something," said Ms. Juszkiewicz, who has since produced about 70 paintings for the series.
The author Regan Penaluna used one of her pieces on the cover of her recent book, "How to Think Like a Woman," about female philosophers. The portrait, "Untitled (after Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun)," shows a woman whose head is enveloped in a sumptuous fabric. She is wearing a white dress with a blue bow at the waist and is sitting on a plush sofa with an open book.
Ms. Penaluna said she chose the painting in part because she thought some of the philosophers featured in her book would have appreciated what she called "the big mystery" inherent in Ms. Juszkiewicz's portraits.
She described that mystery this way: "What is a woman when she is no longer presented to us as an object of beauty?"

Effects of Menopause Confound Biologists: [Science Desk]

Author: Zimmer, Carl

Publication info: Zimmer, Carl.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For biologists, menopause is baffling. If natural selection favors genes that produce more descendants, why don't women remain fertile their entire lives? What's the evolutionary benefit of living for so many years without having more babies?
The mystery has only deepened as scientists have looked for menopause in mammals in the wild and found clear evidence of it only in a few species of whales. "It is very, very rare," said Kevin Langergraber, a primatologist at Arizona State University.
That rarity has led some researchers to argue that menopause played a crucial part in the evolution of humans. Perhaps, they proposed, it was a crucial ingredient in raising children whose big brains need lots of time -- and parental support -- to fully develop.
But a study published on Thursday by Dr. Langergraber and his colleagues challenges this view. After decades of observations in a rainforest in Uganda, they discovered that some chimpanzees go through menopause, too.
Susan Alberts, a biologist at Duke University who was not involved in the research, said that she would have been skeptical of such a claim in the past. She and her colleagues have performed some of the key studies showing that other primates do not go through menopause.
But she said the data from the new study, which includes observations of older female chimpanzees as well as measurements of hormones in their urine, had persuaded her. "The data are beautiful," she said. "It's just clear in their analysis that they have dotted every i and crossed every t."
In 1966, the British evolutionary biologist William Hamilton speculated that women's long post-reproductive life must have been important in the course of human evolution. Other scientists later turned Hamilton's musings into detailed theories, including the famous Grandmother Hypothesis.
Over the course of human evolution, that theory goes, our species gained much larger brains than other apes. As children's brains slowly develop, they are relatively helpless, depending on adults for food and protection for many years.
At the same time, as women get older, giving birth and raising children gets more dangerous both for themselves and for their offspring. Instead of taking that risk, their later years could be focused on helping raise their grandchildren.
The Grandmother Hypothesis has been bolstered by some studies of women who live in farming villages or in bands of hunter-gatherers. In those groups, children who get extra food and care from their grandmothers are more likely to survive than children who do not.
"We make transfers in a big way to the next generation, and the generation after that," Dr. Alberts said.
In recent years, however, Dr. Langergraber and his colleagues have questioned the theory. Since 1995, they and others have been watching the so-called Ngogo community of chimpanzees in Uganda. They noticed a number of healthy, old female chimps that were not having more babies. A chimp named Garbo, for example -- one of the stars of the "Chimp Empire" series on Netflix -- is now 67 years old. She had her last known pregnancy at age 38.
Brian Wood, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, conducted a statistical analysis of data collected from 185 Ngogo females and found that a significant number had lived long after their last known pregnancy.
Jacob Negrey, then a graduate student at Boston University, then collected urine from both young and old chimpanzees. In some cases, he captured it by laying out plastic sheets under their sleeping trees. In other cases, he collected it from leaves.
Later, Melissa Emery Thompson studied the urine at her lab at the University of New Mexico, measuring estrogen and other hormones in the samples. The researchers found that the hormone levels changed over the life span of female chimpanzees in the same way they do in humans.
"I find the evidence compelling that these females are living long past the end of reproduction," said Michael Cant, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Exeter who was not involved in the new study.
Only a few other populations of chimpanzees have been the focus of long-term studies, and researchers have not seen any sign of menopause in those groups. The new finding raises two possibilities: Either the Ngogo chimpanzees are peculiar, or they are typical of apes and the other populations are weird.
The Ngogo chimpanzees enjoy a particularly good life, Dr. Langergraber said. The forest is rich with food, and the leopards that once hunted the apes have largely been eradicated by humans. So it is possible that Ngogo females have a chance to get old that is not usually afforded to chimpanzees.
But Dr. Langergraber leans toward another possibility: that menopause used to be common in chimpanzees but has become rare as chimpanzees face threats from people.
People have hunted chimpanzees across Africa, as well as infecting them with deadly diseases. A common cold virus that only causes sniffles in humans could be lethal to chimpanzees.
But for the most part, Ngogo chimpanzees have been spared these modern assaults. Park guards have largely been successful at keeping poachers' snares out of the park, and scientists are careful to wear masks and keep their distance around the chimps to avoid passing on viruses.
Without much disease, Ngogo chimpanzees may live long enough to experience menopause. Perhaps chimpanzees have experienced menopause for millions of years. It's even possible that menopause arose in the common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans seven million years ago.
The Grandmother Hypothesis doesn't explain how chimpanzees could evolve menopause. With relatively small brains, baby chimpanzees are not as dependent on their parents as human children are. And Dr. Langergraber and his colleagues have not observed Garbo or other older females providing any extra food to their grandchildren.
To look for other possible evolutionary explanations for the menopause in chimpanzees, Dr. Langergraber and his colleagues are looking to whales.
In many wild species, females become less fertile with age. But until now, only five species of whales had displayed the distinctive signs of menopause, defined as a sharp halt to their reproductive years long before the end of life.
Studies on killer whales have revealed that the offspring of older females are less likely to survive than those of younger females. "Older females lose out when they breed at the same time as younger females in the same group," said Dr. Cant, who led some of the research. It appears that the female whales come into conflict, perhaps over food.
Menopause in killer whales might allow them to put their efforts into helping their pods stay alive, rather than having more babies. Dr. Cant and his colleagues have found that old females often lead their fellow whales on long trips to hunting grounds, perhaps taking advantage of their decades-old memories.
Dr. Langergraber speculated that menopause might have first evolved in small-brained apes in a similar manner. Later, when our ancestors evolved big brains and helpless babies, the benefits of help from grandmothers may have favored menopause even more. "It's probably going to be a multi-causal story," Dr. Langergraber said.

Author's Best Seller Didn't Fix All of Her Finances: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Despite writing a best seller that became a hit Netflix series, Ms. Land says she still worries about her job security.
What do you do with the money you earn from a story you wrote about not having much for too many years?
As a single mother cleaning houses, Stephanie Land dusted and polished a catalog of possible answers to this question and chronicled them in her memoir "Maid." Her new book, "Class," which comes out on Nov. 7, picks up where "Maid" left off, recounting her struggle to use food stamps to feed herself and her daughter while going deep into student loan debt.
When "Maid" became a surprise best seller in 2019 and then a hit Netflix series in 2021, it looked to the world like she had become rich.
A local nonprofit requested a donation in the range of $ 25,000 to $ 30,000. Friends asked for loans, large ones. A fan seemed surprised -- and not exactly approving -- to see her sitting in first class.
The reactions were a lot to absorb, given that she wasn't that far removed from living in a homeless shelter with a toddler. But what she wanted as much as anything was a house, in her name -- one without black mold or roommates or unpredictable landlords.
It wasn't easy to get one.
When you sell a book, you usually get your money in up to four separate payments over at least a couple of years. Agents take up to a 15 percent cut, and you have to set aside money for taxes.
When Ms. Land, 45, got her first book payment in 2016, she had nearly $ 50,000 in student loans. She also had about $ 16,000 in credit card debt, which she paid off immediately.
Her two children had been on state-subsidized health insurance, but her book earnings rendered them ineligible, so she needed to purchase new insurance, which at one point cost her family over $ 30,000 per year. She spent $ 7,000 on a very used Subaru.
"I had years of not being able to make ends meet to make up for," she said. "And that includes mental health and our physical health."
So down-payment money was scarce. Ms. Land got married in 2019 to a veteran who is eligible to receive disability payments through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, but two late student-loan payments had left him ineligible for a V.A. home loan. They tried to move from Missoula, Mont., to Raleigh, N.C., in early 2020 and were seeking a mortgage of about $ 350,000.
But her book deal and its promise of future payments weren't enough for her to qualify for one. "I couldn't prove to them that I had a job," she said.
She didn't really believe she did, either. "The book advance felt like some kind of weird loan," she said, given the standard contractual provision in the book industry that a publisher can reject a finished manuscript. "It was scary."
A Netflix deal is also no guarantee of riches. With an adaptation like the one of Ms. Land's book, you generally get a small amount up front once your agent sells the rights -- this happened several months after the book came out and became a best seller -- and much more only when the cameras turn on. But if the show doesn't get made at all, no more money generally comes your way -- and production hadn't started yet when Ms. Land was trying to buy a home.
A long-term source of guaranteed income would also have been helpful to qualify for a mortgage. Like many nonfiction authors, Ms. Land turned to speaking. An author of her renown should be able to command $ 15,000 to $ 20,000 or so for a speaking engagement, before agent fees, taxes and any discounts or freebies for nonprofit clients.
But this too is precarious. Bookings can be sporadic, and her income dried up during the early months of the pandemic. Speakers may have a shelf life of only a handful of years before their book gets old and the topic seems stale.
The subject of poverty is, alas, always timely. The further Ms. Land gets from the lived experience of it, however, the more she worries that she seems like an impostor. "I'm still really struggling with job security," she said. "My job depends on people finding me interesting, and I worry that people are thinking that I'm not authentic."
There was no evidence of that earlier this month when Ms. Land spoke to an audience of University of Delaware freshmen who had read her book. The queries at the end were reverential. "You ask me questions like I'm a white guy or something," she said, drawing peals of laughter from the crowd.
In September, she'd politely declined to write a $ 30,000 check to the nonprofit with the bold ask, though she had paid a week's worth of camp tuition for a dozen low-income families in her community. Friends who approached her with financial needs ended up with $ 15,000 in loans over time, and she forgave them all. When she sits in first class, it's almost always because clients pay for her ticket.
And that house? She finally got it, when a miracle worker mortgage broker finagled a deal for her in Missoula. The down payment was low enough that mortgage insurance was necessary. She'll be on the road a lot in the coming years to pay for it all. (Ms. Land declined to comment on the terms of her second book contract.)
Inside the house, there isn't much that resembles the lavish homes she cleaned and described in "Maid." There is no hot tub or deep fryer or Lazy Susan with fancy salts and a variety of hot sauces.
Instead, there are 45 or so houseplants and a kitchen crammed with jam jars and Fiestaware plates in rainbow colors. Three dogs live there too, slobbering all over everything and shedding so much that twice-daily vacuuming is sometimes necessary. Ms. Land and her husband clean; she can't bring herself to hire someone to be on their hands and knees while she is still walking around. When she stays in hotels, she leaves $ 20 per night near the phone with a note of gratitude.
Her children have their own rooms, which they've fixed up as they please.
"As a house cleaner, the thing that really got to me was the kids' bedrooms," she said. They had places for their clothes. They had new clothes that weren't from Goodwill, and lots of them.
"I wanted that for my kids," she said. "Everything else is just a bonus."

Hollywood Studios Are Growing Optimistic About Reaching a Deal to End the Actors' Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The entertainment companies are growing optimistic that the work stoppage may end soon, though some issues remain unresolved, people briefed on the matter said.
Following several productive days at the negotiating table, Hollywood studios are growing optimistic that they are getting closer to a deal to end the 108-day actors' strike, according to three people briefed on the matter.
These people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the labor situation, cautioned on Sunday that some issues remain unresolved with the actors, including protections around the use of artificial intelligence technology to create digital replicas of their likenesses without payment or approval. But other knots had started to become untangled, the people said.
SAG-AFTRA, as the actors' union is known, had been asking for an 11 percent raise for minimum pay in the first year of a contract, for instance. Studios had insisted that they could offer no more than 5 percent, the same as had recently been given (and agreed to) by unions for writers and directors. Early last week, however, studios lifted their offer to 7 percent. By Friday, SAG-AFTRA had eased its demand to 9 percent.
SAG-AFTRA did not respond to requests for comment. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which negotiates on behalf of the major entertainment companies, declined to comment.
In an email to SAG-AFTRA members on Friday night, the union's negotiating committee said, "We completed a full and productive day." On Saturday, the union sent a routine reminder about pickets planned the coming week, including one scheduled for Wednesday at Walt Disney Studios. The sides continued to negotiate on Sunday.
Last week, studio executives made it known -- in conversations with filmmakers, agents, reporters and actors themselves -- that a deal must be done (or nearly so) by the end of this week, or else sets were likely to remain dark for another two months.
Put another way, unless talks speed up, January could be the soonest that casts (and crews) see paychecks.
Brinkmanship? Of course. It's a standard part of any strike. The companies, however, said they were simply pointing to the calendar. It will take time to reassemble creative teams, a process complicated by the coming holidays. Preproduction (before anyone gathers on a set) for new shows can take up to 12 weeks, with movies taking roughly 16 weeks. Bake in the time for contract ratification by the SAG-AFTRA members.
More than 4,000 mostly workaday actors responded on Thursday with an open letter to their union, saying, "We have not come all this way to cave now." They added, "We cannot and will not accept a contract that fails to address the vital and existential problems that we all need fixed."
At the same time, some stars have pressured union leaders to approach negotiations with greater urgency. Out-of-work crew members have also grown increasingly frustrated with the Hollywood shutdown. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents 170,000 crew members in North America, has estimated that its West Coast members alone have lost more than $ 1.4 billion in wages.
For their part, companies are under pressure to salvage their spring television schedules and movie lineups. On Friday, Disney delayed a live-action version of "Snow White," which had been scheduled for March 26, because it would be impossible to finish in time. Earlier in the week, Paramount pushed back Tom Cruise's next "Mission: Impossible" movie, along with "A Quiet Place: Day One," starring Lupita Nyong'o.
The entertainment business has been at a standstill for months because of strikes by writers, who walked out in May, and actors, who joined them in July. The writers' strike was resolved last month, prompting hopes of a speedy resolution between studios and the actors' union. Instead, the process has been slow.
Talks between the sides restarted on Tuesday after breaking down earlier in the month over a union proposal for a per-subscriber fee from streaming services, which Netflix's co-chief executive Ted Sarandos publicly dismissed as a "levy" and "a bridge too far." SAG-AFTRA accused studio executives of "bully tactics."
It is unclear how the streaming issue might be resolved. But there is real hope in Hollywood that people may soon be back to work.
"At this time, we have no concrete information from any studio," Michael Akins, an International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees official in Georgia, wrote to members on Friday. "But the writing is clearly on the wall that the industry shutdown is in its final days."

Old World, Young Africa: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Astonishing change is underway in Africa, where the population is projected to nearly double to 2.5 billion over the next quarter-century -- an era that will not only transform many African countries, experts say, but also radically reshape their relationship with the rest of the world.
Birthrates are tumbling in richer nations, creating anxiety about how to care for, and pay for, their aging societies. But Africa's baby boom continues apace, fueling the youngest, fastest growing population on earth.
In 1950, Africans made up 8 percent of the world's people. A century later, they will account for one-quarter of humanity, and at least one-third of all young people aged 15 to 24, according to United Nations forecasts.
The median age on the African continent is 19. In India, the world's most populous country, it is 28. In China and the United States, it is 38.
The implications of this "youthquake," as some call it, are immense yet uncertain, and likely to vary greatly across Africa, a continent of myriad cultures and some 54 countries that covers an area larger than China, Europe, India and the United States combined. But its first signs are already here.
It reverberates in the bustle and thrum of the continent's ballooning cities, their hectic streets jammed with new arrivals, that make Africa the most rapidly urbanizing continent on earth.
It pulses in the packed stadiums of London or New York, where African musicians are storming the world of pop, and in the heaving megachurches of West Africa, where the future of Christianity is being shaped.
And it shows in the glow of Africa's 670 million cellphones, one for every second person on the continent -- the dominant internet device used to move money, launch revolutions, stoke frustrations and feed dreams.
"It feels like the opportunities are unlimited for us right now," said Jean-Patrick Niambé, a 24-year-old hip-hop artist from Ivory Coast who uses the stage name Dofy, as he rode in a taxi to a concert in the capital, Abidjan, this year.
Africa's political reach is growing, too. Its leaders are courted at flashy summits by foreign powers that covet their huge reserves of the minerals needed to make electric cars and solar panels.
With a growing choice of eager allies, including Russia, China, the United States, Turkey and Gulf petrostates, African leaders are spurning the image of victim and demanding a bigger say. In September, the African Union joined the Group of 20, the premier forum for international economic cooperation, taking a seat at the same table as the European Union.
Businesses are chasing Africa's tens of millions of new consumers emerging every year, representing untapped markets for cosmetics, organic foods, even champagne. Hilton plans to open 65 new hotels on the continent within five years. Its population of millionaires, the fastest growing on earth, is expected to double to 768,000 by 2027, the bank Credit Suisse estimates.
Dinner at Sushi Mitsuki, a new restaurant in a neighborhood with a rising skyline in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, starts at $ 200 per person.
"Africa is entering a period of truly staggering change," said Edward Paice, the director of the Africa Research Institute in London and the author of "Youthquake: Why African Demography Should Matter to the World."
He added:
In many countries, historically low birthrates are creating older, smaller populations. Caregivers in Italy, which is expected to have 12 percent fewer people by 2050, are experimenting with robots to look after the aged. The prime minister of Japan, where the median age is 48, warned in January that his society was "on the verge" of dysfunction.
Africa's challenge is to manage unbridled growth. It has always been a young continent -- only two decades ago the median age was 17 -- but never on such a scale. Within the next decade, Africa will have the world's largest work force, surpassing China and India. By the 2040s, it will account for two out of every five children born on the planet.
Experts say this approaching tide of humanity will push Africa to the fore of the most pressing concerns of our age, like climate change, the energy transition and migration.
But it has also exposed the continent's gaping vulnerabilities.
Peril and Potential
Africa's soaring population is partly a result of remarkable progress. Africans eat better and live longer than ever, on average. Infant mortality has been halved since 2000; calorie intake has soared.
But while a handful of African countries are poised to ride the demographic wave, others risk being swamped by it.
Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is already deeply stressed: Nearly two-thirds of its 213 million people live on less than $ 2 a day; extremist violence and banditry are rife; and life expectancy is just 53, nine years below the African average.
Yet Nigeria adds another five million people every year, and by 2050 is expected to overtake the United States as the world's third most populous country.
Young Africans are better educated and more connected than ever: 44 percent graduated from high school in 2020, up from 27 percent in 2000, and about 570 million people use the internet. But finding a good job, or any job, is another matter.
Up to one million Africans enter the labor market every month, but fewer than one in four get a formal job, the World Bank says. Unemployment in South Africa, the continent's most industrialized nation, runs at a crushing 35 percent.
Frustration feeds desperation.
In countries like Somalia, Mozambique and Mali, opportunity-starved youths pick up guns to fight for jihad, or for money. In Gabon and Niger, youngsters fed up with sham politics crowd streets and stadiums to yell slogans in favor of military coups.
On the high seas, smugglers' boats make perilous journeys to Europe and the Middle East, carrying desperate young Africans and their dreams of a better future. At least 28,000 have died on the Mediterranean since 2014, the United Nations says.
The climate crisis is an especially urgent concern.
"Our generation takes things personally," said Keziah Keya, a 21-year-old software engineer from Kenya.
Ms. Keya exemplifies the potential of that generation. Born into a poor family, she taught herself to code using the internet, and later represented Kenya at the International Math Olympiad in London. Last year, she was hired by a renewable energy company.
But she recently watched in dismay as a river near her home ran dry. Soon after, her grandmother's crop of tomatoes withered. Starving cattle began to die. Three local herders took their own lives, she said.
"If we want to change things, we have to do it ourselves," said Ms. Keya, who last month flew to Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania to study computer science, on a Fulbright Scholarship. But she sees her future in Kenya. "We can't afford to wait."
Forecasting population trends is a fraught and contentious business, with a history of flawed predictions. In the 1970s, books like "The Population Bomb" by Paul R. Ehrlich popularized fears that an overcrowded planet would lead to mass starvation and societal collapse.
Africans are rightfully cautious of foreigners lecturing on the subject of family size. In the West, racists and right-wing nationalists stoke fears of African population growth to justify hatred, or even violence.
But experts say these demographic predictions are reliable, and that an epochal shift is underway. The forecasts for 2050 are sound because most of the women who will have children in the next few decades have already been born. Barring an unforeseeable upset, the momentum is unstoppable.
"It's the mother of all megatrends," said Carlos Lopes, an economist from Guinea-Bissau who formerly headed the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa.
Many others agree. The economic rise of China and India were the first great shocks of this century, they say. Africa's youthful tide will most likely drive the next seismic shift.
Its first tremors are already being felt, and nowhere more than in global culture.
Cultural Powerhouse
When the Nigerian star Burna Boy stepped out before an adoring crowd at New York's Citi Field this summer, he confirmed himself as pop royalty.
Weeks earlier, in London, he had filled an 80,000-capacity venue. In New York, he became the first African artist to sell out an American stadium.
He sang his new single, "Sittin' on Top of the World."
It was yet another milestone for Afrobeats, a West African musical genre that is becoming a global sensation. Afrobeats songs were streamed over 13 billion times on Spotify last year, up from eight billion in 2021; the genre's biggest hit, Rema's "Calm Down," was a fan phenomenon at the soccer World Cup in Qatar. Countless TikTok dance challenges were born.
"It's a great time to be alive," said Laolu Senbanjo, a Nigerian artist living in Brooklyn. "Whether I'm in Target or an Uber, I hear the Afrobeats. It's like a bridge. The world has come together."
African artists seemed to be on red carpets everywhere this year -- at the Grammy Awards, which added a new category for Best African Music; at the Met Gala, where the Nigerian singer Tems came fringed in ostrich feathers; and at the Cannes Film Festival, where a young French-Senegalese director, Ramata-Toulaye Sy, was a breakout star.
African fashion had its own shows in Paris and Milan. In Venice, Africa is the focus of this year's Architectural Biennale. Last year, an architect from Burkina Faso won the prestigious Pritzker Prize. In 2021, Tanzania-born Abdulrazak Gurnah won the Nobel Prize in Literature.
"Africa's not just one place," he said in an interview. "It's complicated and complex; differentiated, contrasted."
Long viewed in the West as a niche interest -- or worse, exotica -- African culture has become the continent's soft power, and, increasingly, a source of hard cash.
The world's fastest growing music market is in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the main industry body. By 2030, Africa's film and music industries could be worth $ 20 billion and create 20 million jobs, according to UNESCO estimates.
Young Africans are honing their talents, sensing an opening.
Scriptwriters and animators are shaking off the clichéd image of a continent defined by famine and conflict to tell new stories -- frothy reality shows, gritty gangster tales and even children's cartoons, made in Africa by Africans, that have aired on streaming services like Disney+ and Amazon Prime.
This summer, "Supa Team Four," a cartoon series about teenage superheroes from Zambia who save the world, aired on Netflix. The theme is power -- girl power, teen power but also plain electricity: The chief villain tries to knock out the city power grid.
Malenga Mulendema, the show's creator, worked with a team across six African countries, and said that the movie "Black Panther," when it came out in 2018, "paved the way" for new depictions of Africa. "People want to box us in," she said. "But when you have multiple shows like this you can't box in, anymore, what it means to tell an African story."
The commercial potential of Africa's cultural might is only starting to be realized. Netflix has spent $ 175 million in Africa since 2016, but has plans to invest $ 2.5 billion in South Korea. It was not until 2004 that a work by an African artist sold for over $ 1 million at auction, according to Hannah O'Leary, the head of modern and contemporary African art at Sotheby's. Since then, another 11 have passed that bar‌. "But the market is still hugely under-realized," she said.
Foreign companies are looking to cash in. This year gamma, a music company owned in part by Apple, set up an office in Lagos, hoping to discover the next Burna Boy, or even a host of smaller stars. "We're going straight to the source," said Sipho Dlamini, a gamma executive.
Born in Zimbabwe but raised in Watford, outside London, in the 1980s, Mr. Dlamini remembers being bullied because of his background. "We were called names," he said. "All kinds of names."
Now, "African" is a badge of pride. "Historically, the image was what people saw on TV: kids starving, kwashiorkor and flies," he said, referring to a severe form of malnutrition marked by a swollen belly. "Now they will tell you they are dying to come to Cape Town, to Mombasa, to Zanzibar. It's cool to be African."
Jobs Crisis
Zeinab Moawad wondered if she was wasting her time.
The 18-year-old stood outside the tutoring center in Cairo where she had spent a year cramming for college entrance exams. But even if she was granted a place in Egypt's best engineering or medical schools, she doubted that it would lead to a good job.
"We're on our own," she said.
Not long ago, technology was the big idea for enabling Africa to leapfrog its way out of poverty.
Start-ups sprouted in countries like Nigeria, South Africa and Morocco. Innovative technologies, like M-Pesa, brought mobile banking to tens of millions of people. Women-only coding schools emerged. Microsoft and Google established major centers in Kenya, the self-styled "Silicon Savannah" of East Africa. Optimists spoke of an "Africa rising."
But while technology brought billions in investment, it failed dismally on one crucial front: creating jobs.
"That's a problem," said Mo Ibrahim, a Sudanese-born telecommunications tycoon and philanthropist.
It is also a problem for the world, said Aubrey Hruby, an investor in Africa and an author of "The Next Africa." She said, "After climate change, Africa's jobs crisis will be a defining challenge of our era."
Elsewhere, the answer was industrialization. In the 1970s and 1980s, when China, South Korea and Japan were the engines of population growth, their factories were filled with young people producing clothes, cars and TVs. It made them rich and lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty.
Africa is poorly positioned to repeat that feat. Other than South Africa and a handful of countries in North Africa, most of the continent has failed to industrialize. In fact, it is losing ground: Africa's share of global manufacturing is smaller today than it was in 1980.
Infrastructure is an obstacle. Six hundred million Africans, or four in 10, lack electricity. An average American refrigerator consumes more power in a year than a typical person in Africa. Major roads and railways often lead to the coasts, a legacy of extractive colonialism, which inhibits trade between countries.
And the baby boom endures, smothering economic growth.
Other regions, like East Asia, prospered only after their birthrates had fallen substantially and a majority of their people had joined the work force -- a phenomenon known as the "demographic transition" that has long driven global growth. Britain's transition took two centuries, from the 1740s to the 1940s. Thailand did it in about 40 years.
But in Africa, where birthrates remain stubbornly high -- nearly twice the global average -- that transition has proved elusive.
The picture changes greatly from one country to another. In South Africa, women have two children on average, while in Niger they have seven. Some smaller economies, like those of Rwanda and Ivory Coast, are among the world's fastest growing. But on the whole, the continent cannot keep pace with its swelling population.
Adjusted for population size, Africa's economy has grown by 1 percent annually since 1990, according to the global consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Over the same period, India's grew 5 percent per year and China's grew 9 percent.
Despite making up 18 percent of the global population, Africa accounts for just 3 percent of all trade.
For legions of jobless and frustrated young Africans, that leaves only one good option: Get out. Every year, tens of thousands of doctors, nurses, academics and other skilled migrants flee the continent. (At least one million Africans from south of the Sahara have moved to Europe since 2010, according to the Pew Research Center.) Migration is such a feature of life in Nigeria that young people have a name for it -- "japa," Yoruba slang that means "to run away."
And the countries they leave behind depend on them to survive. In 2021, African migrants sent home $ 96 billion in remittances, three times more than the sum of all foreign aid, according to the African Development Bank.
"The African diaspora has become the largest financier of Africa," said Akinwumi Adesina, the bank's head.
In fact, the majority of young migrants do not even leave the continent, moving instead to other countries in Africa. But the plight of those who gamble their lives to travel further -- left to die in sinking boats by the Greek Coast Guard, gunned down by Saudi border police or even stumbling through Central American jungle to reach the United States -- has become a potent emblem of generational desperation.
The new big idea to invigorate African economies is the transition to green energy. African governments and investors are angling for a piece of the global effort, sure to involve trillions of dollars in the coming decades, which they hope can deliver Africa's much-sought-after industrial revolution.
Africa has 60 percent of the world's solar energy potential and 70 percent of its cobalt, a key mineral for making electric vehicles. Its tropical rainforests pull more carbon from the atmosphere than the Amazon. Ambitious ventures are taking shape in numerous countries: a dazzling solar tower in Morocco; a $ 10 billion green hydrogen plant in Namibia; a Kenyan-made machine that extracts carbon from the air.
The Africa Climate Summit, which took place in Nairobi in September, not only galvanized those seeking to profit from the climate transition, it also produced a bullish new narrative.
"Africa is neither poor nor desperate," President William Ruto of Kenya said.
Whether young Africans can truly tap the potential of the coming energy revolution depends on other factors, too, not least the capacities of their entrenched and aging leaders.
Young Voters, Old Leaders
A youthful continent is run by old men. The average African leader is 63 years old; the oldest, President Paul Biya of Cameroon, is 90, a full 72 years older than the average Cameroonian. Under their grip, democracy has fallen to its lowest point in decades: Half of all Africans live in countries considered "not free" by Freedom House.
Five African heads of state, including Mr. Biya, have held power for more than three decades; nearly all are grooming their sons as successors. "Sick old men," said the Nigerian writer and Nobel laureate, Wole Soyinka, in an interview.
Even so, foreign powers are scrambling to back them.
President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, in power since 1994, receives over $ 1 billion in Western aid annually, and has established his tiny country as a hub for sports and international conferences -- even as he is accused of killing or kidnapping his critics, or purports to win elections by a margin of 99 percent.
As the United States, China and Russia vie for position, an array of middle powers is crowding in too. About 400 new embassies have opened in African countries since 2012, according to the Diplometrics Program at the University of Denver; Turkey, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and India top the list.
Yet there is one key group that Africa's gerontocrats have disastrously failed to win over: the alienated youth of their own nations.
"Our elites treat us like idiots," Nourdine Aouadé, a lawyer and young political leader, said at his office in Niger's capital, Niamey, after a military takeover in August. Like many young Nigeriens, Mr. Awade, 32, supported the action.
"Coups are just the consequence of social injustice," he said.
Youthful uprisings first flared in 2011, during the Arab Spring, when an uprising in Tunisia inspired others in Egypt and Libya. Later, powerful demonstrations erupted in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Senegal and even Eswatini, a tiny kingdom of 1.2 million people in southern Africa.
This year, young people have channeled their anger into pro-military populism -- cheering the new junta in Niger or, weeks later, Gabon, where they posted TikTok videos mocking their newly ousted president, Ali Bongo Ondimba. Other leaders, watching nervously, worry that they could be next.
The age gap between geriatric leaders and restless youth is "a major source of tension" in many African countries, said Simon Mulongo, a former African Union diplomat from Uganda. "It's a powder keg, and it can explode anytime."
One day last spring, Nuha Abdelgadir was hunched over her phone at a cafe in Sudan's capital, Khartoum. Her thumb flicked restlessly through a gallery of smiling faces -- friends who had been killed by Sudan's security forces in pro-democracy demonstrations. Ms. Abdelgadir, 18, had come to take their place.
"We're equal with the boys," she said, gesturing to another young woman. "We've got shields, we throw stones, we clash."
Her group, "Anger Without Limits," was at the fore of the street clashes that had occurred every week since Sudan's military had seized power in a coup 18 months earlier. Ms. Abdelgadir's job was to pluck streaming tear-gas canisters from the ground and fling them back at the police. It was risky work, she admitted; over 100 protesters had been killed. But, she said, "I don't care."
Weeks later, Sudan tumbled into war. Fighting between rival military factions in mid-April rippled across Khartoum, then the country. On the third day of fighting, a stray shell punched through Ms. Abdelgadir's home, sending it up in flames. She fled with her family to the countryside. By September, she was planning to leave Sudan, and even the continent.
Even then, she insisted she would be back to finish what she had started. "We will take to the streets again," she texted, the night before boarding a bus taking her over Sudan's border into Ethiopia. "The democracy we dream of will come."
Militants Marching
While some take flight, others pick up a gun.
In the Sahel, the semiarid region bordering the Sahara that runs across the African continent, tens of thousands of teenagers have joined militant groups linked to Al Qaeda and Islamic State. They bring havoc in their wake -- thousands of civilians killed, five million forced from their homes and political destabilization that has led to a string of military coups.
But the main driver of this powerful insurgency is not an extremist ideology or religious belief, according to a U.N. study of 1,000 former fighters from eight countries. Instead, researchers found, the single biggest reason for joining a militant group was the simple desire to have a job.
Modu Ali, from a poor family with 10 children in northern Nigeria, had barely finished primary school when he joined the extremist group Boko Haram, over a decade ago. His goal was to "fight for the rights of the deprived," he said. "Instead it ruined my life." He surrendered and joined a rehabilitation program for former fighters.
The Sahel leads the world in two ways. It is the global center of extremist violence, accounting for 43 percent of all such deaths in 2022, according to the Global Terrorism Index. And it has the highest birthrates -- on average seven children per woman in Niger and northern Nigeria, six in Mali and Chad, and five in Sudan and Burkina Faso.
These factors are why many view the Sahel as the most worrisome manifestation of Africa's "youthquake."
One key to tackling that problem lies with teenage girls like Asiya Saidu.
Like many in Zaria, a Muslim-majority city in northern Nigeria, Ms. Saidu expected to be married by 14 and to have her first child soon after. "My uncle was hellbent on finding me a husband," she recalled.
Instead, she enrolled at the Center for Girls Education, an American-funded program that has helped as many as 70,000 girls to stay in school, and ultimately to have smaller families.
Educating girls has an unusually large effect on family size in Africa because it delays the age of marriage and helps young women to space out their children, researchers have found. "It's a natural kind of birth control," said Habiba Mohammed, the program's director.
Ms. Saidu, now 17, recently applied for nursing school.
"I do want to get married," she said. But first, she said, "I want to be independent and learn to support myself."
The Future Is Already Here
It could be that Africa will undergo transformations that are hard to see now.
When the economist Ha-Joon Chang was growing up in South Korea in the 1960s, his country was subjected to the same condescension and racism leveled at many African nations today, he said. It was poor, had just emerged from war, and was seen by American officials as a basket case.
"Nobody took us seriously," said Mr. Chang, now a professor of economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.
That South Korea has become one of the world's largest economies shows how success can strike in the most unlikely places, Mr. Chang added: "With time and effort, remarkable transformations are possible."
A young population was a big part of South Korea's success, Mr. Chang said. But it took other ingredients, too: visionary leaders, wise policies and education, as well as intangibles like drive, innovation and sheer good fortune, he said. "A lot of things have to work together."
Could Africa's youth boom portend a similar miracle?
This year's surging turmoil -- new crises, new wars and new economic slumps -- would give pause to the greatest of optimists. Yet there are also reasons to hope.
"I tell my friends in England that the time will come when they will put out a red carpet for those guys now coming in boats," said Mr. Ibrahim, the philanthropist.
Some, like Nedye Astou Touré, are already reaching for the stars.
Ms. Touré, a 23-year-old student, stood over a pile of old aircraft parts at a university lab in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. Her eyes gleamed with anticipation. "It's for a rocket," she said of the pile.
She and another senior at the university hope to launch their projectile 100 meters into the air, a first step toward building a low-orbit satellite.
It might take a while, Ms. Touré admitted. But while others with such grand dreams have typically left Africa behind, she wanted to show it can be done at home.
"Just wait," she said. "Three years from now you might be hearing about us."

Full text: Enlarge this image.
As the world grays, Africa blooms with youth.
By 2050, 1 in 4 people on the planet will be African, a seismic change that’s already starting to register.
You can hear it in the music the world listens to. You can see it in movies, fashion and politics.
You can sense it in the entrepreneurial drive of young Africans — and the urgent scramble for jobs.
You can see it in the waves of youth who risk all to migrate — and in the dilemmas of those who remain.
Astonishing change is underway in Africa, where the population is projected to nearly double to 2.5 billion over the next quarter-century — an era that will not only transform many African countries, experts say, but also radically reshape their relationship with the rest of the world.
Birthrates are tumbling in richer nations, creating anxiety about how to care for, and pay for, their aging societies. But Africa’s baby boom continues apace, fueling the youngest, fastest growing population on earth.
In 1950, Africans made up 8% of the world’s people. A century later, they will account for one-quarter of humanity and at least one-third of all young people ages 15 to 24, according to United Nations forecasts.
The median age on the African continent is 19. In India, the world’s most populous country, it is 28. In China and the United States, it is 38.
The implications of this “youthquake,” as some call it, are immense yet uncertain and likely to vary greatly across Africa, a continent of myriad cultures and some 54 countries that covers an area larger than China, Europe, India and the United States combined. But its first signs are already here.
It reverberates in the bustle and thrum of the continent’s ballooning cities, their hectic streets jammed with new arrivals, that make Africa the most rapidly urbanizing continent on earth.
It pulses in the packed stadiums of London or New York, where African musicians are storming the world of pop, and in the heaving megachurches of West Africa, where the future of Christianity is being shaped.
And it shows in the glow of Africa’s 670 million cellphones, one for every second person on the continent — the dominant internet device used to move money, launch revolutions, stoke frustrations and feed dreams.
“It feels like the opportunities are unlimited for us right now,” said Jean-Patrick Niambé, a 24-year-old hip-hop artist from Ivory Coast who uses the stage name Dofy, as he rode in a taxi to a concert in the capital, Abidjan, this year.
Africa’s political reach is growing, too. Its leaders are courted at flashy summits by foreign powers that covet their huge reserves of the minerals needed to make electric cars and solar panels.
With a growing choice of eager allies, including Russia, China, the United States, Turkey and Gulf petrostates, African leaders are spurning the image of victim and demanding a bigger say. In September, the African Union joined the Group of 20, the premier forum for international economic cooperation, taking a seat at the same table as the European Union.
Businesses are chasing Africa’s tens of millions of new consumers emerging every year, representing untapped markets for cosmetics, organic foods and even Champagne. Hilton plans to open 65 new hotels on the continent within five years. Its population of millionaires, the fastest growing on earth, is expected to double to 768,000 by 2027, the bank Credit Suisse estimates.
Dinner at Sushi Mitsuki, a new restaurant in a neighborhood with a rising skyline in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, starts at $200 per person.
“Africa is entering a period of truly staggering change,” said Edward Paice, the director of the Africa Research Institute in London and the author of “Youthquake: Why African Demography Should Matter to the World.”
“The world is changing,” he added. “And we need to start reimagining Africa’s place in it.”
The energy in Africa contrasts with the rising uneasiness in Europe and Asia.
In many countries, historically low birthrates are creating older, smaller populations. Caregivers in Italy, which is expected to have 12% fewer people by 2050, are experimenting with robots to look after the aged. The prime minister of Japan, where the median age is 48, warned in January that his society was “on the verge” of dysfunction.
Africa’s challenge is to manage unbridled growth. It has always been a young continent — only two decades ago, the median age was 17 — but never on such a scale. Within the next decade, Africa will have the world’s largest workforce, surpassing China and India. By the 2040s, it will account for 2 out of every 5 children born on the planet.
Experts say this approaching tide of humanity will push Africa to the fore of the most pressing concerns of our age, like climate change, the energy transition and migration.
But it has also exposed the continent’s gaping vulnerabilities.
Peril and Potential
Africa’s soaring population is partly a result of remarkable progress. Africans eat better and live longer than ever, on average. Infant mortality has been halved since 2000; calorie intake has soared.
But while a handful of African countries are poised to ride the demographic wave, others risk being swamped by it.
Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation, is already deeply stressed. Nearly two-thirds of its 213 million people live on less than $2 a day; extremist violence and banditry are rife; and life expectancy is just 53, nine years below the African average.
Yet Nigeria adds another 5 million people every year and by 2050 is expected to overtake the United States as the world’s third most populous country.
Young Africans are better educated and more connected than ever: 44% graduated from high school in 2020, up from 27% in 2000, and about 570 million people use the internet. But finding a good job, or any job, is another matter.
Up to 1 million Africans enter the labor market every month, but fewer than 1 in 4 get a formal job, the World Bank says. Unemployment in South Africa, the continent’s most industrialized nation, runs at a crushing 35%.
Frustration feeds desperation.
In countries like Somalia, Mozambique and Mali, opportunity-starved youths pick up guns to fight for jihad or for money. In Gabon and Niger, youngsters fed up with sham politics crowd streets and stadiums to yell slogans in favor of military coups.
On the high seas, smugglers’ boats make perilous journeys to Europe and the Middle East, carrying desperate young Africans and their dreams of a better future. At least 28,000 have died on the Mediterranean since 2014, the United Nations says.
The climate crisis is an especially urgent concern.
Floods, droughts and storms have battered African countries. Concern about climate change is shaping plans for the future and stoking worries about its impact.
“Our generation takes things personally,” said Keziah Keya, a 21-year-old software engineer from Kenya.
Keya exemplifies the potential of that generation. Born into a poor family, she taught herself to code using the internet and later represented Kenya at the International Math Olympiad in London. Last year, she was hired by a renewable energy company.
But she recently watched in dismay as a river near her home ran dry. Soon after, her grandmother’s crop of tomatoes withered. Starving cattle began to die. Three local herders took their own lives, she said.
“If we want to change things, we have to do it ourselves,” said Keya, who last month flew to Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania to study computer science, on a Fulbright Scholarship. But she sees her future in Kenya. “We can’t afford to wait.”
Forecasting population trends is a fraught and contentious business, with a history of flawed predictions. In the 1970s, books like “The Population Bomb” by Paul R. Ehrlich popularized fears that an overcrowded planet would lead to mass starvation and societal collapse.
Africans are rightfully cautious of foreigners lecturing on the subject of family size. In the West, racists and right-wing nationalists stoke fears of African population growth to justify hatred or even violence.
But experts say these demographic predictions are reliable and that an epochal shift is underway. The forecasts for 2050 are sound because most of the women who will have children in the next few decades have already been born. Barring an unforeseeable upset, the momentum is unstoppable.
“It’s the mother of all megatrends,” said Carlos Lopes, an economist from Guinea-Bissau who formerly headed the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa.
Many others agree. The economic rise of China and India were the first great shocks of this century, they say. Africa’s youthful tide will most likely drive the next seismic shift.
Its first tremors are already being felt, and nowhere more than in global culture.
Cultural Powerhouse
When Nigerian star Burna Boy stepped out before an adoring crowd at New York’s Citi Field this summer, he confirmed himself as pop royalty.
Weeks earlier, in London, he had filled an 80,000-capacity venue. In New York, he became the first African artist to sell out a U.S. stadium.
He sang his new single, “Sittin’ on Top of the World.”
It was yet another milestone for Afrobeats, a West African musical genre that is becoming a global sensation. Afrobeats songs were streamed more than 13 billion times on Spotify last year, up from 8 billion in 2021; the genre’s biggest hit, Rema’s “Calm Down,” was a fan phenomenon at the soccer World Cup in Qatar. Countless TikTok dance challenges were born.
“It’s a great time to be alive,” said Laolu Senbanjo, a Nigerian artist living in New York City. “Whether I’m in Target or an Uber, I hear the Afrobeats. It’s like a bridge. The world has come together.”
African artists seemed to be on red carpets everywhere this year — at the Grammy Awards, which added a new category for Best African Music; at the Met Gala, where Nigerian singer Tems came fringed in ostrich feathers; and at the Cannes Film Festival, where a young French-Senegalese director, Ramata-Toulaye Sy, was a breakout star.
African fashion had its own shows in Paris and Milan. In Venice, Africa is the focus of this year’s Architectural Biennale. Last year, an architect from Burkina Faso won the prestigious Pritzker Prize. In 2021, Tanzania-born Abdulrazak Gurnah won the Nobel Prize in literature.
“Africa’s not just one place,” he said in an interview. “It’s complicated and complex; differentiated, contrasted.”
Long viewed in the West as a niche interest — or worse, exotica — African culture has become the continent’s soft power and, increasingly, a source of hard cash.
The world’s fastest-growing music market is in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the main industry body. By 2030, Africa’s film and music industries could be worth $20 billion and create 20 million jobs, according to UNESCO estimates.
Young Africans are honing their talents, sensing an opening. In Lagos, young designers show their creations. In Nairobi, hundreds in a poor neighborhood are learning to play classical music. In Dakar, a break-dancing team prepares to perform in the youth Olympics.
Scriptwriters and animators are shaking off the clichéd image of a continent defined by famine and conflict to tell new stories — frothy reality shows, gritty gangster tales and even children’s cartoons, made in Africa by Africans, that have aired on streaming services like Disney+ and Amazon Prime.
This summer, “Supa Team Four,” a cartoon series about teenage superheroes from Zambia who save the world, aired on Netflix. The theme is power — girl power, teen power but also plain electricity: The chief villain tries to knock out the city power grid.
Malenga Mulendema, the show’s creator, worked with a team across six African countries and said that the movie “Black Panther,” when it came out in 2018, “paved the way” for new depictions of Africa. “People want to box us in,” she said. “But when you have multiple shows like this, you can’t box in, anymore, what it means to tell an African story.”
The commercial potential of Africa’s cultural might is only starting to be realized. Netflix has spent $175 million in Africa since 2016 but has plans to invest $2.5 billion in South Korea. It was not until 2004 that a work by an African artist sold for more than $1 million at auction, according to Hannah O’Leary, the head of modern and contemporary African art at Sotheby’s. Since then, another 11 have passed that bar. “But the market is still hugely underrealized,” she said.
Foreign companies are looking to cash in. This year, gamma, a music company owned in part by Apple, set up an office in Lagos, hoping to discover the next Burna Boy or even a host of smaller stars. “We’re going straight to the source,” said Sipho Dlamini, a gamma executive.
Born in Zimbabwe but raised in Watford, outside London, in the 1980s, Dlamini remembers being bullied because of his background. “We were called names,” he said. “All kinds of names.”
Now “African” is a badge of pride. “Historically, the image was what people saw on TV: kids starving, kwashiorkor and flies,” he said, referring to a severe form of malnutrition marked by a swollen belly. “Now they will tell you they are dying to come to Cape Town, to Mombasa, to Zanzibar. It’s cool to be African.”
Jobs Crisis
Zeinab Moawad wondered if she was wasting her time.
The 18-year-old stood outside the tutoring center in Cairo where she had spent a year cramming for college entrance exams. But even if she was granted a place in Egypt’s best engineering or medical schools, she doubted that it would lead to a good job.
“We’re on our own,” she said.
Not long ago, technology was the big idea for enabling Africa to leapfrog its way out of poverty.
Startups sprouted in countries like Nigeria, South Africa and Morocco. Innovative technologies, like M-Pesa, brought mobile banking to tens of millions of people. Women-only coding schools emerged. Microsoft and Google established major centers in Kenya, the self-styled “Silicon Savannah” of East Africa. Optimists spoke of an “Africa rising.”
But while technology brought billions in investment, it failed dismally on one crucial front: creating jobs.
Chronic unemployment, an old problem, is now a major crisis.
The continent’s working-age population — people ages 15 to 65 — will hit 1 billion in the next decade.
What will these 1 billion workers do?
“That’s a problem,” said Mo Ibrahim, a Sudanese-born telecommunications tycoon and philanthropist.
It is also a problem for the world, said Aubrey Hruby, an investor in Africa and an author of “The Next Africa.” She said, “After climate change, Africa’s jobs crisis will be a defining challenge of our era.”
Elsewhere, the answer was industrialization. In the 1970s and 1980s, when China, South Korea and Japan were the engines of population growth, their factories were filled with young people producing clothes, cars and TVs. It made them rich and lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty.
Africa is poorly positioned to repeat that feat. Other than South Africa and a handful of countries in North Africa, most of the continent has failed to industrialize. In fact, it is losing ground: Africa’s share of global manufacturing is smaller today than it was in 1980.
Infrastructure is an obstacle. Some 600 million Africans, or 4 in 10, lack electricity. An average U.S. refrigerator consumes more power in a year than a typical person in Africa. Major roads and railways often lead to the coasts, a legacy of extractive colonialism, which inhibits trade between countries.
And the baby boom endures, smothering economic growth.
Other regions, like East Asia, prospered only after their birthrates had fallen substantially and a majority of their people had joined the workforce — a phenomenon known as the “demographic transition” that has long driven global growth. Britain’s transition took two centuries, from the 1740s to the 1940s. Thailand did it in about 40 years.
But in Africa, where birthrates remain stubbornly high — nearly twice the global average — that transition has proved elusive.
The picture changes greatly from one country to another. In South Africa, women have two children on average, while in Niger, they have seven. Some smaller economies, like those of Rwanda and Ivory Coast, are among the world’s fastest-growing. But on the whole, the continent cannot keep pace with its swelling population.
Adjusted for population size, Africa’s economy has grown by 1% annually since 1990, according to the global consulting firm McKinsey & Co. Over the same period, India’s grew 5% per year, and China’s grew 9%.
Despite making up 18% of the global population, Africa accounts for just 3% of all trade.
For legions of jobless and frustrated young Africans, that leaves only one good option: Get out. Every year, tens of thousands of doctors, nurses, academics and other skilled migrants flee the continent. (At least 1 million Africans from south of the Sahara have moved to Europe since 2010, according to the Pew Research Center.) Migration is such a feature of life in Nigeria that young people have a name for it: “japa,” Yoruba slang that means “to run away.”
And the countries they leave behind depend on them to survive. In 2021, African migrants sent home $96 billion in remittances, three times more than the sum of all foreign aid, according to the African Development Bank.
“The African diaspora has become the largest financier of Africa,” said Akinwumi Adesina, the bank’s head.
In fact, the majority of young migrants do not even leave the continent, moving instead to other countries in Africa. But the plight of those who gamble their lives to travel further — left to die in sinking boats by the Greek coast guard, gunned down by Saudi border police or even stumbling through Central American jungle to reach the United States — has become a potent emblem of generational desperation.
The new big idea to invigorate African economies is the transition to green energy. African governments and investors are angling for a piece of the global effort, sure to involve trillions of dollars in the coming decades, which they hope can deliver Africa’s much-sought-after industrial revolution.
Africa has 60% of the world’s solar energy potential and 70% of its cobalt, a key mineral for making electric vehicles. Its tropical rainforests pull more carbon from the atmosphere than the Amazon. Ambitious ventures are taking shape in numerous countries: a dazzling solar tower in Morocco; a $10 billion green hydrogen plant in Namibia; a Kenyan-made machine that extracts carbon from the air.
The Africa Climate Summit, which took place in Nairobi in September, not only galvanized those seeking to profit from the climate transition but also produced a bullish new narrative.
“Africa is neither poor nor desperate,” President William Ruto of Kenya said.
Whether young Africans can truly tap the potential of the coming energy revolution depends on other factors, too, not least, the capacities of their entrenched and aging leaders.
Young Voters, Old Leaders
A youthful continent is run by old men. The average African leader is 63 years old; the oldest, President Paul Biya of Cameroon, is 90, a full 72 years older than the average Cameroonian. Under their grip, democracy has fallen to its lowest point in decades: Half of all Africans live in countries considered “not free” by Freedom House.
Five African heads of state, including Biya, have held power for more than three decades; nearly all are grooming their sons as successors. “Sick old men,” Nigerian writer and Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka said in an interview.
Even so, foreign powers are scrambling to back them.
President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, in power since 1994, receives more than $1 billion in Western aid annually and has established his tiny country as a hub for sports and international conferences — even as he is accused of killing or kidnapping his critics, or purports to win elections by a margin of 99%.
As the United States, China and Russia vie for position, an array of middle powers is crowding in too. About 400 new embassies have opened in African countries since 2012, according to the Diplometrics Program at the University of Denver; Turkey, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and India top the list.
Yet there is one key group that Africa’s gerontocrats have disastrously failed to win over: the alienated youth of their own nations.
“Our elites treat us like idiots,” Nourdine Aouadé, a lawyer and young political leader, said at his office in Niger’s capital, Niamey, after a military takeover in August. Like many young Nigeriens, Awade, 32, supported the action.
“Coups are just the consequence of social injustice,” he said.
Most young Africans admire and desire democracy, numerous polls have found.
But disillusionment with politicians’ empty promises is giving rise to a new age of protest and to political activism, like performance artists focused on climate change.
Youthful uprisings first flared in 2011, during the Arab Spring, when an uprising in Tunisia inspired others in Egypt and Libya. Later, powerful demonstrations erupted in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Senegal and even Eswatini, a tiny kingdom of 1.2 million people in southern Africa.
This year, young people have channeled their anger into pro-military populism — cheering the new junta in Niger or, weeks later, Gabon, where they posted TikTok videos mocking their newly ousted president, Ali Bongo Ondimba.
Other leaders, watching nervously, worry that they could be next.
The age gap between geriatric leaders and restless youth is “a major source of tension” in many African countries, said Simon Mulongo, a former African Union diplomat from Uganda. “It’s a powder keg, and it can explode anytime.”
One day last spring, Nuha Abdelgadir was hunched over her phone at a cafe in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum. Her thumb flicked restlessly through a gallery of smiling faces — friends who had been killed by Sudan’s security forces in pro-democracy demonstrations. Abdelgadir, 18, had come to take their place.
“We’re equal with the boys,” she said, gesturing to another young woman. “We’ve got shields. We throw stones. We clash.”
Her group, “Anger Without Limits,” was at the fore of the street clashes that had occurred every week since Sudan’s military had seized power in a coup 18 months earlier. Abdelgadir’s job was to pluck streaming tear gas canisters from the ground and fling them back at the police. It was risky work, she admitted; more than 100 protesters had been killed. But, she said, “I don’t care.”
Weeks later, Sudan tumbled into war. Fighting between rival military factions in mid-April rippled across Khartoum, then the country. On the third day of fighting, a stray shell punched through Abdelgadir’s home, sending it up in flames. She fled with her family to the countryside. By September, she was planning to leave Sudan and even the continent.
Even then, she insisted she would be back to finish what she had started. “We will take to the streets again,” she texted the night before boarding a bus taking her over Sudan’s border into Ethiopia. “The democracy we dream of will come.”
Militants Spreading
While some take flight, others pick up a gun.
In the Sahel, the semiarid region bordering the Sahara that runs across the African continent, tens of thousands of teenagers have joined militant groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. They bring havoc in their wake — thousands of civilians killed, 5 million forced from their homes, and political destabilization that has led to a string of military coups.
But the main driver of this powerful insurgency is not an extremist ideology or religious belief, according to a U.N. study of 1,000 former fighters from eight countries. Instead, researchers found, the single biggest reason for joining a militant group was the simple desire to have a job.
Modu Ali, from a poor family with 10 children in northern Nigeria, had barely finished primary school when he joined the extremist group Boko Haram, over a decade ago. His goal was to “fight for the rights of the deprived,” he said. “Instead, it ruined my life.” He surrendered and joined a rehabilitation program for former fighters.
The Sahel leads the world in two ways. It is the global center of extremist violence, accounting for 43% of all such deaths in 2022, according to the Global Terrorism Index. And it has the highest birthrates — on average seven children per woman in Niger and northern Nigeria, six in Mali and Chad, and five in Sudan and Burkina Faso.
High birthrates alone do not cause insurgencies.
But they are a major accelerant when combined with weak states and deep poverty.
A warming planet is also a major factor, erasing livelihoods and driving people to desperation.
These factors are why many view the Sahel as the most worrisome manifestation of Africa’s “youthquake.”
One key to tackling that problem lies with teenage girls like Asiya Saidu.
Like many in Zaria, a Muslim-majority city in northern Nigeria, Saidu expected to be married by 14 and to have her first child soon after. “My uncle was hellbent on finding me a husband,” she recalled.
Instead, she enrolled at the Center for Girls Education, a U.S.-funded program that has helped as many as 70,000 girls to stay in school and ultimately have smaller families.
Educating girls has an unusually large effect on family size in Africa because it delays the age of marriage and helps young women to space out their children, researchers have found. “It’s a natural kind of birth control,” said Habiba Mohammed, the program’s director.
Saidu, now 17, recently applied for nursing school.
“I do want to get married,” she said. But first, she said, “I want to be independent and learn to support myself.”
The Future Is Already Here
It could be that Africa will undergo transformations that are hard to see now.
When economist Ha-Joon Chang was growing up in South Korea in the 1960s, his country was subjected to the same condescension and racism leveled at many African nations today, he said. It was poor, had just emerged from war and was seen by American officials as a basket case.
“Nobody took us seriously,” said Chang, now a professor of economics at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.
That South Korea has become one of the world’s largest economies shows how success can strike in the most unlikely places, Chang added: “With time and effort, remarkable transformations are possible.”
A young population was a big part of South Korea’s success, Chang said. But it took other ingredients, too: visionary leaders, wise policies and education, as well as intangibles like drive, innovation and sheer good fortune, he said. “A lot of things have to work together.”
Could Africa’s youth boom portend a similar miracle?
This year’s surging turmoil — new crises, new wars and new economic slumps — would give pause to the greatest of optimists. Yet there are also reasons to hope.
“I tell my friends in England that the time will come when they will put out a red carpet for those guys now coming in boats,” said Ibrahim, the philanthropist.
African countries have a vital resource that aging societies are losing: a youthful population brimming with energy, ideas and creativity that will shape their future and the world’s.
Some, like Nedye Astou Touré, are already reaching for the stars.
Touré, a 23-year-old student, stood over a pile of old aircraft parts at a university lab in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. Her eyes gleamed with anticipation. “It’s for a rocket,” she said of the pile.
She and another senior at the university hope to launch their projectile more than 300 feet into the air, a first step toward building a low-orbit satellite.
It might take a while, Touré admitted. But while others with such grand dreams have typically left Africa behind, she wanted to show it can be done at home.
“Just wait,” she said. “Three years from now, you might be hearing about us.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: His comments on the Mideast conflict have been the subject of news reports, but the polarizing coverage has ignored how comics have treated the situation.
Halfway through a sold-out show at the PNC Arena in Raleigh, N.C., on Wednesday, Dave Chappelle stopped to ask the audience about screaming coming from the balcony. "I'm scared it might be the Jews coming for me," he said, a mischievous tone in his gravelly voice.
This was a reference to a previous show, in Boston, where Chappelle's criticism of Israeli policies reportedly led to cheers and pushback from the crowd, hundreds of walkouts and one patron posting online that she never felt more "unsafe." Press descriptions of the event were often vague. The reports of cheers for Hamas didn't specify if they were coming from one person or a large group. But what seems clear from the reports is that along with defending Harvard students who had signed a letter saying Israel was "entirely responsible" for the violence, Chappelle had denounced the Oct. 7 massacre of Israelis and got sidetracked when someone in the crowd told him to be quiet.
Chappelle's follow-up show on Wednesday was as much the work of a diplomat as a provocateur, telling the audience to pray for both Israelis and Palestinians and calling the situation for both a nightmare. At one point, he addressed American Jews, saying, "Whatever they can do to take the violence or the danger out of a situation, they should do it." Then he added, "I'm not about antisemitism, but I'm allowed to disagree with whoever I want to."
Chappelle, wearing a sleeveless flannel shirt that hung down to his thighs, never figured out what the commotion at the top of the arena was about, but he said he had heard someone say there was a medical issue. Chain-smoking, Chappelle made a few jokes, then added: "You know what it will say in the paper tomorrow: Dave Chappelle makes fun of man as he dies."
It's an understandable complaint. Of course, Chappelle seeks out contentious subjects -- his lawyerly explanation of the antisemitism of Kanye West on "Saturday Night Live" last year does not help his cause in this current controversy -- and no one exaggerates their own victimhood more. He's still saying, "Any minute they're going to cancel me" despite the fact that he's performing for huge crowds and has another Netflix special on the way. But the media attention that Chappelle's comedy gets is obsessive, polarized and often tediously literal.
It brings to mind one of the most memorable bits of this century, his 2004 joke about Ja Rule being asked to weigh in on Sept. 11. Mocking how our media ask celebrities to be sober authorities making sense of tragic events, Chappelle said, "I want some answers that Ja Rule might not have right now."
This joke has aged tremendously well. Social media has only amplified the opinions of the Ja Rules of the world. The algorithms that run our feeds are making sure you have Justin Bieber and Gigi Hadid to explain the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Now every corporation and middle school seems to have its own foreign policy. Comedians have been perhaps the most outspoken of artists, with Sarah Silverman and Amy Schumer consistently commenting on Israel and antisemitism on social media, earning praise and condemnation. The comic Bassem Youssef went viral for his appearance on Piers Morgan's show. Obviously, in a democratic society, it's important for people to feel free to speak out on matters of gravity, and an emotional response on this issue is not only understandable but necessary. But it's also reasonable to think that you should want some answers that Dave Chappelle might not have right now.
Chappelle is a tricky case, because since his Ja Rule joke, he has embraced the sober truth-teller role, telling magnetic stories that sometimes end in lessons, not punchlines. His take on Israel has been mostly sober, but other comics are incorporating the issue into their work. Matt Ruby put 10 minutes of his jokes from a club set online, defending himself by saying, "This is how Jews handle crisis." The German stand-up Shahak Shapira released a 25-minute special, "Baklavas From Gaza." Both sounded like rough drafts, but they seem motivated less by a blunt interest in changing hearts and minds than in comforting them.
The seeming hopelessness of the conflict in the Middle East has always drawn comics looking to push buttons. In one of the most high-risk "Saturday Night Live" monologues ever, Louis C.K. likened Israelis and Palestinians to his daughters fighting, with him as America trying to mediate. Since he had sandwiched this metaphor between a joke about his "mild racism" and another about trying to understand pedophilia, he managed the feat of making the subject seem safe.
In recent years, several sharp Muslim comics have made funny comedy on television from the Palestinian perspective. In "Mo," set in Texas, the Palestinian American comic Mo Amer, who plays a likable fool, gives his pitcher nephew a pep talk on the mound of a Little League game, telling the boy that he's a Palestinian so "if there's one thing you can do is throw things accurately." Then, as another adult tries to shuttle him off the field, he advises the boy to imagine a tank coming at him.
This show was created with another comic, Ramy Youssef, whose own superb, self-named Hulu series, "Ramy," recorded an episode in Israel portraying daily life in the occupied territories of the West Bank, including the tedium of waiting at a checkpoint to cross over. Playing a jerky American bull in a China shop, Youssef tries to relate to a Palestinian love interest by saying he gets it, comparing the experience to traffic at the Lincoln Tunnel. Both these shows humanize the Palestinian experience in ways that feel new.
No one has been funnier on this least funny of subjects than Larry David and an episode of his "Curb Your Enthusiasm" about an incredible Palestinian chicken restaurant that causes controversy by moving next door to a Jewish deli. It's invariably high on lists of the greatest installments of the series. It ended with David walking between competing protest groups: one from the chicken restaurant led by his Palestinian girlfriend (dirty talk during sex includes her calling him an occupier and him quoting Theodor Herzl) and another made up of many of his Jewish friends waving signs in front of a deli.
The anguished look on David's face, eyes bulging, face contorting in confusion, has become a popular meme. It's used so often that people don't even realize what it refers to. My sense from Chappelle's show is that he could relate.
While Chappelle still jokes about transgender people, which was the focus of his last special, his new hour, due in December, throws fewer bombs than his last one. It's a bit humbler and even has a silly side along with some moony philosophizing about the Will Smith slap, with him calling Smith and Chris Rock "fellow dreamers I met along the way."
In Raleigh, the one time he told the crowd he would do a "dangerous joke," it turned out to be something like a parody of one: "Two Jews walk into a bar. I'd say the punchline, but there might be a transgender person here." He smiled as if he knew how corny this sounded.
When a woman in the audience yelled out, "Free Palestine," he told her he heard her but added: "Don't start that up or there will be a news cycle for another week."

Inspired Use Of Scissors And Bodies: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A show at the Japan Society focuses on four innovators who created a blueprint for a new society with postcards, scissors, chess sets and instructions.
Squatting over a large paper surface with a paintbrush dangling between her legs. Sitting onstage at Carnegie Hall while audience members come up to snip her clothing off with scissors. Blowing soap bubbles to make musical sounds. These are some of the actions taken in the name of art in "Out of Bounds: Japanese Women Artists in Fluxus" at the Japan Society, an exhibition that focuses on four revolutionary women, Shigeko Kubota, Takako Saito, Mieko Shiomi, and one you've probably heard of before, Yoko Ono.
Fluxus was founded in the early 1960s and paved the way for Conceptual art, Minimalism, performance and video. It saw the future in other words. Rather than create traditional paintings or sculpture, these artists did things like play games, mail postcards, cook meals and offer instructions inspired by notated musical scores. (The composer John Cage was a central figure.) There was a logic -- or anti-logic -- to this approach. Serious, "rational" society had produced mass destruction in the 20th century. Maybe novel methods of producing culture could serve as a salvo or blueprint for a new society.
But by focusing on four Japanese women, the show asks: Who stands the test of time? Who doesn't? Was Fluxus really a blueprint for the future? The exhibition, organized by Midori Yoshimoto and Tiffany Lambert, with Ayaka Iida, features around 150 objects, which range from boxes full of curious objects to videos, films and photographs.
One of the things that's obvious immediately is just how international Fluxus was -- a portent of today's much more global art world. Kubota and Shiomi moved to New York in 1964 -- partly because they felt their career prospects were limited in Japan -- and quickly became involved with Fluxus. Kubota focused on everyday activities, preparing meals and making "Flux Napkins" (c. 1967).
Kubota's infamous "Vagina Painting" (1965) was a performance in which she either attached a paintbrush to her underwear or inserted the brush into her body (the details of this are left a little unclear) and waddled over a large paper surface. The idea of "birthing" a painting and using the body in such a crudely basic way was echoed in feminist art by Ana Mendieta and Marina Abramovic, or Carolee Schneemann's "Interior Scroll" (1975), which consisted of pulling a written text out of her own vagina. In many ways, this serves as a precursor of all the bodily performance you see in the art world today.
Kubota was also a pioneering video artist. (A recent exhibition at MoMA showcased a handful of her video sculptures.) One of her works here, "Video Poem" (1970-75), features a monitor playing close-up images of her face as she nestles inside a sleeping bag. It is a sweet, somewhat sad work (the sleeping bag was her ex-boyfriend's), but not a blockbuster.
Technology and its relationship with the body was a mainstay of Fluxus, as it was for other Fluxus artists like Nam June Paik, in the postwar era. Information theory was burgeoning alongside game theory -- and games. These artists seized upon chess, a medieval war and strategy game, approaching it in an absurd, playful way, giving it exalted status.
Saito's wildly imaginative and beautifully crafted chess sets are among the best works here. Saito's "Sound Chess" from around 1977 is an interactive artwork in the form of a series of identical-looking wooden cubes containing different unknown objects (actually buttons, beans and bells). Pick them up and shake them, or attempt to play using hearing, memory and touch.
The artist's "Grinder Chess" (c. 1964) uses mechanical drill attachments as chess pieces and designs chess sets made with tiny booklets as playing pieces or a glove as a board. What does it mean to remake chess? It means, quite literally, to remake the rules of the game. And yet, chess has become popular again, on the internet and the Netflix mini-series "The Queen's Gambit" (2020). (For another take on chess in the art world, head downtown to Hamishi Farah's paintings at Maxwell Graham's gallery on the Lower East Side, where paintings of traditional black and white chess pieces are explored in a racial context.)
Mieko Shiomi came out of experimental music and improvisation, and that is her strongest suit. A projected video here shows her performing in 1961 with Group Ongaku, a Japanese noise and sound ensemble, blowing soap bubbles. (The video also includes the artist Yasunao Tone, a founding member of the Japanese section of Fluxus who will be performing at the Japan Society in conjunction with this show.)
Shiomi also created "action poems," including "Event for Late Afternoon" (1963) that consisted of lowering a violin from the top of a building to street level without making a sound. Long before the internet and its instant global connections, her "Spatial Poem" treated communication as a network. Shiomi provided participants with cards and instructions to write something on them, place them somewhere and report back to her. Then, like a social scientist, she would track and map the results. These are nice, poetic gestures, but don't carry the punch of some of the others.
And then there was Yoko Ono. Her famous "Cut Piece" performed in New York in 1965 and filmed by the Maysles Brothers, is on view here. You see Ono sitting onstage at Carnegie Hall while members of the audience come up and cut off her clothing. "Cut Piece" -- like her terrific "Grapefruit," a book of instructions and drawings that invited readers to do things like laugh, cough or scream for various durations -- has been performed by people around the world, taking on a new meaning based on the time and the setting.
Of course, Ono became best known outside the avant-garde art world as the partner of John Lennon -- and, for decades, a scapegoat for the breakup of the Beatles, which many consider to be a convenient misogynist and anti-Asian claim. On the other hand, Ono's infiltrating the Beatles might be among her best, unacknowledged performances ever. (What if Taylor Swift was showing up at art openings instead of football stadiums? That would be a game-changer.)
Peter Jackson's recent film about the making of the last Beatles album, "Let It Be" (1970), captured Ono sitting in the studio doing Fluxus-y things: painting at an easel, eating a pastry, paging through a Lennon fan magazine. As Amanda Hess observed in The New York Times, it's "as if she is staging a marathon performance piece, and in a way, she is."
The American artist David Horvitz flips this scenario with a T-shirt that reads: "John Lennon Broke Up Fluxus." This isn't 100% true: George Maciunas, the Lithuanian-born artist who was a driving force behind Fluxus, died in 1978 and the movement foundered after that. After wedding Lennon in 1969 though, Ono did become apprehensive about performing "Cut Piece" -- that is, sitting alone onstage as strangers approached her clutching scissors. (Ono's wild, proto-punk music is now considered by some to be more radical and interesting than Lennon's solo musical efforts.)
Like the Horvitz T-shirt, "Out of Bounds" offers a new way of thinking about Fluxus, placing Japanese women's contributions at the center, and white European and American men in supporting roles. With a roster of ongoing activities, the exhibition also seems to suggest that maybe Fluxus never broke up at all, but continues every time we play "Sound Chess" or follow Ono's "Grapefruit" instructions; listen to a heartbeat or the sound of the earth turning; step in all the puddles in a city or, as she suggested in "Map Piece" (1964), "Draw a map to get lost."
The current art world is characterized by biennials, art fairs and the art market. This runs counter to the ethos of Fluxus, which focused on more ephemeral gestures and less on objects of value. And yet, the whole contemporary art world runs like a giant, high-stakes game. Who is visible? Who is marketable? Who counts? Maybe, with its emphasis on randomness and chance, Fluxus predicted something it didn't even realize, and Ono & Company plotted, one canny gesture at a time, the world we live in.

Full text: "Creepshow," "The Fall of the House of Usher" and other shows serve up humor with their horror.
Sorting through the seasonal bounty of horror and supernatural television series timed to Halloween, I have focused on shows that approach the grim task with a sense of humor. Here, in alphabetical order, are five series released this month that put more emphasis on wit than on sheer terror.
'30 Coins'
The Spanish filmmaker Álex de la Iglesia careens through the conventions of the religious conspiracy thriller in this preposterous and highly enjoyable series that combines a "Da Vinci Code"-style premise with extremes of gore and a circling, tenuously comprehensible plot.
In the first season, a Spanish village became the site of a battle among Roman Catholic cabals and emissaries of Satan over Judas's 30 pieces of silver, which if collected would give their owner unimagined power. Or something like that. Fighting back against these forces of evil was a motley crew that included a renegade priest, the village's unhappily married mayor and a plucky veterinarian.
In Season 2, which premiered this week on HBO and Max, the apocalypse has been averted but its likelihood is still palpable, and the number of creepy beasts in the manner of Bosch and Guillermo del Toro has exponentially increased. Also joining the show is Paul Giamatti as a science-fiction-writing cult leader who is human in form but as frightening as any beast.
'Creepshow'
Now in its fourth season on the horror-centric streaming service Shudder (as well as AMC+), this anthology series wears its comic-book sensibility and B-movie aesthetic proudly. And the best of its 22-minute stories (two per episode) also exhibit the cleverness and industriousness that contribute to real pop-culture satisfaction. You'll see the first twist coming, but the second and the third may take you by surprise.
"Creepshow" doesn't reach too far for its inspirations -- Season 4's familiar scenarios include a persecuted vampire family, a werewolf in a "Little Red Riding Hood" situation, a haunted video game and a cursed pair of 3-D glasses.
But along with its unpretentious nature comes a willingness to be self-referential and provide fan service, and some of its most entertaining segments are unabashed in-jokes. The Season 4 opener, "The Hat," suggests that the novels of a writer strongly resembling Stephen King were actually composed by a snappy homburg that refuses to stop writing. In "George Romero in 3-D," Romero comes back to life in animated form to battle ghouls of his own creation. King and Romero were, of course, the writer and director of the 1982 film "Creepshow" from which the series was spun off.
'The Fall of the House of Usher'
Mike Flanagan's fifth horror mini-series for Netflix (a collection that began with "The Haunting of Hill House") is, if you care about consistency with the source, a serious mismatch. The genuinely morbid intensity of Edgar Allan Poe's writing, on prominent display in "The Fall of the House of Usher," is out of tune with Flanagan's well-upholstered, tongue-in-cheek, slightly synthetic approach to horror, where everything is right there on the surface.
But that surface is often diverting, if not particularly frightening or memorable, and Flanagan can be counted on for large, capable casts. The eight-episode "Usher" offers Bruce Greenwood and Zach Gilford as current and past versions of Roderick Usher, reimagined as a Sackler-like big-pharma executive; Carl Lumbly as a prosecutor named Auguste Dupin; a raspy Mark Hamill as a corporate fixer named Arthur Gordon Pym; and T'Nia Miller as an Usher offspring named Victorine Lafourcade. The Flanagan regular Carla Gugino cycles through costumes and makeup, "Kind Hearts and Coronets"-style, as a seductive angel of death.
Dupin, Pym, Lafourcade and many others are named after Poe characters who had nothing to do with "Usher," an indication of how Flanagan's series is less an adaptation of the original -- it isn't really that at all -- than a Frankenstein's-monster collage of references to numerous Poe stories and poems. Episode titles -- "Murder in the Rue Morgue," "The Pit and the Pendulum" -- clue you in to the style of gruesome death that's about to take place. Passages of Poe's prose and poetry are frequently incorporated into the dialogue, making for very flowery conversations. Gugino's character is named Verna, an anagrammatic nod to Poe's favorite bird.
Flanagan's biggest change is to expand and update the story into a carnivalesque critique of capitalist greed and inhumanity. Roderick Usher, childless in the original story, now has six heirs whose lives are a catalog of wealth-and-entitlement motifs: nightclub bacchanals, sex with subordinates, wellness profiteering, antiquities looting, crisis management, A.I. infatuation, baking silly trompe l'oeil cakes. Poe's Ushers were doomed by malaise and sheer malevolent ambience; Flanagan's have to die because they're a virus on the earth. As apocalyptic metaphors go, his "Usher" is reasonably entertaining.
'Shining Vale'
Jeff Astrof and Sharon Horgan's series cunningly blends horror, satire and situation comedy in its picture of a modern American woman's dilemma: Has Pat Phelps, the struggling writer played by Courteney Cox, been driven crazy by the stresses of marriage, motherhood and career? Or does she act like a crazy person because her house is haunted and she's fighting off demonic possession?
The first season of "Shining Vale" on Starz was a riff on "The Shining," with Pat eventually taking an ax to her suburban Connecticut manse and to her feckless husband, played with simpering perfection by Greg Kinnear. Season 2, whose third episode premieres Friday, tackles another celebrated film, "Rosemary's Baby"; the herbal tea a neighbor provides to calm Pat's nerves after her release from a psychiatric ward has the unexpected side effect of reversing her menopause.
The avenging (but often friendly) spirit played by Mira Sorvino in Season 1 has supposedly been electro-convulsed out of Pat's head, but luckily Sorvino returns, now playing the concerned neighbor. She and Kinnear, along with a stellar supporting cast that includes Judith Light, Merrin Dungey, Parvesh Cheena, Allison Tolman and the great Harriet Sansom Harris (Bebe in the original "Frasier"), bring a comic harmony to the show's indelicate balance of tones.
'Wolf Like Me'
A melancholy Australian romantic dramedy with werewolves, Peacock's "Wolf Like Me" mixes tones and tropes in the manner of "Shining Vale" but with a quieter, less satirical effect. When "Shining Vale" sags, it goes flatly jokey; when "Wolf Like Me" runs out of energy, it gets blandly sentimental.
But when the creator, writer and director of "Wolf Like Me," Abe Forsythe, is on his game, it's a funny, lovely and moving show that can tap straight into your emotions. Also crucial are the performances of Isla Fisher as Mary, an American werewolf hiding from the world in Adelaide, Australia, and the young actress Ariel Donoghue as Emma, a girl devastated by the loss of her mother who becomes Mary's de facto stepdaughter and develops a fierce loyalty to her. Josh Gad plays Gary, Emma's father and Mary's unlikely new boyfriend, and does a nice job of staying out of Fisher and Donoghue's way.
Season 1 brought this accidental trio together, introduced a teasing note of magical realism (along with the outright full-moon supernaturalism) and established the theme of love's triumph over grief and alienation. In Season 2, the focus shifts to Mary's pregnancy, which is both a blessed event and a five-alarm crisis. Forsythe's inventiveness occasionally runs low, and the characters can get strident and unengaging, but he builds to an exciting and wrenching finale that's also a dire cliffhanger.

Yellow Door: '90s Lo-Fi Film Club: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: This documentary is both a look at a small, obsessive film club that formed in the early '90s in South Korea and an origin story of the director Bong Joon Ho, who was in the group.
Every filmmaker, including the great ones, starts somewhere -- even if that means making a low-rent stop-motion short called "Looking for Paradise" that's about a stuffed gorilla searching for freedom while fighting a caterpillar that emerged from its fecal matter. That was how a young, student Bong Joon Ho made his debut, a saga detailed in "Yellow Door: '90s Lo-Fi Film Club," a charming documentary about a cohort of South Korean cinephiles formed in 1992.
Before becoming one of the world's most acclaimed contemporary auteurs (through movies including ("Parasite," "Okja" and "Snowpiercer"), Bong found an education as part of this tiny, makeshift film academy made up of graduate students and other film lovers. The documentary, directed by Lee Hyuk-rae (who was part of the group), gathers the club members to reminisce about these early days, when they'd congregate in a yellow-painted office to watch and study bootleg VHS copies of art-house movies.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Their interests were representative of what was then a larger, budding wave of South Korean cinephile culture that would produce major talent, including Bong and the filmmaker Park Chan-wook, though most of the other members of this particular group went on to have careers outside of film.
The documentary carries a couple of interesting insights into Bong's own origins: There's a surprisingly profound kernel of emotional acuteness in his amateur debut, along with an early instance of the motif of basements that shows up in many of his later films. But the doc mostly amounts to a sweet nostalgia trip about a niche group of obsessive young people. It's also an ode to young adulthood itself: For most of the group, latching on to cinema was simply a means of finding a community, and themselves.

Grit, Glamour and a Deadly Drug: [Review]

Full text: In David Yates's film, Emily Blunt plays a single mother who takes a job at a pharmaceutical start-up with questionable sales methods.
"Pain Hustlers," a conflicted yet entertaining dramedy from David Yates, takes its title from a group of pitchmen hawking fentanyl to clinics across the southeast. The drug is legal. Their sales methods aren't -- but in the mockumentary footage that opens the film, they try to sell the audience on their innocence. One pusher (Catherine O'Hara) huffs defensively that she's not "El Chapo or something."
The script, by Wells Tower, is about a fictive drug named Lonafen. It's inspired by the journalist Evan Hughes's coverage of Insys Therapeutics, whose founder, John Kapoor, was convicted and served two years in prison. Like so many other recent movies on brands from Blackberry to Beanie Babies, it's about how low people will sink to make a buck while justifying their misdeeds as the cost of successful capitalism. Turns out the price of a soul is pretty cheap.
Our way into the story is Liza Drake (Emily Blunt), a single mother who once peddled lipstick, steak knives, and pig dung, and is scraping by as a stripper when a skeevy patron, Pete (Chris Evans), enlists her into pharmaceutical sales. Her new boss, a widower named Dr. Neel (Andy Garcia), invented a fast-acting fentanyl spray for cancer patients like his late wife. Within months, Liza propels Lonafen's market penetration from zero to 86 percent.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Liza is an enthralling huckster. In one great bit, she fast-talks a principal out of expelling her daughter (a promising Chloe Coleman) for nearly burning down the school. She's also an amalgamation of several real people from Hughes's book, "The Hard Sell," which makes the character feel overstuffed with multiple personalities that flip-flop between greed and guilt. Both Blunt and the woman she's playing come off as hard-working charmers, but it's impossible to buy that Liza is at once Lonafen's savviest employee and the only naïf who believes the drug is, as she insists, "safer than aspirin."
It's not, of course. Beanie Babies fanatics lost fortunes; Lonafen users are losing their lives. The movie is constrained by its own conscience, thriving when Evans's marvelously feral Pete is unleashed to dress like a Lonafen spray and rap about sales commissions, only to pivot apologetically from corporate bacchanals to suffering victims. There's a wonderful, hallucinatory shot of a hooked veteran (Willie Raysor) gazing across a car lot at an inflatable sky dancer whose sagging limbs are slowed down to become an interpretive dance of addiction. Other junkies are merely sketches of mass misery, such as the anonymous horde of extras instructed to stumble toward Liza like zombies.
The scariest characters, however, are the doctors. The strip mall lonely-heart Dr. Lydell (Brian d'Arcy James) writes narcotic prescriptions in exchange for fancy macarons, phony flattery from women, and cash costumed as speaking engagement fees. (One savagely funny young drug hustler played by Colby Burton even traffics in sexual favors.) Here, only the fictional Liza frets over the patients while the increasingly money-mad Dr. Neel vows to push Lonafen onto people without cancer. "Grow or die!" he orders his sales team -- the language of a tumor.

Cricket-Crazy Diaspora Grabs Eye of Big Media: [National Desk]

Full text: Investors are trying to capitalize on the relatively small -- but loyal and growing -- audience for the sport.
Right after morning prayers on a Saturday this month, members of the Masjid Quba mosque in Brooklyn joined a party.
In between bites of halwa and sips of chai at Lahori Chilli on the edge of the Midwood neighborhood -- the center of Little Pakistan -- patrons offered hopeful, yet measured, commentary. Pakistan was taking on India, its fiercest on-field and geopolitical rival, during the men's cricket World Cup in India.
"Pakistan and India is simply a thrill," said Nisar Khan, 49, who moved from Pakistan 18 years ago.
For decades, early-morning communal gatherings were the only way for the South Asian diaspora to experience cricket matches. Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi Americans would pack restaurants, movie theaters and student unions to connect, through pay-per-view telecasts, with the game and culture they had left behind.
These days, those watch parties are more sparse. More and more, fans can simply watch games from their living rooms. Recognizing the growing clout of South Asian Americans, media companies have invested heavily in cricket in recent years. ESPN and Willow TV, owned by the Times of India Group, share the American rights for this year's World Cup. The Pakistan-India match, like others from the tournament, was streamed on ESPN+.
"I see this the same as I see anime on Netflix," said Michael Pachter, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities. It's "a very small slice of their overall subscriber base, but a rabid group of fans who love the content."
It is one of a number of ways that various companies are trying to capitalize on the relatively small -- but loyal and growing -- audience for cricket in the United States.
Investors have poured more than $ 1 billion to expand the sport in the United States, and spent more than $ 100 million to build cricket stadiums for a new league. The league's team owners include Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft; the Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan; and Mukesh Ambani, an Indian telecommunications businessman.
The sport will be played at the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, the first time in more than a century that cricket will be included. Next year's Twenty20 World Cup -- a truncated version of this year's event, with matches that take much less time -- will take place in North America. India and Pakistan will also play their first match on U.S. soil as part of the tournament.
But where businesses and politicians see an opportunity, many of the five million Americans of South Asian descent see the game -- and life -- they left thousands of miles away.
Whether all of this ultimately succeeds will be largely determined by fans like Bhaveshkumar Davda, who was born in India but grew up in New York City in the 1980s. In the early 2000s, Mr. Davda, 52, had to go to movie theaters to watch cricket, but he was able to watch the Pakistan-India match this month at home. After the game, he donned an Indian cricket hat and a Knicks starter jacket while walking on the street in Jersey City's Little India, jubilant over India's victory.
"Everybody loves to watch cricket," Mr. Davda said. "Even the old people, even the young."
While many Americans unfamiliar with cricket view the sport with curiosity, the scale of its global popularity is undeniable, largely because of the intense interest from South Asians.
When the Indian national team plays a big match, workdays are frequently interrupted, stores close and routines otherwise grind to a halt. The India streaming service Hotstar, which Disney owns, said 35 million people had viewed the Pakistan-India match on the service. The Indian cricket star Virat Kohli has more Instagram followers than the N.B.A.'s LeBron James.
Satyan Gajwani, the vice chairman of the digital arm of the Times of India Group and one of the investors trying to increase interest for cricket in the United States, said focusing on Indians who lived outside India was a big part of Willow's strategy. He noted the affluence of Indian Americans, who make up a majority of the South Asian population in the United States. According to the latest census estimates, Indian Americans have the highest median household income of any group in the country.
"This is what should be a powerful and lucrative and well-served audience," he said. "From a business perspective, this seemed like something you could build something around."
Today, Willow reaches four million U.S. households and is distributed on carriers like DirecTV, Dish and Comcast, a far cry from when it began in 2003 as a site that offered often unreliable streams of international matches. It has been helped along by the growth of the South Asian American population -- which doubled from 2010 to 2020 -- and the overall improvement of streaming infrastructure.
Before it started streaming cricket, ESPN bought Cricinfo (now known as ESPNcricinfo), a website dedicated to cricket coverage, in 2007. The site now brings in millions of hits in traffic every month. John Lasker, senior vice president for ESPN+, said ESPN's cricket coverage had helped it reach "fans we weren't serving before."
After sharing the rights to this year's World Cup with ESPN, Willow owns most rights to stream and broadcast the sport to North American audiences for the next five years. It's also the media partner of the new domestic professional league, Major League Cricket, which played its inaugural season in July.
Cricket had long struggled to break through in the United States. Upstart leagues flamed out because of a lack of funding and organization, while the U.S. cricket federation was expelled from the International Cricket Council amid financial woes. Media companies like Nimbus and Zee Media found little success broadcasting Indian matches in America.
But the success of Twenty20, cricket's shortest format, and the continued immigration and increasing clout of South Asian Americans elevated the game.
In test cricket, the oldest and most traditional form of the sport, matches can last as long as five days and produce no result, a fact that often baffles American sports fans. Test matches are somber affairs that stop for tea and refreshment breaks, with both teams wearing white uniforms. Even one-day matches, as in this year's World Cup, can last up to eight hours.
At Twenty20 matches, which take only three hours, each side wears colorful garb as pop music blares in between balls and cheerleaders keep the energy high. Their shorter format incentivizes the sport's most exciting aspects: big hits and run chases.
Cricket could still struggle to gain widespread backing. While the South Asian population is booming, the community represents a tiny slice of TV audiences.
But cricket fans bring an outsize level of intensity and commitment. According to data from Comscore, the typical Willow viewer watched the channel for more than 24 hours per month, nearly twice as much as ESPN and nearly four times as much as the MLB Network.
Now, the key to expanding the sport in the United States is catering to the less rabid observers. Watching, playing and experiencing cricket up close is what can bring cricket "beyond just the pure South Asian diaspora," Mr. Gajwani said.
Morrisville, N.C., was one of two host cities for Major League Cricket's inaugural season, with sellout crowds of more than 3,500 for each match in late July. Vendors at the stadium sold Indian ice cream and butter chicken, and lively Desi music embodied the raucous atmosphere. The South Asian population in Morrisville has grown rapidly over the past quarter-century, with immigrants drawn by high-paying tech jobs in the Research Triangle region.
The town was building a park for baseball around a decade ago, before deciding to dedicate it to cricket, realizing the sport was more popular locally, according to T.J. Cawley, the mayor of Morrisville. In July, Church Street Park was a site for Major League Cricket, and it hosts a local amateur cricket league.
Mr. Cawley, who grew up playing ultimate Frisbee in Westchester County outside New York, said he had also "played in the league for a few seasons."

At Some U.S. Universities, Donors Extend Influence: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: After the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, some major donors are aiming to shape the free-speech values and top leadership on campuses.
Some of the most powerful people in business have taken aim at universities over their responses to the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel and to accusations of antisemitism.
Marc Rowan, the chief executive of Apollo Global Management and a major donor to the University of Pennsylvania, has called for the resignation of the school's president and its chairman. Former Ambassador Jon Huntsman halted giving to the school, and Ron Lauder, the Estée Lauder cosmetics heir, said he was "re-examining" his financial support.
Donors accuse Penn of applying its free-speech values inconsistently. Clifford Asness, the chief investment officer at AQR Capital Management, wrote in a letter to the university's Wharton School this week that he had "long been dismayed at the drift away from true freedom of thought" and would not consider donating until "meaningful change was evident."
At Harvard, the Israeli billionaire Idan Ofer and the Victoria's Secret founder Leslie Wexner have cut ties with the school after student groups signed a petition blaming Israel for the Hamas attack.
Big donors to universities have long expected special treatment, like preference for their children's applications. But these demands aim to shape the universities' core values and unseat top leadership.
Universities helped create the expectation that donations come with influence. Like most nonprofits, U.S. universities foster relationships with some donors by offering them seats on the board of the trustees. The job comes with real power: Trustees vote on decisions like tenure and the selection of the university president. For smaller donors, schools sometimes offer membership to alumni councils or advisory circles, which don't come with fiduciary responsibilities but provide a platform for influencing decisions.
The question is how far the influence of individual donors should extend. "The job of a college or university president is very hard because, on the one hand, he or she has to keep the trustees happy -- because they are big givers and because they can fire the president," Edward Rock, a professor of law at New York University who specializes in corporate governance, said. "At the same time, he or she has to make sure that the university's academic mission is not compromised by external forces, whether they be political forces or economic forces."
This potential conflict is not new. In 1995, Yale returned a $ 20 million gift from a billionaire alumnus after he demanded selection of professors in the Western civilization program he funded. Leaders of Penn's faculty senate argued in a letter this week that donors pushing for the university's president and chairman to resign over a Palestinian literature festival that was held on campus, which the donors say presented antisemitic ideas, had similarly gone too far.
"Academic freedom is at the heart of our educational and research missions," they wrote. "And we demand that it remain free from internal or external pressure or coercion."
Even the best-funded universities work to keep big donors. The endowments of elite universities are as large as some of today's best-known funds. Penn has an endowment of $ 21 billion. Harvard has $ 50 billion. Even with these big coffers, the apparent exodus of money is meaningful, experts told DealBook.
The criticism from well-known businesspeople could influence smaller and future donors. And often, donors' contributions are allocated toward specific programs, which means there's less cash for universities to freely spend than headline sums might imply.
"No matter what, it's going to be a crunch to their operating fund," said Larissa Reece, a consultant at Ashley Rountree and Associates who advises schools on fund-raising. "Even Harvard, with their resources and endowments, still requires an annual fund to keep the basics of some things at the university running."
Not all of Penn's big donors are willing to withdraw support over the current debate. Blackstone Group's C.E.O., Jon Gray, who, alongside his wife, donated $ 55 million to Penn for cancer research and $ 10 million for supporting low-income children, said this week that he would continue to support the university despite Rowan's campaign.
"Those are long-term missions for us," Gray told Bloomberg. "The decision about her future," he added, referring to the university's president, "lies with the board of trustees at Penn." -- Lauren Hirsch
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Representative Jim Jordan is out as House speaker nominee. After the far-right Ohio lawmaker failed for a third time to win election as speaker on Friday, Republicans voted to drop him as the nominee. There is no consensus among Republicans about an alternative candidate, as the House remains paralyzed.
Netflix shares pop on strong subscriber growth. The streaming giant on Wednesday reported better-than-expected earnings, despite Hollywood strikes that have brought film and television production to a near standstill. Netflix added roughly nine million new subscribers last quarter, even as it stepped up its crackdown on password sharing. Investors also cheered news that it will raise prices on some subscription plans.
Jay Powell leaves the door open for more interest-rate increases. The Federal Reserve chair signaled on Thursday that the central bank was prepared to leave rates unchanged at its meeting in November, but that it could raise them later if data showed the economy was running too hot. Powell said policymakers were also closely monitoring geopolitical tensions. Turmoil in the Middle East has sent oil prices higher in recent days, which could push up inflation and weigh on growth.
The U.S. deficit doubled in the past year. Treasury reported a deficit of $ 1.7 trillion for the 2023 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, but the total actually hit $ 2 trillion once President Biden's student-loan plan and its demise are taken into account. Republicans have blamed the shortfall on excessive federal spending; Democrats point to the Trump tax cuts. The big culprit appears to be lower tax revenues unrelated to those cuts.
The right way to fail
Amy Edmondson, a management professor at Harvard Business School, is an expert on what makes teams and organizations successful. Her latest book, "Right Kind of Wrong," argues that a crucial piece of that puzzle is a willingness to fail.
DealBook spoke with Edmondson about why failure can be useful, if done right. The interview has been condensed and edited.
You call one of your concepts "intelligent failure." How does that differ from a mistake?
To have a mistake, there has to be a recipe to use and it wasn't used. An intelligent failure is one that occurs in new territory in pursuit of a goal, where you had good reason to believe what you tried might work.
You've written that a healthy relationship with failure allows people to "play to win" instead of "playing not to lose." What do you mean by that?
When we play to not lose, we don't take risks. We go for good enough. That's more certain compared to the stretch goals, and so it's much safer and more natural to do. But no innovation ever came that way.
How do business leaders avoid creating an organization that encourages people to play not to lose?
Organizations penalize people for things that go wrong rather than rewarding the well-intended, thoughtful, smart efforts that those failures represented. I've had countless managers at all levels tell me, "I was trying something new, I was innovating, our team learned a lot from it," only to later on in their annual performance review hear something along the lines of "Well, we see you made this mistake here, and we hold that against you."
How does your earlier work about "psychological safety" factor into how managers can create an environment where it's OK to fail?
Psychological safety is an environment where people believe that interpersonal risks can be taken, which is speaking up truthfully about what's really happening. And they believe they won't be penalized or punished or humiliated for that kind of candor. And so that's important both for innovation and to encourage people to take risks.
It's also crucial for preventing preventable failures. I'm all for preventing as many failures that are caused by error in known territory as humanly possible. And that can only happen when people are willing to speak up with concerns or questions about something and ask for help when they need it.
Is there an example that illustrates the wrong kind of failure?
Sam Bankman-Fried provides one of the most visible business failure stories in the news today. The massive failure of his company does not qualify as an intelligent one. Yes, it was a new territory; yes, he had done his homework and was deeply knowledgeable about technology and markets; and, yes, it was driven by a goal. But the size of the failure is far from helpful in providing valuable new knowledge about Bitcoin. And, rather than sincere experiments and genuine innovation, lying and deception were built into the business model for a long time.

A Spotlight on Korean Art: [SpecialSections]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There are at least five exhibitions of Korean art at major U.S. museums this fall. The featured works vary from early 12th-century stoneware to a sculpture made from soap.
This article is part of the Fine Arts & Exhibits special section on the art world's expanded view of what art is and who can make it.
When Hyunsoo Woo arrived in the United States in 1996, she was, in her words, "fresh off the boat" from South Korea. And she noticed something right away.
"Korean art was nowhere to be found" in American museums, even encyclopedic ones, said Ms. Woo, now the deputy director for collections and exhibitions at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. "I was very puzzled by that."
What a difference 27 years makes: This fall, there are at least five exhibitions of Korean art at major museums across the country.
The art they are featuring varies from an early 12th-century stoneware ewer to works made recently, like Lee Youngsil's lacquer on wood "Yeongchuksan Gamnodo (Nectar Ritual Painting)" (2022). The confluence of shows now represents the museum world's recognition that it must continue to expand its view of what kinds of art merit exhibition space. "The variety of these shows is really good to see," said Hyonjeong Kim Han, the senior curator of Asian art at the Denver Art Museum.
Two shows already on view are "The Shape of Time: Korean Art After 1989" at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, of which Ms. Woo was a co-curator, and "Only the Young: Experimental Art in Korea, 1960s-1970s" at New York's Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.
Forthcoming shows include the San Diego Museum of Art's "Korea in Color: A Legacy of Auspicious Images," opening on Oct. 28; "Lineages: Korean Art at the Met," opening Nov. 7 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; and "Perfectly Imperfect: Korean Buncheong Ceramics," on display at the Denver Art Museum from Dec. 3.
Many of the organizers of the shows are Korean-born or Korean American curators -- all of them women -- who have been gearing up for this moment for a long time.
"All these brilliant women are scattered around and all doing great work," said the Korean American collector Miyoung Lee, a trustee of the Whitney Museum of American Art who is based in New York.
The Korean influence is also felt more subtly in museum leadership positions. "It's so exciting that there's so much interest and activity in these fields," said Min Jung Kim, who was appointed director of the St. Louis Art Museum in 2021.
At the time, the museum touted her as the first female director of the institution in its 142 years, but she is also the first Korean-born director of a major U.S. art museum. (Ms. Kim has spent her whole career in the United States and is a U.S. citizen.)
Ms. Han is a co-curator of the Denver ceramics show, which looks at the buncheong stoneware tradition that flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries and still influences makers today. Among the featured pieces is "Barrel-Shaped Bottle with Peony Motif," made in the 1400s during the Joseon dynasty.
"Perfectly Imperfect" was organized with the National Museum of Korea; other of the fall's shows also get financial or organization support from Korean institutions.
Ms. Han, born and raised in Seoul, noted that "Korean galleries were often the last to be added" for museums with dedicated spaces for Asian art, usually only after galleries were established for Chinese and Japanese work. "Now, Korea is in a leading role," she added.
Ms. Woo of Philadelphia said that the specificity of the exhibitions represented a "maturing" on the part of both audiences and museums.
"Now, the museum audience is savvy enough to see and absorb the different aspects of Korean art," she said. "Previously, you'd have just a single masterpiece show that spanned the ages."
Ms. Woo's show, "The Shape of Time," features the work of 28 artists, including a new site-specific commission by Meekyoung Shin, "Eastern Deities Descended" (2023), a sculpture made from soap.
The show uses 1989 as its launching point, Ms. Woo said, because that year marked an opening up of Korean culture after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. The year also saw the South Korean government relax its rules on citizens traveling outside of the country.
She said that since that time, artists have been reflecting on Korea's tumultuous 20th century, from its annexation by Japan in 1910 to the division between North Korea and South Korea, and the Korean War.
"We all share that collective trauma," Ms. Woo said.
Kyung An, an associate curator of Asian art at the Guggenheim, said that her show, "Only the Young," tries to shed light on a movement from the 1960s and 1970s that may be less familiar to viewers than Pop, Conceptualism and Minimalism.
"There were multiple forms of art happening," said Ms. An, a co-curator of the show with Kang Soojung of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea. "It opens up an opportunity to tell a more diverse and plural story than we've seen before."
The exhibition includes some 80 works by various practitioners of what has become known as Korean Experimental Art (silheom misul), including Ha Chong-Hyun, Kim Kulim, Lee Kun-Yong and Sung Neung Kyung. One of the most eye-catching pieces is Jung Kangja's "Kiss Me" (1967/2001), a mouth-like mixed media sculpture framed by pink lips.
The Met's show casts its gaze internally, looking at how the museum has collected and shown Korean art throughout its 153-year history.
"The Korean presence at the Met started in the 1880s," said Eleanor Soo-ah Hyun, associate curator of Korean art at the museum. "The first objects were musical instruments. In 1892, we got a ceramic piece, which is not surprising, since that was in vogue at the time." The Met established its first permanent gallery of Korean art in 1998.
"Lineages" will largely feature ceramics and paintings, including Baik Nam-soon's "Paradise" (1936), a painted, eight-panel folding screen.
"It shows our collecting history," Ms. Hyun said of the lineup, but it also points to the future. "We're not as strong in Korean modern and contemporary work, and we hope to develop that."
As for the confluence of multiple Korean art shows in the same season, several of them were delayed by the pandemic, and coincidence may play a part in the clustering of shows this fall.
But the organizers see a larger trend in the culture, too.
"I do wonder if there's some sort of energy that we're all channeling," said Ms. Hyun of the Met, who is Korean American. "It's like when Hollywood has three asteroid movies at the same time."
Ms. An of the Guggenheim, who was born in Korea and grew up largely in England, said that her show has been in the works for nearly six years.
But she added that Korean culture has been exploding everywhere, from the Oscar-winning film "Parasite" to the hit Netflix show "Squid Game" and the worldwide popularity of K-pop music. To that list may be added the art fair Frieze Seoul, which had its sophomore outing in September.
The San Diego Museum of Art intends to capitalize on the larger trend, with a K-pop dance troupe set to perform on its front steps.
Their exhibition looks at how contemporary artists have adapted the polychrome painting tradition that stretches back to the Joseon Dynasty, which began in the 14th century. Works include Kim Sangdon's 2019-20 sculpture "Cart," a painted wood sculpture in a shopping cart.
"We're an encyclopedic museum, and this bridges eras and traditions," said Rachel Jans, an associate curator of modern and contemporary art at the museum and a co-curator of the show. It was organized with the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea, and the Korean Cultural Center of Los Angeles.
For Ms. Jans, such a show makes especially good sense at her museum given San Diego's population. "We have a large Korean American community here," she said.
Perhaps the best recommendation for the slate of shows as a whole is that curators are eagerly casting their eyes toward what is on display in other museums.
As Ms. An put it, "They're all going to be different. I can't wait to see them."

Cameo Was Flying High Until Its Wings Melted: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A start-up that offers fans a way to buy personalized videos from celebrities was supercharged by pandemic boredom and venture capital. All it had to do was grow forever.
Kenny G opened a meeting with a saxophone serenade. Paula Abdul judged an "American Idol"-style talent contest. "Hamilton" cast members performed. Lance Bass was there, hanging out. And when Robert Van Winkle, better known as Vanilla Ice, sang his 1990 hit, "Ice Ice Baby," flanked by 10-foot sparklers, he pulled the Sugar Ray frontman Mark McGrath onstage.
This was Cameopalooza 2021, a company retreat celebrating the meteoric rise of Cameo, an app and website where regular people could buy personalized videos from minor celebrities for as little as $ 1. Attendees feasted on seafood towers and fondue fountains at an upscale restaurant on the Chicago waterfront and partied into the night at a Hilton penthouse suite, where Jack Harlow, a TikTok-famous rapper, performed a private show.
Three hundred Cameo employees danced, took videos and basked in their good fortune to be a part of the Cameo "Fameo" -- the company's nickname for its employees and community of celebrities. They were on a rocket ship powered by D-list celebrities and pandemic loneliness.
The company was preparing to expand in every direction: crypto art, live events, merchandise, international; its co-founder and chief executive, Steven Galanis, now 35, was expert at straddling the line between business and pleasure. A former collegiate party promoter, he shared the lifestyle of Cameo's celebrity talent, jet setting between parties, sporting events and luxury homes in Miami, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Cameo had just raised $ 100 million on the audacious ambition to pioneer the "connection economy," landing a $ 1 billion "unicorn" valuation just a few years into its existence.
Now fueled by money from venture capitalists including SoftBank, the investor that powered so many of the previous decade's frothiest start-ups, Cameo could be so much more than just a quirky, semi-ironic video greetings business. Mr. Galanis and his co-founders decided to build "one of the most important, beloved consumer companies of the generation," as Mr. Galanis declared in a 2021 interview. "Something that can be as enduring as what Walt Disney did for the last century."
Investors and employees -- encouraged with a meme stock battle cry of "LFG!"("let's go!" with an expletive) -- believed the company's surging growth would continue forever.
A decade of near-zero interest rates, abundant venture cash and a steady tech boom gave no indication otherwise. A company like Cameo could afford to lose money forever, as long as it kept getting bigger. And American culture produced few things with such regularity as it did new celebrities.
What could go wrong?
The Mayor
Company lore traces Cameo's roots to a 2016 conversation between Mr. Galanis, then an account manager at LinkedIn, and his friend Martin Blencowe, an N.F.L. agent. Mr. Blencowe had asked Cassius Marsh, the former Seattle Seahawks linebacker, to record a congratulatory video for a friend who had just had a baby. As Mr. Blencowe described the friend's thrilled reaction, an idea took shape.
Mr. Galanis, a 2010 Duke University graduate, recruited a fellow alumnus and software engineer, Devon Townsend, to build it. In the spring of 2017, the website BookCameo.com launched with a tweet from Mr. Marsh, promising videos for around $ 20; Tori Spelling and niche Vine personalities like Evan Breen joined later that year. (Mr. Blencowe, 37, and Mr. Townsend, 33, who are also co-founders, still work at the company.)
For Mr. Galanis, Cameo, based in his hometown, Chicago, felt like the company the trio was destined to build. He and Mr. Blencowe were fresh from a short-lived production career. (Mr. Galanis still highlights their IMDb credits, which include a TV show called "SAF3," pronounced "safe," about an elite rescue task force.) Mr. Townsend had been a star on Vine, the short-lived, short-form video app.
"We lived in this world," Mr. Galanis said. "We didn't build this business by accident."
This article is based on interviews with Mr. Galanis and more than 30 current and former Cameo employees, investors and advisers as well as internal documents, screenshots and photographs.
Mr. Galanis sports a dark close-cropped beard and often wears either polos or Cameo-branded shirts and baseball caps. He's a self-assured pitchman who views himself as an ultra-connector, peppering conversation with references to business leaders he admires like Elon Musk.
He pointed to a 13-year-old college newspaper profile of the events company he ran at Duke, with the headline "The Mayor of Main Street." He said it offered "pretty important" context for why he was able to build Cameo. The article, which is topped with a photo of Mr. Galanis flashing a thumbs-up while drinking a Busch Light, describes how he made a name for himself by befriending local venues and organizing huge parties, like a beer-pong event that was viewed as innovative for taking place on a weeknight at Shooters, a spot that was normally a sweaty dance club with a cage. (He also took credit for an "April Showers" party, featuring coeds in wet T-shirts.)
To grow in the early days, Cameo started recruiting anyone with a shred of fame to its platform, taking a 25 percent cut of videos that cost fans as much as $ 3,000. People could describe the message they wanted their celeb of choice to send: a birthday wish, a pep talk, a roast. The resulting videos were strange and amazing to receive -- Did Dennis Rodman really just tell me to have a great night?
Cameo worked best for people who were "more famous than they are rich," Mr. Galanis would say. And by the 2010s, there were plenty of those people. The old star system of movies and network shows had been displaced by YouTube channels and viral moments and the rise of reality TV. Nostalgia was rampant; obsessive fandoms had become a badge of honor. Cameo capitalized on it all, allowing fans to connect directly with celebrities who didn't seem that Olympian in the first place.
Popular talent included the Soup Nazi character played by Larry Thomas on "Seinfeld" and a YouTube duo called the Game Grumps. Brian Baumgartner, best known as Kevin from "The Office," was the company's top earner as of January 2022, according to an internal dashboard viewed by The New York Times, with more than $ 3 million in sales since joining. He was followed by Gilbert Gottfried (now deceased), Brett Favre, Sonja Morgan of the "The Real Housewives of New York City," Kevin O'Leary of "Shark Tank" and Chris Harrison of "The Bachelor." Each of the five showed lifetime sales of more than $ 1 million.
You could get a celebrity to say just about anything on Cameo, it seemed -- which, in addition to being the main part of its appeal, was an early risk to its reputation. The service hit a setback in 2018 when Mr. Favre and Soulja Boy unwittingly recorded Cameos that were laced with obscure antisemitic messages. (The platform quickly deactivated links to the videos and deleted associated accounts.)
By 2019, powered by word of mouth, Cameo had grown to 100 employees and raised $ 50 million from top venture firms, including Kleiner Perkins.
It added celebrity investors like Snoop Dogg and Bethenny Frankel of "Real Housewives." Ms. Frankel said in an interview that she refused to offer her video services unless she could buy shares. Becoming an investor made it easier to explain her presence on the platform alongside what her publicist once referred to as "Z-list talent," she said.
Things had already been going well, but Cameo was supercharged by the pandemic, when both celebs and customers were bored and seeking connection. Mr. Galanis likened Cameo's 2020 growth -- a more than fourfold increase in revenue to $ 100 million -- to getting an invincibility star while playing Mario Kart.
Stars who had previously ignored Cameo's outreach, like the singer Akon (known for such hits as "Smack That"), signed up, along with pandemic celebrities like the cast of Netflix's "Tiger King." Others, like Mandy Moore, Busy Philipps and Mike Tyson, joined Cameo for a fund-raiser. Cameo was even name-checked in a special May episode of NBC's "Parks & Recreation." The Biden campaign partnered with the start-up for fund-raising in 2020.
Employees were awed by a huge spike in Mother's Day sales, the first big pandemic gift-giving holiday, and glowing press rolled in. "Cameo Was Made for the Coronavirus," New York magazine declared. It was "fascinating, and slightly addictive," The New Yorker weighed in.
To capture the moment, the company hatched a costly marketing stunt as it neared the sale of its millionth Cameo that spring: sending a celebrity and a fan to space via Virgin Galactic, underscoring Cameo's moonshot ambitions, according to three former employees and an internal memo. The company wanted to ignite "Willy Wonka's Golden Ticket type hysteria" around it, per the memo, and even produced a video promoting the "space race" with Andy Dick, Lance Bass and other personalities. The trip would be "one giant leap for fankind," they declared.
But the killing of George Floyd in late May set off widespread protests days before the announcement, the former employees said, prompting Mr. Galanis to cancel the plan.
As the pandemic stretched on, employees worked tirelessly to keep up with the interest in the platform, especially Cameo's young talent managers, who drove celebrity sign-ups through a barrage of direct messages, emails and texts to blue-check-marks and their agents. (William Shatner of "Star Trek" complained several times on Twitter about how Cameo's employees were "relentless in hounding celebrities to death" and swore he'd never join.) Former employees recalled requirements of at least 100 "touch points" per day -- one D.M. or email counted as a touch point -- and 200 during the holidays, when people bought the most videos.
Staff took turns sending messages from the main Cameo Twitter account. "The fans keep asking!" they wrote to one recruit, punctuating with a money bag emoji. "You got a few min to chat Cameo?" A follow-up promised "big $ $ business deals."
Mr. Galanis declared in the summer of 2020 that Cameo would be a "work from anywhere" company as he relocated to Miami. He had gone on a hiring spree, doubling Cameo's staff size to 200 and recruiting a team of pricey executives from companies like LinkedIn, McDonald's and Hulu, who he believed would help take the start-up public. He said that a board member had advised him to channel Phil Jackson building the Chicago Bulls championship team.
Peak Cameo
Investors clamored to give Cameo more money, partly because in the fever dream of 2021, investors clamored to give any start-up more money. Crypto, meme stocks, collectibles, real estate -- all of it was going up, and there was more cash going around than tech founders knew what to do with.
Cameo's founders had struck on a good idea at exactly the right time -- something that counts as a success in the normal business world. But not for high-growth tech start-ups. The flood of cash from investors seeking more risk for higher returns pushed companies like Cameo to spend more, grow faster and take bigger swings in pursuit of moonshot glory. A handful of companies go on to become the next Facebook. But countless others blitzscale themselves off a cliff.
Few investors are more synonymous with such boom-and-bust investing than Masayoshi Son, head of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. Some of Mr. Son's aggressive bets have paid off handsomely, like his investment in the Chinese conglomerate Alibaba. Others crashed and burned, like WeWork, the high-flying co-working company that's now at risk of insolvency. Several former Cameo employees invoked WeWork when talking about their experience at Cameo.
Mr. Galanis met with Mr. Son on Zoom in February 2021. Mr. Son offered Cameo $ 400 million in cash -- four times the company's fund-raising goal -- and told Mr. Galanis to spend $ 100 million of it sponsoring the Tokyo Olympics, Mr. Galanis said. Instead, he stuck to Cameo's target. A representative for SoftBank declined to comment.
The hot new funding round, announced in March 2021 -- around the time Covid vaccines rolled out widely -- drew enough interest that Mr. Galanis and his co-founders sold a chunk of shares, a move that is sometimes frowned upon by investors and wasn't disclosed to employees. Mr. Galanis said he sold less than 12 percent of his shares -- which could have been worth millions of dollars at the time -- and that he remains the largest individual shareholder. (The co-founders each take a salary of no more than $ 150,000, he said.)
Rank-and-file employees were not permitted to sell, though outside investors like Ms. Frankel were. She said she had gotten the sense that the app had peaked and sold her stake for a "seven-figure return," including her video earnings.
With the new $ 1 billion valuation, the mood at Cameo was euphoric. The company rented a Beverly Hills mansion it called the "Cameo House" with a big deck and a pool for roughly $ 60,000 a month. Cameo was burning $ 5 million a month on its staff, travel, parties at the Cameo House, and expensive takeout for stars from chichi spots like Sugarfish and Jon & Vinny's.
The company regularly highlighted its celebrity investors like Ms. Frankel. In 2021, it added Earvin (Magic) Johnson to its board.
The hype extended to equity. The message to employees, especially new hires, was that unlike their 401(k)s, their payouts could make them rich. Some employees donned vests on their one-year anniversary at Cameo in a nod to some shares vesting, two former staffers said.
But the business couldn't grow fast enough from just video messages. Cameo experimented with other ways to get people to pay for interactions with talent, like live events, real-time video calls and direct messages. It created Cameo for Business to pair celebrities with corporations for ads and speaking gigs, a promising division that was often shunted to the side in favor of ventures that involved fans.
An initiative called Project Blackbeard tried to woo bigger celebrities onto Cameo with upfront cash payments and minimum guarantees. But the deals were costly -- Ian Somerhalder, an actor from the teen drama "Vampire Diaries," received a six-figure sum, according to three former employees -- and the stars often left once the contracts ended. Once other celebrities and agents got wind of the advances, many began demanding similar fees. Cameo ended the project. (Mr. Somerhalder did not reply to a request for comment; Cameo noted that he had since rejoined.)
Many major stars didn't want to be on Cameo, except for the occasional charity event. It had a strong whiff of the D-list, and they didn't want to be listed next to a pair of TikTok rappers called the Island Boys or the dermatologist known as Dr. Pimple Popper.
But Cameo was hungry for any piece of them. In October 2021, the company bought Represent, a Los Angeles business that helped celebrities and influencers sell customized goods to their fans. Represent had a star-studded roster, including Zayn Malik, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the cast of "Friends," and Cameo hoped those clients might eventually start making videos.
It paid $ 25 million to $ 30 million, according to three people familiar with the deal, and took on debt for the first time to do so. The company celebrated with a "Friendsgiving" party at the Beverly Hills mansion in November, which featured dancers in gold costumes gyrating inside clear globes floating on its pool and guests like Ms. Abdul and Perez Hilton.
But Cameo's hopes to get in with Represent's stars died quickly.
Mr. Malik was among celebrities who refused requests to join Cameo, two former employees said -- and few of Cameo's stars, with some exceptions like the internet sensation Corn Kid, ended up experimenting with Represent. The company said joining Cameo became a "friction point" for some Represent stars. (Mr. Malik did not reply to requests for comment.)
The failed experiments were one thing, but there was a bigger problem on the horizon as the company headed into 2022. People were simply not spending as much on Cameos as they had been before.
The Tinder Swindler and NFTs
Cameo's unsuccessful lurches into new products and growing internal stress put new scrutiny on Mr. Galanis and his unfocused management style. (The company said that Mr. Galanis's daily responsibilities "may not have been apparent to each employee," particularly while they worked remotely.)
Weekly staff meetings featured a "Steven's Thoughts" portion where he often discussed his weekends jet setting at Formula 1 races, the Cannes Lions festival and N.C.A.A. games. (Cameo said travel was not the primary focus of "Steven's Thoughts.") Sometimes he talked about Cameo's plans to expand into the cryptocurrency business known as web3, comparing the opportunity to Christopher Columbus's exploration of the new world. He told some employees he was seeing a longevity doctor who had informed him that, despite being 35, he was biologically 44. (Being chief executive has taken a huge toll on his health, he said in an interview.)
The newly expanded sales team was stuck in place, circling whatever person had just gone viral on TikTok or joined the cast of "Love Island."
In early 2022, some talent reps began seeking out convicted fraudsters like Simon Leviev, better known as Tinder Swindler from Netflix, a con artist who scammed dozens of women out of millions of dollars on dating apps. (Cameo said felons were allowed on the app, including those in jail, so long as they were not subject to U.S. sanctions.)
Mr. Galanis and other company leaders promoted the Tinder Swindler on social media and touted the money they would make from him, outraging women at the company and later prompting one executive to issue a companywide apology on Slack, according to internal messages. One employee sent a Slack message flagging Billy McFarland of Fyre Festival notoriety and the pharma villain Martin Shkreli for outreach, saying, "Just in case they get out of jail early, we should be on top of it." The Information earlier reported on the internal strife.
Some celebrities left, citing the arrival of Mr. Leviev and other polarizing characters, several employees said. The actress Alyssa Milano told The Times in a text message that she left Cameo after members of the Trump family joined in mid-2021, though she recently rejoined amid the Hollywood strikes. Last year, employees also complained after Cameo executives gave Represent the task of selling merchandise for Andrew Tate, the self-declared misogynist who has since been charged with rape and human trafficking.
Mr. Galanis, for his part, said he was annoyed by the reactions, blaming Cameo's hiring spree for bringing on employees who didn't share what he characterized as the company's values around free speech.
"There was actually someone at an all-hands that said, 'I feel Cameo is gaslighting me by letting Donald Trump Jr. on because his father killed my father,"' Mr. Galanis said. "Her dad had passed away from Covid. So that's the type of just crazy activism that was happening at the company, and this wasn't just one person."
Cameo kept throwing spaghetti at the wall. Perhaps inevitably, it got in on crypto, with Cameo Pass, a new product that sold crypto-backed art known as nonfungible tokens alongside access to V.I.P. parties.
The crypto push seemed to reflect the personal enthusiasms of the company's founder as much as it did any business imperatives. Around that time, Mr. Galanis showed off an NFT he'd purchased on his own. It was a cartoon picture of a monkey wearing 3-D glasses called a Bored Ape that cost him $ 320,000. Represent made him a pair of flip-flops bearing the image.
In March 2022, for the first time in four years, the Federal Reserve announced plans to raise interest rates, signaling that the free money chasing high-growth start-ups might be about to dry up. In May of that year, Cameo, which was still burning millions a month without the sales to show for it, laid off 87 people, or around a quarter of its staff, citing overhiring and the market downturn. The party seemed over.
Except -- the parties weren't over. A few days after the cuts, Cameo threw a celebration in Miami for its NFT holders at a Star Island mansion with a red carpet, a row of sports cars and performances from Diplo, DJ Khaled and Fabolous. Current and former employees were outraged, though Cameo said the parties were paid for by the proceeds of its NFT sales.
Cameo's crypto business brought in a few million dollars in revenue before the company shut it down, one year after it launched. The price of its NFTs, which initially sold for around $ 630, sank as low as $ 7.60. Cameo had entered the market near its peak; a May 2022 crash wiped out $ 300 billion in one week. In July, Cameo slashed its internal valuation of its common shares by 55 percent, according to an internal presentation viewed by The Times. In August 2022, hackers stole Mr. Galanis's monkey art along with $ 70,000 worth of cryptocurrency.
Mr. Galanis tried to round up more cash in 2023, according to three people familiar with the situation, but investors were turned off by all the spending. A potential deal that would have let Cameo acquire a European competitor called Memmo fell through, according to two people familiar with the conversations. Memmo went bankrupt in August. Another investor, the private equity firm TPG, has had multiple conversations about investing this year, but no deal is imminent, three people said.
'Wouldn't Wish It on Anybody'
Today, Cameo operates as a husk of its former self. Its nearly 400 employees have shrunk to 33, plus a handful of contractors, after three rounds of layoffs. Magic Johnson, who was paid for his role, left Cameo's board after not fulfilling obligations that included making Cameo videos, promoting the service and attending board meetings, according to two people familiar with his exit. (Cameo said he left on good terms. Mr. Johnson didn't reply to requests for comment.) Cameo gave up its Beverly Hills mansion, and Represent stopped taking new clients.
The all-star team of executives that Mr. Galanis put together is now almost entirely gone. "I had to fire some of my best friends," he said. "I wouldn't wish it on anybody, but my job as C.E.O. is to make sure this business survives and fulfills our mission and vision."
Cameo is wringing more money from the videos it started with, increasing its cut to 30 percent for new talent plus a new 10 percent service fee.
It also appears to be seeking out talent who might not even be considered D-list. Since 2020, more than 100,000 people had applied to sell videos on Cameo but were rejected for having small followings or unverified identities, Mr. Galanis said. Now, he said, Cameo "allows more of those people to get through."
And it continues to seek new horizons. The company recently sponsored jerseys for a professional pickleball team that Mr. Galanis co-owns in Miami. Mr. Galanis said no funds from Cameo were used for the sponsorship.
Cameo is just one case study in the grim awakening for the start-up sector writ large, and an especially familiar tale among pandemic darlings like Zoom and Peloton that couldn't maintain their rapid growth.
Still, Mr. Galanis argued that Cameo was thriving and "absolutely" still on track to become the next Disney. Cameo turned its first monthly profit in August since May 2020, he said -- but only excluding certain costs like interest and taxes. Revenue, which had not grown year over year since June 2021, rose in September. The Hollywood strikes gave the company a boost, and investors were paying attention to its cost cutting, he said.
Mr. Galanis said his ambitions for Cameo hadn't changed through it all. "I was put on Earth to build this company," he said. "I'll fight for it every day."

Actors and Hollywood Studios Will Restart Negotiations: [National Desk]

Full text: Talks aimed at ending the strike by the actors' union broke up less than two weeks ago, with the two sides saying they remained far apart.
The major entertainment studios and the union representing tens of thousands of striking actors will return to the negotiating table on Tuesday, less than two weeks after talks were suspended because the sides remained far apart on significant issues.
The restart of negotiations was announced in a joint statement on Saturday from the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, and SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union. Four top studio executives -- NBCUniversal's Studio Group chairwoman and chief content officer, Donna Langley; the Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos; the Walt Disney Company chief executive Robert A. Iger; and Warner Bros. Discovery's chief executive David Zaslav -- will take part in the talks, as they did before the suspension.
The renewal of discussions is welcome news for an entertainment industry that has largely been at a standstill for months because of dual strikes by writers, who walked out in May, and the actors, who joined them in July. On Oct. 9, the Writers Guild of America ratified its new contract and there had been hope that a new deal with the actors would follow.
The strikes have been devastating financially for many, both within and outside the industry. The California economy has lost an estimated $ 5 billion. But an agreement with the actors would mean getting back to work without losing the entirety of the fall television schedule or having next summer's moviegoing season upended.
Instead, conversations between the alliance and the actors' union fell apart on Oct. 11. The studios balked at a new proposal that would involve a viewership bonus that they said would cost them close to $ 800 million.
In an interview after the discussions ended, the union's chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, said: "Their position was the only way they'll keep talking is if we give them a whole new set of counters. They're not going to respond to what we gave them. They just want us to go back and start over and that's not going to happen."
In an earnings call this past week, Mr. Sarandos said the proposal "really broke our momentum."
Like their counterparts in the screenwriters' guild, leaders of the actors' union have called this moment "existential." They say the streaming era has had a negative impact on their working lives and their compensation. They are seeking wage increases, as well as protections around the use of artificial intelligence.
This past week, a group of A-list actors including George Clooney, Emma Stone and Tyler Perry made a proposal to the union that involved, among other things, the guild's top earners paying more in dues in an attempt to bring an end to the strike. The proposal was immediately rejected by the guild but its existence suggested that its membership was getting restless.
Social media posts criticizing the guild also started popping up, including one from the former union president, Melissa Gilbert. She took the union to task for sending out Halloween guidelines in which members were told to not dress as characters from major studio productions or post photographs of the costumes online because it could be seen as promoting the work of the studios they are striking against.
"THIS is what you guys come up with," Ms. Gilbert wrote on Instagram. "Literally no one cares what anyone wears for Halloween. I mean, do you really think this kind of infantile stuff is going to end the strike? We look like a joke."

Cameo to the Moon, and Back

Kenny G opened a meeting with a saxophone serenade. Paula Abdul judged an American Idol-style talent contest. “Hamilton” cast members performed. Lance Bass of ’NSync was there, hanging out. And when Robert Van Winkle, better known as Vanilla Ice, sang his 1990 hit “Ice Ice Baby,” flanked by 10-foot sparklers, he pulled Sugar Ray frontman Mark McGrath onstage.
This was Cameopalooza 2021, a company retreat celebrating the meteoric rise of Cameo, an app and website where regular people could buy personalized videos from minor celebrities for as little as $1. Attendees feasted on seafood towers and fondue fountains at an upscale restaurant on the Chicago waterfront and partied into the night at a Hilton penthouse suite, where Jack Harlow, a TikTok-famous rapper, performed a private show.
Three hundred Cameo employees danced, took videos and basked in their good fortune to be a part of the Cameo “Fameo” — the company’s nickname for its employees and community of celebrities. They were on a rocket ship powered by D-list celebrities and pandemic loneliness.
The company was preparing to expand in every direction: crypto art, live events, merchandise, international; its co-founder and CEO, Steven Galanis, now 35, was expert at straddling the line between business and pleasure. A former collegiate party promoter, he shared the lifestyle of Cameo’s celebrity talent, jet setting between parties, sporting events and luxury homes in Miami, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Cameo had just raised $100 million on the audacious ambition to pioneer the “connection economy,” landing a $1 billion “unicorn” valuation just a few years into its existence.
Now fueled by money from venture capitalists including SoftBank, the investor that powered so many of the previous decade’s frothiest startups, Cameo could be so much more than just a quirky, semi-ironic video greetings business.
Galanis and his co-founders decided to build “one of the most important, beloved consumer companies of the generation,” as Galanis declared in a 2021 interview. “Something that can be as enduring as what Walt Disney did for the last century.”
Investors and employees — encouraged with a meme stock battle cry of “LFG!”(“Let’s go!” with an expletive) — believed the company’s surging growth would continue forever.
A decade of near-zero interest rates, abundant venture cash and a steady tech boom gave no indication otherwise. A company such as Cameo could afford to lose money forever, as long as it kept getting bigger. And American culture produced few things with such regularity as it did new celebrities.
What could go wrong?
An Idea Takes Shape
Company lore traces Cameo’s roots to a 2016 conversation between Galanis, then an account manager at LinkedIn, and his friend Martin Blencowe, an NFL agent. Blencowe had asked Cassius Marsh, a former Seattle Seahawks linebacker, to record a congratulatory video for a friend who had just had a baby. As Blencowe described the friend’s thrilled reaction, an idea took shape.
Galanis, a 2010 Duke University graduate, recruited a fellow alumnus and software engineer, Devon Townsend, to build it. In the spring of 2017, the website BookCameo.com launched with a tweet from Marsh, promising videos for about $20; Tori Spelling and niche Vine personalities such as Evan Breen joined later that year. (Blencowe, 37, and Townsend, 33, who are also co-founders, still work at the company.)
For Galanis, Cameo, based in his hometown, Chicago, felt like the company the trio was destined to build. He and Blencowe were fresh from a short-lived production career. (Galanis still highlights their IMDb credits, which include a TV show called SAF3, pronounced “safe,” about an elite rescue task force.) Townsend had been a star on Vine, a short-lived, short-form video app.
“We lived in this world,” Galanis said. “We didn’t build this business by accident.”
This article is based on interviews with Galanis and more than 30 current and former Cameo employees, investors and advisers as well as internal documents, screenshots and photographs.
Galanis sports a dark, close-cropped beard and often wears either polos or Cameo-branded shirts and baseball caps. He’s a self-assured pitchman who views himself as an ultra-connector, peppering conversation with references to business leaders he admires such as Elon Musk.
He pointed to a 13-year-old college newspaper profile of the events company he ran at Duke, with the headline “The Mayor of Main Street.” He said it offered “pretty important” context for why he was able to build Cameo. The article, which is topped with a photo of Galanis flashing a thumbs-up while drinking a Busch Light, describes how he made a name for himself by befriending local venues and organizing huge parties, including a beer-pong event that was viewed as innovative for taking place on a weeknight at Shooters, a spot that was normally a sweaty dance club with a cage. (He also took credit for an “April Showers” party, featuring women in wet T-shirts.)
To grow in the early days, Cameo started recruiting anyone with a shred of fame to its platform, taking a 25% cut of videos that cost fans as much as $3,000. People could describe the message they wanted their celeb of choice to send: a birthday wish, a pep talk, a roast. The resulting videos were strange and amazing to receive — Did Dennis Rodman really just tell me to have a great night ?
Cameo worked best for people who were “more famous than they are rich,” Galanis would say. And by the 2010s, there were plenty of those people. The old star system of movies and network shows had been displaced by YouTube channels and viral moments and the rise of reality TV. Nostalgia was rampant; obsessive fandoms had become a badge of honor. Cameo capitalized on it all, allowing fans to connect directly with celebrities who didn’t seem that Olympian in the first place.
Popular talent included the Soup Nazi character played by Larry Thomas on “Seinfeld” and a YouTube duo called the Game Grumps. Brian Baumgartner, best known as Kevin from “The Office,” was the company’s top earner as of January 2022, according to an internal dashboard viewed by The New York Times, with more than $3 million in sales since joining. He was followed by Gilbert Gottfried (now deceased), Brett Favre, Sonja Morgan of the “The Real Housewives of New York City,” Kevin O’Leary of “Shark Tank” and Chris Harrison of “The Bachelor.” Each of the five showed lifetime sales of more than $1 million.
You could get a celebrity to say just about anything on Cameo, it seemed — which, in addition to being the main part of its appeal, was an early risk to its reputation. The service hit a setback in 2018 when Favre and Soulja Boy unwittingly recorded Cameos that were laced with obscure antisemitic messages. (The platform quickly deactivated links to the videos and deleted associated accounts.)
By 2019, powered by word-of-mouth, Cameo had grown to 100 employees and raised $50 million from top venture firms, including Kleiner Perkins.
It added celebrity investors such as Snoop Dogg and Bethenny Frankel of “Real Housewives.” Frankel said in an interview that she refused to offer her video services unless she could buy shares. Becoming an investor made it easier to explain her presence on the platform alongside what her publicist once referred to as “Z-list talent,” she said.
Things had already been going well, but Cameo was supercharged by the pandemic, when both celebs and customers were bored and seeking connection. Galanis likened Cameo’s 2020 growth — a more-than-fourfold increase in revenue to $100 million — to getting an invincibility star while playing Mario Kart.
Stars who had previously ignored Cameo’s outreach, including singer Akon (known for such hits as “Smack That”), signed up, along with pandemic celebrities such as the cast of Netflix’s “Tiger King.” Others, including Mandy Moore, Busy Philipps and Mike Tyson, joined Cameo for a fundraiser. Cameo was even name-checked in a special May episode of NBC’s “Parks & Recreation.” Joe Biden’s presidential campaign partnered with the startup for fundraising in 2020.
Employees were awed by a huge spike in Mother’s Day sales, the first big pandemic gift-giving holiday, and glowing press rolled in. “Cameo Was Made for the Coronavirus,” New York magazine declared. It was “fascinating, and slightly addictive,” The New Yorker weighed in.
To capture the moment, the company hatched a costly marketing stunt as it neared the sale of its millionth Cameo that spring: sending a celebrity and a fan to space via Virgin Galactic, underscoring Cameo’s moonshot ambitions, according to three former employees and an internal memo. The company wanted to ignite “Willy Wonka’s Golden Ticket type hysteria” around it, per the memo, and even produced a video promoting the “space race” with Andy Dick, Lance Bass and other personalities. The trip would be “one giant leap for fankind,” they declared.
But the killing of George Floyd in late May 2020 set off widespread protests days before the announcement, the former employees said, prompting Galanis to cancel the plan.
As the pandemic stretched on, employees worked tirelessly to keep up with the interest in the platform, especially Cameo’s young talent managers, who drove celebrity sign-ups through a barrage of direct messages, emails and texts to blue check marks and their agents. (William Shatner of “Star Trek” complained several times on Twitter about how Cameo’s employees were “relentless in hounding celebrities to death” and swore he’d never join.) Former employees recalled requirements of at least 100 “touch points” per day — one DM or email counted as a touch point — and 200 during the holidays, when people bought the most videos.
Staffers took turns sending messages from the main Cameo Twitter account. “The fans keep asking!” they wrote to one recruit, punctuating with a money bag emoji. “You got a few min to chat Cameo?” A follow-up promised “big $ $ business deals.”
Galanis declared in the summer of 2020 that Cameo would be a “work from anywhere” company as he relocated to Miami. He had gone on a hiring spree, doubling Cameo’s staff size to 200 and recruiting a team of pricey executives from companies such as LinkedIn, McDonald’s and Hulu, whom he believed would help take the startup public. He said a board member had advised him to channel Phil Jackson building the Chicago Bulls championship team.
Business Was Zooming
Investors clamored to give Cameo more money, partly because in the fever dream of 2021, investors clamored to give any startup more money. Crypto, meme stocks, collectibles, real estate — all of it was going up, and there was more cash going around than tech founders knew what to do with.
Cameo’s founders had struck on a good idea at exactly the right time — something that counts as a success in the normal business world. But not for high-growth tech startups. The flood of cash from investors seeking more risk for higher returns pushed companies such as Cameo to spend more, grow faster and take bigger swings in pursuit of moonshot glory. A handful of companies go on to become the next Facebook. But countless others blitzscale themselves off a cliff.
Few investors are more synonymous with such boom-and-bust investing than Masayoshi Son, head of the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. Some of Son’s aggressive bets have paid off handsomely, including his investment in Chinese conglomerate Alibaba. Others crashed and burned, including WeWork, a high-flying coworking company that’s now at risk of insolvency. Several former Cameo employees invoked WeWork when talking about their experience at Cameo.
Galanis met with Son on Zoom in February 2021. Son offered Cameo $400 million in cash — four times the company’s fundraising goal — and told Galanis to spend $100 million of it sponsoring the Tokyo Olympics, Galanis said. Instead, he stuck to Cameo’s target. A representative for SoftBank declined to comment.
The hot new funding round, announced in March 2021 — around the time COVID-19 vaccines rolled out widely — drew enough interest that Galanis and his co-founders sold a chunk of shares, a move that is sometimes frowned upon by investors and wasn’t disclosed to employees.
Galanis said he sold less than 12% of his shares — which could have been worth millions of dollars at the time — and that he remains the largest individual shareholder. (The co-founders each take a salary of no more than $150,000, he said.)
Rank-and-file employees were not permitted to sell, although outside investors such as Frankel were. She said she had gotten the sense that the app had peaked and sold her stake for a “seven-figure return,” including her video earnings.
With the new $1 billion valuation, the mood at Cameo was euphoric. The company rented a Beverly Hills mansion it called the “Cameo House” with a big deck and a pool for roughly $60,000 a month. Cameo was burning $5 million a month on its staff, travel, parties at the Cameo House, and expensive takeout for stars from chichi spots such as Sugarfish and Jon & Vinny’s.
The company regularly highlighted its celebrity investors such as Frankel. In 2021, it added Magic Johnson to its board.
The hype extended to equity. The message to employees, especially new hires, was that, unlike their 401(k)s, their payouts could make them rich. Some employees donned vests on their anniversary at Cameo in a nod to some shares vesting, two former staffers said.
But the business couldn’t grow fast enough from just video messages.
Cameo experimented with other ways to get people to pay for interactions with talent, including live events, real-time video calls and direct messages. It created Cameo for Business to pair celebrities with corporations for ads and speaking gigs, a promising division that was often shunted to the side in favor of ventures that involved fans.
An initiative called Project Blackbeard tried to woo bigger celebrities onto Cameo with upfront cash payments and minimum guarantees. But the deals were costly — Ian Somerhalder, an actor from the teen drama “Vampire Diaries,” received a six-figure sum, according to three former employees — and the stars often left once the contracts ended. Once other celebrities and agents got wind of the advances, many began demanding similar fees. Cameo ended the project. (Somerhalder did not reply to a request for comment; Cameo noted that he had since rejoined.)
Many major stars didn’t want to be on Cameo, except for the occasional charity event. It had a strong whiff of the D-list, and they didn’t want to be listed next to a pair of TikTok rappers called the Island Boys or the dermatologist known as Dr. Pimple Popper.
But Cameo was hungry for any piece of them. In October 2021, the company bought Represent, a Los Angeles business that helped celebrities and influencers sell customized goods to their fans. Represent had a star-studded roster, including Zayn Malik, Arnold Schwarzenegger and the cast of “Friends,” and Cameo hoped those clients might eventually start making videos.
It paid $25 million to $30 million, according to three people familiar with the deal, and took on debt for the first time to do so. The company celebrated with a “Friendsgiving” party at the Beverly Hills mansion in November, which featured dancers in gold costumes gyrating inside clear globes floating on its pool and guests such as Abdul and Perez Hilton.
But Cameo’s hopes to get in with Represent’s stars died quickly.
Malik was among celebrities who refused requests to join Cameo, two former employees said — and few of Cameo’s stars, with some exceptions such as internet sensation Corn Kid, ended up experimenting with Represent. The company said joining Cameo became a “friction point” for some Represent stars. (Malik did not reply to requests for comment.)
The failed experiments were one thing, but there was a bigger problem on the horizon as the company headed into 2022. People were simply not spending as much on Cameos as they had been before.
Throwing Spaghetti at the Wall
Cameo’s unsuccessful lurches into new products and growing internal stress put new scrutiny on Galanis and his unfocused management style. (The company said Galanis’ daily responsibilities “may not have been apparent to each employee,” particularly while they worked remotely.)
Weekly staff meetings featured a “Steven’s Thoughts” portion where he often discussed his weekends jet setting at Formula One races, the Cannes Lions festival and NCAA games. (Cameo said travel was not the primary focus of “Steven’s Thoughts.”) Sometimes he talked about Cameo’s plans to expand into the cryptocurrency business known as Web3, comparing the opportunity to Christopher Columbus’ exploration of the new world. He told some employees he was seeing a longevity doctor who had informed him that, despite being 35, he was biologically 44. (Being CEO has taken a huge toll on his health, he said in an interview.)
The newly expanded sales team was stuck in place, circling whatever person had just gone viral on TikTok or joined the cast of “Love Island.”
In early 2022, some talent reps began seeking out convicted fraudsters such as Simon Leviev, better known as the Tinder Swindler from Netflix, a con artist who scammed dozens of women out of millions of dollars on dating apps. (Cameo said felons were allowed on the app, including those in jail, so long as they were not subject to U.S. sanctions.)
Galanis and other company leaders promoted the Tinder Swindler on social media and touted the money they would make from him, outraging women at the company and later prompting one executive to issue a companywide apology on Slack, according to internal messages. One employee sent a Slack message flagging Billy McFarland of Fyre Festival notoriety and pharma villain Martin Shkreli for outreach, saying that “just in case they get out of jail early, we should be on top of it.” The Information earlier reported on the internal strife.
Some celebrities left, citing the arrival of Leviev and other polarizing characters, several employees said. Actress Alyssa Milano told the Times in a text message that she left Cameo after members of the Trump family joined in mid-2021, although she recently rejoined amid the Hollywood strikes. Last year, employees also complained after Cameo executives gave Represent the task of selling merchandise for Andrew Tate, a self-declared misogynist who has since been charged with rape and human trafficking.
Galanis, for his part, said he was annoyed by the reactions, blaming Cameo’s hiring spree for bringing on employees who didn’t share what he characterized as the company’s values around free speech.
“There was actually someone at an all-hands that said, ‘I feel Cameo is gaslighting me by letting Donald Trump Jr. on because his father killed my father,’” Galanis said. “Her dad had passed away from COVID. So that’s the type of just crazy activism that was happening at the company, and this wasn’t just one person.”
Cameo kept throwing spaghetti at the wall. Perhaps inevitably, it got in on crypto, with Cameo Pass, a new product that sold crypto-backed art known as non-fungible tokens alongside access to VIP parties.
The crypto push seemed to reflect the personal enthusiasms of the company’s founder as much as it did any business imperatives. About that time, Galanis showed off an NFT he had purchased on his own. It was a cartoon picture of a monkey wearing 3D glasses called a Bored Ape that cost him $320,000. Represent made him a pair of flip-flops bearing the image.
In March 2022, for the first time in four years, the Federal Reserve announced plans to raise interest rates, signaling that the free money chasing high-growth startups might be about to dry up. In May 2022, Cameo, which was still burning millions a month without the sales to show for it, laid off 87 people, or about one-fourth of its staff, citing overhiring and the market downturn. The party seemed over.
Except — the parties weren’t over. A few days after the cuts, Cameo threw a celebration in Miami for its NFT holders at a Star Island mansion with a red carpet, a row of sports cars and performances from Diplo, DJ Khaled and Fabolous. Current and former employees were outraged, although Cameo said the parties were paid for by the proceeds of its NFT sales.
Cameo’s crypto business brought in a few million dollars in revenue before the company shut it down, one year after it launched. The price of its NFTs, which initially sold for about $630, sunk as low as $7.60. Cameo had entered the market near its peak; a May 2022 crash wiped out $300 billion in one week. In July 2022, Cameo slashed its internal valuation of its common shares by 55%, according to an internal presentation viewed by the Times. In August 2022, hackers stole Galanis’ monkey art along with $70,000 worth of cryptocurrency.
Galanis tried to round up more cash this year, according to three people familiar with the situation, but investors were turned off by all the spending. A potential deal that would have let Cameo acquire a European competitor called Memmo fell through, according to two people familiar with the conversations. Memmo went bankrupt in August. Another investor, the private equity firm TPG, has had multiple conversations about investing this year but no deal is imminent, three people said.
‘Wouldn’t Wish It on Anybody’
Today, Cameo operates as a husk of its former self. Its nearly 400 employees have shrunk to 33, plus a handful of contractors, after three rounds of layoffs. Magic Johnson, who was paid for his role, left Cameo’s board after not fulfilling obligations that included making Cameo videos, promoting the service and attending board meetings, according to two people familiar with his exit. (Cameo said he left on good terms. Johnson didn’t reply to requests for comment.) Cameo gave up its Beverly Hills mansion, and Represent stopped taking new clients.
The all-star team of executives that Galanis put together is now almost entirely gone. “I had to fire some of my best friends,” he said. “I wouldn’t wish it on anybody, but my job as CEO is to make sure this business survives and fulfills our mission and vision.”
Cameo is wringing more money from the videos it started with, increasing its cut to 30% for new talent plus a new 10% service fee.
It also appears to be seeking out talent who might not even be considered D-list. Since 2020, more than 100,000 people had applied to sell videos on Cameo but were rejected for having small followings or unverified identities, Galanis said. Now, he said, Cameo “allows more of those people to get through.”
And it continues to seek new horizons. The company recently sponsored jerseys for a professional pickleball team that Galanis co-owns in Miami. Galanis said no funds from Cameo were used for the sponsorship.
Cameo is just one case study in the grim awakening for the startup sector writ large, and an especially familiar tale among pandemic darlings such as Zoom and Peloton that couldn’t maintain their rapid growth.
Galanis argued that Cameo was thriving and “absolutely” still on track to become the next Disney. Cameo turned its first monthly profit in August since May 2020, he said — but only excluding certain costs like interest and taxes. Revenue, which had not grown year over year since June 2021, rose in September. The Hollywood strikes gave the company a boost and investors were paying attention to its cost cutting, he said.
Galanis said his ambitions for Cameo hadn’t changed through it all. “I was put on Earth to build this company,” he said. “I’ll fight for it every day.”

SAG-AFTRA Sends Actors Guidelines for Halloween: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The SAG-AFTRA union told its members not to dress as characters from major productions and post pictures, which could be seen as promoting the work of companies they are negotiating with.
Barbie, Ken and Wednesday Addams costumes are out. Ghosts and zombies are in.
Halloween this year is tricky for actors on strike, under new union guidelines that tell them how to avoid crossing the virtual picket line: Don't dress as characters from major studio productions or post photographs of the costumes online.
"Let's use our collective power to send a loud and clear message to our struck employers that we will not promote their content without a fair contract," the union, SAG-AFTRA, said in the guidelines on Thursday.
The union urged its members to "celebrate Halloween this year while also staying in solidarity."
SAG-AFTRA, representing more than 150,000 television and movie actors, has been on strike since July while it negotiates a contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which represents major movie and streaming companies including Disney, Netflix and Warner Bros.
Generally, the union encourages striking members to share photographs of their union engagement and the picket line in order to amplify their demands, which include increased residual payments from streaming services, a wage boost and protections regarding the use of artificial intelligence. But SAG-AFTRA said its Halloween guidelines were intended "to make sure our members don't inadvertently break strike rules."
The guidelines urge members to choose generic costumes -- of zombies, spiders or ghosts, say -- or to base their costumes on characters from animated television shows.
In its coverage of the new guidelines on Thursday, The Hollywood Reporter highlighted some of the rules' technicalities. For example, a costume based on Barbie, which is owned by Mattel, could suggest that the wearer was promoting the summer's biggest movie from a major studio.
"Presumably, actors could dress up like struck characters if they weren't seen publicly in their costumes, but it's probably best not to risk it -- after all, nothing is scarier than getting called out for scabbing," the publication wrote, using the slang term for someone who disregards a strike.
Social media photos of costumes inspired by content covered by the strike could be considered publicity work, according to the union. It was not clear how actors would handle dressing up as Barbie or J. Robert Oppenheimer at events that would not be publicized or whether actors would influence the costume choices of their family members.
"I look forward to screaming 'scab' at my 8 year old all night. She's not in the union but she needs to learn," the actor Ryan Reynolds said in a joking post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.
John Rocha, a union actor and the co-host of "The Hot Mic," a film review podcast, called the decision "foolish" and said he hoped that SAG-AFTRA would reverse course.
"Partying at Halloween dressed as the characters their fellow SAG actors brought to life (while they blow off some steam) should be ENCOURAGED," he said on X.
Negotiations between the entertainment studios and the union collapsed last week, with both sides saying they remained far apart on the most significant issues.

F.C.C. Is Moving to Restore Net Neutrality Regulations: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The News
The Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to move forward on a proposal to restore open internet rules, which were repealed during the Trump administration, with a final vote likely to come next year.
The commissioners at the Democratic-led agency voted 3 to 2 along party lines to kick off a monthslong process to bring back so-called net neutrality regulations that prohibit broadband providers from blocking or slowing down services like Google and Netflix on their networks.
Telecommunications companies that provide broadband and Republicans have vowed to fight the proposal, saying it will be too much of a burden on broadband providers.
Why It Matters
By voting to move ahead with a proposal to restore net neutrality, the F.C.C. is broadening its reach.
The move will ultimately enable the agency to categorize high-speed internet as a utility, like water or electricity. That is a major step toward modernizing the agency's objectives, especially as consumers increasingly depend on the internet as their main source for communications. The agency will then be able to police broadband providers for net neutrality violations, consumer harm and security lapses.
"Now is the time for our rules of the road for internet service providers to reflect the reality that internet access is a necessity for daily life," Jessica Rosenworcel, the chair of the F.C.C., said in a statement.
Background: What is net neutrality?
Net neutrality is a wonky principle of equal internet access.
The idea is that broadband customers should have access to any site without interference by high-speed internet service providers. The concept, coined more than 15 years ago by Tim Wu, a Columbia law school professor, was initially developed to stop cable and telecom companies that provide internet services from blocking or slowing down the delivery of sites like Google, Netflix and Skype, which compete with them.
The debate over net neutrality has been highly partisan. The F.C.C. established net neutrality regulations during the Obama administration, but Republicans criticized them as an overreach. Telecom companies have also argued that net neutrality rules could lead to regulatory creep and the regulation of broadband rates. The F.C.C., led by Republicans under President Donald J. Trump, repealed the rules in 2017.
Ms. Rosenworcel, a Democrat, has said she decided to revive the debate after seeing the importance of broadband oversight in the coronavirus pandemic. Broadband became a necessity for education and work during lockdowns, but the agency couldn't force providers to ensure quality service, she said.
What Critics Say
Republican lawmakers are fighting the move to restore net neutrality rules. In a letter to Ms. Rosenworcel this week, Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee slammed the proposal as a "solution in search of a problem."
USTelecom, the trade group representing companies like AT&T and Verizon, wrote letters this week to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees warning of "mission creep" by the F.C.C. into cybersecurity. The letters said the F.C.C. was potentially sowing confusion among government agencies and congressional committees over national security issues related to broadband.
Brendan Carr, a Republican commissioner at the F.C.C., said broadband services had improved without regulation. He criticized the proposal as counterproductive for consumers.
"There will be lots of talk about 'net neutrality' and virtually none about the core issue before the agency: namely, whether the F.C.C. should claim for itself the freewheeling power to micromanage nearly every aspect of how the internet functions -- from the services that consumers can access to the prices that can be charged," Mr. Carr said.
What's Next
The F.C.C. will begin taking public comments on the proposed rule. The chair can then choose to incorporate comments into a final draft. The commission will then vote on enacting the regulation in early 2024 at the earliest.

The Devil on Trial: [Review]

Full text: This documentary revisits a 1981 homicide that the defense tried to attribute to demonic possession.
It isn't for me to say whether Arne Cheyenne Johnson really killed his landlord Alan Bono because he was possessed by a demon, as his lawyers tried to argue in a landmark 1981 trial in Connecticut known as the "devil made me do it" case. But on the basis of the spurious, crudely sensational documentary "The Devil on Trial," it isn't for the director, Christopher Holt, to say what really happened, either.
The film strives to present a credible account of a disturbing story, which also involves the supposed possession of a young boy and an exorcism conducted under the guidance of the self-declared ghost hunters and demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren -- events loosely depicted onscreen in "The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It," a fictionalized account.
The story is that Johnson accidentally summoned the demon possessing the child to enter his own body, igniting the mayhem that followed.
While the documentary's opening credits insist that "all the audio recordings and photographs" used are real, the film appears to have little interest in the truth and even less in reportorial integrity.
The photographs, which purport to show evidence of possession, have been so heavily filtered and processed that "real" seems misleading. The old, garbled audio recordings are not compelling testimony either, and the filmmakers know it: They've goosed them up with sound effects and dramatic theme music.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Firsthand accounts of the events from Johnson and others are used as fodder for slick re-enactments, which is where Holt really goes to town: Houses shake, lights shudder and shadowy figures lurk mysteriously, all in the style of a third-rate horror movie. The desperation to be scary, rather than engaging or provocative, is an intellectual failure, and an artistic one -- a failure of imagination. Instead of challenging assumptions, exploring implications or discussing the difficult questions here, Holt merely mines the material for superficial shock value and lurid titillation.
The Devil on Trial
Rated TV-MA for disturbing imagery and violence. Running time: 1 hour 21 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

This Weekend I Have ...: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Our TV critic recommends an afterlife comedy, an intriguing documentary and a five-in-one British murder show.
This weekend I have ...
a half-hour, and I want something fun and tricky.
'Upload'
When to watch: Season 3 begins Friday, on Amazon.
Robbie Amell and Andy Allo star in this bright and cynical afterlife comedy, where the only thing more certain than the icy finger of death is the rapaciousness of capitalist greed. Start at the beginning here; there is an involved mythology of renegade love, corporate malfeasance and secret doppelgängers. And jokes! ("We went to Niagara-La Croix on our honeymoon, right after they carbonated.") "Upload" is biting but it isn't miserable -- some of its characters may be dead and existing as consciousnesses uploaded to a corporate cloud, but they still have their senses of humor. If you miss "The Good Place," or you just have a hole in your heart where a smart and dexterous show is supposed to go, watch this.
... a few hours, and I like third acts.
'The Greatest Show Never Made'
When to watch: Now, on Amazon.
This three-part documentary about a hoax is surprisingly tender rather than tawdry. In 2002, reality television was a relatively new genre with outrageous setups and life-changing prizes. So when 30 people (including Tim Eagle and Lucie Miller) were cast on a social experiment-format show in London, they thought they were embarking on a dazzling new chapter. It turned out, though, that the guy running everything was just ... a guy running everything: There was no network, no money, no actual show. "Greatest" uses clever stylistic techniques, including fully recreating the apartment where much of the "show" was filmed, to tease out a complicated, surprising story about fame and change.
... several hours, and I love a buffet.
'Bodies'
When to watch: Now, on Netflix.
If you love a British cop show but can't choose between historical, contemporary or futuristic crimes and investigations, try "Bodies," which crams four murder shows into one and throws in a time-travel scientist show for good measure. Luckily, it works. Amaka Okafor anchors the present-day timeline as an investigator who finds a naked body in an alley; eventually, she and we learn that in 1890, 1941 and 2053, other cops have found naked bodies in the same spot, each with the same apparent cause of death and strange wrist tattoo. There's a lot happening in "Bodies," and it all happens quickly and with a fun urgency. It is also pretty gross in terms of old-timey autopsies and such, so the super squeamish should proceed with caution.

Full text: Mr. Stewart and Apple are parting ways because of creative differences over "The Problem," people with knowledge of the decision said.
Jon Stewart's show on Apple's streaming service is abruptly coming to an end, according to several people with knowledge of the decision, the result of creative differences between the tech giant and the former "Daily Show" host.
Mr. Stewart and Apple executives decided to part ways in recent days, two of the people said. Members of the show's staff were informed about its end on Thursday. Taping of episodes for the third season was scheduled to begin within a couple of weeks, one of the people said.
The Apple show, "The Problem With Jon Stewart," debuted to some fanfare two years ago as Mr. Stewart's return to the talk show format after a six-year hiatus. As host of "The Daily Show" from 1999 to 2015, he turned a low-rated Comedy Central late-night series into a cultural force, becoming one of the nation's best-known media and political critics.
But Mr. Stewart and Apple executives had disagreements over some of the topics and guests on "The Problem," two of the people said. Mr. Stewart told members of his staff on Thursday that potential show topics related to China and artificial intelligence were causing concern among Apple executives, a person with knowledge of the meeting said. As the 2024 presidential campaign begins to heat up, there was potential for further creative disagreements, one of the people said.
A representative for Apple declined to comment.
Apple's foray into entertainment has raised the risk of collateral damage to its brand or estrangement of the diverse customers who buy its pricey iPhones and iPads. As of September, Apple TV+ had more than 19.8 million U.S. subscribers, according to data from the analytics firm Antenna, excluding deals with some distributors.
Delving into current events, as Mr. Stewart did on "The Problem," could have put Apple at the center of the kinds of political and geopolitical controversies that other major corporations have confronted, including the way conservatives turned on Disney or liberals protested Starbucks over gun safety concerns. Though Apple hadn't faced similar boycotts or criticism, the possibility was there with each episode -- 20 in all.
In its two seasons, "The Problem" confronted several hot-button topics, including gun control and gender identity.
The show initially had difficulty gaining traction. By the second season, though, several interviews generated viral clips online, and the season was nominated for the outstanding talk series Emmy. (The prime-time Emmys ceremony is scheduled for Jan. 15.)
Now "The Problem" will join the many other talk shows that failed to survive in the streaming world, including ones hosted by Sarah Silverman, Norm Macdonald, Chelsea Handler and Joel McHale. Netflix, which made several attempts at a talk show, has moved on from the format.
Streaming shows usually depend on a significant shelf life, whereas cable and network talk shows lean on the urgency of a topical news cycle.

Old Dads: [Review]

Full text: A curmudgeon, starting fatherhood late, has lots to say about the world.
Don't get your hopes up: This is not a documentary about Al Pacino, Robert De Niro and Mick Jagger. "Old Dads" is the feature directorial debut of Bill Burr, a popular 50-something comedian with a shaved head and a light beard who plays Jack, who came to fatherhood late.
Jack narrates in a voice not unlike that of Burr's standup persona, responding to the issues that confound the contemporary straight white male with profane non-sequiturs. Jack muses that he can't leave his child in the car to pop into a convenience store, but that said store is free to sell hormone-packed junk foods, and that nobody cares because they're addicted to internet pornography. I'm paraphrasing.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
As is customary in today's Guy Comedies, Jack is part of a trio -- with Bokeem Woodbine and Bobby Cannavale, who play his business partners, Mike and Conner. They've just sold their successful concern to an unctuous young start-up bro (Miles Robbins) whose "disrupter" shtick provides fodder for more modern-life-is-rubbish humor.
The movie emphasizes Jack's near-constant indignation about adult scooter riders and parking as much as it does his parenting concerns. Jack and his wife, Leah, are currently worried that their son might not get a proper kindergarten recommendation. As such, Jack locks horns with a principal (Rachael Harris) who, like many of the parents who surround Jack and Leah, is a parody of both 1980s-style New Age bromide-spouters and insipid practitioners of today's "woke" philosophies.
Many scenes are predicated on Jack's eye-rolling, then shouty reactions to phrases like "inclusive adjacent" or "check your privilege." Burr is skilled at this, for sure. And Woodbine and Cannavale, who are better actors overall, slide into Burr's mode with ease. The results will prove satisfactory and maybe cathartic for his fans.
Old Dads
Rated R for language themes, nudity, more language. Running time: 1 hour 44 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

Striking Actors Reprise Familiar Roles: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In January, Francesca Xuereb took the leap many actors in Los Angeles dream of: She quit her waitressing job. After booking a recurring role in HBO Max's "The Sex Lives of College Girls" and performing another for a forthcoming show on Peacock, she was meeting with producers and auditioning five or six times a week.
"I was getting a lot of traction," she said.
But the concurrent strikes by the Writers Guild of America and Ms. Xuereb's performers' union, SAG-AFTRA, put all that on hold. She is now back at her serving job, working four shifts a week at Akasha, a neighborhood farm-to-table restaurant in Culver City.
"It definitely felt like slowing down, and that doesn't necessarily feel good," she said. "I don't mind working in the restaurant. My picture of what being an actress would look like is working as a server until I was able to not go back."
The strikes have brought the entertainment business to a standstill. The Writer's Guild strike, which began in May, ended on Sept. 27, but the SAG-AFTRA strike, which started in July, continues. Writers, actors, set decorators and production coordinators have all slid back into the industry that serves as Hollywood's shadow partner: restaurants.
In Los Angeles it's a cliché that the ranks of hosts, waiters and bartenders are filled with aspiring comedians, actors and writers. And while the rise of gig work like driving for ride-share companies means that food service is not necessarily the default job for newly arrived dreamers, the strike has supercharged demand for restaurant jobs.
Erika Rotolo, the director of human resources for the local breakfast-taco chain HomeState, said that while hiring for two new locations this summer, the company was flooded with applications from not only actors and writers, but also art directors, seamstresses and makeup artists. Open calls were packed, and a job posting for a dishwasher, which the restaurant would normally struggle to fill, had to be taken down after drawing 70 applications in 12 hours.
Ms. Rotolo said that while she loves working alongside creative people in restaurants, she had mixed emotions. "We were excited to have so many applicants," she said. "Another part of me felt badly because people were putting some of their creative and personal dreams on hold due to what's going on."
Chelsea Rendon, a SAG-AFTRA strike captain at Warner Brothers, has performed in both film and television since she was 5 years old, and was a series regular on Starz's "Vida," which ended in 2020. She said a combination of shrinking residuals, Covid slowdowns and a lack of opportunities for Latinos left her financially drained even before the strike.
In May, when the Writers Guild walked out, she took her first-ever restaurant job at Roadside Taco in Studio City, where she'd been a regular diner.
"Normally, you have a day job as a server, and once you get a good booking you quit," she said. "I feel like I've had a successful career and had been able to provide for myself, and all of a sudden I can't."
Still, she finds the job's routine a surprising balm. "It felt amazing to have somewhere to go and have a purpose.," she said. "So much of life as actors is waiting for auditions, waiting for callbacks."
John Dellaporta had never been able to fully leave his restaurant job, but the strike shifted him from picking up occasional shifts -- "spackle," as he put it -- to working regular nights at Miceli's, the oldest Italian restaurant in Hollywood. Before the strike, he'd booked his first recurring role, on HBO's "Winning Time," which has since been canceled.
At Miceli's, the servers take turns singing for the guests, which he said he enjoys because it gives him a chance to perform even as Hollywood is shut down. "I go back to my tables and make the joke, 'I'm not just a singer, I'm also your waiter,"' he said. "It gets more laughs than it deserves."
Writers are rarer than actors in the restaurant ranks, in part because climbing the writing career ladder can involve a decade of office-based assistant work.
Hillary Handelsman was working in her first staff writing job in the summer of 2022, on the Netflix comedy "Survival of the Thickest." The show didn't air for a year, leaving Ms. Handelsman in financial limbo before the strike even began. Finding part-time work was a struggle until she was put in touch with Cookie Good, a cookie business started by a screenwriter during the 2007 strike.
At one point she was doing a delivery in her Cookie Good outfit and saw a colleague from an agency where she had worked 10 years earlier. "Oh, God, what if they see me and I have to explain?" Handelsman remembered thinking. "As time has gone on, I'm so much less sensitive about it. I'm supporting myself and there's nothing to be embarrassed about."
For nine years, the actor and comic Elyssa Phillips has been a server at Osteria Mozza, the high-end Italian restaurant run by Nancy Silverton. Since coming to Los Angeles, Ms. Phillips has nabbed a number of co-starring roles in TV, and was the artistic director of the Pack Theater in Hollywood. But the one time she tried cutting back her hours at Mozza, she couldn't afford the parking meters near work. She credits the job with giving her the flexibility to serve as a strike captain of the picket line outside Disney studios.
Ms. Phillips has always tried to keep her life in entertainment separate from her work in the restaurant, an effort that grew more complicated during the strike. "There are studio executives I've taken care of for nine years. I know when their anniversaries are, I know if they like a black or white napkin, I know how they like a martini. I try to never ever talk about entertainment," she said.
If a regular finds out she's a strike captain, she changes the subject: "Let me get you a martini. Let me do what I'm here to do."
Ms. Phillips called working at Mozza "the best restaurant job in Los Angeles," but she said she hopes the strike will allow more working actors to leave their day jobs. "Being a member of this union, we have a certain level of responsibility, and that responsibility is keeping acting as a career and not as freelance work," she said.
Ms. Xuereb, who began her career in 2020, is newer to the industry but understands that conditions are not what they once were. "When I talk to mentors, it sounds like the way I was working, with a few guest stars every few months -- people used to raise a family on that," she said.
Talks between the performers' union and the studios were recently suspended, but even when the strike eventually ends, it will likely be months before production ramps up again, especially with the holidays approaching. Every actor and writer will be out auditioning and pitching at once, too.
Ms. Rotolo said HomeState recently lost an employee who was called back to her job as a showrunner, but otherwise the restaurant is fully staffed.
Ms. Xuereb said she expects to keep her restaurant job for the time being. "It's not the dream," Ms. Xuereb said. But, she added, "This is part of it, working to be able to do the thing that you love."

Is the Literary Hat Vying to Become the New Tote Bag?: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For $ 27 (not including tax and shipping), you can own a baseball cap embroidered with the name of your favorite literary darling, too.
Zadie Smith. Elif Batuman. Joyce Carol Oates. Dionne Brand. Alice Munro. Patricia Lockwood. Olga Tokarczuk. Lydia Davis. Rachel Kushner. Deborah Levy. Rachel Cusk. Yoko Tawada. Chris Kraus. Mary Gaitskill. Sheila Heti. Fleur Jaeggy.
These are the women whose novels are spotlighted in personal collections and bookstores alike. They are a mainstay on best-seller lists, amassing accolades that include the National Book Award, the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize. And you have most likely read them all -- you may even have a favorite.
Recently, these writers inadvertently found their names, quite literally, at the center of the latest maelstrom brewing on X, formerly known as Twitter. The culprit? Hats.
On Sept. 22, Minor Canon -- described as a "fan project, not a brand or an art project" on its website, where it sells book and art merchandise (not unlike a brand) -- posted photos of its latest drop: solid-colored baseball caps, embroidered with the names of prominent female writers. "CONTEMPORARY WOMEN," the post reads on the X platform, "Available Now."
Criticism and mockery soon followed: The hats were confusing (at $ 27 apiece, which does not include tax or shipping); posturing (As one observer said: "Wow! You read! And you've read books by a woman! That's so crazy!"); exploitative (Minor Canon did not initially ask the writers for permission to use their names or offer them a cut of its profits).
Within a day of the release, Minor Canon removed the hats from its website and paused all future orders. Saelan Twerdy, 41, Minor Canon's founder, who works in publishing in Montreal, said in a statement that he had reached out to the authors after the controversy and had apologized for not seeking their consent in advance.
"I designed these products because I am a huge fan of the authors involved, and the last thing I would want is for them to feel exploited or disrespected," Mr. Twerdy said over email, adding that he fully understood "if anyone would prefer not to be commodified in this way." A number of authors have already responded to him, he said, and have been "generally positive."
Ridicule aside, some readers not so secretly pined for the hats, while others readily admitted that they had bought the caps featuring their favorite literary darlings. The issue, it seems, is not so much an empty gesture toward feminism or a failure to seek the writers' approval as it is with book swag itself.
It's reading as a wink, a performance.
"Books, like the clothes you wear or the car you own, are symbols of a person's tastes, of their aesthetic and intellectual sensibilities," said Terry Nguyen, a contributing editor for Dirt, a daily newsletter about the internet and pop culture, who wrote an essay about the aesthetics of bookishness.
She continued: "In the digital age, there is more social value a person (or celebrity) can cultivate in appearing well-read or knowledgeable about best-selling titles or popular authors."
For bibliophiles, Ms. Nguyen added, the discomfort may lie in how a book, like any other product, can become a commodity: Branded merchandise is just that anxiety reincarnate. "Rachel Cusk and Zadie Smith have become, in effect, literary brands -- once their names are removed from the context of a book's cover and placed on a hat or a tote bag," she said.
Bookish aesthetics are not unique to Minor Canon. Dirt sells a hat emblazoned with "Girl Moss" (a play on the term "girl boss" and a nod to a viral tweet posted by one of the newsletter's founders, Daisy Alioto). On Friday, the magazine n + 1 dropped a "Track Changes" hat (also $ 27), celebrating the release of an art-criticism handbook of the same name.
Previously, every few years, a book might become canon within a niche group of readers. In 2015, for instance, T-shirts printed with "Jude & JB & Willem & Malcolm" -- the main characters of Hanya Yanagihara's "A Little Life" (Ms. Yanagihara is the editor in chief of T Magazine) -- became something like a closet staple for some gay men.
Other books were accompanied by savvy marketing that turned merch into a red-velvet-roped area of Who's Who. In 2021, Sally Rooney's "Beautiful World, Where Are You?" dropped alongside a book-branded hat, tote bag and umbrella, flooding the social media accounts of so-called literary celebrities and influencers. But in 2023, lame is the tote bag branded with highly anticipated titles with bloated marketing budgets -- and vogue is the literary hat.
So what is it, exactly, about the accessory?
Is it the ultimate pairing of the lowbrow (baseball cap) and the highbrow (literature)? Or is it wearing books as one might wear cult fashion labels -- and the uncanny performance of it all? Does it matter?
Perhaps the better question is, Are the hats even cool? That, Ms. Nguyen said, depends on the wearer. "My general philosophy is that branded merch is fun and a good conversation starter," she said.
Pat Montano, an artist in Brooklyn who uses they and them pronouns, said they had almost bought the Dionne Brand hat. It wasn't the price tag or the minor controversy that had deterred their purchase. Rather, Mx. Montano said, they already owned an Annie Ernaux hat in a death-metal font.
We're too online, they said, and no one needs to defend a $ 27 purchase to strangers. "Everybody just needs to log off," Mx. Montano said, "pick up a book and lay on some grass -- or some moss."

Full text: As Netflix pours more of its resources into original content, Amazon Prime Video is picking up the slack, adding new movies for its subscribers each month. Its catalog has grown so impressive, in fact, that it's a bit overwhelming. Here are some of our favorites you can stream right now.
'Sound of Metal' (2020)
Riz Ahmed is devastatingly good as Ruben, a drummer whose entire life -- his music, his relationship, his self-image -- is upended by a sudden case of extreme hearing loss, in this wrenching drama from the writer and director Darius Marder. Ruben's sense of solitude, even with others, quickly transforms to self-consciousness, then self-doubt, then self-destruction. "Sound of Metal" is ultimately less about finding a cure than finding the stillness within oneself. Marder works in a quiet, observational style, skillfully avoiding clichés, taking turns both satisfying and moving. Our critic praised the film's "distinctive style."
'Women Talking' (2022)
The writer and director Sarah Polley, adapting the novel by Miriam Toews, tells the haunting tale of an insular religious community ripped apart by the actions of its predatory men. Those crimes are seen briefly, in flashback; the primary focus of Polley's film is a long, difficult debate between several of the women in the community about what will happen next. Assembling a cast of first-rate actors (including Jessie Buckley, Claire Foy, Judith Ivey, Rooney Mara, Frances McDormand and Ben Whishaw), Polley turns what could have been a polemic into an urgent, thoughtful morality play. (Polley's "Take This Waltz" is also streaming on Prime.)
'The Handmaiden' (2016)
The filmmaker Park Chan-wook ("Oldboy") takes the stylistic trappings of a period romance and gooses them with scorching eroticism and one of the most ingenious con-artist plots this side of "The Sting." Working from the Sarah Waters novel "Fingersmith," Park begins with the story of a young Korean woman who, as part of a seemingly straightforward swindle, goes to work as a Japanese heiress's handmaiden, occasionally pausing the plot to slyly reveal new information, reframing what we've seen and where we think he might go next. Our critic called it "amusingly slippery entertainment." (For an earlier example of peak erotic thriller, stream "Play Misty for Me.")
'All About My Mother' (1999)
This "passionate, wise and deeply felt" drama from the writer and director Pedro Almodóvar won the Oscar for best foreign-language film, and understandably so -- it's one of his finest and funniest films, a love letter to the stage and those who inhabit it. Telling a story with enough buried secrets and stunning turns to recall Douglas Sirk and Tennessee Williams, Almodóvar follows the nurse Manuela (Cecilia Roth), as the loss of her son leads her on a heart-wrenching (and occasionally gut-busting) journey into her colorful past. Penélope Cruz co-stars. (Amazon is also streaming Almodóvar's "Broken Embraces.")
'Night Comes On' (2018)
This Sundance sensation is a heart-wrenching story of grief, pain, regret and struggle. The director and co-writer Jordana Spiro tells the story of Angel (Dominique Fishback), released from jail on the eve of her 18th birthday and torn between getting her life together and finishing the crime that put her there. Spiro adopts a no-nonsense approach, digging into the probationary process and the various ways in which the deck is already stacked against her protagonist. In an unforgettable performance, Fishback eschews showy moments for a lived-in authenticity.
'The Untouchables' (1987)
This crackling riff on the hit 1959 television series could have been just another in the endless series of color-by-number TV-to-movie adaptations. But the personnel involved made it something special. Directed with stylishness and wit by Brian De Palma, written with toughness by David Mamet and scored with operatic intensity by Ennio Morricone, the film featured memorable performances by Kevin Costner, an Oscar-winning Sean Connery and an appropriately scenery-chewing Robert De Niro. With so much firepower, "The Untouchables" transcended its roots to become one of the snazziest, sharpest crime pictures of the 1980s.
'The Sugarland Express' (1974)
Steven Spielberg's first theatrical release (after the astonishing made-for-TV movie "Duel") is based on a true story and vibrates with verisimilitude, filling out scenes with authentic locations and colorful supporting characters, often played by local non-actors. But it's also, essentially, a two-hour chase scene, executed with breathless bravado by a director who was already a master craftsman, choreographing his automotive ballets as large-scale slapstick. "Sugarland" refuses to paint its Texas characters in broad strokes, so the flaws of the antiheroes are weighed equally with the decency of the lawmen. And this may be Goldie Hawn's finest performance, who funnels her persona (with its unquestionable warmth and charisma) into a genuine and singular character.

Full text: From Disney Channel bops to Nickelodeon theme songs, tween pop from the 2000s is proving to be an unironic draw at parties across the country.
It's a Friday night in 2006: The Bagel Bites are defrosting in the oven and a case of Capri Suns is chilling in the refrigerator. You turn on the TV in the living room, click your way to the Disney Channel, and prepare to sing both the Troy and Gabriella parts in "Breaking Free" from "High School Musical."
Flash-forward and it's 2023: The living room is now a bar, Capri Suns have turned into gin and tonics, and you are on the dance floor with dozens of other 20- and 30-somethings singing along to the "That's So Raven" theme song.
"I love Disney Channel, it's very nostalgic," Leslie Epps, 25, said at a recent party fueled by 2000s tween culture at Webster Hall, a concert venue in Manhattan. "We want to enjoy our youth in a way, and this is the way to do it. It's kind of like a school dance for adults."
For many adults, the tween pop acts of the 2000s represent a less complicated time of childhood innocence -- a time when Hannah Montana, the Jonas Brothers, Aly & AJ, the Cheetah Girls and Selena Gomez ruled the round-the-clock Disney Channel programming, while iCarly and Big Time Rush dominated on Nickelodeon. Young people of the 2000s lived in a pre-streaming world where pop culture catered to the youth market in a way it had not quite done so before.
In more recent times, nostalgia for the era has taken the form of random D.J. requests, tribute shows and themed parties at clubs.
"You would be surprised of how many times at weddings I get asked to play the Jonas Brothers, especially 'Burnin' Up,"' said Malcolm Alexander, a full-time D.J. and the owner of Brink Entertainment, a live-music and events company based in Long Beach, Calif.
This wasn't necessarily the case five or even 10 years ago, however, when Mr. Alexander was asked to play 'NSync and Paula Abdul tracks rather than Hannah Montana. He credits the popularity of streaming platforms such as Disney+ and Netflix in revitalizing interest in aughts tween pop. He now sneaks winking references to that culture into his mixes.
"I'll be playing Europop nostalgia like Daft Punk stuff or even Cher's 'Believe' and I'll see girls dancing," Mr. Alexander, 30, said. "I'm like, OK, if I mix Hilary Duff's 'What Dreams Are Made Of,' I know that's going to go off. And sure enough, it does."
Ms. Duff, who starred in 65 episodes of the Disney Channel hit "Lizzie McGuire," was also the muse for a benefit concert that the Atlanta singer Nadia Vaeh planned to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Ms. Duff's album "Metamorphosis." In August, Ms. Vaeh and several local musicians played the album in its entirety at local coffee shop to raise money for Y'all Rock Camp ATL, a nonprofit organization that offers music lessons to young musicians.
"My very first concert ever was Hilary Duff at 13 years old," Ms. Vaeh, who is now 32, recalled. "With the 20-year anniversary of this album, I found myself going down the Disney rabbit hole and revisiting everything. It's crazy how much of the songs are embedded in my brain."
For her performance, Ms. Vaeh channeled the Disney Channel star with a blond wig, low-rise denim jeans, a pink-and-orange mesh top and orange chunky-heeled sandals.
"The music now is more of a fleeting moment versus, like, a lifestyle," she said. "We were going through Cheetah Girls or Hilary as kids to just get through the day."
Away from your childhood bedroom, lavish weddings and coffee shops, the 2000s tween music movement has also made its way into clubs and theaters across the country.
The actor and D.J. Matt Bennett has been touring clubs and theaters on and off since 2019 with his popular Party 101 events. Before he played Cheetah Girls mixes from his laptop, he played Robbie Shapiro on four seasons of the Nickelodeon sitcom "Victorious," which debuted in 2010.
Mr. Bennett, 31, said he was inspired to start throwing parties celebrating all things aughts back in 2019, when, during a night out in Los Angeles, a D.J. played "Come Clean" by Ms. Duff and "the place just exploded."
Shortly after that experience, he started to create mash-ups drawing on songs from "The Lizzie McGuire Movie" (2003) all the way to his "Victorious" days.
"Everybody is now getting independent streams of content on TikTok and Instagram," Mr. Bennett said. The particular monoculture that began in the early 2000s "was the last time where everybody was kind of still watching TV and being fed the same stuff and this music was a part of that."
According to Tyler Bickford, an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in children's literature and childhood studies, there was an "arms race" around the tail end of the last century during which children's consumer and media companies became convinced that if they failed to lock in the 9-to-12 demographic, they would be dead in the water.
"This era was about the importance of children -- both as performers and consumers -- to mainstream popular culture," he said.
According to Professor Bickford, whose work examines the rise of the tween music industry from its childish roots and into legitimizing children's participation in public culture, pop music allowed these companies to start building inroads with young consumers.
"This tween moment kind of normalized pop music for kids," Professor Bickford said.
Mr. Bennett's Party 101 -- its name is a reference to another Nickelodeon series, "Zoey 101" -- is currently on tour throughout the country. At recent stops in New York, Atlanta and Boise, he has brought his "Victorious" castmates Avan Jogia, Elizabeth Gillies and Daniella Monet to the stage.
The show has Mr. Bennett mixing and matching bits of auditory aughts nostalgia like songs from Disney Channel Original movies and Nickelodeon theme songs. The almost two-hour set of mash-ups is accompanied with onstage video screens featuring clips from beloved shows -- and even Disney Channel commercials from the era.
After not being able to secure tickets to the sold-out show in Cleveland, where she lives, Whitney Nicole, 24, decided to make the trek out to New York for last month's show at Webster Hall.
"Back then, you didn't really have any real problems, and it's kind of like a stress-free time in my life," said Ms. Nicole, who was wearing a Big Time Rush T-shirt (she said she had seen the band, which originated as a fictional act on a Nickelodeon show of the same name, "40 times in concert"). "So I feel like whenever I hear that music, I forget that I'm an adult."
"Me and my friends still drive around town blasting this music,"' said another attendee, Daniel Ventura, 26. "Our go-to crying song is 'Butterfly Fly Away' from the Hannah Montana movie."
For Mr. Bennett, Party 101 is about more than just letting loose and forgetting your adult responsibilities.
"Culturally, there's a lot of joy that goes into this, and a lot of joy that people seem to get from it, especially post-pandemic lockdown," he said. "Anybody can replicate this; it doesn't have to be on a gigantic scale."
Of all the singalongs featured in and shrieks of excitement generated by this ultra-specific playlist, one ballad, "This Is Me" from the 2008 Disney Channel original movie "Camp Rock," seemed to capture the emotion and energy of the Webster Hall performance.
Joining in the lyrics of self-empowerment ("Now I've found who I am there's no way to hold it in, no more hiding who I want to be this is me"), some sang to their friends while others projected their voice to the main stage, all of them enjoying one night when the realities of adulthood felt just a little farther away.

Water Access? That's Just Part of a Town's Appeal.: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Once known as a military town, this Monmouth County borough is reinventing itself with a slew of new development. (Just ask Netflix.)
After Covid hit, Ted Dalton and Lucy Banduci spent a lot of time traveling between their weekend house in the Catskill Mountains and their two-bedroom condo in Brooklyn, where they returned for their children's schooling. The uncertain time accelerated their conversations about leaving the city entirely, as it did for so many New Yorkers.
Mr. Dalton, 51, who grew up in the Princeton, N.J., area and had worked and lived in New York for more than 25 years, was reluctant to leave, but Ms. Banduci, 46, a Queens native, was ready for something new. With what he described as "no allegiances to anywhere," the couple began looking at houses in Connecticut, Westchester County and New Jersey in early 2021.
Familiar with Rumson, N.J. -- "the name town with big houses," as Mr. Dalton put it -- they soon discovered neighboring Fair Haven, Little Silver and then Oceanport.
"Oceanport was more of a sleeper town that people didn't know as well," said Mr. Dalton, the managing director of real estate finance for a bank in Manhattan. "But everyone we talked to seemed so happy to be there. We'd look at houses, and then we'd go grab a bite to eat, sitting right on the water and thinking, 'This is the best."'
Of course, they weren't the only ones seeking a lifestyle change at the time -- or the only couple to discover Oceanport, a 3.2-square-mile Monmouth County borough of 6,150 residents near the Jersey Shore. Over the following months, Mr. Dalton and Ms. Banduci were outbid on six homes, despite going as much as $ 100,000 over the asking prices, before finally securing their 3,300-square-foot house in July 2021, paying $ 1.275 million.
Since moving into the recently built, four-bedroom, four-bath house, they've added a pool and joined the Monmouth Beach Bathing Pavilion beach club. Their 11-year-old son, Theodore, has started sailing lessons at the nearby Shrewsbury River Yacht Club, and their daughter, Josie, 6, has taken up horseback riding and Irish step dancing. Their neighborhood abutting Blackberry Bay is also being transformed.
"Every house is being bought, and there's construction on every other block," Mr. Dalton said. "It's a changing of the guard."
Oceanport is mostly known as the home of Monmouth Park Racetrack, which occupies 275 acres, and the former Fort Monmouth Army base. Opened in 1917 as a central post for Army research, intelligence and communication, Fort Monmouth was decommissioned in 2005 and closed in 2011, leaving empty swaths of the 1,126-acre military base, which is split between Oceanport, Eatontown and Tinton Falls.
"Oceanport was a military town. You would hear taps playing and canons going off. It was alive," recalled Thomas J. Tvrdik, 44, a lifelong resident who is a real estate agent with Re/Max and a member of the borough council. "Then, for years, it sat vacant and desolate, so it's nice to see it come alive again."
That new life has emerged as investors have snatched up parcels of former base property to build new housing, commercial and recreational facilities. In December 2022, the Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Authority approved a $ 55 million bid by Netflix to buy 292 acres, 117 of them in Oceanport. Destined to become the streaming giant's East Coast production hub, the site will be built out over the next decade with 12 sound stages and extensive support space, and it promises to bring thousands of jobs and millions of dollars to the region.
"Netflix is an economic driver for the whole area, just like the fort was," said John F. Coffey, Oceanport's mayor, who described Fort Monmouth's closure and the sudden loss of 10,000 local jobs as "something that was dropped on our heads." "This was a hot spot of activity, and it will be a hot spot again. The difference is, it will be paying taxes now."
What You'll Find
Surrounded and divided by the Shrewsbury River's tributary bays and creeks, and just two miles from the Atlantic coast, Oceanport is defined by its connection to water -- from the numerous homes that back up to waterways to the borough's three marinas, multiple boat ramps and nearby beach clubs.
"You have waterfront access everywhere, and you're close enough to the beach that kids can ride their bikes there. But it's a more affordable option than the shore towns," said Helen George, 61, an agent with Resources Real Estate, who taught second grade in Oceanport for 30 years.
Being adjacent to the coast, but not on it, has made Oceanport more affordable in the past. But that is changing as ranch houses gain second stories and Cape Cods are replaced with larger homes. Given the desirability of the area, Mr. Coffey said he sees such development as inevitable, noting that "others have already gone through this period of growth, and Oceanport is the last of the local towns to do so."
Beach proximity is what convinced Frank and Jennifer Giocastro to move to Oceanport, after years of visiting the area from their home in Queens. "Every time we'd go to leave Jersey, my kids would cry that they wanted to stay," said Mr. Giocastro, 47, a plasterer for the New York City Housing Authority, who bought a five-bedroom house in Oceanport in 2019, paying $ 940,000. "Coming from Queens after 40-something years, it's like being on vacation, but we live here."
While anticipation over Netflix's arrival has been running high, the Oceanport portion of Fort Monmouth has already seen significant development, including 180 townhouses being built by Pulte Homes and the rehab of former officers' housing into 68 homes, plus an adjacent 48 rental units. Other projects include the construction of a fitness center, a senior care center, a craft beer brewery, a sports bar, a satellite campus for New Jersey City University, and a new borough complex of government offices. There is no central commercial district in town, but plans for a retail, office and hotel project are underway on a 12-acre lot at the former military base.
Also slated for an update is Monmouth Park Racetrack, where thoroughbred horses have raced each summer since 1947. As interest in horse racing waned, the racetrack sought additional revenue, and in 2016 it became the first site in New Jersey to add sports betting. Plans are now underway for Caesars Sportsbook to build a high-end betting center at the track, Mr. Coffey said.
What You'll Pay
In early October, there were ­­­20 homes on the market in Oceanport, and 15 pending sales. The most expensive listing was a five-bedroom house built in 2003 on 0.49 acres on Horseneck Point Peninsula, listed for $ 1.65 million; the least expensive was a three-bedroom house built in 1985 on 0.06 acres, listed for $ 519,850.
The median price of the 65 homes sold between January and the end of September this year was $ 785,000, according to the Monmouth Ocean Multiple Listing Service; during the first nine months of 2022, 53 homes sold for a median price of $ 690,000.
The Vibe
If you aren't keen to join the yacht club or park your boat in one of the borough's marinas, there are public ramps that offer access to the river. Kayaks and paddle boards are available to rent at Oceanport Paddle Club at Riverside Marina, where there is also a restaurant that serves lobster rolls. In nearby Long Branch, Monmouth Beach and Sea Bright, there are several beach clubs that require annual membership, as well as scattered public access points.
Occupying the site of the former Fort Monmouth Commissary is Birdsmouth Beer, a craft brewery that opened last year, and the newly opened Baseline Social, a 17,000-square-foot sports bar and virtual golf center. A former World War II dance hall has been transformed into Park Loft, a wedding and catering venue.
The Schools
Oceanport students attend Wolf Hill Elementary School, which has 312 students in prekindergarten through fourth grade, and Maple Place Middle School, with 249 students in fifth through eighth grade. In 2019, voters approved a $ 33 million referendum to upgrade the elementary and middle schools, a project that is now underway.
For high school, students from Oceanport join those from West Long Branch, Sea Bright and Monmouth Beach at Shore Regional High School, in West Long Branch, which has an enrollment of 594 students in ninth through 12th grade. The high school offers 23 Advanced Placement courses. Average SAT scores in 2021-22 were 552 in reading and writing and 543 in math, compared with state averages of 538 and 532.
Students can also apply to one of Monmouth County's specialized high schools focusing on law, biotechnology and applied sciences. Private school choices include Ranney School in Tinton Falls, for prekindergarten through 12th grade, and Red Bank Catholic High School in Red Bank, for ninth through 12th grade.
The Commute
Oceanport is about 60 miles south of New York City, a drive that can take around 90 minutes, depending on traffic.
New Jersey Transit offers direct train service to Penn Station in Manhattan from neighboring Little Silver or Long Branch; the trip takes 80 to 100 minutes and costs $ 16 one way or $ 451 for a monthly pass from Little Silver, or $ 16.25 one way or $ 463 for a monthly pass from Long Branch.
A faster alternative is taking the Seastreak Ferry from Highlands or Atlantic Highlands, about 10 miles north of Oceanport. The trip to Lower or Midtown Manhattan takes 40 to 60 minutes and costs $ 28 one way or $ 720 for 40 tickets.
The History
In 1938, the Fort Monmouth Army base developed the first radar system, used to detect oncoming attacks and later to bounce radio signals off the moon. Among the radar staff was Julius Rosenberg, who worked as an electrical engineer in the early 1940s, during which time he was accused of stealing sensitive information and sharing it with the Soviet Union. He was later convicted as a spy and executed, along with his wife, Ethel.

Full text: When it comes to at-home fitness, carving out a dedicated space for movement can make the difference between a workout completed and a workout skipped. As a personal trainer, I know firsthand how empowering it can be to exercise in your home. Here are five cheap(ish) things to help you transform a corner of your home into a spot where fitness goals can take shape and be realized. INGRID SKJONG
Find a sturdy, comfortable yoga mat. The signal to yourself that workout time is about to begin can be as simple as rolling out a yoga mat. The Yoga Accessories 1/4" Extra Thick Deluxe Yoga Mat provides a fourth inch of squishy yet supportive PVC foam to ground your poses or exercises.
Save space with a set of adjustable dumbbells. Strength training is an essential part of a well-rounded fitness strategy. To get as much as possible out of your strength training, the load you lift needs to increase as your strength improves. The Core Home Fitness Adjustable Dumbbell Set saves space compared to a full suite of dumbbells.
Use resistance bands to help with prehab and rehab. To supplement strength training, the Perform Better Exercise Mini Bands are compact and handy for a host of different exercises aimed at prehab (injury prevention) and rehab (injury recovery). They have a folded length of 10 inches (two inches shorter than most), which makes for a tighter fit.
Limit distractions with a device stand. Keeping your workout time as distraction-free as possible is often easier said than done, so don't let a slipping phone or a toppling tablet be your downfall. Whether you use a device to stream a workout, to refer to exercise descriptions or to keep up with Netflix, it should be anchored securely with a device stand.
Use a foam roller for self-massaging. There aren't loads of scientific evidence backing the use of foam rollers, but that hasn't stopped them from becoming fixtures in gyms. Many experts agree that if foam rolling makes you feel good, keep doing it. A high-density foam roller is efficient for self-myofascial release, self-massage that's focused on breaking up knots in tissue called fascia and easing tight muscles.

Poll Shows Sentiment
Of Consumers Souring
U.S. consumer sentiment deteriorated in October, with households expecting higher inflation over the next year, but labor market strength was likely to continue supporting consumer spending.
The third straight monthly decline in sentiment reported by the University of Michigan on Friday was across nearly all demographic groups. Consumers' 12-month inflation expectations increased to a five-month high.
Sentiment was also most likely hurt by violence in the Middle East, in addition to the continuing auto strike and political dysfunction in Washington.
"There were a lot of reasons sentiment could have fallen, given different geopolitical events and the macro picture being highly uncertain, but the movements in sentiment are pretty volatile and don't necessarily move in line with broader spending," said Shannon Seery, an economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, N.C.

ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY
Best Buy Will Discontinue
Selling DVDs and Blu-rays
Best Buy is saying goodbye to movie-watching with physical discs. The consumer electronics retailer plans to phase out its DVD and Blu-ray sales by early 2024 -- with physical movies set to be sold in-stores and online through the holidays, Best Buy confirmed on Friday. Video games will not be impacted.
"The way we watch movies and TV shows is much different today than it was decades ago," the company said in an emailed statement. "Making this change gives us more space and opportunity to bring customers new and innovative tech for them to explore, discover and enjoy."
Best Buy isn't the only company to start moving away from physical media in recent months. Last month, Netflix's DVD-by-mail service, for example, officially came to a close as the company's iconic red-and-white envelopes made their final trip. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Faulty Axle Bolt Prompts New Ford Explorer Recall
Ford is recalling more than 238,000 Explorers in the U.S. because a rear axle bolt can fail, potentially causing a loss of drive power or allowing the SUVs to roll away while in park.
The recall comes after U.S. safety regulators opened an investigation into the problem after getting two complaints that repairs didn't work in two previous recalls this year and in 2022.
Affected are certain Explorers from the 2020 through 2022 model years.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says in documents posted Friday on its website that the rear axle horizontal mounting bolt can fracture and cause the drive shaft to disconnect, increasing the risk of a crash.
Dealers will replace a bushing and the rear axle bolt. They also will inspect the rear axle cover for damage near the bolt hole and replace the cover if damage is found. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When my family was enlisted nearly 60 years ago, little did we suspect that the pastry would become a pop-culture phenomenon and inspire a Seinfeld movie.
Almost every family has a secret they never discuss. Ours is this: We were taste testers for Pop-Tarts.
It was not long after Kellogg's introduced the toaster pastry in 1964. But for several months one year (none of us can pinpoint the exact date), brown cardboard boxes arrived on our doorstep with an assortment of Pop-Tarts tucked inside. Strawberry. Raspberry. Brown-Sugar Cinnamon. We ate them all. After dinner. Sometimes hot, usually cold. With frosting and without.
Neither I nor any of my seven siblings can recall how we came to be Pop-Tart critics, and my parents aren't alive to tell us. But I have a theory: My mother was resourceful and, with eight children to feed, she probably saw an appeal for tasters somewhere and thought: "Oh, boy. Free dessert."
Whatever the reason, we were witnesses to food history. Today, as Kellogg's prepares to celebrate the 60th birthday of Pop-Tarts next year, they remain a cultural touchstone. Last year, more than two billion were sold, according to the company. They've been depicted on art murals, exhibited in museums and parodied on "Saturday Night Live."
And like Barbie, they even have their own movie: Next year, Jerry Seinfeld plans to release "Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story," a farcical chronicle of the race to win the breakfast-pastry wars, which Post began with its own toaster pastry, Country Squares, six months before Kellogg's introduced Pop-Tarts.
Mr. Seinfeld, who directs and stars in the Netflix film, based his script on a joke in his stand-up routine, and invited a baker's dozen of his friends to join him onscreen, including Amy Schumer, Melissa McCarthy and Hugh Grant.
In an interview, he recalled a boyhood trip with his mother to the supermarket, where, upon seeing a box of Pop-Tarts, "I just grabbed it."
They were a revelation for a kid who ate dry toast. "They seemed very futuristic," Mr. Seinfeld said.
Even the name -- Kellogg's considered calling them "fruit scones" -- was changed to reflect the sensibilities of the '60s, when Pop Art was ascendant. And they transformed the lowly toaster into more than just an appliance for browning bread.
To me and my siblings, Pop-Tarts were exotic. We were raised in a small agricultural community in the shadow of California's Santa Cruz Mountains and got most of our food from the farms and dairies that dotted the outskirts of town. Processed food was rare in our house, and store-bought sweets rarer still, as it was cheaper to bake dozens of homemade cookies on a Sunday to be divvied up during the week.
The Pop-Tarts were delivered to our door in a cardboard box about the size of a footstool, with nothing on the outside to indicate flavor, frosting or even that it was from Kellogg's. The individual packages inside were marked with only a number.
I was barely in kindergarten, as I recall. But I was captivated, like one of the hominids in "2001: A Space Odyssey" -- only, instead of staring at a black alien monolith, I was transfixed by a cardboard box. (In his 2020 Netflix special, Mr. Seinfeld echoed a similar sentiment about seeing Pop-Tarts for the first time: "We were just chimps in the dirt playing with sticks.")
When our family food experiment began, Pop-Tarts were already in stores, but we got unreleased flavors our neighbors and classmates couldn't buy. And that made us special.
One sister recalls that our father locked the Pop-Tarts in the basement for safekeeping. This makes sense. Food left unattended in a big family tends to disappear quickly, and my parents guarded the Pop-Tarts the way Harry Winston watches over its diamonds on Oscar night.
We didn't eat Pop-Tarts for breakfast; our mother continued to serve the oatmeal that, if it sat too long, congealed into beige goo. And if you ate one too quickly out of the toaster, you were likely to burn your tongue.
On tasting nights, we would gather around the kitchen table after dinner. Then my father would appear with the box of Pop-Tarts and place it gently on the counter with the same care he laid baby Jesus in the crèche on Christmas Eve. My mother would tear open the bags and dole out one Pop-Tart apiece. She did not toast them (which is kind of the point, isn't it?), and the flavor was kept secret until the big reveal.
Some of us sniffed and nibbled. Others took sizable bites. My mother would sometimes ask us questions. But mostly, we remember filling out forms and grading the Pop-Tarts for taste and texture. Then the box, and the filled-out forms, would be whisked away and the leftovers rationed until another box arrived with new flavors and frostings to try.
We were good students and took our job seriously, considering our appraisals with the same thoughtfulness as a "Top Chef" judge. In our minds, at least, this was important work. I may be exaggerating here, but if you like Frosted Strawberry or Frosted Brown Sugar Cinnamon -- two of Kellogg's best-selling flavors -- you may have our family to thank.
But as revolutionary as Pop-Tarts were, few of us remember being wowed. Our great-grandmother, who had emigrated from Czechoslovakia, regularly turned out trays of homemade apricot kolache and fresh apple strudel. Pop-Tarts paled in comparison.
"I did not like them," said my sister Mary. They didn't appeal either to my sister Gondie, but gave her bargaining power on the school playground. "You could eat one Pop-Tart and trade the other for a candy bar," she said of the two-pack. For my part, I would eat them only if my mother cut the edges off, leaving a ravioli-size square of frosted raspberry jam.
Maybe it's not surprising that none of us eat them now. "But it was a great memory," said my brother Michael.
I called Kellogg's, which on Oct. 2 split off Pop-Tarts and other brands into a new company called Kellanova, to see if it had a record in its archives of my family, or others like ours. A spokeswoman said the company did not keep historical data. I scoured websites that referenced Pop-Tarts and the 1960s, and read the account of a man (whom I couldn't locate) who said he had worked with Kellogg's to develop the Pop-Tart and brought them home to his children.
This made me wonder: Would our experience be an anachronism today, in a digital world where everyone seems to be an online food connoisseur?
Now, there are Pop-Tart reviews by the Food Network, blind taste tests on YouTube, communities that rate them on Reddit, online rankings and taste challenges for children. Joey Chestnut, the perennial winner of Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, ate 100 Pop-Tarts in about 30 minutes a few years ago. (His favorite flavor was S'Mores.)
I asked Mr. Seinfeld why he thought people would be interested in a comedy about the dawn of Pop-Tarts.
"Ninety-five percent of it is complete insanity," he said of the movie. But he noted that the Pop-Tart holds great nostalgic appeal. "It was a great graphic, and a great name and a great product."
Indeed Mr. Seinfeld said he still liked to eat two Brown Sugar Cinnamon Pop-Tarts with a glass of milk.
"There is nothing better," he said.

Hollywood Writers Ratify New Contract With Studios: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The vote, which followed the end of the strike on Sept. 27, officially brought to a close a bitter, five-month labor dispute. The actors remain on strike.
Hollywood film and TV writers voted overwhelmingly to approve a new three-year contract with the major entertainment studios, the Writers Guild of America said on Monday, formally bringing to a close a bitter five-month labor dispute.
During the one-week voting period, more than 8,500 writers submitted ballots, and the contract was ratified with 99 percent of the vote, according to the Writers Guild, which represents more than 11,000 screenwriters.
"Together we were able to accomplish what many said was impossible only six months ago," said Meredith Stiehm, the president of the Writers Guild's western branch, in an email to members.
The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the major studios, congratulated the union in a statement, adding, "It is important progress for our industry that writers are back to work."
Ratification had widely been expected and the practical effects from the vote will be fairly minimal. Writers Guild board members had already unanimously voted to approve the agreement and the 148-day screenwriter strike -- one of the longest in the union's history -- ended on Sept. 27.
Picketing was quickly suspended, and writers have returned to work. Productions that do not need the services of striking actors -- most notably talk shows, including "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" and "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" -- have already started airing new episodes. Productions of scripted movies and TV shows remain paused.
During the screenwriter voting period, all attention in the entertainment industry has been focused on the negotiations between studios and SAG-AFTRA, the union representing tens of thousands of striking actors. The two sides began bargaining on Oct. 2, and were scheduled for another session on Monday. The meetings are the first formal sit-downs between the sides since the actors went on strike on July 14.
Like their counterparts in the screenwriters guild, leaders of the actors' union have called this moment "existential." They are seeking wage increases, as well as protections around the use of artificial intelligence. The last time the two unions were on strike at the same time was 63 years ago.
The strikes brought Hollywood to a standstill and the financial fallout has been significant. Beyond the writers and the actors, more than 100,000 behind-the-scenes workers were out of a job for months. The California economy has lost an estimated $ 5 billion. The stock prices of the major studios have dropped. With movie releases being delayed until 2024, the box office has taken a hit.
There is widespread optimism in the entertainment industry that a deal between the actors and the studios could be reached soon. Once the actors' strike is resolved, thousands of entertainment workers -- including drivers, makeup artists, florists and set builders -- will be able to return to work.
Top entertainment executives -- including the Walt Disney Company chief executive, Robert A. Iger; a Netflix co-chief executive, Ted Sarandos; the Warner Bros. Discovery chief executive, David Zaslav; and the NBCUniversal Studio Group chairman, Donna Langley -- have participated in the bargaining sessions with SAG-AFTRA, much like they did in the final rounds of negotiations with the writers.
Since the Writers Guild reached a tentative agreement with the studios on Sept. 24, there was little doubt that it would be approved by rank-and-file members. Recent informational membership meetings to discuss the prospective contract had turned into impromptu celebrations, featuring lengthy standing ovations for the union officials who negotiated the new contract.
The ratification results exceeded the margin the last time the writers were on strike. In 2008, 93.6 percent of 4,060 screenwriters voted to ratify that contract.

Georgia Town Where 'Stranger Things' Is Shot Longs for Production: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The impact of the writers' and actors' strikes has rippled far from Hollywood, including to the town where "Stranger Things" is partially filmed.
Before a hole could pierce open a parallel dimension, unleashing murderous creatures like a Demogorgon into the placid existence of Hawkins, Ind., there needed to be another invasion.
Hawkins, the fictional home of "Stranger Things," had to take over the small town in Georgia where the hit Netflix show has been set since it debuted in 2016.
The old county courthouse in the center of Jackson, Ga., was turned into the Hawkins Library. An empty storefront became Melvald's General Store. On the other side of the town square, a marquee was added to the front of a restaurant, transforming it into Hawkins's movie theater.
But lately, Jackson has just been Jackson. "Stranger Things" retreated, along with most of the other movies and television shows filmed in Georgia, as the writers' strike that began in May and the actors' strike that followed in July reached far beyond Hollywood. The writers reached a tentative deal with studios in late September, and a ratification vote is underway. But actors are still negotiating with entertainment companies, keeping most TV and film production shut down.
As some of the nation's most generous film tax credits have nudged movie and television studios to invest heavily in Georgia over the last 15 years, a number of cities and towns have tried to get a piece of the business. But the state's embrace of the film industry has sometimes awkwardly collided with the conservative politics of its Republican leaders, who generally believe that resisting organized labor is a key to a welcoming business climate.
The economic pain inflicted by the work stoppages has prompted some elected officials, including the state's labor commissioner, to reconsider Georgia's relationship with the entertainment industry and the incentives that lured it in.
"I think those on strike better think long and hard about whether they think Georgia is a place where those incentives should stay in place," the commissioner, Bruce Thompson, said in an interview before the Writers Guild of America reached its tentative deal.
But in places like Butts County, home to Jackson, some local officials have been more loath to criticize the strikes.
Michael Brewer, whose job as deputy county manager includes serving as a liaison to the film and television industry, acknowledged the disruption, particularly for consumers. "But I'm also trying to see it from the industry point of view," he said.
"With inflation, with cost changes, the value of a dollar they made is not the same that it was," Mr. Brewer added. "A lot of things have changed over the last few years. They have to make sure their rights are protected."
The climate in Georgia, including its status as a right-to-work state where workers cannot be required to join a union as a condition of employment, has made organizing a challenge and left the writers and actors guilds with a limited footprint. The Writers Guild, which represents more than 11,000 screenwriters, has only a few dozen members in the state.
But many nonunion workers in Georgia's film industry have expressed solidarity with their striking peers, whose concerns included decreased pay in the streaming era and the threat posed by artificial intelligence, even as they have struggled to make ends meet in recent months. The state typically has dozens of movies and television shows in production, but in recent months, filming has been limited mostly to reality series, like "Hoarders" and "Love & Hip-Hop Atlanta."
"It's kind of hard not to be salty about it, but I understand -- the strikes needed to happen," said Liz Bowman, who was a special effects artist for "Stranger Things" before the strikes began and has since been giving tours of locations from the show in Jackson. "I love the film industry, but I feel like sometimes you get these big studios and they forget that they have real people working for them."
The strikes have meant fewer tourists, who prefer to come to Jackson when "Stranger Things" is filming, hoping to see or possibly interact with actors from the show. The infusion of money that comes with production has dried up, taking away the corresponding boost for local businesses or the pay for shutting down stores or using homes for filming.
Jackson took advantage of its farmland and small-town appearance, interstate access and proximity to Atlanta to turn itself into something of a filming destination for movies and television shows. Lake Jackson became a popular location, as did Bucksnort Road, a long, lonely strip of pavement between sprawling fields.
Some in town have capitalized on the "Stranger Things" ties. An escape room attraction opened with the show as its theme. Bradley's Olde Tavern -- the stand-in for the Hawkins movie theater -- has special drinks, like Demogorgon Blood (vodka, Dr Pepper, orange soda and grenadine).
The association with one of the hottest shows on television has not been to every resident's liking; some preferred the relative obscurity of Jackson before "Stranger Things." The show's supernatural themes and monsters have not been entirely warmly received in an overwhelmingly Christian community. When the old courthouse was still active, judges did not appreciate the commotion caused by productions and would dispatch the sheriff to quiet them down.
More broadly, there have been clashes between Georgia's conservative politics and a largely left-leaning industry. In 2019, actors and directors threatened boycotts after state lawmakers approved a bill severely restricting abortion access. And conservative leaders have said the industry is partly to blame for Georgia, once reliably Republican, becoming a swing state where Joseph R. Biden Jr. became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win since 1992.
But in Jackson, there has also been a recognition that the industry has injected vitality into a town that had been languishing. The spot where Hannah Thompson opened Hawkins Headquarters, a store on the town square with a "Stranger Things" theme, had been vacant for seven years.
"It's like a little bit of life has been breathed back in because of 'Stranger Things,"' she said.
Even with the turbulence, Ms. Bowman, 29, has felt somewhat lucky, relishing the opportunity to connect with fans of the show from as far away as the Philippines who stop in Jackson for the tour (pizza and snacks included).
"I know a lot of stunt people that are working for GameStop right now because they can't get jobs," she said. "I know a lot of camera people who straight up went to go work for Best Buy."
With the writers' strike over, there have been encouraging signs. Mr. Brewer said he had gotten inquiries from location scouts after months of silence. Ticket sales for the "Stranger Things" tour have surged, Ms. Thompson said.
They hope that "Stranger Things" will come back sooner rather than later, as the series is planning its final season. Filming was supposed to start in May, right around when the writers' strike got underway.
Sylvia Redic, Jackson's city manager, keeps hearing the same question: "When is Season 5?" she said. "And that's directly affected by the strike."

They hope that “Stranger Things” will come back sooner rather than later, as the series is planning its final season. Filming was supposed to start in May, right around when the writers strike got underway.
Sylvia Redic, Jackson’s city manager, keeps hearing the same question: “When is Season Five?” she said. “And that’s directly affected by the strike.”

Travis, Don't Fumble Taylor!: [Op-Ed]

Full text: The blond glamour girl and the sports superstar were doomed from the start.
The galaxy exploded when Marilyn Monroe, sex goddess, and Joe DiMaggio, Joltin' Joe, married at City Hall in San Francisco on Jan. 14, 1954. Sequins at bat.
I have a black-and-white shot of the two kissing at the ceremony -- Marilyn in that sweet black sweater with a white fur collar. I got it because it's a journalistic artifact: The New York Times photo editor who chose the picture got demoted because Marilyn's mouth was slightly open and the publisher considered it a breach of taste.
During their honeymoon in Japan, Monroe took a side trip to entertain the troops in Korea. The reception she got, singing "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" in a glittery dress on a freezing day, was rapturous.
"It was so wonderful, Joe," she told her new husband when she returned. "You never heard such cheering!"
"Yes, I have," he replied churlishly.
And that was the end of that. DiMaggio married the luminous star and tried to snuff out her light. He got furious when she filmed the famous scene for Billy Wilder's "The Seven Year Itch," standing over a Gotham subway grate as her white pleated halter dress went up in a pouf. The self-regarding sportsman didn't like the competition, so he tried to turn the most scintillating sex symbol in the world into a hausfrau cooking his spaghetti.
I'd like to think things have changed in seven decades, that men are thrilled to be in romances with high-powered women, try to be supportive and are happy to share the spotlight with magnetic partners, with nary a worry that they'll be eclipsed by these wonder women.
But Chloe Domont's sizzling erotic drama, "Fair Play," which debuted Friday on Netflix, posits that competition between the genders is still a dicey issue.
Emily, played by Phoebe Dynevor, and Luke, played by Alden Ehrenreich, both work at a financial firm as analysts. They are in love and get secretly engaged. But when she is promoted to portfolio manager, a spot that Nepo Baby Luke assumed would be his, their relationship tanks.
A brooding Luke can't or won't have sex and accuses Emily of leapfrogging over him because she's "hot" and must be sleeping with the boss -- even though she clearly has superior financial instincts. He rattles her confidence by telling her that she dresses "like a cupcake," referring to a small ruffle on her high-necked white blouse. Passion curdles into violence.
The movie revived my old feeling that, while the aroma of male power is an aphrodisiac for women, the perfume of female power can be a turnoff for men.
Have men evolved on the issue of equality more slowly? Even very successful men have confessed to me that they feel intimidated by powerful women, preferring mates who are more malleable and more awed by them.
And so, I worry for Taylor Swift.
Her romance with Travis Kelce, the charming Kansas City Chiefs tight end, has mesmerized the country in a Mars-Venus moment. The macho N.F.L. is thrilled that Taylor's joyous appearances at games are luring more of her perfervid female fan base to watch football. (I admit, I tuned in to the Chiefs-Jets game to see the colliding constellations of "Swelce.")
Swift seems to be in a win-win situation with Travis. Either she gets a boyfriend or another revenge song. ("There is nothing I do better than revenge," she sings.)
And certainly, it's a windfall for Travis in terms of soaring jersey sales, podcast audience and demand for appearances and ads.
But capitalism aside, will their crush get crushed by an avalanche of attention?
Even Travis's brother, Jason, the All-Pro center for the Philadelphia Eagles, brought up the issue of Taylor as distraction. Were she and her squad -- Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and Sophie Turner -- deflecting the spotlight? Sequins on the gridiron.
After the singer's appearance at MetLife Stadium last Sunday night, Jason asked Travis, "Take away your feelings for Taylor. What is your honest opinion on how the N.F.L. is treating celebrities at the games?"
Travis said it was exciting to show who was at the game but conceded, "They're overdoing it a little bit, for sure, especially my situation."
The brothers are good sports. On a recent episode of their podcast, they called a segment the "Swiftie Version," answering questions like "What is a field goal?" from Swift fans who are now neophyte football fans.
Asked at a team news conference on Friday about his new paramour, Travis replied with a sexy smile, "I was on top of the world after the Super Bowl, and right now even more on top of the world, so it's fun, man."
And he doesn't have that look in his eyes that guys who hook up with megafamous divas sometimes get, as if they want to run for daylight.
Swift understands the complicated dynamics better than anyone. As she sings in "Midnight Rain," "He wanted a bride. I was making my own name."

Making Workers, and Plants, Happy: [Style Desk]

Full text: Felipe Gallegos used to work in fashion, designing store displays for Abercrombie & Fitch and Uniqlo. Now he spends his days with plants, helping them thrive in office buildings across New York City.
On a recent morning, Mr. Gallegos and eight of his fellow plant keepers from Greenery NYC, which designs plant installations and maintains them for a range of companies, were gathered outside the Etsy headquarters in Brooklyn. As they prepared to advance on the 20,000 plants growing within the nine-floor building, they might have been mistaken for an artist collective or a large alternative band.
The Greenery crew is part of a new plant crowd -- people who worked in theater, media, fashion and the arts before deciding that they would be happier taking care of monsteras and birds of paradise for a living.
Greenery's 21 plant keepers, called horticulturists, typically make their rounds during working hours. Dressed casually, they move quietly from plant to plant. Office employees may not even notice them but for the watering cans strapped to their backpacks. The tenders often stop to tap detailed notes into their phones concerning any changes in the health of the green things in their care.
Most offices require a team of three or four tenders, who spend a few hours watering, pruning and perhaps moving plants so that they receive the appropriate amount of light and shade. The Etsy workplace, at 200,000 square feet, presents a real challenge, and the crew may stay there up to 8 hours.
At Etsy, Mr. Gallegos, 38, tended to viney pothos and birds of paradise as his colleagues fanned out across the building. Then he stepped back to assess his work.
"That's something embedded in me from doing visual merchandising," he said. "Is it looking great from all angles?"
Rebecca Bullene, the founder of Greenery NYC, said her company has been flooded with applicants lately. "They say, 'I keep seeing these plant stores. I need a lifestyle shift,"' she said. That's a big change from a decade ago, she added, when she had a hard time finding workers, and most came from a landscaping background.
For the employees at Greenery NYC, whose clients include Bank of America, Google, Cartier, Netflix, The New York Times and other companies, there is also the aesthetic challenge of choosing the right plants and flowers for a given space.
Erin Eck, the director of continuing education at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, says she has noticed a rise in interest in the garden's certificate program in horticulture. Until recently, she said, the people who went to the classes were mostly retirees. Now there's a waiting list, and the students "are looking to do this as a profession," Ms. Eck said.
Lauren Clark, who has a master's degree in history from Sarah Lawrence College, spent 12 years working as a freelance historical researcher on documentary films. She felt unsatisfied with her career but deeply content when she transformed a concrete pit behind her Brooklyn apartment into a garden. So she took a job with the North Brooklyn Parks Alliance and is now one of two gardeners in charge of McGolrick Park in Greenpoint.
"When I'm walking down the street with clippers in my belt and covered in dirt, I'm aware that I don't look like a Sarah Lawrence grad," Ms. Clark said.
It may seem like a leap to go from working on documentaries to pulling weeds, but plant care has come to be regarded as a career akin to working in design or the arts. It's telling that the writers of "Beef," the Netflix show starring Ali Wong, fashioned Ms. Wong's character as the owner of an upscale plant shop, KoyoHaus.
The hipification of the plant business fits in with related movements in fashion, cuisine and design that came along around the turn of the century: High-end fashion designers drew inspiration from Carhartt and other workwear brands that had long made clothes for laborers; chefs assembled seasonal menus of simple fare at farm-to-table establishments with cracked wooden tables; and interior designers moved away from anything rococo to a refined version of Grandmother's house in the woods.
Plants were a natural candidate to be remade by the mania for rustic chic. Macramé hangers and Bzippy planters started appearing on Pinterest mood boards; tiny potted succulents decorated office desks and apartment windows. With the emergence of biophilic design, which brings natural elements to homes and offices to promote a sense of well-being, lush plant displays became essential to Silicon Valley start-ups and established companies alike.
Taylor Johnston, who runs a nursery in Rhode Island, Issima, and a women's workwear brand, Gamine, can recall the days before plants became must-have accessories and the people who took care of them received little respect.
Despite having a degree in horticultural design, Ms. Johnston had few opportunities and little social status when she started out, she said. She worked at flower farms and made ends meet in residential landscape design. "People truly called me 'the help,"' Ms. Johnston said, recalling an encounter with a snobbish homeowner.
In 2008, the fashion retailer Anthropologie started a garden and home brand, Terrain. Hilton Carter, who was then a fledgling filmmaker, remembered visiting the flagship store and cafe in Glen Mills, Pa., and being "hit over the head," as he put it, by the beauty of the tropical plants suspended like chandeliers.
He went on to become a plantfluencer on Instagram and the author of several books on plant-centered home design. He says he has noticed a change in the status of houseplants since he entered the field. "There wasn't a lot of, 'Let's treat plants like art,"' he said. "Now you'll see that."
In 2012 came the Sill, a New York store with the motto "Plants Make People Happy." Its founder, Eliza Blank, set out to not only sell chicly potted houseplants to nature-starved urbanites but to build a whole mood around plants. "It felt like this overlooked category that had all the makings of a beautiful brand," Ms. Blank said. Soon her company was installing thousands of plants in offices across the city, in luxuriant displays.
Other upscale boutiques that have sprung to life include Cactus Store, Folia Collective, Homecoming, Sprout Home, Tula House and Greenery Unlimited, the retail outlet of Greenery NYC. Many of them double as cafes. They also sell ceramics made by artists, along with the latest issue of Apartamento magazine. The sales staffs typically have the modern plant-keeper look -- jumpsuits in the style of Ilana Kohn and cotton work aprons, rounded out with Birkenstocks or beat-up sneakers.
Nick Cutsumpas adopted the name Farmer Nick after he quit his six-figure sales job at a Manhattan tech start-up to become a full-time gardener. "It was such a refreshing escape from my corporate laptop world," he said. Now he has clients in New York and Los Angeles for his business as a "plant coach," a term he invented for himself.
"I wanted to be the one digging the holes and carrying the soil up a four-story walk-up," Mr. Cutsumpas said. "Those were the things I reveled in."
Ms. Bullene, of Greenery NYC, worked for nearly a decade in book publishing before taking a job as an in-house editor at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, where she learned horticultural design and began consulting for residential and corporate clients.
Ms. Bullene said that many of Greenery's 38 employees, including the 21 horticulturists who go into office buildings around the city, have backgrounds in media, fashion and related fields.
"Most of our staff is into music and art," she said. "There's a cultural acceptance of plants as being part of design."
On a recent morning at the company's work space in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn, dozens of macho ferns were lined up on the pavement, destined for the Google building in Manhattan. Nearby, Hallie Goldberg cared for a cluster of office-bound plants, including monsteras, with leaves dappled with holes like a Swiss cheese.
Ms. Goldberg, 28, worked as a stage hand and in retail jobs after studying theater in college. On this day, she was dressed in Levi's bib overalls (the front pocket was just right for holding a pruning tool) as she used a rag doused with two parts water and one part alcohol to wipe a rust fungus from the leaves.
"I had no idea this was a career before I started here," Ms. Goldberg said. She added that she loved the work, saying, "It completely activates this side of my brain that was activated when I was doing theater."
Another employee, Elan Nguyen, 23, a graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology, was repotting tropical plants as Fleetwood Mac's "Rhiannon" filled the open workroom. Her black tank top revealed arm tattoos of a Chinese fan palm and a delicately drawn maidenhair fern. She hoisted a bag full of clay pebbles, pouring some into a ceramic pot. Then she muscled a plant out of a plastic pot and into the ceramic planter.
"I'm always moving, instead of sitting rotting away at a desk," said Ms. Nguyen, who worked briefly for a clothing brand before tending to plants. "This is like a workout."
Since plant care became a fashionable career, Ms. Bullene says, she has had to change her recruitment strategy: Instead of persuading potential candidates that it's an amazing job, she tries to scare them off by emphasizing that the work requires serious manual labor.
You may have one hour to unload 650 plants off a truck in a rainstorm, she tells prospective employees. You may have to lug a 60-pound bag of soil up 10 flights of stairs in an office building, because the freight elevator is broken.
"People have this Pollyanna view of working with plants," Ms. Bullene said. "They come to us because they think it's going to be chill." She laughed. "I don't know any job in New York City that's chill."

Full text: Our guide for what to do this month in the city, from the Village parade to screenings of horror movies and kid-friendly haunted houses.
Recently, a guy in front of me at the checkout had just two things in his shopping basket: giant bags of Twizzlers and a naughty nurse costume. My first thought was: I want to go to that party. My second was: I'm way behind on a Halloween game plan.
Not any more, now that I put together this guide to what to do in and around New York City during the year's spookiest month.
First up, Halloween night traditions. Dress to impress when the perennially popular Village Halloween Parade turns 50 this year. The free event starts at 7 p.m., rain or shine, and runs on Sixth Avenue from Canal Street to 15th Street. Across town in the East Village, Theater for the New City hosts its 47th annual Village Halloween Costume Ball. There will be a costume competition, dancing to swing and Latin bands, and the chance to show off your (required) costume or formal wear.
For Movie Maniacs
A Halloween without horror movies is like a Christmas without Hallmark movies about big-city women falling for small-town bookstore owners. New scary films in theaters now are the Agatha Christie-inspired "A Haunting in Venice"; the twisted sister tale "The Nun II"; and "Saw X," the tenth film in the franchise.
Revival options include two films about the dark side of showbiz: Hitchcock's Marlene Dietrich-led "Stage Fright" (1950), at the Metrograph Theater (Oct. 13); and "Bloodsucking Freaks" (1976), an exploitation film about a demented theater troupe, at Film Noir Cinema (Oct. 20). For a classic scary movie for kids, Film Forum presents a matinee of "Creature From the Black Lagoon" (1954) in 3-D. (Oct. 29).
For a sneak peek at what horror fans will be drooling over next, check out the Brooklyn Horror Film Festival (Oct. 12-19), at Nitehawk Cinema's Williamsburg and Prospect Park locations. The roster includes "Where the Devil Roams," a new film about killer sideshow performers from the Catskills-based horror moviemaking Adams Family; and "Satan Wants You," a documentary on "Michelle Remembers," a memoir about repressed memories that helped spark the Satanic Panic of the '80s. The glorious California-chic zombie drama "Messiah of Evil" is showing in a newly restored version to celebrate its 50th birthday.
For bingeable scares at home, new horror series include "The Fall of the House of Usher," Mike Flanagan's adaptation of the Edgar Allan Poe story (Netflix, Oct. 12), and "Goosebumps," an adaptation of R.L. Stine's horror books for teenagers (Disney+, Oct. 13). Back to scare again are new seasons of the killer doll show "Chucky" (Peacock, Oct. 4) and the anthology series "Creepshow" (Shudder, Oct. 13).
For real-life horror stories, try "John Carpenter's Suburban Screams," a new unscripted anthology about the evils that lurk behind closed doors, from the director of "Halloween" (Peacock, Oct. 13), or the docuseries "Psycho: The Lost Tapes of Ed Gein," which explores the life and crimes of the deranged serial killer who inspired "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and other horror films (now on MGM+).
For Culture Eaters
"TerrorVision," an immersive horror experience at "Horrorwood Studios" in Times Square (300 W. 43rd St.), promises 20,000 square feet of scary rooms and passageways. A cast of 140 actors will endeavor to scare your pants off with "seemingly impossible effects constantly happening all around," according to the news release. A "chicken ticket" lets you wear an amulet so monsters won't target you.
Yvie Oddly, Jaida, Plastique and other popular "RuPaul's Drag Race" alumni are among the scary-good drag queens in the "Night of the Living Drag" tour. The show makes two stops in New Jersey, including Atlantic City (Oct. 6) and Newark on Halloween night.
Horror fans have twisted senses of humor, which is why it comes as no surprise that "Saw," James Wan's sinister 2004 movie, gets the song-and-dance treatment in "SAW The Musical: The Unauthorized Parody of Saw," now at the AMT Theater (345 West 45th Street). The show's website warns guests who sit in the front and second rows not to wear stainable clothing "unless a blood splatter splash or two or three would go with your outfit."
On Oct. 13, the Highline String Quintet performs two horror-movie themed concerts as part of the Candlelight series at the Sheen Center for Thought and Culture. Among the musical selections are Bernard Herrmann's sounds-like-stabbing prelude from "Psycho" and Goblin's sounds-like-a-possessed-music-box score from "Suspiria."
All during Halloween weekend, "Nosferatu, A 3D Symphony of Horror," a digital reimagining of F.W. Murnau's 1922 vampire classic, will be livestreamed in live 3D by the company Theater in Quarantine. (Ticket buyers will get 3D glasses in the mail.)
For Little Ones (and Big Scaredy Cats)
Halloween House takes over the Oculus at 185 Greenwich Street through Nov. 1. A series of immersive rooms that include a Vampires' Lair and a Horror Movie Graveyard, it's a not-too haunted house that is appropriate for all ages and temperaments. The website promises there will be no actors or jump scares.
If there's one thing horror movies teach you, it's how to run. On Oct. 28, the Queens NYC Halloween Half, 10K and 5K all take place at Flushing Meadows Corona Park. The races start and finish at the Unisphere, near the Queens Museum of Art.
The New York Public Library offers free ways to keep kids happy before they get bitten by the trick-or-treating bug. In Manhattan, the Macomb's Bridge Library hosts a pumpkin decorating class (Oct. 20). Children four and over are invited to a Creepy Crafternoon (Oct. 30) at the Sedgwick Library in the Bronx. On Staten Island, the Mariners Harbor Library offers a class on the science of candy corn (Oct. 12), and on Halloween, teens are invited to the West New Brighton branch to watch the campy killer-doll film "M3gan" and make M3gan-inspired masks.
Throughout October in the Bronx, the New York Botanical Garden's annual Fall-O-Ween features several family-friendly events, including pumpkin decorating and a giant skeleton parade with works by the puppeteer Lucrecia Novoa. The master pumpkin carver Adam Bierton hosts workshops on select weekends.
Hungry for horror? The author Sarah Lohman is offering a series of spooky-themed online classes through the Brooklyn Brainery, including "A Culinary History of Funeral Food" (Oct. 10) and "Cult Food" (Oct. 12).
If scares aren't your thing, October is prime time for picking. Admission is free at the Queens County Farm Museum's pumpkin patch, open daily through Halloween. Demarest Farms in Hillsdale, N.J., is open for apple picking on select dates through Oct. 9; $ 8 gets you access to the orchard and a petting zoo. At Decker Farm on Staten Island, let off steam with the awesome-sounding bungee-assisted pumpkin chucking.

Pay Back With Interest: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One couple can't achieve work-life balance is in this impeccable debut feature from Chloe Domont.
"Fair Play" is a superbly malevolent erotic thriller about two ambitious financial analysts who drink too much, sleep too little and cannot afford to bring their feelings to work. The trouble is that Emily (Phoebe Dynevor) and Luke (Alden Ehrenreich) are secretly engaged -- a tension aggravated when their boss, Campbell (an intimidating Eddie Marsan), promotes her over him. "I'm so happy for you," Luke manages to croak. Emily believes him (briefly) but Chloe Domont, the writer and director of this impeccable debut feature, suspects this couple might not survive her cutting observations on money, gender and power. Domont doesn't destroy their bliss with a sledgehammer; she uses a shiv. The agony that follows is a star-making performance for Dynevor and a star-correcting one for Ehrenreich who, in playing a nepotism hire confounded by his first brush with failure, reminds audiences why we've been rooting for the actor to succeed.
Each dawn, Emily and Luke take separate routes to One Crest Capital where they pretend to be strangers. Their co-workers are jackals and our leads, while magnetic and madly in love, aren't much more evolved. "I didn't get into this to be a hero," Emily admits. The office culture is captured in one sight gag: Emily, Luke and their fellow underlings zoning out during workplace harassment training while in the background, an upper-level portfolio manager demolishes his desk with a golf club. The shot is cleverly staged -- the cinematographer Menno Mans moves his camera like a comedian building to a punchline -- and it packs a wallop of foreboding. Our lovebirds should've heeded those tips on conflict avoidance.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Otherwise, Domont attacks from the flank. Emily senses approaching threats, but they're never quite what she, or we, expect. When Campbell tricks Emily into meeting him for a 2 a.m. drink, she's relieved to find he's singled her out only to privately compliment her brains and drive. Later, at a strip club, Emily's male colleagues try to rattle her with disgusting frat house tales that couldn't even be printed in Penthouse. She's bored -- what blowhards! The real menace is in Luke's silence, in how he punishes Emily by becoming withdrawn and mulish. There's nothing she can say, or do, to make her fiancé smile, and her disastrously obnoxious attempts to relieve the pressure just make things worse.
While these high finance investors talk as though they stake millions on neutral data, "Fair Play" suggests that fortunes are actually made by placing a bet on whose opinion you trust. Domont delights in that clash, and layers the film with as many other contrasts as she can find: romance versus blood, aggression versus perception, and cruel fights that play out over a soundtrack of tender soul. As verbal wounds escalate into literal bruises, we realize Domont has tricked us to invest our own empathy in these two emotionally bankrupt young lovers who can accept volatility in the stock market -- but not in themselves. Before the knives come out, Luke tries to defend his actions. "I've been nothing but supportive!" he protests. The bleakest part is that he believes it.

Fair Play
Rated R or sexual content, sexual violence and language. Running time: 1 hour 53 minutes. Watch on Netflix.

Full text: Our TV critic recommends an international smorgasbord, with great shows from Sweden, Austria and France.
This weekend I have ... a half-hour, and I want a show with teeth.
'Love & Anarchy'
When to watch: Now, on Netflix.
This Swedish dramedy (in Swedish, with subtitles or dubbed) follows Sofie (Ida Engvoll), a married mother of two who works in the Stockholm publishing industry. To her own surprise, she kind of blows up her life when she meets Max, a young I.T. guy in the office. The two start a mischievous and then increasingly intense power-exchange game, a rich source of "what am I doing?" thrills and naughty transgressions. "Love" has a bright and exciting cynicism, and it plays to both a madcap side and a more emotional, grounded one. If you miss the office on "Younger," watch this.
... a few hours, and I want a bit of everything.
'Walking on Sunshine'
When to watch: Now, on MHz Choice.
More happens in the pilot of "Sunshine" than in full seasons of other shows. This Austrian dramedy (in German, with subtitles) kicks off with blistering workplace bickering, fragile sobriety, academic fraud, government inquests, vehicular manslaughter, the re-ignition of old conflicts, maternal body-shaming, on-camera sabotage and a quirky inheritance decision. Tilia (Proschat Madani) runs a TV weather show and is furious when she is forced to make her brother-in-law, a disgraced newscaster, her new anchor. He isn't too thrilled about it, either. If you like behind-the-scenes tales but not the smugness of many shows about shows, watch this. Ten episodes are available now, and Season 2 arrives on Oct. 31.
... a few hours, and I want something eerie.
'Les Revenants'
When to watch: Now, on Amazon (Season 1 only), AMC+ and Topic.
If you crave fog, spookiness, mystery, the undead -- but in a sexy, brooding French way -- "Les Revenants" (in French, with subtitles) is streaming again for your moody pleasure. The show is set in a small town where one day several dead people re-emerge, looking just as they did when they died and eager to return to their lives. Some of their bereft loved ones are thrilled, but others aren't quite sure how to feel; how do you respond when your undead twin reappears, and she is still a young 15, but you're now an independent 19-year-old? "Les Revenants" is gorgeous and fascinating, a show whose images and ideas make a lasting impression.

On Paris Runways, the Revenge of Maximalism: [Style Desk]

Full text: Stealth wealth? Quiet luxury? Marni, Balmain and Schiaparelli beg to differ. Rick Owens has his own ideas.
It was, perhaps, inevitable. "Succession," the compulsively watchable, moment-defining HBO series about a venal family of billionaires duking it out in the C-suite, came to an end. Rupert Murdoch, the real-life media billionaire who provided some of the inspiration for the show, has officially retired and handed his crown to his son Lachlan. The Loro Piana baseball hat that became a de facto symbol of the fortunes that exist in the shadows gave way, in Milan, to Loro Piana bucket hats. Even sun hats!
And in Paris, it seems, a whole group of designers have had quite enough of the stealth wealth movement. Maximalism is staging its revolt.
Well, this is the city that made a home for Netflix's Emily, with all her over-the-top absurdity. Where else would it happen?
"I know that everybody right now is about quiet luxury, which is obviously an important topic," Olivier Rousteing of Balmain said backstage before a show that was effectively an explosion of roses in polka dots, patent leather, latex and jewels.
"But I think what people should be about today is the strength of identity. I don't want to try to play a minimalism designer, because I'm not. I'm French. And you know, you can love Pompidou. But you can love Versailles."
The point being: There is room for both fans of the inside-outside modern museum and of the ornate palace. That life is richer for having both. Hence the exaggerated clichés of feminine wiles built into the padded hips and corsetry of his collection, the blooms.
"There is that thing in fashion where happiness is not the right word, because everybody feels like you're so superficial," Mr. Rousteing said, tossing his new long braids (maximal hair). "But what is wrong about being happy? What is wrong with wanting to spread joy?" Fair question.
"Joy" is suddenly a popular word, like a clarion call of rebellion against settling for the basics. That's not so unexpected coming from Mr. Rousteing, who has often seen himself as an underdog thanks to his age when he was appointed creative director of Balmain (he was in his 20s), race, birthright and pre-trend penchant for the 1980s.
But there was Francesco Risso, too, bringing his traveling Marni show to Paris after stops in New York and Tokyo -- and not just to Paris, but to the most Parisian fashion site of all: Karl Lagerfeld's former mansion, an 18th-century hôtel particulier in the Seventh Arrondissement in all its baroque, gilded glory, with its own private garden -- the better to showcase Mr. Risso's own gleefully bizarro version of the baroque. Because, he said, "I kept thinking about this idea of joy." Work is hard, he went on. It takes commitment. Why not make clothes that can be "a celebration, like an act of rebellion toward that feeling?" Too much restraint can be as draining as too little.
So basic crop tops and hipster jeans in muddy colors soon gave way to riots of mishmash stripes and plaids (the kind that look vintage, but then turn out to have been painstakingly pieced together, strip by strip), which in turn gave way to Marie Antoinette volumes covered in a floral storm of botanical decoupage. Some pieces even sprouted three-dimensional metal flowers made from upcycled cans, en tremblant.
In one of those weird but pointed designer mind-melds that sometimes happen, Mr. Rousteing also made some of the iridescent faux corsages at Balmain out of recycled plastic. Fun. Maximalism is often associated with heaviness (overload and all that), but this version feels light.
The Revolt of the Hand
The fabrication of the flowers is not, as it happens, a minor detail in explaining part of the appeal of the alternate muchness, or the return to muchness, or whatever you want to call it.
They represented, said Mr. Risso, "the most intricate celebration of the hand, the ecstasy of the hand" (each cotton flower in his decoupage work had to be cut out and waxed and then applied to a dress; when asked how many they had made, all he could come up with was "an insane number").
In a time of anxiety over artificial intelligence, that craftiness is key; it emphasizes the humanity and kookiness of creation. The weird, intuitive leaps and dreams that currently distinguish, or at least we hope distinguish, the man-made from the machine.
That's what Julien Dossena was talking about, anyway, before his Rabanne show, which took as its inspiration Jean Clemmer's 1960s photographs for the house of nude women draped in jeweled loin cloths -- like Spartan warriors (if Spartan warriors were women), Mr. Dossena said. Or in this case, not-so-Spartan warriors, since the contemporary versions were dripping in chain mail, peacock feathers and an abundant desert-goddess fringe. "It's good to remember there are people behind the clothes," Mr. Dossena said.
There's a fine balance to, as Daniel Roseberry said before his Schiaparelli show, "dressing with abandon, but still control."
To imagine, in his case, that what a slithery little black dress really needs for that final bit of oomph is a very large gold-painted ceramic lobster at the neck, or that the way to undercut the stuffiness of a tailored jacket is to spill a handbag's worth of faux stuff -- cigarettes (this is France), lipsticks, change -- permanently down one side, just to remind everyone of the glory that can be found in mess.
Or, for that matter, that the best way to finish off a pair of white high-tops is with some gilded trompe l'oeil toes on the toe cap. Which, it turns out, really is the best way.
The Rise of Monumentalism
Though there is also another way that isn't just a rejection of minimalism or full-throated return maximalism. Call it monumentalism, or minimalism taken to maximum volume -- simple lines, mega effects -- and then consider Rick Owens. Even he was spouting off about the value of positivity this season.
"I was just thinking that is such a good thing," Mr. Owens said backstage (talking about how he had been to a Björk concert and how impressed he was by her optimism). "I'm conscious that maybe I need to contribute more than doom," he went on, referring to his own reputation as the prince of fashion darkness. "Romancing doom is a classic thing, but maybe that's not the most responsible thing I could do."
To that end, instead of belching cloud of gray fog, his mist machines belched ... pink and yellow ("positivity" being a relative thing). Diana Ross's "I still believe in love" played on the soundtrack, over and over. And rose petals rained down from the sky to blanket the runway on which minced Mr. Owens' trademark otherworldly creatures, their silhouettes attenuated to an extreme degree by fluted leather and denim skirts intricately seamed around the body, and high-waist trousers that brushed the floor over towering platforms and were paired with cropped motorcycle jackets, peaked shoulders reaching for the heavens.
Leather dresses were crushed around the body like little mountains of meringue (Mr. Owens can drape leather like Madame Grès draped jersey); oversize jumpsuits came complete with silk capes, like deflated parachutes trailing behind. And Mr. Owens's "donuts" -- gigantic circular tubes that resemble a multipurpose stole, or a boa constrictor swallowing the body, depending on your point of view -- were crafted from stacks of silk organza.
"Or orgasm-o, as they call it in the studio," Mr. Owens giggled. The idea being to make the big tubes look like "candy confections, like spun-sugar doughnuts, in the most satisfying crushable way. No one's gonna be able to buy them because they're so labor intensive," he said. "They're wonderful, and they're expensive."
You might even say excessively delicious. Even if they are an acquired taste.

Full text: The impish persona and insouciant attitude of the Formula 1 driver Yuki Tsunoda have overturned stereotypes. The next step? Showing he can keep up with rivals.
The pressure was on Yuki Tsunoda. Within days, he would compete in a Formula 1 race in his home country, Japan. Bad luck had forced him out of two previous races minutes before the start, and speculation was rife that he might be demoted after some disappointing performances.
Yet at a fan event in central Tokyo last week, Mr. Tsunoda appeared jovial as he shared the stage with several rivals. When a moderator asked him to teach his fellow drivers a few words of the local language, Mr. Tsunoda took the microphone and chirped, "We are all slower than Yuki" in Japanese, drawing a laugh from the hundreds of fans hoisting their cellphones for photos.
It was in keeping with an impish persona, and, atypically for a top-level Japanese athlete, a foul mouth and devil-may-care attitude that has inspired a cult following and an international appeal that outstrip his accomplishments so far in F1.
When he made his debut in 2021, he was the youngest driver on the F1 grid and, as it happens, the shortest (he still is, at a reported 5 feet 3 inches). With his baby face, Mr. Tsunoda, 23, quickly gained an incongruous reputation for cursing volubly on the radio that drivers use to give feedback to engineers and mechanics -- audio traffic that is also broadcast to fans during races.
Clips of him shouting "Shut up!" and other less printable outbursts went viral on social media, and his colorful reference to a "traffic paradise" that angered him on the track became a meme among fans.
In the wildly popular Netflix series "Formula 1: Drive to Survive," Mr. Tsunoda was shown farting, being lackadaisical about strength training and announcing "I want to go first poo" before a massage.
In his first year, some fans questioned whether he had earned the right to act that way. "People would think, 'Why is he shouting a lot in the radio even if he is not performing really well?"' Mr. Tsunoda said during an interview over Zoom a few weeks before the Japanese Grand Prix.
But just as Hideo Nomo, one of the earliest Japanese players in Major League Baseball, upended stereotypes about Asian masculinity, Mr. Tsunoda may help topple other racial clichés.
While Asians are often characterized as disciplined and obedient, Mr. Tsunoda's behavior shows that they "are allowed to have this full range of emotions and dispositions, even if what you're saying has to be bleeped out," said Christina Chin, associate professor of sociology at California State University, Fullerton.
Mr. Tsunoda's global exposure has coincided with a resurgence of Formula 1 racing in Japan, which last boomed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the European-dominated sport, Mr. Tsunoda is the first Japanese driver to race in the elite circuit since Kamui Kobayashi left in 2014.
Last weekend, 220,000 fans attended the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka over three days of practice, qualifying and racing, the highest number since 2006. Fans in T-shirts bearing the logos of teams like Red Bull, Mercedes and Ferrari jockeyed with "Yuki Go Go" banners in the stands.
Even Mr. Tsunoda's former English tutor, Junko Tasaki, 51, showed up wearing a T-shirt imprinted with a maple leaf design from Mr. Tsunoda's AlphaTauri team helmet and carrying a large cardboard cutout of the driver's face.
"I had no interest in F1 before I met him," Ms. Tasaki said. For the record, she added, "I didn't teach him to say 'shut up' or the F-word."
Just before climbing into his car on race day, Mr. Tsunoda consulted with several engineers and paused for a last-minute selfie with Yusaku Maezawa, the Japanese billionaire fashion retail entrepreneur. The day turned somber for Mr. Tsunoda when he finished 12th, outside the sacred top 10 where team points are scored. His best finish in any of the 16 races this season so far was 10th place.
One spot in front of him on Sunday was Liam Lawson, the younger backup driver rumored to be in contention to replace Mr. Tsunoda next year. But going into the race weekend, AlphaTauri and Honda, the Japanese carmaker that supplies engines and financial backing for the team, announced that Mr. Tsunoda would continue to drive for them next year.
Speaking to Japanese reporters after the race, Mr. Tsunoda rubbed his fist in his right eye socket and lamented not placing higher in front of local supporters.
Mr. Tsunoda's rise to Formula 1 started in the pits of go-kart racing near his home in Sagamihara, a suburb outside Tokyo, when he was 4. At age 5, he won the Japanese series championship for his age group.
"I didn't think of it as raising him to be a driver, as much as having fun together," Nobuaki Tsunoda, 60, Mr. Tsunoda's father, said during an interview in a garage office crammed with custom-built bicycles, a vintage Honda S2000 sports car and a row of his son's helmets. "I always said if you want to stop, you can stop."
Moving up to single-seater racing was more than his family could afford. His father, who had business connections with Honda, suggested he try out for the carmaker's racing school, which accepted him.
By 2018 -- the year Honda started building engines for Red Bull, the parent team of AlphaTauri -- Mr. Tsunoda had won the championship of a lower circuit, Formula 4.
Honda's backing has been crucial for Mr. Tsunoda. "F1 takes a lot of money," said Masahiro Owari, a Japanese sportswriter. "I think a lot of the reason he is on the team is because of Honda's support."
When Mr. Tsunoda was promoted to F1, he first moved to Milton Keynes, England, racing for AlphaTauri. Before his second F1 race in 2021, he crashed during a qualifying session, and his driving deteriorated over subsequent races. Since then, the team hired him a psychologist, he toned down the swearing and his driving improved.
He said he didn't consider therapy a punishment. "I take it like they wanted to support me as much as possible to be a better driver," he said.
AlphaTauri did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Beyond racing, Mr. Tsunoda said he wants to open a restaurant after winning a world championship. He didn't enjoy the food in Milton Keynes, he said, but since traveling more and moving to Italy, where AlphaTauri is based, he has eaten more palate-pleasing meals. He envisions a fusion menu with items like Wagyu beef tacos.
The first time his parents visited him at his home in Faenza, his mother, Minako Tsunoda, hoped to eat a meal in an Italian restaurant. Instead, she said, Mr. Tsunoda asked her to fix him ozoni, soup with sticky rice cakes, and sekihan, rice with red beans.
"I was not really a foodie guy" in Japan, he said. "Probably because I didn't recognize how good Japanese food is compared to other cuisine."

SUZUKA, Japan — The pressure was on Yuki Tsunoda. Within days, he would compete in a Formula One race in his home country, Japan. Bad luck had forced him out of two previous races minutes before the start, and speculation was rife that he might be demoted after some disappointing performances.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A one-woman show that used her date with a white hipster to talk about life, race, love and sex, led an editor to sign her to write two novels.
Echo Brown, a late blooming storyteller who mined her life to create a one-woman show about Black female identity and two autobiographical young adult novels in which she used magical realism to help convey her reality, died on Sept. 16 in Cleveland. She was 39.
Her death, at a hospital, was confirmed by her friend Cathy Mao, who said the cause had not yet been determined. But Ms. Brown was diagnosed with lupus in about 2015, leading eventually to kidney failure, Ms. Mao said by phone. A live kidney donor had been cleared for a transplant, which was expected to take place early next year.
Ms. Brown, who grew up in poverty in Cleveland and graduated from Dartmouth College, had no professional stage experience when her serio-comic show, "Black Virgins Are Not for Hipsters," made its debut in 2015. It told her autobiographical story, through multiple voices, about dating a white hipster, including wondering what his reaction to her dark skin would be, and the sex, love, depression and childhood trauma she experienced.
"It's very revealing, and I felt very vulnerable doing it," she told The Oakland Tribune in 2015, adding, "It's as if you get onstage and share your deepest, darkest secrets. Putting my sexuality out there in front of people can make me feel very exposed."
The show was successfully staged in theaters in the Bay Area; she also performed it in Chicago, Cleveland, Dublin and Berlin.
Robert Hurwitt, the theater critic for The San Francisco Chronicle, called Ms. Brown "an instantly attractive and engaging performer" who "has us eating out of her hand well before she gets everyone up and dancing to illustrate (with a little help from Beyoncé) why Black women shouldn't dance with white men until at least after marriage."
And the writer Alice Walker said on her blog in 2016, "What I can say is that not since early Whoopi Goldberg and early and late Anna Deavere Smith have I been so moved by a performer's narrative."
When "Black Virgins" was mentioned in a profile of Ms. Brown in the Dartmouth Alumni Magazine in 2017, Jessica Anderson, an editor at Christy Ottaviano Books, an imprint of Little, Brown Books for Young Readers, took notice.
"I reached out blindly to see if she would turn her attention to writing for a young adult audience," Ms. Anderson said in a phone interview. "She wasn't familiar with young adult or children's literature. I sent her some books, and she had an immediate sense of what her storytelling should be."
The result was "Black Girl Unlimited" (2020), a novel that Ms. Brown tells through the lens of her young self as a wizard who deals with a fire in her family's cramped apartment, her first kiss, her brother's incarceration, sexual assault and her mother's overdose.
"Brown's greatest gift is evoking intimacy," Karen Valby wrote in her review in The New York Times, "and as she delicately but firmly snatches the reader's attention, we are allowed to see this girl of multitudes and her neighborhood of contradictions in full and specific detail."
Ms. Brown's second book was "The Chosen One: A First-Generation Ivy League Odyssey" (2022), a coming-of-age story that uses supernatural elements like twisting portals on walls to depict her disorienting and stressful experiences at Dartmouth as a Black woman on a predominantly white campus.
Publishers Weekly praised Ms. Brown for the way she ruminated on her "independence, fear of failure and mental health" with "vigor alongside themes of healing, forgiveness and the human need to be and feel loved."
Echo Unique Ladadrian Brown was born on April 10, 1984, in Cleveland. She was reared by her mother, April Brown, and her stepfather, Edward Trueitt, whom she regarded as her father. Her father, Edward Littlejohn, was not in her life. During high school she lived for a while with one of her teachers.
Ms. Brown thought that Dartmouth, with its prestige and stately campus, would represent a "promised land" to her and be "the birth of my becoming," she said in a TEDx talk in 2017.
But early on she heard voices from a speeding truck shout the N-word at her.
"They weren't students, they probably weren't affiliated with Dartmouth in any way, but it was enough to shatter me," she said. The incident taught her a lesson: "There are no promised lands in this world for marginalized people, those of us who fall outside the category of normal."
She graduated in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in political science -- she was the first college graduate in her family -- and was hired as an investigator with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the independent oversight agency of the New York City Police Department. She left after two years, believing that "we didn't have the power to do the work that was necessary," she told the Dartmouth Alumni Magazine.
She worked as a legal secretary and briefly attended the Columbia Journalism School. She became depressed, started to study yoga and meditation, and moved to Oakland in 2011. While there, she was hired as a program manager at Challenge Day, a group that holds workshops at schools aimed at building bonds among teenagers.
Her job included telling students about her life, which helped her find her voice.
"I found that I could drop people into emotion and pull them out with humor," she said in the Dartmouth magazine article. "That's where I learned I was a good storyteller and wondered, 'Where can I go to tell more stories?"'
She began taking classes in solo performing with David Ford at the Marsh Theater in San Francisco. At first, she wrote comic scenes, then created more serious ones.
"It was clear that she was someone who was ready for this, and she had a very easy time getting the words off the pages as a performer," Mr. Ford said. "There was something miraculous about her."
In addition to her mother and stepfather, Ms. Brown is survived by her brother Edward. Her brother Demetrius died in 2020.
Ms. Brown's latest project was a collaboration with the actor, producer and director Tyler Perry on a novel, "A Jazzman's Blues." It is based on a 2022 Netflix film of the same name that Mr. Perry directed from a script that he wrote in 1995, about an ill-fated romance between teenagers (the young man becomes a jazz musician) in rural Georgia that takes place largely in the late 1930s and '40s. It is to be published early next year.
Ms. Anderson said the project came about because, as Ms. Brown got sicker, "it was too energy-consuming for her to work on her own material. So she was looking for a more creative partnership. and this came about through her agent."

Full text: The singer's blockbuster tour ended over the weekend without the release of a visual component. But a "Renaissance" film will be released in December, she announced on Monday.
Beyoncé's 56-show Renaissance World Tour ended over the weekend without the release of any much-anticipated visual component tied to the singer's shimmering 2022 dance album. Beyoncé, however, may have had a plan all along: "Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé" will be released in movie theaters on Dec. 1, the singer announced on Monday, immediately following the tour's final show in Kansas City, Mo.
"Be careful what you ask for, 'cause I just might comply," Beyoncé -- whose two previous solo releases, her 2013 self-titled album and "Lemonade," from 2016, were billed as "visual albums" -- wrote on Instagram, quoting the "Renaissance" song "All Up in Your Mind."
The singer has previously released concert films, documentaries and extravagant music video collections via DVD ("I Am...Yours," 2009), HBO ("Life Is but a Dream," 2013, and "Lemonade," 2016) and Netflix's streaming service ("Homecoming," 2019). But the release of the "Renaissance" film to theaters around the country follows a similar strategy deployed by Taylor Swift, who headlined the summer's other culture-dominating blockbuster tour, and whose Eras Tour concert film is due out in theaters on Oct. 13.
The two headliners are estimated to have generated more than $ 9 billion in economic activity combined, with each tour nearly matching the revenues of the Beijing Olympics in 2008, after adjusting for inflation.
The "Renaissance" film will track the tour's journey from its opening in Stockholm in May to its finale on Oct. 1. "It is about Beyoncé's intention, hard work, involvement in every aspect of the production, her creative mind and purpose to create her legacy and master her craft," according to an announcement. Tickets are on sale now.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"When I am performing, I am nothing but free," Beyoncé says in the trailer. "My goal for this tour was to create a place where everyone is free, and no one is judged." The preview also includes behind-the-scenes footage of the singer rehearsing with her daughter Blue Ivy Carter, who performed on the tour, and interacting with her husband, Jay-Z, and the couple's young twins.
Writing in The New York Times upon the tour's North American beginning, the critic Lindsay Zoladz said, "The show's look -- as projected in diamond-sharp definition onto a panoramic screen -- conjured Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' by way of the 1990 drag ball documentary 'Paris Is Burning."' The critic Wesley Morris, writing about the album, a tribute to Black and queer dance music, said of Beyoncé: "The range of her voice nears the galactic; the imagination powering it qualifies as cinema."

Full text: Wes Anderson, Pedro Almodóvar and Godfrey Reggio have films this fall that are less than an hour each.
If it's epic cinema you seek this fall, many marathons await: Martin Scorsese's sprawling Oklahoma murder ballad "Killers of the Flower Moon" (3 hours 26 minutes); Ridley Scott's lush and bloody biopic "Napoleon" (2 hours 37 minutes); the ambitious, Jennifer Lawrence-less "Hunger Games" prequel "The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes" (2 hours 37 minutes). Even "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour," that musical behemoth slinking from stadiums to screen, commands a rigorous 2 hours and 48.
Flip the telescope though, and movies are also getting very, very small. In the discombobulated midst of a strike and a festival season, stand-alone shorts -- a category generally confined to film-nerd niche or career steppingstone -- have suddenly emerged as the passion projects of several name-brand auteurs. Why well-established directors would pivot to a format not exactly famed for its commercial viability feels like something of a mystery, but the presence of enthusiastic benefactors may offer a clue: a vaunted French fashion house, a streaming giant, a Soderbergh.
The participation of Netflix provides an unusually broad platform for Wes Anderson, who has perhaps most committed to the bit; "The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar" serves as the quixotic centerpiece of his four-part collection inspired by the endlessly adaptable British novelist Roald Dahl and unrolled on the site over consecutive days in late September.
"Henry Sugar," about a wealthy wastrel (Benedict Cumberbatch) who finds his purpose in the mystical third-eye teachings of an eccentric yogi (Ben Kingsley), seems designed to fit Anderson's gifts as a jewel-box maximalist. The starry cast runs full force with his nesting-doll plots and deadpan drolleries, the color palette comes saturated in a Pantone riot of blues, pinks and egg-yolk yellows, and the tone flips nimbly from tender to absurd, more Dahl sweetness than arsenic.
At 39 minutes, "Henry Sugar" is easily the longest and most elaborate in the series, and the only one to get a limited release in theaters (with admissions priced accordingly, between $ 5 and $ 8). It's also probably the closest to a sure-thing Oscar nominee, a recognition that may or may not extend to the lovely but evanescent "Asteroid City," Anderson's winsome feature-length dip into retrofuturism from earlier this year.
Pedro Almodóvar, the resident romantic surrealist of Spanish cinema, seems to have less lofty goals for "Strange Way of Life," his featherweight dollop of fashion-cowboy whimsy presented and costumed by the venerable Parisian label Saint Laurent. (It's not the brand's first foray into film; they backed the perennial French provocateur Gaspar Noé's demented 2019 short "Lux Aeterna," which also had its premiere at Cannes.)
The plot, such as it is, rests purely on gestural melodrama, with a "Brokeback Mountain" twist: A stoic sheriff, Jake (Ethan Hawke), and his onetime fellow gunslinger and secret paramour, Silva (Pedro Pascal), are reunited after 25 years apart. The passion between them -- also telegraphed by handsome young doppelgängers in lusty flashbacks -- still burns, but it's complicated by the criminal urges of Silva's violent, petulant son (George Steane).
Almodóvar's gaze is more like a series of fun house mirrors here, passing through classic dime-store-novel narrative, the macho-man canon of midcentury Technicolor westerns and the winky camp of queering it all in circa-2023 couture. (Pascal's Kelly-green jacket, the production notes take pains to point out, is a tribute to one James Stewart wore in 1952's "Bend of the River," though its bedazzlement tilts more Ibiza disco than dusty frontier).
For all the novelty of watching two midlife male movie stars declare their love and linger in bathtubs, "Strange" feels teasingly incomplete at 30 minutes, galloping off before it's hardly begun. It seems smart, then, that it's being paired theatrically with Almodóvar's other recent English-language experiment, the more substantial 2020 short "The Human Voice," featuring Tilda Swinton as a woman undone by her departing lover (it opens Oct. 4).
The luxe artifice of those films feels several galaxies removed from Godfrey Reggio, the former monk turned avant-garde documentarian whose pointed social consciousness and wordless, kaleidoscopic catalog has made him a sort of gnomic godhead for devoted cinephiles and stoners alike. But Hollywood still finds its way to the Santa Fe octogenarian's door: Steven Soderbergh, a fan since 1983's seminal "Koyaanisqatsi," is listed as executive producer on the 52-minute "Once Within a Time," and will travel to several cities to promote it. (Reggio is also the subject of a MoMA retrospective with his longtime collaborator, Philip Glass, that runs through Oct. 4, where the new short plays daily before releasing more widely in theaters.)
Set to a clamorous Glass score, "Once" unleashes a whirling torrent of images, churned into a daguerreotype steampunk fever dream: merry-go-rounds, mushroom clouds, screaming chimpanzees in VR headsets. Mike Tyson appears as a benevolent wizard, and the climate activist Greta Thunberg as a stern bobblehead. "Is it the sunset or the dawn?" an interstitial card demands, as sand runs through a monolithic hourglass; both hope and apocalypse are heavily implied. At 83, Reggio probably knows more than most about the tyranny of time; onscreen at least, if not in life, new rules can be applied.

Negotiator Takes Stage For Actors: [Correction]

Full text: Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the lead negotiator for SAG-AFTRA, will be a key player as the guild begins talks with the studios again on Monday.
Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the executive director and chief negotiator for the actors' union, has spent the past two decades toiling behind the scenes during contract talks. The spotlight, he knows, is for the SAG-AFTRA president, usually a well-known performer like the current office holder, Fran Drescher.
But ever since the guild went on strike on July 14 for the first time in 40 years, things have been different.
In the past three months, Mr. Crabtree-Ireland, 51, has stepped out from behind the negotiating table and made fiery speeches, walked film festival red carpets and reached out to the union's younger members via Instagram reels. His more frequent appearances have given people ample opportunity to see the tattoos on his forearms, a visual clue to how much the professional and the personal are intertwined for him. On the right are five symbols -- a record, a play button, a film reel, a megaphone and a radio antenna -- representing the contracts he's negotiated for union members in the music, film/TV, radio, commercial, video and broadcast industries. On his left arm is a coil with five loops that represent the five children he has adopted with his husband, John.
"It's not just a job for me," he said in an interview. "This is where I've spent the vast majority of my professional career, and I really care about what happens to our members."
Now, however, Mr. Crabtree-Ireland is facing his most challenging public moment. Come Monday, when the union returns to the negotiating table with the studios in an attempt to resolve the strike that has much of Hollywood at a standstill, all eyes will be on him.
(Ted Sarandos, a co-chairman of Netflix; David Zaslav, the chief executive of Warner Bros. Discovery; Donna Langley, the chief content officer of NBCUniversal Studio Group; and Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, will also be in attendance, along with the chief negotiator for the studios, Carol Lombardini.)
When the Writers Guild of America agreed to a tentative deal for its 11,500 members last Sunday, that left SAG-AFTRA as the lone union holding out for a new deal. How this week's negotiations go will therefore affect not just the tens of thousands of people in Mr. Crabtree-Ireland's guild, but everyone in the entertainment industry.
The dual strikes have been devastating financially, with more than 100,000 behind-the-scenes workers like location scouts, makeup artists and lighting technicians out of work. The California economy has lost an estimated $ 5 billion. Major studios like Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global have seen their stock prices drop. Analysts have estimated that the global box office will lose as much as $ 1.6 billion in ticket sales because of movies whose releases were pushed back to next year.
"I'm 100 percent sure that he's a deal maker, a realist and that he understands the horse trade," Bryan Lourd, chief executive of Creative Artists Agency, said of Mr. Crabtree-Ireland. "He has the list of what he's got to get and what he can lose."
Mr. Crabtree-Ireland said that he was encouraged by the tentative deal reached by the writers and that he was anxious to get a deal done for the actors. But he added that he did not feel pressure because the actors were the only ones on strike. The push he feels, he said, was "because of the economic impact and the impact on our members and others."
The negotiations on Monday will be the first time that the union and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios, have talked since the actors went on strike. At the time SAG-AFTRA walked out, the dialogue between the sides had reached a boiling point.
Mr. Iger, of Disney, elicited the ire of many writers and actors by saying that those on strike were not being "realistic" in their demands. Ms. Drescher responded by saying Disney should put Mr. Iger "behind doors and never let him talk to anybody" and compared him and the other studio chiefs to "land barons of a medieval time."
Mr. Crabtree-Ireland was traditionally seen as a voice of reason by several studio executives, but at a news conference on July 13 announcing the strike, he appeared beside Ms. Drescher and spoke passionately about the studios' intentions to replace background actors with artificial intelligence technology in perpetuity.
The studios issued a statement, arguing that A.I. agreements could only be made for a specific project -- but by then, A.I. had become a rallying cry for striking actors. The actors, like the writers, have also said that the streaming era has worsened their compensation and overall working conditions.
Mr. Crabtree-Ireland played down the volatile nature of the rhetoric in the interview, and said Ms. Drescher's comments about Mr. Iger were just a response to a statement that had angered "a very wide swath of our members."
"She was elected by the members to do this job," he added. "So I feel very confident walking into a room with Fran and the rest of our negotiating team who have had extraordinary unity throughout this entire process."
The studio alliance declined to comment for this article.
While the writers' deal would seem to give the actors and studios a blueprint for their negotiations, Mr. Crabtree-Ireland pointed out that SAG-AFTRA has different asks. For instance, he noted the new level of transparency reached between writers and the streaming companies regarding residual payments was "huge." But the actors are looking to secure a revenue-sharing deal with the studios, a proposal the alliance has deemed a non-starter.
"We really feel that the companies need to share a share of the revenue that's coming from streaming," Mr. Crabtree-Ireland said. "And we are not presently considering an approach that doesn't attach in that way."
Mr. Crabtree-Ireland joined SAG-AFTRA in 2000, a Georgetown graduate with a law degree from the University of California, Davis, who spent the first two years of his career in the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.
He rose quickly at the union, first to general counsel, then adding chief operating officer to his title. In 2021, he was named national executive director and chief negotiator, a job that pays $ 989,700 annually.
Outside of the office, Mr. Crabtree-Ireland raises his children ranging in age from 4 to 18 with his husband. The two were first married in 2004, one of the first 100 same-sex couples to wed in San Francisco before the California Supreme Court annulled the unions.
While well-liked by both his colleagues and his adversaries, his performance during the strike has earned some critiques from his own membership. Despite the loyalty exhibited on the picket lines, many who have dealt with the union behind the scenes describe a messy, disorganized approach -- specifically when it comes to the rules about what its members can and can't do during the strike.
One point of contention was the issue of interim agreements, which essentially allowed actors to work on and publicize projects that were not backed by the studios the union was striking against.
The rules were fuzzy, however, and many actors were confused about what was permissible. The comedic actress Sarah Silverman blasted SAG-AFTRA on her Instagram account, and Viola Davis declined to begin production on a film granted an interim agreement. Soon, publicists began hounding the union to clarify whether actors could promote independent films without worrying that they were crossing the picket line.
On Aug. 24, less than a week before the start of the Venice and Telluride Film Festivals, Mr. Crabtree-Ireland issued a statement that read in part, "Whether it's walking a picket line, working on approved Interim Agreement productions, or maintaining employment on one of our other permissible, non-struck contracts, our members' support for their union is empowering and inspiring."
Mr. Crabtree-Ireland also talked to many actors who had concerns.
"I underestimated how quickly our members were going to need that information," Mr. Crabtree-Ireland said. "That is one of the few things that I would do differently."
It was a pragmatic response, in keeping with the reputation Mr. Crabtree-Ireland has built throughout his career. And many in the entertainment industry are hoping that same style will be a key in the negotiations that could get Hollywood back to business.
"It's tricky to navigate because he's trying to please his members and fight for their issues and a lot of them have different issues," said Lindsay Dougherty, lead organizer for Teamsters Local 399, the union that represents Hollywood workers like truck drivers, casting directors and animal trainers. "It's obviously not all on him, but I'm sure he feels the pressure."

Picking Up a Maestro's Baton: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On a late-spring day in 2018, when the New York Philharmonic was deep in rehearsals of a Strauss symphony, an unexpected visitor showed up at the stage door of David Geffen Hall, the Philharmonic's home.
The visitor, Bradley Cooper, the actor and director, had come on a mission. He was preparing to direct and star in a film about Leonard Bernstein, the eminent conductor and composer who led the Philharmonic from 1958 to 1969. He was asking the orchestra's leaders for help with the movie, "Maestro," which has its North American premiere on Monday at the New York Film Festival.
The Philharmonic is accustomed to having luminaries at its concerts. But it was unusual for someone like Cooper to express such deep interest in classical music, a field often neglected in popular culture.
"How many top Hollywood stars can be genuine or interested in that way?" said Deborah Borda, the Philharmonic's then-president and chief executive. "We were really impressed."
Soon, Cooper was a regular at the Philharmonic's concerts and rehearsals, sitting in the conductor's box in the second tier and peppering musicians with questions. He visited the orchestra's archives to examine Bernstein's scores and batons. And he joined Philharmonic staff members on a trip to Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, placing a stone on Bernstein's grave, a Jewish rite.
"You could see that he was watching with a very special eye," said Jaap van Zweden, the Philharmonic's music director. "He wanted to get into Bernstein's soul."
Cooper's time with the Philharmonic was the beginning of an intense five-year period in which he immersed himself in classical music to portray Bernstein, the most influential American maestro of the 20th century and a composer of renown, whose works include not just "West Side Story" but music for the concert hall.
He attended dozens of rehearsals and performances in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Berlin and at Tanglewood in Massachusetts. And he befriended top maestros, including van Zweden; Michael Tilson Thomas, a protégé of Bernstein who led the San Francisco Symphony; Gustavo Dudamel, who leads the Los Angeles Philharmonic; and Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the music director of the Metropolitan Opera and the Philadelphia Orchestra, who served as the film's conducting consultant.
Cooper has portrayed musicians before: He took piano, guitar and voice lessons for his role as Jackson Maine, a folksy rock star, in the 2018 film "A Star Is Born," which he also directed.
But "Maestro," in theaters on Nov. 22 and on Netflix on Dec. 20, posed a new challenge. Bernstein was a larger-than-life figure with an exuberant style at the podium. Cooper needed to learn not only to conduct, but also to captivate and seduce like a great maestro.
Cooper watched archival footage of Bernstein conducting, and Nézet-Séguin recorded dozens of videos on his phone in which he conducted in Bernstein's manner. He also sent play-by-play voice-overs of Bernstein's performances and assisted Cooper on set, sometimes guiding his conducting through an earpiece.
Nézet-Séguin said the biggest challenge for Cooper, as for many maestros, was "feeling unprotected" and "naked emotionally" on the podium. "He wouldn't settle for anything less than what he had in mind."
Cooper, who wrote "Maestro" with Josh Singer, declined to comment for this article because he belongs to the union representing striking actors, which has forbidden its members from promoting studio films. But in a discussion last year with Cate Blanchett, who played the fictional maestro Lydia Tár in "Tár" (2022), he described conducting as "the most terrifying thing I've ever experienced."
He said that people often ask: "What does a conductor even do? Aren't you just up there doing this?" He waved his arms.
"My answer is it's the absolute hardest thing you could possibly ever want to do," he said. "It is impossible."
Cooper grew up near Philadelphia surrounded by music. He played the double bass and showed an interest in conducting, inspired by portrayals of mischievous maestros in "Looney Tunes" and "Tom and Jerry" cartoons. When he was 8, he asked Santa for a baton.
"I was obsessed with conducting classical music," he told Stephen Colbert on the "Late Show" last year. "You know you put your 10,000 hours in for something you never do? I did it for conducting."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Steven Spielberg, who had been planning to direct "Maestro," was aware of Cooper's obsession. He recalled Cooper telling him that "he'd conduct whatever came out of their hi-fi system at home."
After a screening of "A Star Is Born," Spielberg was so impressed that he decided to hand "Maestro" over to Cooper, with whom he shares a love of classical music.
"It only took me 15 minutes to realize this brilliant actor is equaled only by his skills as a filmmaker," said Spielberg, who produced the film, along with Cooper and Martin Scorsese.
Cooper worked to win the trust of the Bernstein family, including his children, Jamie, Alexander and Nina, who gave the film permission to use their father's music. ("Maestro" beat out a rival Bernstein project by the actor Jake Gyllenhaal.)
Jamie Bernstein said that Cooper seemed "keen to seek an essential authenticity about the story." He asked questions about her relationship with her father, and he was adept at imitating his gestures, like placing his hand on his hip as he conducted.
Cooper visited the family home in Fairfield, Conn., admiring a Steinway piano that Bernstein used to play and examining his belongings: a bathrobe, a blue-striped djellaba, a bottle of German cough syrup that he brought back from a foreign tour.
"He was just like a sponge soaking up every detail about our family's existence that he possibly could," she said.
Cooper sent photos of himself in makeup and costumes, holding replicas of Bernstein's batons, to his children. (They defended him recently when he drew criticism for wearing a large prosthetic nose in his portrayal of Bernstein, who was Jewish.)
At the gym, Cooper sometimes wore a shirt emblazoned with the words "Hunky Brute," a nickname that Bernstein used for the New York Philharmonic's brass players. (Bernstein also wore a version of the shirt.)
Bernstein's musical career unfolds in the background in "Maestro"; much of the film focuses on his conflicted identity, including his marriage to the actress Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan) and his dalliances with men.
Cooper was eager to approach "Maestro" less as a biography and more as the story of a marriage, Spielberg recalled.
While Cooper understood Bernstein's genius, Spielberg said, he also had "an understanding of the complexities of Felicia's love for this man, whom she would certainly have to share not only with the world but also with his hungry heart."
The film, shot largely on location, recreates several moments from Bernstein's career, including his celebrated 1943 debut with the New York Philharmonic, when he filled in at the last minute for the ailing conductor Bruno Walter at Carnegie Hall.
At Tanglewood, the Boston Symphony Orchestra's summer home in the Berkshires, Cooper's Bernstein is shown leading master classes and driving a sports car with the license plate MAESTRO1 across a pristine lawn as the real Bernstein had done. He visits his mentor, the Russian conductor and composer Serge Koussevitzky, who suggests he change his surname to Burns to avoid discrimination.
In his conducting studies, Cooper spent the most time with Dudamel and Nézet-Séguin. He visited Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, dressed and made up as Bernstein, for sessions with Dudamel. And he traveled to Germany, score in hand, to observe Dudamel as he rehearsed Mahler's "Resurrection" Symphony with the Berlin Philharmonic. (Dudamel declined to comment because he is also a member of the actors' union.)
Cooper stealthily watched Nézet-Séguin from the orchestra pit at the Met, including at a 2019 performance of Debussy's "Pelléas et Mélisande." Later that year, for Bernstein's 100th birthday, Nézet-Séguin invited Cooper and Mulligan to narrate a staging of Bernstein's operetta "Candide" with the Philadelphia Orchestra.
Nézet-Séguin said he didn't set out to give Cooper conducting lessons but to refine his portrayals. "I had to take what he already did as an actor," he said, "and make it into a frame that was believable."
Nézet-Séguin, who also conducts the film's soundtrack, helped him find the downbeat for Schumann's "Manfred" overture, which opened the Carnegie program in 1943. And he assisted Cooper with dialogue for a rehearsal scene of "Candide," during which he conducts with a cigarette in his mouth.
Last fall, Cooper and Nézet-Séguin traveled to Ely Cathedral in England to recreate a 1973 performance of Mahler's "Resurrection" Symphony by Bernstein and the London Symphony Orchestra, a climactic moment in the film.
Cooper, who chose the music in "Maestro," had studied the piece intensely, watching Bernstein's performance as well as videos in which Nézet-Séguin dissected Bernstein's gestures and explained how to count beats.
"He would watch the videos," Nézet-Séguin said, "and then text me and say, 'Hey, can we talk about this or that moment?"
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Inside an empty Ely Cathedral, Nézet-Séguin, wearing a sweater that had belonged to Bernstein, coached Cooper as he rehearsed an eight-minute section of the piece with a recording.
When the London Symphony Orchestra arrived, Cooper watched as Nézet-Séguin rehearsed in the style of Bernstein, who often broke the rules of conducting with his animated gestures. Sometimes, Cooper offered suggestions, such as adding tremolo in the strings.
When Cooper took the podium, Nézet-Séguin provided occasional direction through an earpiece, advising him to hold onto a moment or let go.
The musicians of the London Symphony Orchestra were startled by Cooper's transformation. "It was uncanny," said Sarah Quinn, a violinist in the orchestra. "It was just kind of a double take."
Throughout his work on "Maestro," Cooper maintained a connection to the New York Philharmonic, soliciting stories about Bernstein. Van Zweden, who worked with Bernstein in Amsterdam in the 1980s, told him how Bernstein had broken protocol and hugged Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, calling her "darling" and taking a sip of his drink at the same time.
Cooper visited Geffen Hall last fall after its $ 550 million renovation, attending a rehearsal of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and flipping through a Mahler score that had belonged to Bernstein. He returned in February when Dudamel was introduced as the Philharmonic's next music director, embracing him and admiring a photo of Bernstein.
Over the summer, Cooper invited a few Philharmonic staff members and musicians to his Greenwich Village townhouse for screenings of "Maestro." The orchestra presented him with a gift: a replica of Bernstein's Carnegie debut program.
"From the beginning, he was intent on avoiding a broad burlesque of a personality, especially one as big as Bernstein's," said Carter Brey, the orchestra's principal cellist, who attended a screening.
Cooper has compared playing Bernstein to "channeling a supernova." He said in a recorded Zoom conversation with Jamie Bernstein last year that her father transmitted his soul through conducting.
"The pilot light never went out with him, which is incredible given everything that he saw, experienced, understood, comprehended, bore witness to, even within his own self," he said in the video. "What a person. What a spirit."

Rough Diamonds
This moody Netflix series centers on a torrid family saga, something we don't get enough of these days.
