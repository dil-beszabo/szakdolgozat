Full text: Entering your 40s can throw you into an emotional tailspin -- one that may lead you to spend more and jeopardize your nest egg.
The midlife crisis is easy to poke fun at -- especially if it's someone else's.
The stereotype, as portrayed in movies and on TV, is familiar: A middle-aged man has a meltdown upon turning 40 and ditches his wife for a younger woman and a sports car. Or maybe just the car.
In real life, though, a midlife crisis is rarely so obvious or dramatic, or the sole province of men. Milestones like a 40th or 50th birthday, or becoming an empty nester, can provoke uncertainty about your life and your future. And this uncertainty can influence the way you spend.
"Feelings drive behaviors," said Nathan Astle, a financial therapist in Kansas City, Mo. If you feel dissatisfied with your life, you might buy a new wardrobe or spend on cosmetic procedures. Or if you're seeking excitement, you might splurge on big-ticket items like travel or expensive wine.
Of course, there's no harm in the occasional treat, especially when you budget for the expense. The trouble is, a midlife crisis can hit just as retirement is becoming more real. So if you're going to treat yourself, you should also make sure your retirement savings and investments are on track, experts say.
When it comes to investing, time is more important than "timing," said Ashley Agnew, a financial therapist. In other words, saving for retirement early in life matters more than entering the market when stock prices are low and exiting when they're high.
For example, with a 6 percent return, an investment of $ 5,000 each year (for 40 years) will grow to more than $ 800,000 by the time you're 65, Ms. Agnew said. But if you invest the same amount of money for 30 years, you'll have $ 400,000.
As the runway to retirement gets shorter, there's less time to save. "Short-term thinking can have a long-term impact," Ms. Agnew said.
Marti Awad, a financial adviser in Denver, said signs that a midlife crisis might be in full swing include pulling money from your 401(k) or individual retirement account, or borrowing against your home for purchases that are wants, not needs. Running up credit card debt or hiding purchases from loved ones are also warning signals.
But because shopping often boosts mood (even temporarily), spending isn't seen as a problem -- it's mistaken for a solution, Mr. Astle said. So it's important to come up with a plan before an issue brews. To prevent a midlife crisis from throwing off your financial goals, consider these safeguards.
Beware of lifestyle creep
If you are fortunate enough to be consistently employed over the years, income usually rises with age and experience.
A 2022 survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau found that the median household income for people ages 45 to 54 was $ 101,500 per year, compared with $ 80,240 for those 25 to 34.
"Typically, people enter their highest earning years in their 40s and 50s," said Paco de Leon, author of the book "Finance for the People." With higher income, you may be able to afford more expensive restaurants, fancier vacations or a bigger home.
Buying these things, however, can unleash a phenomenon called lifestyle creep, which is when your expenses rise with your income.
"It's a slippery slope," Ms. de Leon said. For example, if you earn $ 80,000 a year and your salary increases by 3 percent, a few extra expenditures like dinners and weekend getaways -- not to mention inflation -- can quickly eat up your additional money.
Even a one-time splurge can be precarious, Ms. de Leon warned. If you buy designer shoes, for instance, you may decide that your wardrobe looks drab. Or if you order a hand-woven rug, your Ikea furniture may seem dated. This mind-set can make former luxuries seem like necessities, causing you to spend more.
To prevent lifestyle creep, try setting financial boundaries. For example, if your salary goes up, invest the extra income in your retirement account. If that's not possible, try following a general piece of financial advice, which is to put 20 percent of your raise in savings. And if you receive a yearly bonus, spend a small amount of it, and invest the rest, Ms. de Leon advised.
Trick your brain: Use a 'buy list'
A midlife crisis can unleash a "here and now" mentality about money, Ms. Agnew said. And this can make you more vulnerable to impulse spending.
To prevent this, Ms. de Leon recommends creating what she calls a buy list. Write down everything you want and imagine yourself buying the items, she said.
Like scrolling on social media or drinking alcohol, shopping provides a dopamine rush. The buy list, however, can "trick your brain" into thinking you've spent the money, she said, providing the same reward.
If two weeks pass and you still want the item, think through the downsides before you do anything. Ms. de Leon suggests answering this question: "Will this put me in a more financially fragile position?"
Just like eating too much doesn't cause weight gain immediately, spending a little extra may not hurt your bank account right away -- but it's important to calculate the long-term cost.
For example, parting with an extra $ 50 each week becomes $ 200 by the month's end. If you're a decade away from retirement and keep up that pace, you'll have spent $ 24,000 by the time you retire.
As we get older, unforeseen expenses can balloon. Health care costs may rise and caring for sick family members can come with greater financial burdens. When saving for retirement, don't forget to take these potential costs into account, Ms. de Leon said.
'Stress test' your bank account
If you're considering a major expense, like a dream vacation on a milestone birthday, Ms. Awad suggests reviewing your retirement plan first. Financial planners have software that can run a "stress test" to analyze the effect of the purchase, she said.
A stress test runs different return scenarios, revealing the inherent risk in your financial choices, Ms. Awad said. Seeing the range of potential returns can help you determine if your nest egg can weather the spend.
Find support
Financial mishaps can be embarrassing, which can prevent you from taking action. "Shame is the enemy of change," Mr. Astle said. Therefore, if you've overspent, don't be afraid to reach out for help.
For example, if stress fueled your splurge, a financial therapist could teach you healthier ways to handle your emotions. Being able to name your feelings can help you respond differently, he said.
If pulling money from your 401(k) hurt your financial health, meeting with a fee-only financial planner could help you get back on track. And if you've run up credit card debt, a professional can create a plan to help you pay it off. If you're in need of low-cost or free credit counseling or budget management, there are resources at the Financial Counseling Association of America and the National Foundation for Credit Counseling; the foundation offers free courses.
Even if your savings have taken a hit, the results of money missteps are rarely set in stone. "Taking small steps to correct your mistakes goes a long way," Mr. Astle said.

Clown Cardio Doesn't Take Exercise Too Seriously: [Style Desk]

Full text: Whenever Alex Lee mentions Clown Cardio, he is met with some confusion.
"People will say, 'What is that? People dressed like clowns chasing after you?"' Mr. Lee, a 42-year-old technical writer who lives in Los Angeles, said after a recent class. No one's wearing face paint or red noses -- nor are they necessarily chasing anyone (more on that later) -- but this hourlong session, which costs $ 20, incorporated a bicycle horn, mini circus tents from Ikea and carnival-style popcorn boxes.
Jaymie Parkkinen, who founded the class at Pieter Performance Space in Los Angeles, compiles theater games usually reserved for improv warm-ups and turns them into aerobic exercises with clown-themed props: a game similar to blob tag, wherein the tagged link arms and chase everyone; a more chaotic version of musical chairs; a circus tent version of Capture the Flag; disorderly dance competitions.
When Mr. Parkkinen wants to expand the class's repertoire, he visits Los Angeles's Central Library and peruses the performance section; recently he was inspired by exercises found in a 1920s book for vaudevillians.
In this class, attendees of all genders and ages are encouraged to let it all out. "I want to emphasize play, not winning," Mr. Parkkinen announced before Clown Dodge Ball. The disco tune "Turn the Beat Around" blasted while half the class competed to turn popcorn boxes strewed across the room upright while the other aimed to have more of them face down by the time the song ended.
"I can kind of unzip the human suit and be a gross little goblin and it's accepted because clowns are accessing their inner child," said Sarah Thompson, 29, a marketing copywriter based in North Hollywood who has attended four classes.
Los Angeles is already home to a vibrant clown community, with clown workshops and shows like Clown Church, Clown Zoo, a psychedelic clown workshop, The Idiot Workshop and a clown award show, but Clown Cardio is uniquely focused on exercise.
Clown Cardio was conceived and launched in September 2023, shortly after Mr. Parkkinen's mother was diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer. Mr. Parkkinen, who had been working part-time as a lawyer at an entertainment firm, was inspired to focus more specifically on what brought him joy, and that was the improv warm-ups, where goofiness and physicality are fully activated.
With play as the goal, laughter and sound are one of the metrics Mr. Parkkinen uses to gauge the success of each class, "It's the auditory element for me. It's hard to decipher the level of joy visually."
Can silliness enhance a workout? According to Prof. Sophie Scott, a neuroscientist who specializes in laughter at University College London, laughter doesn't burn many calories on its own. But similar to exercise, laughing causes a significant endorphin boost. Over time, laughing leads to a reduction in the stress hormone cortisol, she said.
Prof. Michelle Liu Carriger, chair of the theater department at U.C.L.A., thinks the recent popularity of clowning could be people realizing that seriousness doesn't get us where we need to go. "The things that got us through difficult pandemic times were not just washing our hands and listening to health professionals, but finding ways to detach, unwind and let off steam."
Many class goers said what they loved about Clown Cardio, which meets in three Los Angeles neighborhoods, is connecting with others. Matthew Moore, a 55-year-old actor, producer and artistic director of Improv for the People, is 6 feet 4 inches tall and is careful to not plow into who he referred to as "smaller people" during class.
Throughout the hour, participants were tender toward another, making sure no one got hurt during a heated pile up. Safety is a crucial part of maintaining the humor of the class, "It's not funny if a clown gets hit in the face with a frying pan and then doesn't get up," said Sam Sullivan, 25, a scenic carpenter living in El Sereno who took a clown class during college and now attends Clown Cardio. In fact, "that's sad."
Several students said taking the class helped them confront coulrophobia, or clown phobia. Mx. Sullivan used to be afraid of clowns but has come to the conclusion that "clowning is not so much about the face paint and scaring people, but defying failure."

Mr. Parkkinen uses the amount of laughter, center, to gauge a class's success. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY ALICIA AFSHAR FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) This article appeared in print on page ST3.

When It Comes to Meatballs, This Is How We Roll: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Maybe they should call the city "The Big Meatball."
When my teenage sons were younger, I worked a recurring theme into the meals I cooked for them. I called it the Meatball of the Month Club. The idea is just what you'd imagine. The fun of it was in tracking down meatball recipes from different cultures in cookbooks and recipe sites, and then using them as the centerpiece for meals that introduced my family to new cuisines.
Years later, I realized that I could have made things a lot easier on myself by holding Meatball of the Month Club meetings in restaurants. New York has to be one of the best cities in the world for meatball collectors.
From Albania to Shanghai to Mexico
You can head, for instance, to the Belmont section of the Bronx for qofte, the Albanian veal meatballs seasoned with onions and red peppers served at Cka Ka Qellu. (The restaurant, by the way, is endorsed by Dua Lipa.)
Or, instead, you could go to Queens to pick your favorite lion's head. Typically, a lion's head meatball is so big there's almost no room for broth in the soup bowl it's served in. My current choice is the Langzhou-inspired one at CheLi in downtown Flushing (there's also a location in the East Village), although I remember thinking that the ones at Shanghai You Garden, nearby, might be better than the soup dumplings that the place is known for.
In Long Island City, you can investigate the Mexican albondigas that the chef Cosme Aguilar stews in a smoke-drenched chipotle sauce at his restaurant, Casa Enrique. Each meatball contains a hard-cooked egg, which raises interesting philosophical questions, such as: Is a Scotch egg a meatball?
Meatballs that roll, and meatballs that don't
What about kofte? It's ground, seasoned meat like any other meatball, yet throughout the Eastern Mediterranean kofte are often molded on to a skewer. But not always: The kofte I ate the other night at Shukette, in Chelsea, were tender little orbs of lamb and beef mixed with fresh herbs, and served on an emerald-green pool of sauce made from arugula and pistachios.
In Japanese restaurants, tsukune are almost invariably molded into fat sausages and cooked on skewers. Still, everybody calls them chicken meatballs. Glazed with tare sauce and grilled, they're usually delicious, whether they're enriched by foie gras at the Lobster Club in Midtown or prepared more classically at Kono, the rarefied yakitori counter in Chinatown.
Kebab aur Sharab, an ornate Upper West Side Indian restaurant, cooks almost everything on a skewer, but not its venison meatballs. The size of large olives, the meatballs are cooked in a fiercely spicy dry curry inspired by the city of Mangalore.
On top of spaghetti
Of course, New York has countless Italian restaurants where the meatballs are made in the classic shape -- so round that, if somebody sneezes, they will roll off the table and on to the floor. The ones I like best are big and fluffy from a generous addition of bread crumbs. This is how you get them at Cafe Spaghetti in Brooklyn, Carbone in Manhattan, and (let's cross the Hudson River for one second) Razza in Jersey City, where they are roasted in a wood-burning pizza oven. The polpette I had this week at Via Carota are in the big-and-fluffy school, too, but they also contain raisins and pine-nuts, Sicilian-style.
Many more Italian meatballs are stuffed into bread at pizzerias and sandwich shops, including the excellent heroes at Parm and the sliders at Stretch Pizza. Denino's Pizzeria and Tavern in Staten Island augments their meatball heroes with pieces of sausage but lets the meatballs dominate, which is how the sandwich came to be known as the 60/40 Hero. For some reason, it's not on the menu of their branch in Greenwich Village.
New York has big meatballs and small meatballs. Spicy meatballs and mild meatballs. Expensive meatballs and cheap meatballs. For the excellent Swedish meatballs served in the Scandinavian-modern barroom at Aquavit in Midtown, you will pay $ 38. You'll also get some lovely puréed potatoes along with lingonberries and shaved, lightly pickled cucumbers. Substitute some other vegetables for the pickles and there you have the Swedish meatball plate at Ikea in Red Hook, Brooklyn. The price is $ 5.99.
And if you would like four Ikea meatballs by themselves, as a side dish? That will be 99 cents.

Fears of Gaza Famine As Suffering Deepens: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Officials of the Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen threatened to respond to American-led airstrikes over the past two days.
The twin specters of a widening regional war and intensified suffering of civilians loomed over the Middle East on Saturday, after the Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen threatened to respond to American airstrikes and a senior U.N. official warned that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza was hurtling toward famine.
An American missile strike, launched from a warship in the Red Sea, hit a radar station outside the Yemeni capital, Sana, early Saturday. The solitary strike came about 24 hours after a much wider barrage of U.S.-led strikes against nearly 30 sites in northern and western Yemen that were intended to deter Houthi attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
Houthi officials tried to brush off the latest assault, saying it would have little impact on their ability to continue those attacks. Their stated goal is to punish Israel for blocking humanitarian aid into Gaza -- though Yemeni analysts say the crisis also presents the Houthis with a welcome distraction from rising criticism at home. Two U.S. officials cautioned on Saturday that even after hitting more than 60 missile and drone targets with more than 150 precision-guided munitions, the U.S.-led airstrikes damaged or destroyed only about 20 to 30 percent of the Houthis' offensive capability, much of which is mounted on mobile platforms and can be readily moved or hidden.
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal military assessments, said that U.S. analysts have been rushing to catalog potential Houthi targets, but that doing so has proved challenging. Western intelligence agencies have not spent significant time or resources in recent years collecting data on Houthi air defenses, command hubs or munitions depots, they said.
The greater risk from the air attacks is likely borne by ordinary Yemenis, whose impoverished nation has been crushed by years of civil war, and who now face a high-stakes confrontation that imperils a fragile 20-month truce.
Some 21 million Yemenis, or two-thirds of the population, rely on aid to survive, in what the United Nations has called one of the world's worst humanitarian calamities -- a dubious distinction now shared by Gaza.
In northern Gaza, where a crippling three-month Israeli siege has hit hardest, corpses are left in the road and starving residents stop aid trucks "in search of anything they can get to survive," Martin Griffiths, the top U.N. aid official, told the United Nations Security Council on Friday. Saying that the risk of famine in Gaza was "growing by the day," he blamed Israel for repeated delays and denials of permission to humanitarian convoys bringing aid to the area.
Since Jan. 1, just three of 21 planned convoys intended for northern Gaza, carrying food, medicine and other essential supplies, have received Israeli permission to enter the area, a U.N. spokesman said on Thursday. More supplies have been distributed in southern Gaza, near the two border crossings that are open during limited hours, but aid workers say vastly more than that is needed to meaningfully help Gazan civilians.
Qatar is mediating talks over a proposal for Israel to allow more medicines into Gaza in exchange for prescription medicines being sent to Israeli hostages held by Hamas, officials have said.
Famine experts say the proportion of Gaza residents at risk of famine is greater than anywhere since a United Nations-affiliated body began measuring extreme hunger 20 years ago. Scholars say it has been generations since the world has seen food deprivation on such a scale in war.
The arrival of bitterly cold winter weather has exacerbated the struggle to survive, Mr. Griffiths said. Much of Gaza's population has jammed into overcrowded, deteriorating shelters in the south, with limited access to clean water and where aid workers warn that disease is spreading fast.
In response to questions, Israel's government on Friday denied it was obstructing aid, saying its permission was contingent on the security situation, the security of its troops and its efforts to prevent supplies from "falling into the hands" of Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza. Israel launched its assault on Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which Israeli officials say at least 1,200 people were killed and another 240 were taken back to Gaza as hostages.
Since then, Israeli attacks, often using American-supplied bombs, have killed more than 23,000 people in Gaza, according to the Gaza health authorities. At least 1.9 million people, or 85 percent of the population, have been forced from their homes, according to the U.N.
Despite growing global criticism, and calls from the Biden administration to take greater care, the pace of Israeli strikes has not relented, and has even quickened in areas where Palestinians had been ordered to flee for their own safety, Mr. Griffiths said.
One strike on Friday on a home in Rafah, near the southernmost tip of Gaza, killed 10 people including several children, Palestinian media reported. At least 700,000 Palestinians have fled to the area around Rafah, along the border with Egypt, hoping for safety. Even there it is elusive.
"There is no safe place in Gaza," Mr. Griffiths said. "Dignified human life is a near impossibility."
Large protests calling for an end to the Israeli assault on Gaza, tied to the 100th day of the war, were expected across the globe on Saturday in cities including London, Dublin, Washington, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta.
In Israel, though, the focus was on the 136 hostages believed to still be held in Gaza. Families and supporters of the people taken captive on Oct. 7 planned to hold an overnight vigil in Tel Aviv on Saturday night. Among the hostages are about a dozen people in their 70s and 80s and a 1-year-old baby. Frustrated relatives have become increasingly vocal in their criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's efforts to free them.
Like Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis have been supported, funded and armed by Iran for many years. American officials say Iran provided the intelligence used by the Houthis to target ships 28 times in the Red Sea since mid-November, causing more than 2,000 other ships to divert onto a much longer route around Africa.
The Houthi response so far to the American and British airstrikes on Friday, which were supported by Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands, has been minimal: a single missile that dropped into the Red Sea about 500 yards from a passing ship on Friday. The maritime security firm Ambrey identified the ship as a Panama-flagged tanker carrying Russian oil -- an apparent mistake, as Russia, an ally of Iran, had denounced the American-led strikes against the Houthis.
Still, the impact of the crisis on global trade is already being felt. In a Friday podcast after the Western strikes, Lloyd's List Intelligence, a shipping data company, said it was seeing an increasing number of container ships diverting to an alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope, which typically adds 10 days and about 3,300 nautical miles to the trip.
Tesla and Volvo said they would be forced to pause production at some car plants in Europe, while Ikea warned that some supplies may run low.
Many Yemen experts were skeptical that this round of U.S. strikes would force the Houthis to back down, and said the group could even be strengthened. Since 2014 the Houthis have endured heavy bombardment by Saudi warplanes armed by the United States, only to emerge as the de facto government in northern Yemen.
A confrontation with the United States strengthens the Houthis' ties to Iran, plays to popular sympathies with Palestinians and could help to quell dissent, experts say: As a shaky peace has taken root in Yemen in the past 18 months, their economic failures have become more evident, and internal opposition has grown.
"War is good for the Houthis right now," said Gregory D. Johnsen, a Yemen expert at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.
The Houthis, for their part, warned that more assaults on Red Sea shipping were coming, as well as a more forceful response to the United States.
"Washington will deeply regret its provocative practices in the Red and Arabian Seas, as will everyone who gets involved with them," Hezam al-Asad, a member of the Houthi political bureau, said in a phone interview after the latest American strike.
The only way for the United States to stop Houthi attacks on shipping, he said, was "an end to the war in Gaza."

Full text: Attacks on two dozen ships since November are forcing shipping lines to figure out whether and when to skip the Suez Canal and send vessels on longer voyages around Africa.
The shipping companies that move goods on one of the world's busiest trade routes for factories, stores, car dealerships and other businesses face an excruciating decision.
They can send their vessels through the Red Sea if they are willing to risk attacks by the Houthi militia in Yemen and to bear the cost of sharply higher insurance premiums. Or they can sail an extra 4,000 miles around Africa, adding 10 days in each direction and burning considerably more fuel.
Neither option is appealing and both raise costs -- expenses that analysts said could ultimately be borne by consumers through higher prices on the goods they buy.
"We are beginning to see the weaponization of the global supply chains," said Marco Forgione, director general of the Institute of Export and International Trade, which supports British corporate efforts to expand in overseas markets.
In recent months, global supply chains had finally recovered after three years of disruptions caused by the pandemic and even a brief blockage of the Suez Canal, which lies at the northwestern end of the Red Sea and handles some 12 percent of global trade. Freight rates had fallen steeply, and the long delays that had bedeviled retailers in the United States and Europe had been resolved.
So far, the problems in the Red Sea have not disrupted global supply chains to the same extent that the pandemic did. "But we are heading in that direction," Mr. Forgione said.
The Houthi attacks have continued even after a U.S.-led force was assembled in the Red Sea to prevent them.
Already, some companies, including Ikea and Next, the British retailer, have said that avoiding the Suez Canal and taking the long route around Africa could delay the arrival of products.
A crucial question will be how the container shipping industry handles the annual surge of exports that typically occurs before China's factories are idled for weeks at Lunar New Year, which is next month.
Difficulties vary considerably by types of vessel. Oil tankers have been little affected and are continuing to use the Red Sea, as the Houthis appear to have shown little interest in them.
By contrast, the number of specialized car-carrying ships using the Red Sea more than halved last month from December 2022, to just 42 trips, and only one has transited the sea so far this year, said Daniel Nash, head of vehicle carriers at VesselsValue, a London shipping data firm.
The first vessel attacked by Houthi gunmen in recent weeks was a car carrier, the Galaxy Leader, which was hijacked on Nov. 19 while returning to Asia for another load of several thousand cars. The 25-member crew, mainly Filipinos, was also kidnapped and still does not seem to have been released.
Longer voyages around Africa for car-carrying vessels traveling to Europe from Asia are particularly disruptive right now for the global auto industry. Chinese automakers have been rapidly increasing exports to Europe, especially of electric cars. Even before the Red Sea troubles, daily charter rates for transoceanic car carriers had skyrocketed to $ 105,000, from $ 16,000 two years ago.
The Red Sea disruption comes as the Panama Canal, which has low water levels caused by drought, has slashed the number of vessels that can pass through. That had forced many ships to choose a longer route to the United States via the Suez Canal.
Websites that track shipping still show scores of vessels in the Red Sea, which connects the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea to the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. But the largest companies have reduced their presence significantly or entirely.
MSC, the largest container shipping company, said in mid-December that it was avoiding the Red Sea. Maersk, the second biggest, temporarily halted transits of the Red Sea then, returned to the area in late December and pulled back again this week after one of its vessels, the Maersk Hangzhou, was attacked.
CMA CGM, the French shipping company, said in statement that some of its vessels had traveled through the Red Sea and that it was planning for a gradual increase of passages through the Suez Canal. "We are monitoring the situation constantly, and we stand ready to promptly reassess and adjust our plans as needed," it added.
Cosco, the Chinese giant, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Hapag-Lloyd, which has a fleet of over 250 container ships and is based in Hamburg, Germany, said the company planned to go around Africa until Jan. 9 and then assess the situation.
An analysis provided by Flexport, a logistics technology company, showed that as of Thursday, 389 container vessels, accounting for over a fifth of global container capacity, had already diverted from the Suez Canal or were in the process of doing so.
"It's about risk assessment, and protecting life and property and cargo," said Nathan Strang, director of ocean freight at Flexport. "If you can avoid a situation that is putting you at existential risk by just avoiding it, go for it."
Interruptions in transits of the Suez Canal are uncommon. But the canal closed to international shipping for eight years after the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. Its reopening was "the happiest day in my life," said Anwar el‐Sadat, Egypt's president at the time.
Some container vessels still using the Red Sea may be headed to or coming from ports there, like those in Saudi Arabia. For financial reasons, some smaller container ships are also continuing to transit the Red Sea for trips between Europe and Asia.
Ships carrying large numbers of containers can shoulder the added costs of going around Africa, but, Mr. Strang said, the longer passage could destroy the economics of vessels carrying 5,000 or fewer containers.
The quickest route to ports on the U.S. East Coast from China is through the Panama Canal. But shipping companies that avoided that canal because of the drought must now sail for even longer as they detour around the Cape of Good Hope. The Cape journey takes 10 days longer, or some 40 percent more, than traveling through the Panama Canal, Flexport calculates.
The cost of transporting a container to an East Coast port from China has soared to around $ 3,900 from $ 2,300 before the Red Sea attacks, says Zvi Schreiber, the chief executive of Freightos, a digital shipping marketplace. When the shipping logjam was at its worst during the pandemic, the cost could be over $ 20,000.
Insurance costs, usually no more than 0.2 percent of the value of a vessel per journey, jumped to 0.7 percent for ships planning to enter the Red Sea, said Mr. Forgione of the trade institute. "That's a very significant increase," he said.
Mr. Schreiber said that he expected shipping companies to be able to handle the current disruption because, after buying more ships in recent years, they had plenty of spare capacity to deal with longer travel times.
"Although the shock is big, and will probably end up being bigger," he said, "the network is coping with it."
And Christian Roeloffs, co-chief executive of Container xChange, an online container logistics platform, said in an email that the current supply chain disruptions from China appeared "relatively modest" compared with what happened when the country imposed lockdowns during the pandemic.

Conflict Looms With Iran, From Lebanon to Red Sea: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With its proxies attacking from many vantage points and its nuclear program suddenly revived, Iran is posing a new challenge to the West -- this time with Russia and China on its side.
President Biden and his top national security aides believed last summer that the chances of conflict with Iran and its proxies were well contained.
After secret talks, they had just concluded a deal that led to the release of five imprisoned Americans in return for $ 6 billion in frozen Iranian funds and some Iranian prisoners. The militants that Tehran finances and arms -- Hamas in the Palestinian territories, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen -- seemed relatively quiet. Iran even slowed enrichment of uranium at its underground nuclear sites, delaying its progress toward a weapon.
Hamas's Oct. 7 invasion of Israel and Israel's tough response have changed all that. Now American and Israeli officials, and a dozen countries working in concert to keep commerce flowing in the Red Sea, are confronting a newly aggressive Iran. After launching scores of attacks, from Lebanon to the Red Sea to Iraq, the proxy groups have come into direct conflict with U.S. forces twice in the past week, and Washington is openly threatening airstrikes if the violence does not abate.
Meanwhile, though little discussed by the Biden administration, the Iranian nuclear program has suddenly been put on steroids. International inspectors announced in late December that Iran initiated a threefold increase in its enrichment of near-bomb-grade uranium. By most rough estimates, Iran now has the fuel for at least three atomic weapons -- and American intelligence officials believe the additional enrichment needed to turn that fuel into bomb-grade material would take only a few weeks.
"We are back to square one," Nicolas de Rivière, a top French diplomat deeply involved in negotiating the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, said last week.
Taken together, the dynamic with Iran is more complex than at any point since the seizure of the American Embassy in 1979 after the overthrow of the shah. American and European intelligence officials say they do not believe the Iranians want a direct conflict with the United States or Israel, which they suspect would not end well. But they seem more than willing to push the envelope, enabling attacks, coordinating targeting of American bases and ships carrying goods and fuel, and walking to the edge, again, of nuclear weapons capability.
Added to the complexity of the problem is the dramatically widening scope of Iran's aid to Russia. What began as a trickle of Shahed drones sold to Russia for use against Ukraine has turned into a flood. And now American intelligence officials believe that, despite warnings, Iran is preparing to ship short-range missiles for use against Ukraine, just as Kyiv is running short on air defense and artillery shells.
It is a reflection of a sharply altered power dynamic: Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Iran no longer finds itself isolated. It is suddenly in an alliance of sorts with both Moscow and China, two members of the U.N. Security Council that, in a past era, supported Washington in trying to limit Iran's nuclear program. Now, that deal is dead, ended by former President Donald J. Trump five years ago, and suddenly Iran has two superpowers not only as allies, but as sanctions-busting customers.
"I see Iran as well positioned, and it has checkmated the U.S. and its interests in the Mideast," said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House. "Iran is active on all the borders, resistant to any sort of change from within, while enriching uranium at very alarming levels."
A Quiet Deal That Ended Badly
Mr. Biden entered office intent on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which contained Tehran's nuclear program for three years until Mr. Trump withdrew from it in 2018. After more than a year of negotiations, an accord was all but reached in the summer of 2022 to restore most of the agreement. It would have required Iran to ship its newly produced nuclear fuel out of the country, just as it had in 2015.
But the effort collapsed.
For the next year, Iran accelerated its nuclear program, for the first time enriching uranium to 60 percent purity, just shy of the 90 percent needed to produce weapons. It was a calculated move intended to show the United States that Tehran was just a few steps from a bomb -- but short of going over the line, to forestall an attack on its nuclear facilities.
In the summer of 2023, however, Brett McGurk, Mr. Biden's Middle East coordinator, quietly pieced together two separate deals. One got the five American prisoners released in return for several imprisoned Iranians and the transfer of $ 6 billion in Iranian assets from South Korea to an account in Qatar for humanitarian purposes.
But the second deal -- one Mr. Biden did not want revealed -- was an unwritten agreement that Iran would restrict its nuclear enrichment and keep a lid on the proxy forces. Only then, the Iranians were told, could there be talks on a broader deal.
For a few months it appeared to be working. Iranian proxies in Iraq or Syria did not attack American forces, ships ran freely in the Red Sea and inspectors reported that enrichment had been drastically slowed.
Some analysts say it was a temporary, and deceiving, quiet. Suzanne Maloney, the director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution and an Iran expert, called it "a Hail Mary they hoped would preserve some calm in the region through the election."
Attacks From All Sides
American intelligence officials say Iran did not instigate or approve the Hamas attack in Israel and probably was not even told about it. Hamas may have feared that word of the attack would leak from Iran, given how deeply Israeli and Western intelligence have penetrated the country.
But as soon as the war against Hamas began, Iran's proxy forces went on the attack. There were, however, significant indications that Iran, facing its own domestic problems, wanted to limit the conflict. Early on, Israel's war cabinet discussed a pre-emptive strike on Hezbollah in Lebanon, telling the Americans that an attack on Israel was imminent and part of an Iranian plan to go after Israel from all sides.
Mr. Biden's aides pushed back, arguing that the Israeli assessment was wrong, and deterred the Israeli strike. They believe they prevented -- or at least delayed -- a broader war.
Yet in recent days the threat of a war with Hezbollah has resurfaced. The group fired scores of rockets at an Israeli military post on Friday and Saturday in what it called a "preliminary response" to the killing last week of a senior Hamas leader, Saleh al-Arouri, in Lebanon.
Some in the Israeli government, like Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, have warned that complacency about Hamas's intentions should not be replicated with Hezbollah, which is thought to have as many as 150,000 missiles aimed at Israel and has trained some of its troops, the Radwan Force, for a cross-border invasion.
But in Washington, the concern now is less about a Hezbollah attack on Israel than an Israeli strike on Hezbollah. The United States has told Israel that if Hezbollah comes over the border, Washington will support Israel -- but not the other way around.
Hezbollah appears to have been careful so far not to give the Israelis an excuse for a military operation. Still, Iran has built Hezbollah, the most powerful force in Lebanon, as protection for itself, not the Palestinians. Hezbollah is a deterrent against any major Israeli attack on Iran, given the carnage its thousands of missiles could inflict on Israel.
That is a prime reason Iran wants to keep Hezbollah out of the war in Gaza, said Meir Javedanfar, a lecturer on Iran at Israel's Reichman University. Otherwise, Israel might go after Iran directly, he said, noting that Naftali Bennett, a former prime minister, has long pushed cutting off "the head of the octopus, not just the legs," like Hamas and Hezbollah.
"I see little interest in Iran escalating at this stage," Ms. Maloney of the Brookings Institution said, "because they're achieving most of their interests without that."
But American officials say that Iran does not have operational control over many of its proxies, and that the intensity of the attacks far from the Lebanon-Israel border could well be the spark for a larger conflict.
Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria have conducted more than 100 such attacks, which have drawn brief counterstrikes when they caused American casualties. On Thursday, an American missile strike in Baghdad -- a rare event -- killed Mushtaq Jawad Kazim al-Jawari, a deputy commander of an Iranian-backed militia who was "actively involved in planning and carrying out attacks against American personnel," the Pentagon said.
Crisis in the Red Sea
The piece of the conflict with the most immediate global impact has been centered on the Red Sea, where Houthi forces in Yemen, using Iranian intelligence and weapons, are targeting what they call "Israeli ships." In fact, they appear to be targeting all ships with heat-seeking missiles that cannot discriminate between targets and fast boats used to board and take over tankers.
When the U.S. Navy came to rescue a Maersk cargo ship under attack last weekend, the Houthis opened fire on Navy helicopters. The Navy pilots returned fire and sank three of the four Houthi boats, killing 10, the Houthis reported.
Maersk, one of the world's largest shippers, has suspended all transits through the Red Sea "for the foreseeable future," meaning that it is routing around the fastest path between Europe and Asia -- the Suez Canal. Companies around the world, from Ikea to BP, are already warning of supply-chain delays.
Washington has pulled together a coalition of nations to defend the ships, but it is heavily dependent on the American naval presence. And so far Mr. Biden has been reluctant to attack the Houthis in Yemen, but that appears to be changing, officials say.
The United States and 13 allies signed on to a statement last week giving what an administration official called a "final warning" to the Houthis to stop "these illegal attacks and release unlawfully detained vessels and crews." It did not mention Iran.
The Pentagon is refining plans for how to hit Houthi launching sites in Yemen, and some sort of assault on Houthi assets in Yemen is likely as soon as there is another attack, officials suggest, as a sharp warning to try to restore deterrence.
"At this point a significant military response is needed against the Houthi rebels, who are really Iranian pirates," said James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral. "Our experience with Somali pirates years ago shows that you can't just play defense; you have to go ashore to solve a problem like this. That is the only way for Iran to get the message."
"The idea that we are simply going to patrol the Red Sea, the size of California," with a "half-dozen police cars -- our ships out there -- is unrealistic," he said.
Mr. Biden faces hard choices. He pulled back from the Middle East to focus on competing with and deterring China. Now he is being sucked back in.
"The U.S. has built up a matrix of deterrence, signaling that it is not interested in a regional war but is prepared to intervene in response to Iran's provocation," said Hugh Lovatt, a Middle East expert for the European Council on Foreign Relations. But the presence of American carriers and troops makes Washington more exposed, he said. "So this matrix of deterrence could be a driver of escalation."
A Screwdriver Turn Away From a Bomb
Looming over all these possible conflicts is the future of Iran's nuclear program, with its long-running potential for direct confrontation with the West.
The years of diplomatic negotiations, covert action to disable Iran's nuclear centrifuges and Israeli assassinations of Iranian scientists have been focused on one goal: extending the time it would take Iran to assemble the fuel for a bomb. When the 2015 deal was reached, the Obama administration celebrated its greatest achievement -- that timeline, it contended, was more than a year.
Today, as Mr. Rivière, now France's U.N. ambassador noted, "we are talking about a couple of weeks or so," a situation that in previous years would have almost certainly prompted a crisis. (Fashioning that fuel into a working bomb would probably take a year or more, however, giving more time for the West to react.)
The Biden administration has said little, officials concede when speaking anonymously, because its options are so limited. With Iran supplying Russia with arms and selling oil to China, there is no chance of Security Council action.
And Mr. Biden's aides have given up interest in reviving the 2015 accord, because it is now outdated. As initially negotiated, it would allow Iran to produce as much fuel as it wants starting in 2030.
"Iran is enriching because they can," Ms. Maloney said. "Their goal has always been to wait out pressure and give themselves the option of a weapons program."

Toast to the 12 Vibes of Christmas: [Style Desk]

Full text: Soft lights in warm colors or bright LEDs? Handcrafted wooden ornaments or modern, minimalist baubles? Real tree or fake?
Shopping for holiday decorations can be overwhelming for any number of reasons, but firming up an aesthetic before you dive into the actual decking of halls doesn't have to be one. Although a whirl through TikTok might suggest that the distinctly branded vibes to choose from are endless, there really is no wrong way to decorate for the holidays, so long as you remain true to your personal style. (But really: You should go for the soft lights.)
If you're looking for somewhere to begin, we have collected 12 starter vibes to help you create the holiday season that's right for you. Traditionalists may gravitate toward a Vintage, Victorian or Hallmark Channel vibe. The more alternative-minded, on the other hand, may find that a Halloween-tinged Creepy Christmas, sun-drenched Summer Christmas or boozy High-Octane Christmas is right for them. And several acknowledged masters of cultivating a Christmastime vibe -- among them, the former first lady Melania Trump and Rockefeller Center -- are examined in depth for ease of mimicking.
So: Who do you want to be this Christmas?
Creepy Christmas
Notes of: Gothic eeriness, cobwebs and exploding penguins
For Bo Welch, a production designer on "Edward Scissorhands" and "Batman Returns" -- two characteristically dark Tim Burton films that, upon closer inspection, are certifiable Christmas movies -- this alternative aesthetic is all about finding the unconventional in the holidays.
"We built a context there that you would not normally associate with Christmas," said Mr. Welch, who said he kept props from "Batman Returns," including a few rubber penguins with bombs on their backs. One Christmas he put them on "icebergs" floating in his Los Angeles home swimming pool.
For anyone who doesn't have the budget of a 1990s holiday blockbuster, Mr. Welch advises that a dark and dreary holiday aesthetic can be achieved by giving last year's dried-out Christmas tree, its needles all fallen off, a dusting of black and stringing it with aggressively jolly lights.
You may even want to leave up some of your Halloween decorations and incorporate them into your spooky holiday décor. For something a little more family-friendly, bring home decorations inspired by "The Nightmare Before Christmas" -- the Burton Christmas film that arguably best captures this culture-clash vibe.
Summer Christmas
Notes of: surfing Santas, December sunscreen and frozen hot chocolate
Surfboards instead of sleighs, sandmen instead of snowmen -- thanks to the 23.44-degree tilt of Earth's rotational axis, Christmas isn't necessarily about being out in the cold. For those who find themselves in Australia, Africa or South America this year (or simply wish they were), it is perfectly acceptable to make Christmas all about vibing in the sun.
If you are among the half of the planet for whom Christmas falls in winter, take a cue from the Southern Hemisphere, where the holiday is better suited to a day at the beach than an evening huddled near the fireplace. Bring out your most festive red and green folding beach chairs and find as many surfing Santa Claus ornaments as you can. Swap the hot chocolate for fresh lemonade, and, if you're truly committed to the vibe, consider decorating a beach umbrella instead of a Christmas tree.
Once you've cranked the heat, you can jettison the Christmas sweaters and snow boots in favor of beach wear and flip-flops. Commit to the bit with a layer of S.P.F. 50 -- and don't forget to reapply.
Vintage Christmas
Notes of: C9 bulbs, silver tinsel and stop-motion 'Rudolph'
"When it comes to Christmas on TV, nostalgia isn't a phase," Maya Salam wrote in The New York Times in 2019, "it's the bedrock." In the past decade, retro holiday variety specials by the likes of Kacey Musgraves and Lady Gaga have channeled forebears of the form like Judy Garland and Cher. Looking backward is nothing new, of course, but embracing the right elements of the past can help you create a Christmas that takes you back to the 1950s (or '60s, or '70s -- "vintage" here is broadly defined).
Your Christmas tree's thin branches should be draped with multicolored C7 or C9 novelty lightbulbs -- the standard red, green, yellow and blue should do the trick. A splash of Space Age silver tinsel injects an element of the proudly synthetic. Intricately designed ornaments -- including glass figurines of Santas, snowmen and nutcrackers -- are essential, and an electric toy train circling the base of your tree rounds out the fantasy.
Don't forget to add garlands around the corners of your home and play classic Christmas specials such as "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" and "A Charlie Brown Christmas." And of course, you can never go wrong this time of year with Bing Crosby on vinyl.
Hallmark Channel Christmas
Notes of: small towns, family-run tree farms and Lacey Chabert
So you left your life in the big city to return to the small town you once called home only to find that somewhere along the way, you forgot the true meaning of Christmas. Perhaps this really is your life, or perhaps you're remembering the plot of one of the many made-for-TV movies you binged this year on the Hallmark Channel.
Happily, you don't have to escape to a small Christmas tree farm to bring the Hallmark Channel to your home.
"Bring the family together and decorate the ornaments together as a family," said Jordan Ninkovich, a production designer on Hallmark movies like "The Holiday Sitter" and "A Maple Valley Christmas."
For Mr. Ninkovich, the quintessential Hallmark holiday home relies on a D.I.Y. approach to decorating with family and loved ones. You can create and personalize your own stockings through arts and crafts, channeling a golden age of merriment he referred to as "the John Hughes days."
Melania Christmas
Notes of: menace, meme fodder and 'The Handmaid's Tale'
In her first Christmas as first lady, Melania Trump debuted a largely traditional vision of a winter wonderland at the White House. A few eyebrows were raised at a hallway decorated with skeletal bouquets of paperwhite twigs, illuminated from below like the face of someone telling a spooky story at a campfire, but the world spun on. It wasn't until the next year, when the decorations for Christmas 2018 were revealed, that a comprehensive Trump doctrine of Christmas décor was established -- at least in the minds of certain Twitter users.
The two rows of "blood-red nightmare Christmas trees" were widely said to evoke "The Handmaid's Tale" and "The Shining." But regardless of the viewer's associations -- bold or menacing, dystopian or avant-garde -- it was unquestionably a distinctive aesthetic.
To recreate this vibe, aim more for "modern art museum exhibit" than "warm and cozy." If you want to be a bit more on the nose, 40 or so scarlet trees and somber lighting in the hallways of your home ought to do it.
College Dorm Christmas
Notes of: discounted ornaments, mini trees and hot plates
At least until finals are over, anyone living in student housing has to find a way to cram potentially limitless holiday cheer into a fairly limited space. Economy is the name of the game.
That was how Allie Weber, a freshman at the University of Arizona, approached the decoration of her two-person dorm room. Her decorations were a mixture of new and old ornaments she brought from her family home in Chandler, Ariz., as well as a fake mini Christmas tree from Ikea.
Just be careful to follow the rules set out by campus housing.
"I did have a difficult time hanging the lights because I had run out of Command strips," said Ms. Weber, who is a marketing major. "We're not supposed to put holes in the wall, so we tried tape, but that didn't work. And eventually one of our neighbors gave us some extra Command strips."
Ramen noodles as tinsel? A cleverly wrapped mini-fridge masquerading as a giant present? College is a time to let your creativity run wild.
Hogwarts Christmas
Notes of: amateur sorcery, owls and floating candles
It's been 16 years since the last "Harry Potter" book, but after eight films, four theme parks and untold tons of branded merchandise, the image of a Hogwarts Christmas occupies an outsize place in the imaginations of millions of Potter-loving adults.
To capture the vibe of Christmas at Britain's premier school of witchcraft and wizardry, you could do worse than pulling references directly from the owls, broomsticks and wands of the eight original movies. Aim for warm colors and a Sorting Hat tree topper. You can get fancy with fishing line and hang LED candles from your ceiling, mimicking the floating candles in the Great Hall. And striped scarves in house colors -- red and gold for Gryffindor or green and silver for Slytherin -- can serve as thematic garlands on the mantel.
Once all the decorating is done, sit back and enjoy a homemade mug of butterbeer -- recipes abound online -- as you play John Williams's score in the background to set the mood.
High-Octane Christmas
Notes of: mulled wine, spiked eggnog and slurred carols
This one is for the adults who find their Christmas spirit in Christmas spirits.
Seasonal drinks like coquito and hot buttered rum are already staples of many a holiday celebration, though usually only in the capacity of refreshment. For a slightly boozier Christmas, consider pressing your holiday drinks into service as decoration.
Given their distinctive spherical containers, ready-to-drink BuzzBallz are well suited to be refashioned into novelty ornaments (many on TikTok have already undertaken the project), and cheekily gift-wrapped cases of beer under the tree can go a long way toward setting a tipsy mood. But there are other ways to spike your celebration without getting quite as crafty. Etsy runneth over with cocktail-specific ornaments that can broadcast your go-to drink order from the branch of an evergreen.
This Christmas vibe is perfect for a low-key holiday gathering, one that can be further enlivened with holiday charades or Christmas karaoke.
Crate & Barrel Christmas
Notes of: beige, sandstone, cream and ivory
Last month, the home-goods retailer Crate & Barrel was name-checked in a popular TikTok video shrugging off the "minimalist beige Christmas" aesthetic in favor of a more exuberant "early 2000s Christmas." Although the maker of the video called certain elements of the vibe "pretty" and "simple," she said that it wasn't for her. Could it be for you?
The retailer's home décor offerings walk the line between classic and modern, and visitors are likely to find everything they need for a cream-colored Christmas.
"We lean a little bit more into this minimalist, beautifully pared-down and edited aesthetic," said Sebastian Brauer, Crate & Barrel's senior vice president for product design. "But it's not cold. It's very warm and still joyful."
Mr. Brauer suggests bringing in natural elements and keeping everything simple, with white-on-white palettes anchored by solid ruby reds and hunter greens. Candles are your source of light here, as they contrast against darker woodsy elements.
Victorian Christmas
Notes of: roaring hearths, ghostly visitations and 'Bah! Humbug!'
Charles Dickens needed only 100 or so pages to transform the modern celebration of Christmas forever. His short novel "A Christmas Carol" not only introduced to the English language the very concept of a "Scrooge," but it suffused the holiday with a sentimentality that it carries to this day.
In one adaptation after another, it's the visuals that stand out. With varying degrees of historical accuracy, the Victorian-era costumes in movies like "The Muppet Christmas Carol" point the way forward for those looking to replicate the vibe: stocking caps for sleeping, wire-rimmed glasses for glaring over, scarves for fighting the London chill. As for decoration, it's all about holly, holly and more holly: Go crazy with entire boughs of the stuff, if you're so moved.
Published a quarter of a century later and an ocean away, Louisa May Alcott's "Little Women" staked out a similarly homey, hearth-forward vision of Christmas for the March girls of Massachusetts.
Pink Christmas
Notes of: Pepto-Bismol, Barbie Land and flamingos
So maybe a red and green Christmas isn't your thing. The tyranny of the standard color palette can be difficult to resist this time of year, but for those who want something a little less traditional, a pink Christmas might be the way to go.
Pink is coming off a banner year, since the "Barbie" movie made it almost inescapable this summer. The color gained fresh relevance this month with Nicki Minaj's new album, "Pink Friday 2," whose release inspired countless A.I.-generated scenes from the pink-hued Gag City that fans imagined as a sort of setting for the album. And, for at least a few more days, Viva Magenta -- a vibrant, fuchsia-skewing pink -- is Pantone's reigning color of the year.
For your own pink Christmas, contrast different shades of pink from orchid to carnation. Decorate your green Christmas tree with pink bows and a generous supply of big blush-colored, glittery ornaments, or lean all the way in with an artificial tree in a shade that's fooling no one.
Rockefeller Center Christmas
Notes of: crowds, Rockettes and turbocharged capitalism
A Christmas stroll through the West Village? Holiday shopping at one of the countless "sick, chic spots" in SoHo? Sorry, but nothing screams Christmas in New York quite like a trip to the beating Art Deco heart of all things grand and overstimulating, Rockefeller Center.
With its 80-foot Norway spruce decorated with five miles of lights, Rockefeller Center -- or, as the actor and comedian Matt Rogers calls it, "RockaFellaCenta" -- is all about thinking big.
To inject the spirit of what is essentially an uncommonly festive office park into your own celebrations, Mr. Rogers advises: "Just go all out and be extra." "I think it's the extremeness of New York City and Rockefeller Center that makes it so special and so memorable," he said. "So once you feel like you've done enough, do more. It's a reverse Coco Chanel: Add one more thing."
Mr. Rogers suggests doubling your usual number of ornaments when decorating your tree. Go for an enormous star tree topper that needs two electrical sockets instead of one. Maybe even go for a second Christmas tree.

Soft lights in warm colors or bright LEDs? Handcrafted wooden ornaments or modern, minimalist baubles? Real tree or fake?
Shopping for holiday decorations can be overwhelming for any number of reasons, but firming up an aesthetic before you dive into the actual decking of halls doesn’t have to be one. Although a whirl through TikTok might suggest that the distinctly branded vibes to choose from are endless, there really is no wrong way to decorate for the holidays, so long as you remain true to your personal style. (But really: You should go for the soft lights.)
If you’re looking for somewhere to begin, we have collected 12 starter vibes to help you create the holiday season that’s right for you.
Traditionalists may gravitate toward a Vintage, Victorian or Hallmark Channel vibe. The more alternative-minded, on the other hand, may find that a Halloween-tinged Creepy Christmas, sun-drenched Summer Christmas or boozy High-Octane Christmas is right for them. And several acknowledged masters of cultivating a Christmastime vibe — among them, former first lady Melania Trump and Rockefeller Center — are examined in depth for ease of mimicking.
So: Who do you want to be this Christmas?
Creepy Christmas
Notes of: Gothic eeriness, cobwebs and exploding penguins
For Bo Welch, a production designer on “Edward Scissorhands” and “Batman Returns” — two characteristically dark Tim Burton films that, upon closer inspection, are certifiable Christmas movies — this alternative aesthetic is all about finding the unconventional in the holidays.
“We built a context there that you would not normally associate with Christmas,” said Welch, who said he kept props from “Batman Returns” including a few rubber penguins with bombs on their backs. One Christmas he put them on “icebergs” floating in his Los Angeles home swimming pool.
For anyone who doesn’t have the budget of a 1990s holiday blockbuster, Welch advises that a dark and dreary holiday aesthetic can be achieved by giving last year’s dried-out Christmas tree, its needles all fallen off, a dusting of black and stringing it with aggressively jolly lights.
You may even want to leave up some of your Halloween decorations and incorporate them into your spooky holiday décor. For something a little more family-friendly, bring home decorations inspired by “The Nightmare Before Christmas” — the Burton Christmas film that arguably best captures this culture-clash vibe.
Summer Christmas
Notes of: surfing Santas, December sunscreen and frozen hot chocolate
Surfboards instead of sleighs, sandmen instead of snowmen — thanks to the 23.44-degree tilt of Earth’s rotational axis, Christmas isn’t necessarily about being out in the cold. For those who find themselves in Australia, Africa or South America this year (or simply wish they were), it is perfectly acceptable to make Christmas all about vibing in the sun.
If you are among the half of the planet for whom Christmas falls in winter, take a cue from the Southern Hemisphere, where the holiday is better suited to a day at the beach than an evening huddled near the fireplace. Bring out your most festive red and green folding beach chairs and find as many surfing Santa Claus ornaments as you can. Swap the hot chocolate for fresh lemonade, and, if you’re truly committed to the vibe, consider decorating a beach umbrella instead of a Christmas tree.
Once you’ve cranked the heat, you can jettison the Christmas sweaters and snow boots in favor of beach wear and flip-flops. Commit to the bit with a layer of SPF 50 — and don’t forget to reapply.
Vintage Christmas
Notes of: C9 bulbs, silver tinsel and stop-motion ‘Rudolph’
“When it comes to Christmas on TV, nostalgia isn’t a phase,” Maya Salam wrote in The New York Times in 2019, “it’s the bedrock.” In the past decade, retro holiday variety specials by the likes of Kacey Musgraves and Lady Gaga have channeled forebears of the form like Judy Garland and Cher. Looking backward is nothing new, of course, but embracing the right elements of the past can help you create a Christmas that takes you back to the 1950s (or ’60s, or ’70s — “vintage” here is broadly defined).
Your Christmas tree’s thin branches should be draped with multicolored C7 or C9 novelty lightbulbs — the standard red, green, yellow and blue should do the trick. A splash of Space Age silver tinsel injects an element of the proudly synthetic. Intricately designed ornaments including glass figurines of Santas, snowmen and nutcrackers are essential, and an electric toy train circling the base of your tree rounds out the fantasy.
Don’t forget to add garlands around the corners of your home and play classic Christmas specials such as “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” and “A Charlie Brown Christmas.” And of course, you can never go wrong this time of year with Bing Crosby on vinyl.
Melania Christmas
Notes of: menace, meme fodder and ‘The Handmaid’s Tale’
In her first Christmas as first lady, Melania Trump debuted a largely traditional vision of a winter wonderland at the White House. A few eyebrows were raised at a hallway decorated with skeletal bouquets of paper-white twigs, illuminated from below like the face of someone telling a spooky story at a campfire, but the world spun on. It wasn’t until the next year, when the decorations for Christmas 2018 were revealed, that a comprehensive Trump doctrine of Christmas décor was established — at least in the minds of certain Twitter users.
The two rows of “blood-red nightmare Christmas trees” were widely said to evoke “The Handmaid’s Tale” and “The Shining.” But regardless of the viewer’s associations — bold or menacing, dystopian or avant-garde — it was unquestionably a distinctive aesthetic.
To re-create this vibe, aim more for “modern art museum exhibit” than “warm and cozy.” If you want to be a bit more on the nose, 40 or so scarlet trees and somber lighting in the hallways of your home ought to do it.
Rockefeller Center Christmas
Notes of: crowds, Rockettes and turbocharged capitalism
A Christmas stroll through the West Village? Holiday shopping at one of the countless “sick, chic spots” in SoHo? Sorry, but nothing screams Christmas in New York quite like a trip to the beating Art Deco heart of all things grand and overstimulating, Rockefeller Center.
With its 80-foot Norway spruce decorated with five miles of lights, Rockefeller Center — or, as actor-comedian Matt Rogers calls it, “RockaFellaCenta” — is all about thinking big.
To inject the spirit of what is essentially an uncommonly festive office park into your own celebrations, Rogers advises: “Just go all out and be extra.” “I think it’s the extremeness of New York City and Rockefeller Center that makes it so special and so memorable,” he said. “So once you feel like you’ve done enough, do more. It’s a reverse Coco Chanel: Add one more thing.”
Rogers suggests doubling your usual number of ornaments when decorating your tree. Go for an enormous star tree topper that needs two electrical sockets instead of one. Maybe even go for a second Christmas tree.
Hallmark Channel Christmas
Notes of: small towns, family-run tree farms and Lacey Chabert
So you left your life in the big city to return to the small town you once called home only to find that somewhere along the way, you forgot the true meaning of Christmas. Perhaps this really is your life, or perhaps you’re remembering the plot of one of the many made-for-TV movies you binged this year on the Hallmark Channel.
Happily, you don’t have to escape to a small Christmas tree farm to bring the Hallmark Channel to your home.
“Bring the family together and decorate the ornaments together as a family,” said Jordan Ninkovich, a production designer on Hallmark movies including “The Holiday Sitter” and “A Maple Valley Christmas.”
For Ninkovich, the quintessential Hallmark holiday home relies on a DIY approach to decorating with family and loved ones. You can create and personalize your own stockings through arts and crafts, channeling a golden age of merriment he referred to as “the John Hughes days.”
College Dorm Christmas
Notes of: discounted ornaments, mini trees and hot plates
At least until finals are over, anyone living in student housing has to find a way to cram potentially limitless holiday cheer into a fairly limited space. Economy is the name of the game.
That was how Allie Weber, a freshman at the University of Arizona, approached the decoration of her two-person dorm room. Her decorations were a mixture of new and old ornaments she brought from her family home in Chandler, Arizona, as well as a fake mini Christmas tree from Ikea.
Just be careful to follow the rules set out by campus housing.
“I did have a difficult time hanging the lights because I had run out of Command strips,” said Weber, who is a marketing major. “We’re not supposed to put holes in the wall, so we tried tape but that didn’t work. And eventually one of our neighbors gave us some extra Command strips.”
Ramen noodles as tinsel? A cleverly wrapped mini-fridge masquerading as a giant present? College is a time to let your creativity run wild.
Hogwarts Christmas
Notes of: amateur sorcery, owls and floating candles
It’s been 16 years since the last “Harry Potter” book, but after eight films, four theme parks and untold tons of branded merchandise, the image of a Hogwarts Christmas occupies an outsize place in the imaginations of millions of Potter-loving adults.
To capture the vibe of Christmas at Britain’s premier school of witchcraft and wizardry, you could do worse than pulling references directly from the owls, broomsticks and wands of the eight original movies. Aim for warm colors and a Sorting Hat tree topper. You can get fancy with fishing line and hang LED candles from your ceiling, mimicking the floating candles in the Great Hall.

How Putin Turned a Western Boycott Into a War Chest Bonanza: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: If companies want to leave Russia, the president is setting the terms -- in ways that benefit his government, his elites and his war.
Soon after Russian troops invaded his country, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, made a plea to Western companies: "Leave Russia," he said. "Make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny."
Hundreds of companies answered the call. Politicians and activists predicted that it would help strangle the Russian economy and undermine the Kremlin's war effort.
President Vladimir V. Putin had other plans.
Mr. Putin has turned the exits of major Western companies into a windfall for Russia's loyal elite and the state itself. He has forced companies wishing to sell to do so at fire-sale prices. He has limited sales to buyers anointed by Moscow. Sometimes he has seized firms outright.
A New York Times investigation traced how Mr. Putin has turned an expected misfortune into an enrichment scheme. Western companies that have announced departures have declared more than $ 103 billion in losses since the start of the war, according to a Times analysis of financial reports. Mr. Putin has squeezed companies for as much of that wealth as possible by dictating the terms of their departure.
He has also subjected those exits to ever-increasing taxes, generating at least $ 1.25 billion in the past year for Russia's war chest.
No private deal is safe. The Dutch beer company Heineken, for example, found a buyer this spring and set a price. But the Russian government unilaterally rejected the deal, people close to the negotiations said, and put the company's Russian holdings in the hands of an aerosol-packaging titan married to a former Russian senator.
In all, Mr. Putin has overseen one of the biggest transfers of wealth within Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Huge swaths of industries -- elevators, tires, industrial coatings and more -- are now in the hands of increasingly dominant Russian players.
In some cases, that player is the state. Government-owned enterprises have acquired the assets of corporate giants like Ikea and Toyota. In many cases, Mr. Putin personally signs off on sales.
"These are good deals for us, for sure," said Anton Pinsky, a prominent restaurateur who joined with a pro-Putin rapper and associates of a powerful senator to take over Starbucks. In an interview in Moscow, he downplayed the significance of his own deal but was clear about the effect of the Western departures.
"You screwed up, left it," he said. "We picked it up inexpensively. Thank you."
Today in Russia, a robust consumer world carries on, helping Mr. Putin maintain a sense of normalcy despite a war that has proved longer, deadlier and costlier than he predicted.
Most foreign companies remain in Russia, unwilling to lose the billions they've invested there over decades. Other businesses have been sold and now have a through-the-looking-glass feel. Krispy Kreme is now Krunchy Dream; its doughnuts come in a similar flat box with familiar flavors. Starbucks has been reborn as Stars Coffee. Its mermaid is now a Russian swan princess.
These companies can buy raw materials domestically or import them from friendly countries. And customers can still easily buy products that have supposedly been pulled from shelves. On a recent day, a Moscow supermarket offered Pepsi from Uzbekistan and Coca-Cola from Poland.
Mr. Putin's economic counterstrikes have helped to fortify support among the elites profiting from the war and to blunt the effects of Western isolation. While Ukraine is preoccupied with short-term imperatives like shoring up international support, the relative resilience of the Russian economy has enabled Mr. Putin to play a long game.
Previously undisclosed documents, financial statements and interviews with dozens of deal makers in Russia and across Europe -- many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution -- show that Moscow now micromanages practically every exit. Companies must navigate an opaque system to win approval to sell. In some cases, Mr. Putin's friends have appealed directly to him to intervene.
"Those who are leaving are losing their position," Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told The Times. "And of course, their property is being bought at a serious discount and taken over by our companies, which are doing it with pleasure."
Still, the wave of departing companies has stung. It has sent a global signal that Russia is a business pariah. The economy is strained and at risk of overheating. Mr. Putin's handling of Western departures has only reinforced Russia's image as a dangerous place to do business. Even some top Russian officials admit that decreased competition and foreign investment will hurt everyday Russians and the economy in the long term.
The Kremlin says it prefers that companies remain in Russia. But Mr. Putin scoffs at the notion that leaving will hurt. "Did they think everything would collapse here? Well, nothing of the kind happened," he said this month. "Russian companies took over and moved on."
Not every deal is a windfall. Some buyers will face steep obstacles to make their new businesses profitable.
Hanging over the exit process for Western firms is the threat of intimidation and force. The Russian authorities have investigated departing companies, interrogated workers and arrested local executives.
Last summer, Mr. Putin seized the Russian arm of the Danish brewer Carlsberg, along with roughly half a billion dollars in cash, and put them under the temporary control of one of his friends.
At least four other companies have similarly lost control of their operations this year to effective state seizures.
Today, Mr. Putin is at the helm of a fraught exit process that works to Russia's advantage. But it began in the early days of the war with the urgent goal of simply keeping the Russian economy alive.
Blocking the Exits
Speaking from the White House two weeks after the invasion, President Biden boasted that the West was crushing the Russian economy. "The list of businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing by the day," he said.
Things looked bleak for Mr. Putin. The stock exchange in Moscow was closed and the ruble had crashed. If Russia lost all the jobs, production and cash of Western companies, the effects would be devastating.
But Mr. Putin was preparing his financial rejoinder. He restricted the movement of money abroad and required that companies from "unfriendly nations" win approval before selling their businesses.
Mr. Putin was putting the brakes on just as Western executives faced pressure to accelerate. In the United States, there was perhaps no more vocal figure than the Yale University management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. He appeared on cable news programs, criticizing companies that remained in Russia.
Professor Sonnenfeld recalled that it was corporate boycotts -- more than sanctions -- that helped abolish apartheid in South Africa. He transformed his office into a sort of war room, with a Yale team grading companies on their efforts to sever Russian ties.
The question of who would end up with those companies was of little concern.
"If Putin thinks he can do better at the deep fryer, let him have at it," he said in an interview. "We really don't care. The important thing is to not have the endorsement of a renowned global brand."
Professor Sonnenfeld's list and others like it added to pressure from shareholders, Ukrainian activists and everyday consumers.
Some executives worried what would happen to their Russian employees, factories and technology if they walked away. Others were reluctant to abandon their investments over a war that might prove short-lived.
But some quickly announced intentions to go. Heineken and Carlsberg said that they would leave once they found buyers. The Canadian gold mining company Kinross did the same, and within days announced a deal for $ 680 million to sell its Russian operation to a local buyer.
OBI, a German hardware store chain, went a step further, saying that it would close all 27 stores in Russia until it found a buyer.
Mr. Putin's government, though, was already erecting hurdles.
On March 17, 2022, the Russian Trade Ministry sent a letter to local OBI managers. The letter, reviewed by The Times, urged managers to defy the company and keep the stores open, citing consumer-protection laws. There was no "economic reason" for closing, the ministry wrote.
OBI, the ministry warned, needed to fulfill "obligations to its consumers, workers and counterparties, including suppliers." That prompted a days-long cat-and-mouse game as local employees tried to reopen stores and executives in Germany tried to stop them.
The Russian authorities also demanded that OBI officials testify about their plans. Prosecutors visited a store and inspected its computer system, the company told The Times.
OBI struck a deal that spring, ultimately selling for the symbolic price of a few dollars.
The buyer, a businessman named Josef Liokumovich, passed the company's background checks and was not on any financial blacklists. But as OBI soon learned, Western companies have no control over who ultimately takes over their operations.
In less than a year, OBI's Russia operation changed owners four times, ultimately landing with associates of the Russian senator Arsen B. Kanokov, who is under U.S. Treasury sanctions. At one point, an ally of the Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov appeared in the ownership register.
Such redirection is why diplomats and experts say it is too early to understand the changing landscape. The true new owners of some businesses might not be known for years, if ever.
"These guys," Urszula Nartowska, OBI's top lawyer, said, "they have the power of what they want to take. And you have to accept that."
In June, the Kremlin demonstrated what companies could expect: Moscow approved the Kinross gold mine sale, but with a stunning alteration. The sale price had been cut in half, to $ 340 million.
The buyer, Highland Gold, would later be blacklisted by British officials who said that gold provided a "significant income stream for Russia's war effort."
"The government realized they could dictate who buys, and maybe use that power to reward connected buyers," said Alan Kartashkin, a lawyer for Debevoise & Plimpton who spent decades in Moscow and has negotiated the exits of Western companies.
"I remember thinking," Mr. Kartashkin added, "once they feel they have the power to control entirely private transactions, where the government has no equity interest, they're not going to stop."
'This Business Is Already Russian'
The mood was celebratory in July when the Russian minister of industry and trade, Denis V. Manturov, appeared at a St. Petersburg elevator factory.
The plant had recently belonged to the world's largest elevator company, the Connecticut-based Otis Worldwide. Now it belonged to a firm controlled by Armen M. Sarkisyan, who had made a fortune running the Russian lottery in part thanks to government connections.
Mr. Manturov bragged that Moscow had brokered special arrangements for the sale. He gushed about a new production line and robust demand for elevators in Russian high-rises. "This business is already Russian," he said. It was now known as Meteor.
Mr. Sarkisyan is an example of a unique creation of the war: a businessman who was politically connected enough to win such a prize and rich enough to close the deal -- but not so closely linked to the Kremlin that he was subject to international sanctions.
Mr. Sarkisyan and others, almost overnight, absorbed huge corners of their markets.
When the Finnish elevator giant Kone tried to sell to its employees, the authorities rejected the deal. Once again, Mr. Sarkisyan's holding company, S8 Capital, became the buyer.
S8 Capital also moved into the tire business, snapping up the Russian operation of the German company Continental, before buying the top Russian tire maker, Cordiant, and entering talks to purchase the Russian factory of the Japanese tire maker Bridgestone.
S8 Capital did not respond to requests for comment.
By the summer of 2022, Russia's economy had stabilized, the ruble had rebounded and Mr. Putin's strategy shifted.
While early in the war, companies like McDonald's had sold to local managers or local business associates, with an option to return to Russia later, such deals soon became more difficult.
Having climbed out of crisis, the government wanted to do more than just keep the doors open. It increasingly wanted to dictate the terms of every deal.
In August of that year, Mr. Putin issued a decree requiring that companies in key industries obtain his signature before selling their Russian assets. Scores of businesses, including divisions of Siemens and Caterpillar, were suddenly subject to the whims of Mr. Putin himself.
"The government was beginning to tighten up the process, and it was becoming a lot more challenging," said Laura Brank, a lawyer at Dechert helping Western companies to exit. "I was telling clients we'd better get moving quickly."
The Subcommission
For most companies trying to leave Russia, the gatekeepers operate out of a gray government building near Red Square. Eleven days after the war began, Mr. Putin empaneled a special "subcommission" there to review requests to sell.
Mr. Putin's longtime finance minister, Anton G. Siluanov, leads the subcommission, which includes officials from the Kremlin, the central bank and key ministries.
They decide whether companies can leave and under what terms.
Once a company has struck a deal with a buyer, the negotiations often begin again -- this time in secret, between the buyer and one of the Russian government ministries. The seller is largely excluded. That process, lawyers say, often ends with a lower sale price and at times a new buyer. The deal then goes to the subcommission. Sometimes, deals fall through after months of silence.
Internal minutes, reviewed by The Times, show that the subcommission scrutinizes even the smallest details. In one meeting last year, the panel approved the $ 59,000 sale of a tiny apartment owned by the Finnish tire company Nokian.
The subcommission wields enormous power. Minutes show that it rejected a proposal by the American electronics company Honeywell to sell its factories until an assessment proved that the Russian buyer was getting a 50 percent discount.
Despite the bureaucracy, businesspeople have jockeyed behind the scenes for the most lucrative assets, often appealing directly to Mr. Putin.
Such was the case in the summer of 2022, when Mondi, a British-Austrian paper company, found a buyer for one of Russia's largest mills and sought government approval to sell.
As the deal came together, one of Mr. Putin's old K.G.B. buddies, Sergei V. Chemezov, appeared. He wrote a letter asking that the president steer the mill toward a group of investors, including the state-owned firm he runs. He even suggested a way to structure the deal to get around Western sanctions. The Times reviewed a copy of the letter.
Neither Mr. Chemezov nor the state-owned company responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Chemezov's deal never happened, but neither did Mondi's original agreement. The subcommission put the mill in the hands of a Moscow property developer for significantly less than the original price.
Abroad, Professor Sonnenfeld and others kept up the pressure. More than 200 companies had earned "F" grades on his list. Professor Sonnenfeld testified before Congress in November 2022. Remaining in Russia, he said, was tantamount to supporting the government.
But under Mr. Putin's rules, leaving also directly benefited the government and, in turn, the war.
This year, the parent company of Ikea sold its Russian malls to a state-controlled bank. Nokian sold its operation to an oil company owned by a Russian regional government. The Russian operations of Nissan, Renault and Toyota were taken over by a state company.
The Russian government has looked to use former Western auto factories to produce vehicles, yachts and private jets for the state-owned luxury brand Aurus, according to an internal Trade Ministry document obtained by The Times.
Neither the Trade nor Finance Ministries responded to requests for comment.
Mr. Putin also found a way to bring money straight into state coffers.
Early on, foreign deals were subjected to what the government called a "voluntary tax" -- required for the privilege of taking money out of Russia in a lump sum. Companies that opted not to pay the tax would receive their payouts in installments.
But by early this year, Mr. Putin had stopped giving them the choice. Companies had to pay the tax, and they still might get their money in installments.
The Kremlin also made explicit what had been implied since the Kinross deal: Companies were required to sell for at least a 50 percent markdown.
Heineken, for About a Dollar
By 2023, the landscape had become unknowable. The Kremlin constantly changed the rules and seemed to be always demanding more. Companies including Unilever announced that they would rather remain in Russia than have their assets end up in the government's hands.
Against that backdrop, executives at Heineken and Carlsberg were still negotiating with prospective buyers this year when Mr. Putin awarded himself even greater powers.
The Russian government, he decreed in April, could seize foreign assets and put them under the temporary oversight of whomever it liked. Companies now risked being seized outright.
Heineken reached a deal that month and the buyer, a Kazakh businessman, requested government approval. Carlsberg executives followed suit, planning to sell to Arnest, the Russian aerosol maker that had recently snapped up the highly profitable drinks-packaging business of the U.S.-based Ball Corporation.
Both brewers felt confident that, more than a year after announcing plans to leave Russia, they would finally do so.
In July, Mr. Putin blindsided Carlsberg executives by seizing the company and placing it in the hands of his longtime associate and judo friend, Taimuraz Bolloev.
Carlsberg was an attractive target. The company controlled the iconic Russian beer brand Baltika and had recently valued its Russian operation at about $ 3 billion. Its sales application had revealed that it was sitting on a half-billion dollars in cash.
In another twist, Russian officials also rejected Heineken's deal. According to the people close to the negotiations, the authorities steered the business toward Arnest -- a consolation, perhaps, for having lost the far more lucrative Carlsberg.
The deal went through for a single euro and the promise to repay $ 100 million in debt.
For Carlsberg executives, the saga was far from over. Mr. Bolloev, they said, has pressured them to sign over the company permanently.
"It would require that we literally did a deal with Putin and his administration, creating a legitimate transaction where they could take over our business for basically close to nothing," Jacob Aarup-Andersen, the Carlsberg chief executive, said in an interview last month. "We just couldn't do that."
Within weeks, the Russian authorities had arrested two company employees and raided their homes. This month, Russian news outlets reported, Mr. Bolloev asked the authorities to nationalize the company.
Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former president who is the deputy chairman of Russia's security council, expressed no sympathy for companies trying to move money out of the country and take it back to the very countries arming Ukraine.
He taunted Carlsberg, thanking them for padding the Russian budget.
"A strong budget means help for the front," he wrote last month. "In this regard, the senseless Danes also contribute to modern Russian weapons."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Soon after Russian troops invaded his country, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, made a plea to Western companies: "Leave Russia," he said. "Make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny."
Hundreds of companies answered the call. Politicians and activists predicted that it would help strangle the Russian economy and undermine the Kremlin's war effort.
President Vladimir V. Putin had other plans.
Mr. Putin has turned the exits of major Western companies into a windfall for Russia's loyal elite and the state itself. He has forced companies wishing to sell to do so at fire-sale prices. He has limited sales to buyers anointed by Moscow. Sometimes he has seized firms outright.
A New York Times investigation traced how Mr. Putin has turned an expected misfortune into an enrichment scheme. Western companies that have announced departures have declared more than $ 103 billion in losses since the start of the war, according to a Times analysis of financial reports. Mr. Putin has squeezed companies for as much of that wealth as possible by dictating the terms of their departure.
He has also subjected those exits to ever-increasing taxes, generating at least $ 1.25 billion in the past year for Russia's war chest.
No private deal is safe. The Dutch beer company Heineken, for example, found a buyer this spring and set a price. But the Russian government unilaterally rejected the deal, people close to the negotiations said, and put the company's Russian holdings in the hands of an aerosol-packaging titan married to a former Russian senator.
In all, Mr. Putin has overseen one of the biggest transfers of wealth within Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. Huge swaths of industries -- elevators, tires, industrial coatings and more -- are now in the hands of increasingly dominant Russian players.
In some cases, that player is the state. Government-owned enterprises have acquired the assets of corporate giants like Ikea and Toyota. In many cases, Mr. Putin personally signs off on sales.
"These are good deals for us, for sure," said Anton Pinsky, a prominent restaurateur who joined with a pro-Putin rapper and associates of a powerful senator to take over Starbucks. In an interview in Moscow, he downplayed the significance of his own deal but was clear about the effect of the Western departures.
"You screwed up, left it," he said. "We picked it up inexpensively. Thank you."
Today in Russia, a robust consumer world carries on, helping Mr. Putin maintain a sense of normalcy despite a war that has proved longer, deadlier and costlier than he predicted.
Most foreign companies remain in Russia, unwilling to lose the billions they've invested there over decades. Other businesses have been sold and now have a through-the-looking-glass feel. Krispy Kreme is now Krunchy Dream; its doughnuts come in a similar flat box with familiar flavors. Starbucks has been reborn as Stars Coffee. Its mermaid is now a Russian swan princess.
These companies can buy raw materials domestically or import them from friendly countries. And customers can still easily buy products that have supposedly been pulled from shelves. On a recent day, a Moscow supermarket offered Pepsi from Uzbekistan and Coca-Cola from Poland.
Mr. Putin's economic counterstrikes have helped to fortify support among the elites profiting from the war and to blunt the effects of Western isolation. While Ukraine is preoccupied with short-term imperatives like shoring up international support, the relative resilience of the Russian economy has enabled Mr. Putin to play a long game.
Previously undisclosed documents, financial statements and interviews with dozens of deal makers in Russia and across Europe -- many of whom spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution -- show that Moscow now micromanages practically every exit. Companies must navigate an opaque system to win approval to sell. In some cases, Mr. Putin's friends have appealed directly to him to intervene.
"Those who are leaving are losing their position," Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told The Times. "And of course, their property is being bought at a serious discount and taken over by our companies, which are doing it with pleasure."
Still, the wave of departing companies has stung. It has sent a global signal that Russia is a business pariah. The economy is strained and at risk of overheating. Mr. Putin's handling of Western departures has only reinforced Russia's image as a dangerous place to do business. Even some top Russian officials admit that decreased competition and foreign investment will hurt everyday Russians and the economy in the long term.
The Kremlin says it prefers that companies remain in Russia. But Mr. Putin scoffs at the notion that leaving will hurt. "Did they think everything would collapse here? Well, nothing of the kind happened," he said this month. "Russian companies took over and moved on."
Not every deal is a windfall. Some buyers will face steep obstacles to make their new businesses profitable.
Hanging over the exit process for Western firms is the threat of intimidation and force. The Russian authorities have investigated departing companies, interrogated workers and arrested local executives.
Last summer, Mr. Putin seized the Russian arm of the Danish brewer Carlsberg, along with roughly half a billion dollars in cash, and put them under the temporary control of one of his friends.
At least four other companies have similarly lost control of their operations this year to effective state seizures.
Today, Mr. Putin is at the helm of a fraught exit process that works to Russia's advantage. But it began in the early days of the war with the urgent goal of simply keeping the Russian economy alive.
Speaking from the White House two weeks after the invasion, President Biden boasted that the West was crushing the Russian economy. "The list of businesses and international corporations leaving Russia is growing by the day," he said.
Things looked bleak for Mr. Putin. The stock exchange in Moscow was closed and the ruble had crashed. If Russia lost all the jobs, production and cash of Western companies, the effects would be devastating.
But Mr. Putin was preparing his financial rejoinder. He restricted the movement of money abroad and required that companies from "unfriendly nations" win approval before selling their businesses.
Mr. Putin was putting the brakes on just as Western executives faced pressure to accelerate. In the United States, there was perhaps no more vocal figure than the Yale University management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. He appeared on cable news programs, criticizing companies that remained in Russia.
Professor Sonnenfeld recalled that it was corporate boycotts -- more than sanctions -- that helped abolish apartheid in South Africa. He transformed his office into a sort of war room, with a Yale team grading companies on their efforts to sever Russian ties.
The question of who would end up with those companies was of little concern.
"If Putin thinks he can do better at the deep fryer, let him have at it," he said in an interview. "We really don't care. The important thing is to not have the endorsement of a renowned global brand."
Professor Sonnenfeld's list and others like it added to pressure from shareholders, Ukrainian activists and everyday consumers.
Some executives worried what would happen to their Russian employees, factories and technology if they walked away. Others were reluctant to abandon their investments over a war that might prove short-lived.
But some quickly announced intentions to go. Heineken and Carlsberg said that they would leave once they found buyers. The Canadian gold mining company Kinross did the same, and within days announced a deal for $ 680 million to sell its Russian operation to a local buyer.
OBI, a German hardware store chain, went a step further, saying that it would close all 27 stores in Russia until it found a buyer.
Mr. Putin's government, though, was already erecting hurdles.
On March 17, 2022, the Russian Trade Ministry sent a letter to local OBI managers. The letter, reviewed by The Times, urged managers to defy the company and keep the stores open, citing consumer-protection laws. There was no "economic reason" for closing, the ministry wrote.
OBI, the ministry warned, needed to fulfill "obligations to its consumers, workers and counterparties, including suppliers." That prompted a days-long cat-and-mouse game as local employees tried to reopen stores and executives in Germany tried to stop them.
The Russian authorities also demanded that OBI officials testify about their plans. Prosecutors visited a store and inspected its computer system, the company told The Times.

The buyer, Highland Gold, would later be blacklisted by British officials who said that gold provided a "significant income stream for Russia's war effort."

Retailers Worry About Holiday Shoppers' Mood: [National Desk]

Full text: Consumer spending has been strong in 2023 despite higher prices and waning savings. But some retailers have jitters heading into Black Friday.
Christina Beck is approaching this holiday season cautiously.
Ms. Beck, a 58-year-old administrative director at a school, makes lists of gifts she plans to buy for her family and friends and sticks with it. But her spending this year will be kept in check by the high cost of food in grocery stores and restaurants, and the mortgage for a home in Minneapolis she bought last year with her best friend.
That best friend, Kristin Aitchison, cannot wait for the holidays. Ms. Aitchison, 55, who works for a senior living home, advises her family each year that she plans to make the holidays smaller, spending less. And every year, she spends more than she did the year before.
"I'm a huge gift giver," Ms. Aitchison, who started her shopping in early November. "I have so much joy in giving gifts. I'm always running around the last week before Christmas because I have to find just a few more gifts."
There are many reasons for people to be more prudent in their holiday spending this year. While inflation is less rapid than it was a year ago, millions of shoppers still feel sticker shock when buying groceries. Payments on federal student loans, which were on pause during the pandemic, have resumed. And higher interest rates have meant larger credit card bills and, for home buyers, mortgage payments.
Yet consumer spending has been surprisingly strong throughout 2023. For retailers, the question is whether people will continue to spend their way through the holiday season or decide this is the time to pull back.
Predictions are murky. The National Retail Federation said it expected holiday sales to increase 3 to 4 percent from last year, without adjusting for inflation, on a par with the prepandemic 2019 season. But in a survey by the Conference Board, a nonprofit research group, consumers said they planned to spend an average of $ 985 on holiday-related items this year, down slightly from the $ 1,006 they anticipated spending last year.
One closely watched early indicator, Amazon's Prime Day in October, showed consumers were spending more, but only slightly. They spent an average of $ 144.53 on Prime Day, a 2 percent increase from the average the year before, according to Facteus, which analyzed credit and debit card transaction data.
Last week, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales nationwide fell 0.1 percent in October from September, the first drop since March. Executives at Walmart also warned that consumer spending had weakened in the last two weeks in October, noting that people seemed to be waiting for sales.
"It makes us more cautious on the consumer as we look into the fourth quarter," John David Rainey, the chief financial officer of Walmart, said in an interview. "I think there's likely more variability in the numbers."
Still, the retail sales pullback was smaller than the decline that many economists had expected after a very strong summer of spending, and some analysts saw it as a sign of continued consumer resilience.
Holiday sales are likely to be decent by prepandemic standards, though not as strong as the gangbuster seasons in 2020 and 2021, said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo.
Higher-income shoppers still have plenty of extra savings built up during and after the pandemic, but those with lower incomes have more fully used up their resources, Mr. Quinlan said. Higher interest rates may also deter shoppers from putting holiday shopping on credit cards. The combination of reduced savings and higher rates "makes it tougher to have a big pile of presents under the tree this year," he said.
For much of the year, consumer spending has been underpinned by continued strength in the job market and wage gains. Average hourly earnings in October were up 4.1 percent from a year earlier. That was faster than inflation. As measured by the Consumer Price Index, prices were up 3.2 percent.
Those factors have helped to keep retail sales climbing on a yearly basis.
Still, signs of slowing are beginning to show up. Wage growth is slowing, and the unemployment rate has risen over recent months. Like Mr. Quinlan, many economists think that consumers are getting closer to exhausting their savings, though some studies suggest that many have been drawing down their financial cushions only slowly.
For many, the resumption of student-loan payments is putting a crimp in holiday spending plans. In a holiday survey by the consulting firm Deloitte, 17 percent of respondents said they had to resume student loan payments, and almost half of them said they planned to reduce their holiday spending as a result.
In past years, Tara Cavanaugh, a 37-year-old marketing manager, spent as much as $ 1,500 on gifts for her family, friends and various office parties, she said. This year, after a move with her partner to Boulder, Colo., and the resumption of her $ 400-a-month student-loan payments -- her partner also has student-loan debt -- she said she was paring down her gift list and expected to spend closer to $ 200.
"We both make decent incomes and live simply, sharing an old car and our furniture is still from Ikea, but it still feels like we're struggling," Ms. Cavanaugh said of her and her partner. "I know a lot of us are feeling the pinch, so I'm not going to freak out about giving gifts to people who are older than me, are doing fine and don't need anything."
As always, many people are looking for deals, whether on Black Friday or through other pre-Christmas sales. About 52 percent of consumers plan to watch for deals and special offers online and 39 percent plan to hunt for sales in stores this year, according to a survey by the research firm Forrester.
When the Amazon toy catalog landed in Claire Kielich's mailbox in Austin, Texas, her two daughters, ages 5 and 10, who also have birthdays in December, began circling what they wanted.
"I'll be watching to see if any of those things go on sale for Black Friday," said Ms. Kielich, 40, who does product development and sourcing in the furniture industry. She said she expected to spend around $ 1,000 this holiday season and already had a stash of stocking stuffers hidden in one of her closets.
Ms. Beck in Minneapolis started buying holiday gifts in July, making lists of what friends and family needed or liked, picking up unique items at local craft stores or from small local businesses and storing them in what she calls her "present drawer." This approach, she said, helps her put more thought into her gifts and keeps her from spending beyond her budget.
Her best friend, Ms. Aitchison, takes the opposite approach. While careful with her finances during the year, come the holidays she has no plan and, basically, no budget. Her oldest child has barred her from ever buying him another pair of corduroy pants. Last year, she bought four nine-foot-tall blow-up dinosaur costumes for her adult children.
"Of course, nobody needs a blow-up dinosaur costume," Ms. Aitchison conceded.
This holiday season, she plans to shop until she drops.
"I don't think about what I'm going to spend," she said. "In January and February, because I spent all my money, I'll eat beans and rice while I pay the bills off."
Despite their different holiday shopping styles, Ms. Aitchison said she and Ms. Beck always had fun shopping together.
"She doesn't get nearly the amount of things that I do," Ms. Aitchison said. "She's always like: 'Kristin stop. Put that down. You don't need it."'

Here to Help; What You Need to Host Friendsgiving in a Small Space: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: Don't let your small place dash your plans to throw a big dinner party. It doesn't take much to host a Friendsgiving event in a tiny space. By making a few changes and investing in some multipurpose items, you can reduce clutter, add comfort and minimize the post-dinner cleanup. ELISSA SANCI
Have a cutting board for double duty. A wooden cutting board can serve many purposes -- it's great for meal preparation, and it can be an elegant way to serve cheese and hors d'oeuvres.
Add stackable glasses. When cabinet storage is scarce, multipurpose glassware becomes a space-saving necessity. The Duralex Picardie Tumblers are stylish and lightweight yet durable enough to survive drops. They stack easily for storage.
Use a table and chairs you can tuck away afterward. When your guest list is long but your dining room table is tiny, it's time to bring in backup. The Plastic Dev Group Banquet Table is an affordable, sturdy option that won't wobble or buckle under the weight of a Friendsgiving spread.
Take advantage of spinning condiment trays. A simple way to maximize table space is to use a rotating cake stand to centralize condiments and make it easier for guests to reach them. Consider the Ateco 612, a revolving cake-decorating stand that doubles as a serving stand.
Bring in a little speaker with a big sound. No Friendsgiving get-together is complete without a mood-setting playlist. Piping your music through a powerhouse speaker is a good way to ensure that guests can hear it through the din.
Add counter space you can move around. A rolling cart, such as the IKEA Bekväm kitchen cart, is an easy way to add preparation space or serving surfaces without taking up much floor space. After the party begins, roll it out of the kitchen and turn it into a bar cart or a tray for side dishes.
Use a window fan for optimal ventilation. A window fan can help ventilate your space and keep your guests from schvitzing as you cook up a storm in the kitchen.

Full text: In the new film from Emerald Fennell, Barry Keoghan plays an Oxford student drawn into a world of lust and envy at a classmate's estate.
"Saltburn" is the sort of embarrassment you'll put up with for 75 minutes. But not for 127. It's too desperate, too confused, too pleased with its petty shocks to rile anything you'd recognize as genuine excitement. This thing was written and directed by Emerald Fennell, whose previous movie was "Promising Young Woman," a horror flick about rape that was also a revenge comedy. So believe me: She wants you riled. Fennell's seen the erotic thrillers, studied her Hitchcock and possibly read her Patricia Highsmith, and gets that if you name your main character Oliver Quick he's obligated to do something at least arguably Dickensian. The question here, amid all the lying, lazing about and (eventually, inevitably) dying, is to what end?
We're dragged back to 2006, where two boys at Oxford -- bookish Oliver (Barry Keoghan) and rakish Felix (Jacob Elordi) -- forge one of those imbalanced, obsessive friendships that one of them mistakes for love and the other tolerates because he's needier than he looks. It goes south or sideways or to outer space but also nowhere. Well, that's not entirely accurate, since it also goes, for one summer, to Saltburn, Felix's family's estate, a grassy expanse that boasts a Baroque mansion with stratospheric ceilings, one cantilevered staircase, copious portraiture, a Bernard Palissy ceramic platter collection and one of those garden mazes where characters get lost right along with plots.
These two meet, in earnest, when Oliver loans Felix his bike, a moment Oliver's been waiting for. The best scenes in the movie happen during this Oxford stretch when Oliver experiences Felix as an intoxicant, and Felix's prepster coterie experiences Oliver as an irritant. There's some crackle and dreaminess and post-adolescent instability here. Identities are being forged. It's been better elsewhere -- John Hughes, "Heathers," Hogwarts, Elordi's HBO show "Euphoria." But Fennell squeezes some hunger, cruelty and passable tenderness onto these moments. When Oliver tells Felix his father's just died, Felix extends his Saltburn invitation out of sincere compassion.
Now, what happens over the course of this visit amounts to a different movie -- or maybe three. Lust and envy take over. As does Fennell's tedious, crude stab at psychopathology. Felix hails from one of those stiff, pathologically blasé clans where "clenched" counts as an emotion. Everybody at Saltburn seems ready for a new toy. And Oliver's A-student impulses make a sport of ingratiation. His erudition, availability and blue eyes impress Felix's droll mother, Elspeth (Rosamund Pike); his mere arrival arouses Felix's self-conscious zombie of a sister, Venetia (Alison Oliver). In a different movie, their enthusiasm for this newcomer would make you sad for Farleigh (Archie Madekwe), a schoolmate and cousin of Felix who's already on the premises, flatulent with attitude by the time Oliver shows up. He's the one nonwhite major character in "Saltburn," a fact the movie considers doing something intriguing with but abandons. His eyebrows are just chronically Up to Something. Is Farleigh worried about losing a financial lifeline? Is he jealous that Oliver might consummate things with Felix before he does?
But this isn't a movie in which anybody's reaction to new developments is straightforward -- and not because there's anything complex or psychological going on with the screenwriting or the performances (Richard E. Grant pumps Felix's father full of drollery). It's because Fennell is more drawn to -- or maybe just better at -- styling and stunts than she is the tougher work of emotional trenchancy. If she gives us one music-video bit (a montage, a whole tracking shot), she must give us half a dozen. When the time comes for the movie to make its switch to gothic mischief, it's like watching the first half of "Psycho" turn into the video for "When Doves Cry" or George Michael's "Freedom! '90." What's that look like? Well: Oliver sneaks a peek as Felix masturbates in a tub, and once the coast is clear he bends over and sips the draining bathwater. It's a fine shot that's also an absurd thing to have this guy do. Which is how you know the movie is failing as a good work of trash. I didn't laugh or gape. I just sat there watching an actor do his damnedest to save the rest of the movie before it heads down the drain. Fennell keeps going, though, turning her mild protagonist into someone ripe for the cover of a bodice-ripper: a crafty virgin discovers the lethal weapon of lust.
This was the gist of "Promising Young Woman," too: that sex was like a chain saw or a gun. When it landed in 2020, the moment seemed right. Fennell had found a way to turn a premise you'd propose at a dinner party or while tipsy in the back of a cab into something tight and mordant: a "rape culture" revenge-o-matic. But it was so morally and formally tidy that it punched its own teeth out. The "o-matic" won. "Saltburn" has the same seductive sleekness -- the nerve. But none of the dread or poison kick.
The film's comic centerpiece was also the star of Fennell's other movie: Carey Mulligan. Here, she's deadpanning her way through a chicly ratty mess named Pamela. Mulligan does blinkered, stammering and sad like if Tama Janowitz had written Miss Havisham first. It's just Helena Bonham-Carter karaoke. But the movie needs it. Pamela has maybe three actual scenes, then we never see her again. She's overstayed her welcome at Saltburn. But the movie misses the campiness Mulligan's giving. You'd like to see her and Pike try on the vulgar farce of "Absolutely Fabulous." But Fennell is going for real opulence, not a comedy of it.
If "Promising Young Woman" had feminist vengeance on its mind, what's "Saltburn" thinking? I spy three hovering text dots. It's got some twists and a handful of good lines (nearly all of them belong to Pike), but it doesn't have many thoughts and even fewer feelings. Here is a movie where gay things occur, but homosexuality abuts, alas, corruption and conniving.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
I suppose Fennell has made a movie about toxic elitism, but she's done it in the way Ikea gives you assembly instructions. And barely even that, since the most blatant class indictment is outsourced to the Pet Shop Boys' "Rent" during a bout of actual karaoke with Oliver and Farleigh. Staging the warfare between two strivers isn't a bad urge, but that doesn't go far enough, either. The movie does for "posh" what "Soul Plane" did for "ghetto": luxuriate in what it's pretending to blow up.
I'm even left doubting Fennell's expertise in main characters. Are we meant to clock a nerd who, when he sheds the clothes and spectacles, makes you as horny as Felix is supposed to make him? Barry Keoghan is trying to create a role out of the disparate parts of other ones (Norman Bates, Tom Ripley, Patrick Bateman), yet doesn't get all the way there. He couldn't have. There is no "there."
The whole movie seems to exist for its coda, and presumably the prosthetics designer whose name appears in the closing credits. It's another music-video fantasia, but so cynical, literal-minded and literally cheeky that I cringed my way through it. And it asks a lot of Keoghan, who could have built a memorable, original character for Fennell. But real acting is not what Fennell's after here. Oliver has a decent amount of strategic sex and Keoghan does his share of nudity, but the only pornographic thing about the movie is the house.

Container Ships Emit a Lot of Gas. Green Ships Offer a Nascent Hope.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: On a bright September day on the harbor in Copenhagen, several hundred people gathered to welcome the official arrival of Laura Maersk.
Laura was not a visiting European dignitary like many of those in attendance. She was a hulking containership, towering a hundred feet above the crowd, and the most visible evidence to date of an effort by the global shipping industry to mitigate its role in the planet's warming.
The ship, commissioned by the Danish shipping giant Maersk, was designed with a special engine that can burn two types of fuel -- either the black, sticky oil that has powered ships for more than a century, or a greener type made from methanol. By switching to green methanol, this single ship will produce 100 fewer tons of greenhouse gas per day, an amount equivalent to the emissions of 8,000 cars.
The effect of global shipping on the climate is hard to overstate. Cargo shipping is responsible for nearly 3 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions -- producing roughly as much carbon each year as the aviation industry does.
Figuring out how to limit those emissions has been tricky. Some ships are turning to an age-old strategy: harnessing the wind to move them. But ships still need a more constant source of energy that is powerful enough to propel them halfway around the world in a single go.
Unlike cars and trucks, ships can't plug in frequently enough to be powered by batteries and the electrical grid: They need a clean fuel that is portable.
The Laura Maersk is the first of its kind to set sail with a green methanol engine and represents a significant step in the industry's efforts to address its contribution to climate change. The vessel is also a vivid illustration of just how far the global shipping sector has to go. While roughly 125 methanol-burning ships are now on order at global shipyards from Maersk and other companies, that is just a tiny portion of the more than 50,000 cargo ships that ply the oceans today, which deliver 90 percent of the world's traded goods.
The market for green methanol is also in its infancy, and there is no guarantee that the new fuel will be made in sufficient quantities -- or at the right price -- to power the vast fleet of cargo ships operating worldwide.
Shipping is surprisingly efficient: Transporting a good by container ship halfway around the world produces far less climate-warming gas than trucking it across the United States.
That's true in part because of the scale of modern cargo vessels. The biggest container ships today are larger than aircraft carriers. Each one is able to carry more than 20,000 metal containers, which would stretch for 75 miles if placed in a row.
That incredible efficiency has lowered the cost of transport and enabled the modern consumer lifestyle, allowing retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Ikea and Home Depot to offer a vast suite of products at a fraction of their historical cost.
Yet that easy consumption has come at the price of a warmer and dirtier planet. In addition to affecting the atmosphere, ships burning fossil fuel also spew out pollutants that reduce the life expectancy of the large percentage of the world's people who live near ports, said Teresa Bui, policy director for climate at Pacific Environment, an environmental organization.
That pollution was particularly bad during the Covid-19 pandemic, when supply chain bottlenecks caused ships to pile up outside of the Port of Los Angeles, producing pollution equivalent to nearly 100,000 big rigs per day, she said.
"They have been under regulated for decades," Ms. Bui said of the shipping industry.
Some shipping companies have tried to cut emissions in recent years and comply with new global pollution standards by fueling their vessels with liquefied natural gas. Yet environmental groups, and some shipping executives, say that adopting another fossil fuel that contributes to climate change has been a move in the wrong direction.
Maersk and other shipping companies now see greener fuels such as methanol, ammonia and hydrogen as the most promising path for the industry. Maersk is trying to cut its carbon emissions to zero by 2040, and is pouring billion of dollars into cleaner fuels, along with other investors. But making the switch -- even to methanol, the most commercially viable of those fuels today -- is no easy feat.
Switching to methanol requires building new ships, or retrofitting old ones, with different engines and fuel storage systems. Global ports must install new infrastructure to fuel the vessels when they dock.
Perhaps most crucially, an entire industry still needs to spring up to produce green methanol, which is in demand from airlines and factory owners as well as from shipping carriers.
Methanol, which is used to make chemicals and plastics as well as fuel, is typically produced using coal, oil or natural gas. Green methanol can be made in far more environmentally friendly ways by using renewable energy and carbon captured from the atmosphere or siphoned from landfills, cow and pig manure, or other bio waste.
But the world today does not yet produce much green methanol. Maersk has committed to using only sustainably produced methanol, but if other shipping companies end up using methanol fuel made with coal or oil, that will be no better for the environment.
Ahmed El-Hoshy, the chief executive of OCI Global, which makes methanol from natural gas and greener sources like landfill gas, said companies today were producing "infinitesimally small volumes" of green methanol using renewable energy.
"Companies haven't done much in our industry yet quite frankly," he said. "It's all hype."
Fuel producers still need to master the technology to build these projects, he said. And in order to finance them they need buyers who are willing to commit to long-term contracts for green fuel, which can be three to five times as expensive as conventional fuel.
Maersk has signed contracts with fuel providers including OCI and European Energy, which is building in Denmark what will be the world's largest plant producing methanol with renewable electricity. The shipping company already has clients like Amazon and Volvo that are willing to pay more to have their goods transported with green fuels, in order to reduce their own carbon footprints.
But many other companies are not yet willing to pay the necessary cost for greener technologies, Mr. El-Hoshy said.
The missing piece, said Mr. El-Hoshy and others in the shipping and methanol industries, is regulation that would help level the playing field between companies trying to clean up their emissions and those still burning dirtier fuels.
The European Union is ushering in rules that encourage ships to decarbonize, including new subsidies for green fuels and penalties for fossil fuel use. The United States is also spurring new investments in green fuel production and more modern ports through generous domestic spending programs.
But proponents say the key to a green transition in the shipping sector are global rules that are pending through the International Maritime Organization, the United Nations body that regulates global shipping.
The organization has long received heavy criticism for its lagging efforts on climate. This summer, it adopted a more ambitious target: eliminating the global shipping industry's greenhouse gas emissions "by or around" 2050.
To get there, nations have promised to agree on a legally binding way to regulate emissions by the end of 2025, which they would put into effect in 2027.
Yet countries have yet to agree on what kind of regulation to use. They are debating whether to adopt a new standard for cleaner fuels, new taxes per ton of greenhouse gas emitted or some kind of mix of tools.
Some developing countries, and nations that export low-value goods like farm products, say that strict regulation would raise shipping costs and be economically harmful.
Proponents of the regulation -- including Maersk -- say it's necessary to avoid penalizing those who are trying to clean up the business, and provide certainty about the industry's direction.
"There has to be an economic mechanism by which you level the playing field so that people are incentivized and not punished for using low-carbon fuels," said John Butler, the chief executive of the World Shipping Council, which represents container carriers including Maersk.
"Then you can invest with some confidence," he added.
Still, Maersk acknowledges that green methanol is unlikely to be the final solution. Experts say that the fuel's reliance on finite sources of waste, like corn husks and cow manure, mean there will not be enough to power the entire global shipping fleet.
In an interview, Vincent Clerc, the chief executive of Maersk, said that the entire maritime sector was unlikely to ever be powered predominantly by methanol. But Maersk had no regrets about moving some of its fleet from fossil fuels to methanol now, then adopting new technologies as they become available, he said.
"This marks a real systemic change for this sector," Mr. Clerc said, gesturing toward the vessel piled high with 20-foot containers in front of him.
Eric Leveridge, the climate campaign manager for Pacific Environment, said his group was glad that Maersk and other shipping companies were moving toward more sustainable fuels. But the organization is still concerned that "it is more for optics and that the impact is potentially being exaggerated," he said.
"When it comes down to it, even if there is this investment, there's still a lot of heavy fuel oil ships on the water," he said.

Notes From the Buy Nothing Life: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Borrowing the style of Joan Didion's "The White Album," a writer considers an online gifting hub where people try to give away unwanted stuff.
1. We post on Buy Nothing in order to give. A frog, kissed just once, could be a prince. A sow's ear upcycled, a silken satchel. One man's trash may be another's "lucky futon."
In today's Buy Nothing feed: a retro keyboard "up for grabs" gets 25 likes. Or, a retro keyboard is the one you've been searching for your whole life. Or, a retro keyboard is junk and should be disposed of in an ethical manner.
Why do we browse, and offer up? Because we are alone in the Zoom room, because we are desperate to prowl the bowels of a neighbor's garage, because we could really use a lucky futon. And so we look for the sermon in the words "gently used," for the neighborly discourse in spreading our castoffs around the subdivision and, especially if we are writers, for the chance to craft lively, self-vanquishing prose in praise of the pregnancy test remaining from a pack of two ("Won't make that mistake again!") or a tottering Ikea Kura bed ("Yours if you can get it down my stairs!").
I am talking about a time when I was living in a small midcentury house in a part of Los Angeles that could now be described as a "senseless-gifting" neighborhood. So insensate was the giving, it was Sensodyne, and yes I am referring here to the toothpaste. Three sample-sized tubes collected at three dental visits spaced six to twelve months apart. Three tubes that I personally made available "if anybody has a use." Yes, the tubes were expired, but "probably still fine," I said. A practical CVS find, unexpired, for about $ 5.
Moments after posting I was besieged with responses from people who were "interested," and "VERY interested," asking, "Would you be willing to split up the lot?" Seventeen in all. Seventeen "able to come by today." Seventeen wanting to "take those off your hands." Why do people want these things? You might ask that. I never ask.
I placed the tubes in a bag, tucked it into the curve of my front staircase and closed the gate. My dog paced at the sound of footfall, the contactless pickup, but I did not gaze through the Levolors.
2. During this period I also offered up what were to me items of at least modest value: a brand-new Bluetooth speaker, a set of four stemless wine glasses, a lovely original painting that could be great if the battered frame was replaced. It should be clear that these offerings were made by someone who wanted to give, someone who prized connection, someone determined to play the game.
I spent what seemed to my husband an eccentric amount of time checking for responses. Beyond a DM about wanting the old frame should I end up "chucking the painting," there were none.
3. In a Notes app, I kept a running list of things claimed on my local Buy Nothing feed. It read like an absurdist's notebook: used Ziploc bags (washed & dried), an abundance of disposable ice packs, three varieties of onion jellies, a food dehydrator ("used just once, when I encapsulated my placenta") and something called "rainbow unicorn shooter."
What I neglected to include on my list were the online interactions themselves, which may have held more value than the items.
4. FLASH GIVE: "Dog bed, like new. Pickup ASAP"
MM: I'd love the dog bed! Can I come now?
BR: Sure! MM: Thanks! Address?
BR: Yes!
MM: OK, ready for address:)
BR: It's out on the driveway!
MM: Great! Just need address ...
BR 1621 LaRoma
MM: Hmm ... not seeing that in Maps. You mean LaLoma?
BR: You coming? I get the feeling you don't really want it
MM: No, I do! Did you mean to say LaLoma or LaRoma?
BR: Love Roma! Lived there one summer. You going?
MM: Ha, no! Do you LIVE on LaLoma?
BR: Yes, sorry! Silly autocorrect! I see you got the dog bed. Enjoy!
MM: Wait, I don't have it! Is it gone??
BR: It's gone!
This is an exchange I had with a neighbor who may or may not have ever had a dog bed to give. I recall commandeering my Subaru to the driveway on LaLoma nonetheless and, as the motor idled, observing an almost imperceptible sway of the Levolors.
5. It was about this time in my life that I became aware of Buy Nothing Project bylaws. "It is up to the giver how they wish to give: first-come-first-serve or use a raffle when several members are interested." Many neighbors operated on what I later recognized as raffle theory, and so, during this time, did I.
Names were chosen from proverbial hats. Names were chosen from actual hats. Names were chosen from a "random name picker" online. Or, would it be "interesting" if the chooser employed a children's counting rhyme? Eeny, meeny, miny, moe ...
This singsong, which required neither hat nor app, had on me the effect of brisk corporal isolation, an ironic effect of a gifting community. I remember I was drinking a Spindrift alone on the terrace. The dog paced inside, having nowhere to lie down. "Toosie Slide" played on Alexa. I ate a tortilla chip.
6. "In May of this year patient experienced sensitivity and roughness to the touch, #25 lingual. A thorough dental evaluation revealed enamel sheered off at gumline. She was placed on 1 cart. Septocaine 4% w/ epinephrine 1:100,000 prior ML composite restoration."
The patient to whom this dental report refers is me. The damage may or may not have been caused by an errant tortilla chip. It may or may not have been aggravated by bruxism. Ongoing sensitivity may or may not occur. Recommendation: "Try Sensodyne."
The toothpaste's potassium ions hyperpolarize the nerve to halt firing. In light of chemical desensitization, the following sense emerged: the keyboard got 25 likes. Tooth #25 was chipped by eating a chip. Tooth #25 is a mandibular central incisor, a bottom center tooth. In other words: the center didn't hold. The dentist admonished that, failing restoration, the tooth would "die and turn dark." Nobody wanted a Bluetooth speaker. The woman who now needed Sensodyne had just given hers away.
7. I once gifted an HVAC filter (in original packaging) to a man who claimed he never won anything. "I'm so happy!" he said. The correspondence was digital but I sensed he was nearly in tears. The next day I saw a post by the same man, giving the same filter away.
8. Another FLASH GIVE: "Fortune cookie, crushed, plastic sealed. SPOILER ALERT: Fortune is 'Let sleeping dogs lie.' If multiple interests, raffle at 10 a.m."
9. I have known, since participating in a neighborhood gift economy, very little about its givers and takers. I do know that a raffle was held and the cookie was claimed. I know that the new recipient of a half-full bottle of body lotion smelling, for its original owner, "too strongly of lavender" posted that Buy Nothing had restored her "faith in humanity" and she "now understands why people gift online as they do."
Quite often I reflect on the lingering roughness of my central incisor, on onion jellies and repurposed Ziplocs and on the fact that, while sleepy, my dog still has nowhere to lie, but I do not yet understand why people gift online as they do.

Full text: The exotic-tasting fruit, though native to North America, is hard to come by. But in one man's backyard near the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, dozens fall each year.
When Reza Farzan wakes up, the first thing he does is check on his pawpaws. He is a 70-year-old bookkeeper with a full workload, but September is pawpaw season, and he is waiting for his fruit to drop. It will -- in its own time.
Thirty years ago, when he moved into an unassuming mint-green townhouse in Brooklyn, he planted two baby pawpaws -- a tree it's safe to say that few on his block, if not in the entire borough, had ever heard of. What followed was a decades-long exercise in patience and devotion, in service of an overlooked plant that's all the more charming for its stubbornness and singularity.
If you've ever sampled an American custard apple, a prairie banana or a hillbilly mango, then you've eaten a pawpaw. Despite occurring naturally up and down the East Coast (and a small slice of Canada) and being North America's largest native edible fruit, the pawpaw is criminally undersung and difficult to source.
The fruit has a brief season (generally limited to September, with some regional variation) and a shelf life of only three to five days. It bruises easily, making it a poor candidate for conventional grocery stores. If there were such a thing as an anticapitalist fruit, the pawpaw, commonly foraged in the wild and inherently resistant to commodification, might qualify.
In spite of these quirks -- or perhaps because of them -- the pawpaw enjoys a small but devoted following. For a plant whose preferred growing region is the temperate zone of North America, the pawpaw is an uncannily exotic-tasting delicacy, a far-flung cousin of the tropical soursop, or guanábana. Its mottled green skin conceals a creamy yellow pulp that tastes of banana and mango; locavore-minded chefs alchemize it into ice cream, beer, bread and tasting-menu fodder -- that is, when it's not simply eaten raw with a spoon.
The exact number of pawpaw trees in New York City is not on any official record, but there aren't many. There are none in Central Park, at least not as far as Central Park's arborists know. There are seven pawpaw trees among the 250 acres of the New York Botanical Garden, and several more in the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, but picking fruit is strictly forbidden on the gardens' grounds.
Mr. Farzan's narrow backyard in Brooklyn's South Slope neighborhood is a lush, if slightly chaotic, oasis. There are Fuji apples, Meyer lemons, figs, peonies and avocados -- although that's far from a complete census of all that grows there. An arsenal of shovels and rakes stands at attention among an extensive supply of empty pots of varied provenance, including former yogurt tubs and soy milk cartons. When cold weather hits, vulnerable plantings are relocated to Mr. Farzan's D.I.Y. greenhouse, featuring a shower-curtain roof, an Ikea-bag door and strings of Christmas lights.
The property is also home to a grapevine rescued from outside a neighborhood bistro that closed during the Covid lockdown. There is a tulip that has blossomed for three days a year, every year, for the last 30 years. But there's no mistaking the star attractions.
After buying his house in 1992, Mr. Farzan specifically sought to plant a native fruit tree. He researched pawpaws at the library and purchased seedlings from a nursery in Oregon, one of only two or three pawpaw sources he could find in the entire country. He had never tasted a pawpaw, but no matter.
"I had no hesitation to order the trees and become a devotee," he said. "This was exceptionally rewarding for me, to grow something that I couldn't get anywhere else."
Those humble seedlings are now trees standing about 30 feet tall. Pawpaw branches have breached the trellis fences on either side of Mr. Farzan's yard. (The neighbors borrow his clippers to trim them.) The trees have weathered 100-plus-degree summer days, below-zero winter nights, and even Hurricane Sandy -- though one of them has listed slightly to one side ever since. Before the storm, he braced the trees together with a support strap that still surrounds them; a birdhouse hangs from it now. A few years ago, a family of mourning doves made their nest among the branches.
Growing pawpaws, even under the best of circumstances, requires patience. The trees take at least three years to produce fruit, sometimes as long as 10. Once their season finally arrives, pawpaws picked too early will never satisfactorily ripen; Mr. Farzan waits until fruit falls on its own. "Some people may say they don't want to bother with all that," he said. "Odds are so much against them if they are narrow-minded."
Mr. Farzan estimated he consumes up to 100 pawpaws in a typical year, some of which he incorporates into omelets, rice, smoothies and other dishes. He gives away another 30 or so to friends, and occasionally sells the fruit that remains -- for pickup only, at around $ 10 apiece.
He acknowledged that the fruit was an acquired taste -- assuming one could be persuaded to taste it at all. "Very few people have tried it, and they're reluctant to, because they say, 'Well, I haven't seen it in a supermarket,"' he said.
Mr. Farzan had no intention of starting a business when he planted his pawpaws, but after discovering Etsy in 2018, he began selling pawpaw seeds ( $ 20 for about 30) and already-sprouted seedlings ( $ 45 each). Under the name MintmanGoods, Mr. Farzan has shipped pawpaw seeds to approximately 150 customers across the United States, as well as in Canada, Europe and Africa.
"My trees are spreading around the world," he said. "It's a source of pride for me as an American because the pawpaw is a native American tree."
Mr. Farzan has become something of an evangelist, an active member of seven pawpaw-centric groups on Facebook, where he gladly shares his wisdom with newcomers. Once the plants reach maturity, he says, pawpaw growers will find them to be hardy, naturally resistant to both pests and the effects of climate change, and altogether low maintenance.
Mr. Farzan has yet to meet another local gardener who cultivates pawpaws, but he is eager for the city to embrace its wild roots. "This is a native tree, and New York City should be proud to have it around," he said. He has repeatedly contacted the Parks Department to inquire about donating pawpaw seedlings to a municipal green space. So far, the department has declined. Dan Kastanis, a Parks Department spokesman, said the agency does accept tree donations, but that it is unable to accommodate all that are put forward; he said it would revisit Mr. Farzan's "generous offer" in the future. Two pawpaw trees were planted earlier this year at a city-owned community garden in East Harlem.
In the meantime, Mr. Farzan's self-described "pawpaw mission" forges on. Last week, he donated 14 seedlings to Red Hook Farms, an urban farming and youth-empowerment program in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn. "We're excited to grow our pawpaw orchard and hopefully one day enjoy with our teen farmers the fruits of this somewhat elusive native," said Saara Nafici, director of Red Hook Farms.
Mr. Farzan also recently posted on the "Park Slope Together" Facebook group to offer free pawpaw seedlings to local gardeners. So far, more than 20 neighbors have expressed interest, to his delight. With a little luck and a lot of patience, within a few years, Mr. Farzan's backyard might not host the only pawpaw harvest in town.
Ginia Bellafante's Big City column will return.

More Storage Space for Stuff Where Dreams Are Made: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: There are ways to make room for storage in even the smallest bedrooms -- and those without any closets at all. Here's how.
Even if you're not a fashionista, your bedroom needs to hold a lot. Clothing takes up space. So do books and jewelry, not to mention things like extra sheets and blankets.
That's why "storage is critical," said Shannon Eddings, an interior designer based in Austin, Texas -- especially true in small homes, where there are few places to hide clutter.
As Ms. Eddings noted, "Not everyone has big closets." And in truly compact bedrooms, there may be no closets at all. But there are plenty of ways to add storage to even the smallest bedrooms. Here are the tricks that she and other interior designers use to maximize every bit of space.
Add Cabinetry Around the Bed
The bed is usually the largest object in the room, and the space above and beside it often goes to waste. To make the most of these areas, one solution is to build a do-it-all headboard wall with integrated storage.
Regan Baker, an interior designer in San Francisco, has designed custom cabinetry for exactly that purpose. "We'll do floor-to-ceiling cabinetry just to maximize every inch of the room," she said.
For a home in Redwood City, Calif., she designed a millwork unit with cantilevered night stands, integrated reading lights, a recessed shelf behind the bed for storing books and art, and cabinets with doors overhead. On the sides, the unit has taller closet-like storage compartments, with a full-length mirror mounted on the back of one of the doors.
Sure, the unit eats up some floor space. But by incorporating so many features into a single piece, you don't need many other pieces of furniture, Ms. Baker said. And because it's a beautifully crafted piece, "it's the focal point."
Create a Sleeping Nook
Another way to add built-in cabinetry and shelving is with a sleeping nook. Ms. Eddings designed a lilac-colored sleeping nook for a house in Austin that includes integrated shelving and lighting behind the pillows, closet-like cabinetry to one side and a trundle bed under the main twin-size mattress.
"My desire was to do something fun and exciting and maximize color, while providing additional storage," Ms. Eddings said.
In a truly space-constrained bedroom, there is also the option of a Murphy bed. In one project, Ms. Eddings designed a floor-to-ceiling storage wall that included cabinets with doors, shelves and a Murphy bed hidden behind panels that look like doors. The bedroom now doubles as a home office.
"We're doing that more and more," she said, "because it provides a lot of floor space in a small room."
Use a Dresser as a Night Stand
If you're not ready to invest in custom cabinetry, a simpler approach is to use furniture that serves multiple functions.
Most night stands offer a minimal amount of storage, with a shallow drawer or two. But a larger chest of drawers can work as an alternative. "I love using a chest or dresser as a night stand, because it gives you a lot more storage," said Emily Spanos, the founder of Emily June Designs, in Houston.
It also offers a larger surface on top to hold a lamp, books and other bedside accessories. Sometimes, Ms. Spanos puts a pair of matching dressers on either side of the bed; other times, she uses mismatched pieces for an eclectic look.
Just make sure the top of the dresser is low enough to be easily reachable from bed.
"I always look at the height of the bed first," Ms. Spanos said, and "then select the night stands or chests."
Use the Space Under the Bed
The space beneath can be used for more than collecting dust or hiding the boogeyman. Storage beds with mechanisms that can tip the mattress up and out of the way to provide access to the space below are widely available, from companies like Flou, West Elm and Ikea.
Another variation on a storage bed is one with built-in drawers that slide or roll out. Many furniture companies make such pieces, and some designers create their own.
Ms. Baker has designed bunk beds with storage drawers built into the base. Yvonne McFadden, an interior designer in Atlanta, designed a bed with a large rollout drawer for a home in Roswell, Ga. The drawer currently holds a trundle bed, but could be used to store other items.
For the same bedroom, Ms. McFadden designed drawer-like wooden boxes on casters that tuck neatly under a console. "The closet was minimal," she said. "So we wanted to make storage fun and easy, and make sure there was plenty of it."
Build a Better Closet
Don't overlook the storage space you already have. Your closet may not be very efficient, especially if it's set up with only a hanging rod and shelf. To make the most of a closet, Ms. Spanos suggested taking stock of everything you need to store and then outfitting the interior with a system that gives everything its place.
"I always measure my clients' clothing," she said, "to make sure we put shelves and hang rods at the right heights."
That might mean installing two levels of hanging rods for shorter items and numerous shelves that can hold shoes and bags. Ms. Spanos often uses Elfa products from the Container Store, which are adjustable, so the components can be repositioned as needed.
Sometimes, she changes the shape of the closet itself. In a compact bedroom in a Houston apartment, Ms. Spanos combined two inadequate closets to create a single storage space running across the wall, concealing it with sliding antique Chinese screens that double as a decorative feature. "Then we used an Elfa system inside that closet to really maximize the space," she said.
Ashley Macuga, the principal designer of Collected Interiors, a firm in San Carlos, Calif., once removed the doors and contents of a closet to add built-in drawers and cabinets inside.
"Instead of awkward doors, where it was difficult to access everything, we decided to take them down and do a full built-in," Ms. Macuga said. "The drawers are where they have most of their clothes, so that also allowed us to avoid a dresser in the room."
Add Containers
Not every solution requires building or buying big pieces of furniture. One of the easiest ways to increase storage is by adding large-scale containers.
Ms. Macuga has four children who share a bedroom at her house near Lake Tahoe. To create enough space for her family's ski gear, she put large wicker trunks from Ballard Designs at the foot of each bed. "Those would also be great for blankets, extra sets of sheets, toys and all kinds of other things," she said.
Ms. Baker and Ms. Spanos often use woven baskets to store any number of things, including sheets and books. Ms. Baker likes to tuck large baskets beneath night stands, where they're out of the way but always ready to conceal clutter. Ms. Spanos uses African baskets with lids that hide what's inside.
"We like using baskets in lots of different rooms," she said. "Whether it's a bedroom, a kids' room or even a living room, they offer a lot of extra storage."

Full text: On top of caring for dozens of adoptable cats, Anne Levin once raised an orphaned baby subway rat. She named him Alexander Hamilton.
Anne Levin never knows what Sunday will bring. When you're the executive director of the Brooklyn Bridge Animal Welfare Coalition -- which provides animal rescuers with veterinary, foster and adoptive support -- and a co-founder of its affiliated cat cafe, anything's possible.
She could be responding to a rescue or veterinary emergency or receiving kittens or rabbits from Animal Care Centers of New York City in Manhattan. She might be preparing for feline medical procedures -- limb amputations, eye removals, an infected tooth. Or she might be running a "spay-a-thon," dispatching surgical teams to clinics around the city.
"We've done as many as 200 cats over a weekend," said Ms. Levin, who lives in Brooklyn Heights. "But we can't do them too often, because they're exhausting."
Ms. Levin, 49, had been volunteering part-time at B.B.A.W.C. when she came up with the idea for a cat cafe. "At the time, rescuers were keeping cats in their homes and holding adoption events in cages on the sidewalk in front of pet stores," she said. She envisioned a "big foster home" where adoptable cats could sit in laps, leap on furniture and roam freely while their potential forever families got to know them.
In May 2016, the Brooklyn Cat Cafe opened in a storefront in Brooklyn Heights. In 2021, it added a low-cost spay-neuter clinic for cats, rabbits and domesticated rats. The organization has since performed more than 4,500 surgeries.
Customers can purchase food for the animals (and bottled drinks for themselves) and hang out with as many as 40 cats, which mingle with the other animals -- rabbits, rats, guinea pigs, dogs and, once, a chinchilla -- that are all up for adoption.
"Everyone gets along," Ms. Levin said. "Mostly."
ON THE WATERFRONT I am an introvert, and I deal with so many people during the week that I like to spend a lot of alone time on the weekends. I live alone, so this is easy. I was planning to do a marathon in Reykjavik, Iceland, in August. I'm not a naturally athletic person; I just wanted to complete one just to say I did it. I was getting up around 5 or 6 a.m. to run. I kind of ran along the waterfront so I didn't have to deal with traffic. I enjoy the peace and quiet and solitude of an early morning run. Unfortunately, I got a stress fracture in July, so I started swimming at a local Y.M.C.A. I hope to get to Iceland next summer.
HEALTHY TREATS One of the best things about working with small animals is I get to buy a bunch of healthy foods and feel very healthy, even though I'm not the one consuming it. I typically buy from the green grocery in Brooklyn, and fill an Ikea bag with peppers, cucumbers, lettuce and carrots. The cats get so many treats from visitors, but the other animals don't.
I do a little tour around the cafe to make sure that all the small animals get attention. They're all fed and cleaned daily, of course, but I like to say hi. I don't want to have favorites, but I have better relationships with some animals more than others, so I visit them. The rabbits and guinea pigs are really fun. I get a lot of pleasure from feeding them.
PLANNING AHEAD Then I typically do paperwork. It sounds really boring, but we have surgeries during the week that I need to schedule. I'll open up opportunities if we have the space.
DINNER PREP I've been trying to eat a better diet because of running and swimming, so I try to buy stuff and make it myself instead of ordering in. I usually cook simple protein, like salmon, so I'll have it during the week when I'm much more inclined to be lazy and not cook. Depending on how social I'm feeling, I might see a friend, or veg at home with a book or watch TV.
CAT CALLS Sometimes someone will drop a cat off and I'll need to go in. Or an animal might be sick and I need to see what's going on. Sometimes we'll have cats recovering from surgery in the clinic. This past weekend we held a small animal surgery clinic, where we neutered rabbits from the city shelter, two rescue guinea pigs and two mice that we're holding for adoption.
A lot of times I have animals to take care of. I've gone on the B.Q.E. to rescue a couple of cats. It's not my typical Sunday and I hope it never becomes that. Unfortunately, the cats do not schedule emergencies appropriately.

Turning a Tale Into a Spectacle: [Review]

Full text: With its home theater under renovation, the Komische Oper branches out, beginning with Henze's "The Raft of the Medusa" at Tempelhof Airport.
The 1816 wreck of the French frigate Medusa, from which just a handful of passengers survived after nearly two weeks on a makeshift raft, was still very recent history when Théodore Géricault painted the scene.
Exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1819, "The Raft of the Medusa" divided those who saw it, especially because the tragedy had stirred anger at the restored Bourbon monarchy.
In 1968, when Hans Werner Henze premiered his oratorio of the same title, it was polarizing too: The performance was canceled when the police intervened after fights broke out among audience and artists over leftist posters and banners hoisted in the concert hall in Hamburg, Germany.
On Saturday, though, when the Komische Oper of Berlin staged the work in and around an enormous pool built by the company in a hangar at the disused Tempelhof Airport, "The Raft of the Medusa" seduced more than it polarized. It is an ambitiously scaled, superbly performed, conceptually clever, politically adroit yet emotionally cool spectacle.
Directed by Tobias Kratzer and conducted by Titus Engel, the show, which runs through Oct. 3, is most notable as the rare venture outside a home theater for a major opera house.
It comes at a period of transition for Berlin's three important companies. (Yes, three -- a legacy of the city's divided era and of Germany's commitment to culture.) The Deutsche Oper and Berlin State Opera both face changes of artistic director and chief conductor. And the Komische Oper is beginning a multiyear renovation of its base in the center of town.
While the Komische Oper will be largely spending this time at the Schiller Theater -- as the State Opera did during its renovations some years ago -- the company is also taking the opportunity to put on productions in less traditional spaces. Each nomadic season will open at the Tempelhof hangar, which is part of a complex built by the Nazis in the 1930s; most of the old airport is now a park and, more recently, an emergency refugee camp.
"The Raft of the Medusa," with its sprawling orchestra and chorus, including an eclectic battery of percussion and a boys' choir, doesn't feel lost in the huge space, even if -- with just three soloists -- its storytelling is essentially intimate.
Henze dedicated the piece to Che Guevara, who had died the previous fall, and the final line, spoken to a rhythm drawn from the protest chant "Ho-Ho-Ho Chi Minh," foretells revolution: "But the survivors returned to the world, instructed by reality, feverish to overthrow it." Ernst Schnabel's text toggles between poetic and starkly journalistic.
A character named Charon, after Greek mythology's ferryman of the underworld, narrates the wreck of the ship and the horrifying days that followed. Death is a dreamily alluring soprano; Jean-Charles, an agonized representative of those aboard the raft.
The chorus of the living, dying and dead solemnly intones and angrily cries out. Henze's orchestra, too, is capable of explosive power, but mostly the score restrains these grand forces to a stunned, wary quiet, played by the Komische Oper's orchestra under Engel with remarkable sensuality and subtlety given the necessity of amplification.
At Tempelhof, members of the chorus are unidentified at the start as they sit among the audience of 1,600, which is arranged in two blocks facing each other across the pool, with the orchestra on a third side of the quadrangle. The choristers, wearing black and white clothes, begin singing from their seats and eventually walk down to the pool.
As the Medusa's voyage begins, Kratzer has the performers frolic in the calf-high water as they play with inflatable rings. (The simple, effective pool set is by Rainer Sellmaier, with Olaf Freese's lighting conveying the harshness of both night and day.)
Rather than early-19th-century sailors, these people suggest contemporary bourgeois beachgoers, much like the oblivious leisure-seekers of the recent opera-installation "Sun & Sea," too focused on tanning to perceive rising seas or the migrants lost in them. Jean-Charles (the forthright baritone Günter Papendell) here might be an accountant or lawyer.
Benches come together to form the raft and are occasionally detached to use as platforms around the pool. Death (the soprano Gloria Rehm, her voice never too harsh or hard) is here a glamorous diva in a sparkling, skintight black gown. As they expire, the choristers trudge out of the water and back to their seats, so we in the audience end up eerily immersed in the ghostly sound of the afterlife.
In both Gericault's painting and Kratzer's production, a lone Black figure is a focal point. Unlike the painting's heroic savior, waving red fabric to get the attention of a ship on the horizon, the staging's Charon, a Black woman (the resonant mezzo-soprano Idunnu Münch), is a pained, helpless witness: an aid worker in a rowboat too small to save anyone.
With the production already depicting the bourgeoisie transformed into desperate refugees, forced to undergo agonies they usually ignore, this casting decision furthers the sense of a reversal of the standard order of things, in which whites look on (or not) as people of color suffer.
It's an intriguing decision. But in attempting to mix realism and stylization, Kratzer tends too naturalistic. As the shipwrecked passengers first scramble en masse toward the raft, splashing violently in the water, the sight is powerful. Later on, though, the survivors' reaching, grasping hands and twitching bodies come off as strenuous cliché, lessening rather than increasing the intensity and depth of feeling. It's not necessary to see an actor dressed as the Jesus that some of the poor souls hallucinate in their hunger, thirst and fear.
But near the end, the hangar's tremendous door, near the side of the pool opposite the orchestra, slowly slides open. The temperature drops as the fresh night air pours in, and you get a tiny, terrifying glimpse of the relief that people in such a situation might find in death. The survivors emerge from the pool and walk out toward the dark, vast expanse of Tempelhof Field, led by an emergency van.
It would have been obvious, even without the van, that this forlorn procession was meant to evoke the path taken by the migrants who have been housed at Tempelhof over the past decade. But the opening of the door was a true, visceral dramatic coup, a fitting climax for a staging with the heft to feel worthy of a remarkable space.

What's Opera Without a Brewery and an Airport Hangar?: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: It was high noon in a disused hangar at Tempelhof airport, near the center of Berlin, and the Komische Oper was troubleshooting its new swimming pool.
The director Tobias Kratzer, speaking into a microphone, stopped a group of extras and chorus members during a rehearsal of Hans Werner Henze's "The Raft of the Medusa," which will open the Komische Oper's season on Saturday. And the raft, made up of benches designed to look like they're floating in the water, was refusing to close on cue.
This hangar, part of a complex built by Hitler's regime in the 1930s, has been used for art installations and sports since the airport closed nearly 16 years ago. Now, it has been outfitted with 1,600 seats and a 15-inch-deep swimming pool stage.
And while the Komische Oper, one of Berlin's three major opera companies, embarks on a multiyear renovation of its theater, the hangar is the first of many sites -- including a temporary base at the disused Schiller Theater, a former brewery and a tent outside the city hall -- where it will mount performances.
"The Raft of the Medusa," an oratorio, was inspired by the 1819 painting of the same name by Théodore Géricault, which was itself based on the 1816 wreck of the French naval ship Medusa. Lifeboats were used by officers and priests, and the roughly 150 enlisted men were left on a hastily built raft made from what could be salvaged of the ship. After a few miles of being towed by the lifeboats, the raft was cut loose by officers looking to save themselves. For 13 days, the survivors floated adrift with little food and water, eventually resorting to cannibalism to stay alive. Only 15 were eventually rescued, and by accident. The events became a symbol of the recently restored French monarchy's indifference to the masses.
Henze, who chose the subject matter for the oratorio in the heated political year of 1968, subtitled the piece "Requiem for Che Guevara" and scored its ending with the rhythm of the protest chant "Ho-Ho-Ho Chi Minh." At its premiere, students hung Che Guevara banners from the conductor's podium; communist and anarchist groups raised red and black flags, and fought both bourgeois audience members and one another; a choir from West Berlin refused to sing under the red banner; and police violence led to the performance being canceled before it began.
For Kratzer, the piece has political and artistic importance well beyond the 1960s. "It gets more universal year by year," he said. "From a distance from the politics of the day, it can be read as being about the crisis of refugees."
At Tempelhof, the hangars next to the one where the Komische will perform, as well as parts of the airport's tarmac, have been used for refugee housing since 2015.
"The raft can be read as a metaphor for every country which will remain inhabitable after the climate crisis," Kratzer added. "And then it's also a metaphor for man in space, for being on a finite planet in the eternal universe. The further you are away from the concrete scandal of '68, the more all those elements open up."
Starting with "The Raft of the Medusa," each of the next five Komische Oper seasons will open with a large-scale performance in the hangar. That is how long the renovation of the company's house, in the center of Berlin, is expected to take. The building's backstage and many technical systems date from the 1960s; the goal is to renovate and preserve the atmosphere of the 1892 operetta theater while adding modern stage technology and a new wing with accessible lobbies, new rehearsal rooms and dressing rooms.
"The current house is not up to today's standards," Susanne Moser, the company's co-director, said in a German-language interview with her leadership partner, Philipp Bröking. "Thankfully the Berlin Senate has agreed to make a major investment in the Komische Oper, Berlin and the art of opera. And what luck that Berlin has an empty theater, the Schiller Theater, that can be a base for us." (Most performances will take place there.)
Disruptions like this are always expensive, as well as risky. The company -- whose repertory is broad, including musicals, operettas and operas -- sold 90 percent of available tickets last season, and has spent recent years saving money to pay for site-specific performances and a reduction in seats per season during the renovation. And although "The Raft of the Medusa" is hardly standard-issue fare, its six-show run is sold out.
"Our public loves the quality of productions," Moser said, in noting that even revivals get a minimum of four weeks of rehearsals. "They love difference. They want to be surprised." Komische Oper attendees, she added, are likelier to be regulars at a variety of cultural events rather than only opera fans.
Kratzer said in an interview that the scale of the Tempelhof hangar makes it possible to stage the Henze in a representational way. "You can have this image of 154 people on this tiny raft in the water," he said. "On a stage it would always look too big. Here, you can see the scale."
Each singer will be equipped with a microphone. The baritone Günter Papendell, a Komische Oper stalwart who will portray the Everyman sailor Jean-Charles, described in an interview the challenges of swimming, fighting and dancing in the shallow water while keeping a microphone dry.
"If the microphone gets wet, then the tone will cut out, and no one will hear me," Papendell said in a German-language interview. "So I have to be up to my neck in water, do some water acrobatics, and keep everything from here up dry."
The score, however, is gentler to sing than some contemporary music, said the soprano Gloria Rehm, who will portray the mythic character of Death, a siren who tempts the lost sailors to give up and stop fighting to survive. In a German-language interview, she laughed and let loose some spiky coloratura. "It's not like that, but almost bel canto in how it sits in the voice," she added.
Bringing Henze's oratorio into the present involved rethinking the role of the narrator, named Charon, after the Greek demigod who brings souls from the land of the living to the land of the dead. Usually cast with a patrician (and white) actor, here it is played by Idunnu Münch, a mezzo-soprano of color; the audience will see something of a reversal of the typical sight of a white narrator describing people of color in crisis.
In a German-language interview, Münch said that her reading of her part would emphasize its musical qualities. "There are many places in the score where speech is rhythmic, and many places where specific pitches are marked," she added, "and I've never heard them on recordings."
Kratzer has directed the character to be less of a passive observer. "Less Brechtian," he said. "As soon as you do it scenically, she can't be neutral." Singing much of the time from a small lifeboat rowing around the wrecked raft, the character will be in the familiar position of witnessing disaster and feeling unable to help.
"Empathy alone is not enough," Kratzer said. "She would love to help, but there are more than a hundred on the raft and even five would sink her lifeboat. This is the tragic dilemma."
Despite the risk of a wet microphone, Papendell described his hopes for "The Raft of the Medusa" and the Komische Oper's coming nomadic period with a laugh and one word: "Revolution!"
"It's good to leave our home behind for a while and play in some other places. In a place like this," he added, gesturing around the hangar, "to be able to make music theater -- I feel unbelievably happy."

California Legislation Would Require Large Companies to Report Emissions: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Under the measure, companies would have to publicly report their climate pollution. Gov. Gavin Newsom's office would not say whether he plans to sign the bill.
The California Legislature this week passed a landmark bill that would require major companies to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, a move with national and global repercussions in governments' efforts to fight climate change.
A spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, declined on Wednesday to say whether he would sign the bill.
If enacted, about 5,000 companies that do business in California would be compelled to report the amount of greenhouse gas pollution that is directly emitted by their operations, and also indirect emissions from things like employee travel, waste disposal and supply chains.
The law would apply to public and private businesses that make more than $ 1 billion annually and operate in California. But because it is the world's fifth-largest economy, California often sets the trend for the nation.
Many of the affected businesses would include oil and gas giants like Chevron, major financial institutions like Wells Fargo and global brands like Apple. The companies would be required to disclose all their emissions starting in 2027.
The California legislation goes beyond a measure proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would require only publicly-traded companies to disclose their emissions. That proposal, which has yet to be finalized, is facing strong opposition from conservatives and business groups.
Opponents of the California measure said compliance would be expensive and onerous, particularly the requirement that businesses accurately track and measure all emissions. For example, clothing manufacturers worry that they would have to report the emissions associated with growing, weaving and transporting textiles, in addition to reporting the direct emissions from their garment manufacturing plants.
The legislation "is a costly mandate that will negatively impact businesses of all sizes in California and will not directly reduce emissions," said Denise Davis, an executive vice president at the California Chamber of Commerce.
But supporters of disclosure said transparency would nudge corporations to reduce the pollution that is dangerously heating the planet and act as a bulwark against greenwashing, false or exaggerated claims by companies about their efforts to fight climate change. Microsoft, Ikea, Patagonia and several other major companies backed the bill.
"We need the full picture to make the deep emissions cuts that scientists tell us are necessary to avert the worst impacts of climate change," said the lead sponsor of the law, State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco. "These disclosures are simple but transformational," he said. "We need strong transparency to create a level playing field among private and public companies. Once again, California is leading the nation on essential climate action."
Governor Newsom, who has built a national profile in part on his push to make California a global leader in climate policy, has been uncharacteristically quiet about the measure.
While the governor has championed aggressive new climate measures, including $ 54 billion in climate spending, his administration's finance department issued an analysis in July that opposed the emissions reporting legislation. The analysis said the measure would require 12 full-time workers to administer the program and result in costs that were not included in the state's current spending plan.
California has a long history of enacting climate change policies that are later adopted by other states and eventually the federal government. Both the Obama administration and the Biden administration have modeled their regulations to accelerate the use of electric vehicles on policies first enacted in California.
Mr. Newsom has until Oct. 14 to veto the bill or it automatically becomes state law.

Clean Energy on Rise Everywhere Except in Poor Nations: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: A big obstacle is the lack of loans, a subject of intense disagreement between richer and poorer countries. But in Congo, a hard-fought solar investment shows a possible path forward.
The world is racing ahead with enormous investments in renewable energy, for the first time this year plowing more money into solar power than oil.
But the world's poorest countries, mostly in Africa, are effectively priced out of the action by a global lending system that considers them too risky for investment. Only 2 percent of global investment in renewable energy has been in Africa, where nearly a billion people have little or no access to electricity.
It's a paradox, Africa's leaders argue. Clean energy projects would help stabilize their countries and economies, they say, reducing the very risk that investors say they fear. It's an issue that looms large this week at a climate summit in Kenya, as it will at climate talks sponsored by the United Nations later this year in Dubai.
It also preoccupies Archip Lobo, whose company, against the odds, raised $ 70 million in international funds this year -- capping half a decade of effort -- to build solar-powered microgrids in Congo.
"A year ago, we were about halfway to losing hope," Mr. Lobo said. "We were thinking, These lenders all want us to assure them there's no political risk, no security risk. How can you do that in Congo?"
He has lived that risk. At 8, Mr. Lobo was made a refugee. His brothers were forcibly recruited by the army, and other family members were raped.
Yet he also embodies an entrepreneurial spirit that thrives in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mr. Lobo, now 31, got a degree and co-founded a company that roasts some of the delectable coffee that grows in eastern Congo.
While his second company, Nuru -- the word means "light" in Swahili -- is small by global standards, investments like these are important, experts say, because if the pattern of clean energy investment doesn't change, by midcentury more than three-quarters of all carbon dioxide emissions could come from the least-developed countries, whose populations and economies are growing faster than anywhere else.
Like many businessmen across Africa, Mr. Lobo found himself stymied by the price and paucity of electricity. His coffee company relied on just an hour or two of power from a generator fueled by diesel that had to be trucked thousands of miles from ports in Kenya and Tanzania.
He co-founded Nuru to try to solve that problem. It negotiated a partnership with a consortium of philanthropic funds, anchored by the Bezos Earth Fund and the Rockefeller and Ikea foundations, that agreed to put in the majority of the recent funding, which is intended to give Nuru a chance to prove that, rather than being a risky investment, it is an enterprise that can make money and transform the local economy.
"We're trying to use philanthropic money to create proof points to get the market moving and show it's less risky than international lending institutions and private banks think," said Simon Harford, the chief executive of the consortium, known as the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet.
With the money, Nuru will increase its urban microgrids in Congo to four, from one, and be able to produce 13 times as much electricity. The company eventually hopes to provide millions of Congolese with cheaper and more reliable electricity than what is produced by the diesel generators that most now use.
More than 70 million of Congo's 100 million people cannot afford or access electricity. Its population is currently growing faster than new electricity customers are being brought online.
"I pay three times less to Nuru than what I paid for diesel, so you can imagine what it means for my business," said Ezekia Rubona, 27, who runs a shop where people can make photocopies, print banners, upload videos and surf the internet. "That generator, too, it always surged. We would lose machines that way."
While the financing is a major breakthrough for Nuru, the company is receiving it at an interest rate of more than 15 percent, five times as high as interest rates for many renewable energy projects in wealthier countries where companies have easier access to credit. Nuru also can't afford to hire a seasoned chief financial officer. It could barely pay its small team over the years for trying to wrangle an investment that elsewhere in the renewable energy world might seem paltry.
The clincher, said Mr. Lobo, was getting investors to actually come to Congo. That was only made harder by an Ebola epidemic in the region and then Covid-19, as well as unrest that is so persistent it rarely makes global headlines. On the day a New York Times reporter arrived in the city of Goma to visit Nuru's existing microgrid, state security forces killed more than 40 people who were gathering for a protest against the presence of a longstanding U.N. peacekeeping force widely seen as ineffective and a source of corruption.
A day later, Goma was back to its usual bustle.
"Investors are human beings too," Mr. Lobo said. "Once you come here and see the hunger for energy, the potential for growth, you can finally look past the risks and see what a transformative investment this will be, a real, genuine business opportunity."
What African leaders gathering in Nairobi, Kenya, this week for the first-ever Africa Climate Summit hope to do is persuade global investors and multinational development banks like the International Monetary Fund that African companies need not only more deals like Nuru's but also better ones.
There's a term, "concessional," for certain kinds of international loans that are designed to help less wealthy international borrowers. The idea is that loans might have below-market interest rates or grace periods for repayment.
Nuru's loan is anything but concessional.
But the idea is to prime the pump for bigger investments. "The multinational banks are the ones who need to be the mobilizers-in-chief," said Chavi Meattle, an expert on climate finance in Africa at the Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit research group. "They've made promises to reform, but they are not following through fast enough."
Ms. Meattle co-wrote a paper last year outlining the flow of climate investments into Africa, which found that a vast majority of what was already a small pool of money went to just a few of Africa's most advanced economies, like Egypt, Morocco and South Africa.
In smaller countries like Sierra Leone, those seeking to develop renewable energy face an even steeper uphill battle than Nuru, which has Congo's large population and famed natural resources as points of reference for potential investors.
Kofie Macauley, a Sierra Leonean engineer, has been trying to raise money for a hydroelectric project in a rural area of the country for a decade. He has courted roughly 60 equity partners, big and small, from around the world, for a dam that costs $ 80 million, a humble sum as far as such projects go. All the groundwork is complete. The money is the only thing.
"I just can't provide the guarantees they insist on," Mr. Macauley said. The dam project, while small, could "change the whole course of Sierra Leone's history," he said, providing power to as many as two million people who now lack it.
"The big banks are too risk-averse to see that," he said. "So the rest of the world will ride a Ferrari, and we stay on the bicycle."

GOMA, Congo — The world is racing ahead with enormous investments in renewable energy, for the first time this year plowing more money into solar power than oil.

He co-founded Nuru to try to solve that problem. It negotiated a partnership with a consortium of philanthropic funds, anchored by the Bezos Earth Fund and the Rockefeller and Ikea foundations, that agreed to put in the majority of the recent funding, which is intended to give Nuru a chance to prove that, rather than being a risky investment, it is an enterprise that can make money and transform the local economy.
“We’re trying to use philanthropic money to create proof points to get the market moving and show it’s less risky than international lending institutions and private banks think,” said Simon Harford, the CEO of the consortium, known as the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet.
With the money, Nuru will increase its urban microgrids in Congo to four, from one, and be able to produce 13 times as much electricity. The company eventually hopes to provide millions of Congolese with cheaper and more reliable electricity than what is produced by the diesel generators that most now use.
More than 70 million of Congo’s 100 million people cannot afford or access electricity. Its population is currently growing faster than new electricity customers are being brought online.
“I pay three times less to Nuru than what I paid for diesel, so you can imagine what it means for my business,” said Ezekia Rubona, 27, who runs a shop where people can make photocopies, print banners, upload videos and surf the internet. “That generator, too, it always surged. We would lose machines that way.”
While the financing is a major breakthrough for Nuru, the company is receiving it at an interest rate of more than 15%, five times as high as interest rates for many renewable energy projects in wealthier countries where companies have easier access to credit. Nuru also can’t afford to hire a seasoned chief financial officer. It could barely pay its small team over the years for trying to wrangle an investment that elsewhere in the renewable energy world might seem paltry.
The clincher, said Lobo, was getting investors to actually come to Congo. That was only made harder by an Ebola epidemic in the region and then COVID-19, as well as unrest that is so persistent it rarely makes global headlines. On the day a New York Times reporter arrived in the city of Goma to visit Nuru’s existing microgrid, state security forces killed more than 40 people who were gathering for a protest against the presence of a long-standing U.N. peacekeeping force widely seen as ineffective and a source of corruption.
A day later, Goma was back to its usual bustle.
“Investors are human beings too,” Lobo said. “Once you come here and see the hunger for energy, the potential for growth, you can finally look past the risks and see what a transformative investment this will be, a real, genuine business opportunity.”
What African leaders gathering in Nairobi, Kenya, this week for the first-ever Africa Climate Summit hope to do is persuade global investors and multinational development banks such as the International Monetary Fund that African companies need not only more deals like Nuru’s but also better ones.
There’s a term, “concessional,” for certain kinds of international loans that are designed to help less wealthy international borrowers. The idea is that loans might have below-market interest rates or grace periods for repayment.
Nuru’s loan is anything but concessional.
But the idea is to prime the pump for bigger investments. “The multinational banks are the ones who need to be the mobilizers-in-chief,” said Chavi Meattle, an expert on climate finance in Africa at the Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit research group. “They’ve made promises to reform, but they are not following through fast enough.”
Meattle co-wrote a paper last year outlining the flow of climate investments into Africa, which found that a vast majority of what was already a small pool of money went to just a few of Africa’s most advanced economies, like Egypt, Morocco and South Africa.
In smaller countries like Sierra Leone, those seeking to develop renewable energy face an even steeper uphill battle than Nuru, which has Congo’s large population and famed natural resources as points of reference for potential investors.
Kofie Macauley, a Sierra Leonean engineer, has been trying to raise money for a hydroelectric project in a rural area of the country for a decade. He has courted roughly 60 equity partners, big and small, from around the world, for a dam that costs $80 million, a humble sum as far as such projects go. All the groundwork is complete. The money is the only thing.
“I just can’t provide the guarantees they insist on,” Macauley said. The dam project, while small, could “change the whole course of Sierra Leone’s history,” he said, providing power to as many as 2 million people who now lack it.
“The big banks are too risk-averse to see that,” he said. “So the rest of the world will ride a Ferrari, and we stay on the bicycle.”

Full text: There's more than one way to show them off stylishly in your home. Here's how the pros do it.
Family photos, children's artwork and other mementos can be an interior design challenge. We want to display them proudly, but kindergarten art projects and snapshots of relatives don't always harmonize with the rest of the décor.
What to do? It all comes down to the presentation.
"Everything in a home should have meaning," said Lauren Robbins, an interior designer in Augusta, Ga. "So taking pieces with history -- whether it's an heirloom piece of furniture or something as simple as children's art -- and incorporating them with a modern twist is really important."
Displayed well, Ms. Robbins continued, that painting made in preschool can look as impressive as anything else in your home -- and it can bring more joy.
She and other interior designers shared some advice.
Frame It
Putting family photos or children's artwork in frames immediately elevates their appearance. If you plan to hang multiple pieces together, try mounting them in matching frames for visual unity, even if the photos or paintings don't look that similar, said Caitlin Kah, an interior designer in Palm Beach, Fla.
The streamlined framing aesthetic is especially useful "when you're dealing with a mix of black-and-white photos and color photos," said Ms. Kah, who once used bamboo frames to display disparate family photos on a grasscloth-covered wall.
Black or white frames are a good, simple option, but colorful frames can also work well for hanging art by children, said Meg Lonergan, an interior designer in Houston.
"It's fun to play up the childlike qualities of the art you're framing," said Ms. Lonergan, who has mounted paintings by her son in red frames. "Instead of trying to make it serious or formal feeling, lean into the nature of the work and frame it in something super eye-catching, cheerful and happy."
Create a Gallery Wall
Once the pieces are framed, don't just hang them in random spots. Create an organized gallery wall for a bigger statement.
Devon Wegman, the founder and design director of Devon Grace Interiors, a Chicago firm, is a fan of large-scale gallery walls with numerous family photos grouped together. "We usually try to create one moment where everything is compiled, like in an epic gallery wall," Ms. Wegman said.
In the loft she shares with her husband and business partner, Michael Wegman, dozens of photos in black frames of various sizes run up an open staircase. To ensure the composition would have a sense of order -- and that it would fill the entire wall -- the couple modeled it with 3-D design software. For their clients, they have used the same process to create grids of evenly spaced family photos and free-form arrangements that look considered.
Ms. Kah has used Framebridge's gallery wall service to achieve a similar effect with less effort: The company takes uploaded digital family photos and designs a gallery wall, then produces framed pieces along with a full-size template for mounting them on a wall.
Use a Picture Shelf
If you worry that a tightly designed gallery wall won't allow you to add more over time -- or if you simply don't want to put so many holes in the wall -- consider a shallow picture shelf or ledge, where framed pieces can be leaned against the wall.
"I love a picture ledge, because you can change things out really quickly, and it doesn't have to be perfect," said Ms. Kah, who installed picture shelves above the kitchen banquette in her home in Palm Beach, Fla. "You can layer things on top of each other. Compared to a gallery wall, it's a little more low maintenance and can grow with your family."
Beyond the kitchen, a long hallway is another good place for a picture shelf, Ms. Kah said. Ms. Wegman once used a picture shelf at a client's home to hold family photos above the TV in the living room.
Run a Wire With Clips
If you want to change the art and photos on display frequently, or don't want to go to the trouble of framing things, try a wire-based hanging system.
Ms. Lonergan and Ms. Wegman like stringing wires across walls with clips for suspending art. "That's where things from my kids' school would come home and get clipped up," said Ms. Lonergan, who used a curtain wire from Ikea. "I would just cycle things out every couple of weeks. It's a nice, informal way to display kids' art that costs almost nothing."
Install a Bulletin Board
A bulletin board, or pinboard, offers similar advantages. Ms. Robbins installed a fabric-covered one above a desk in the mudroom of her home in Georgia to hold her children's artwork. But rather than choosing a plain fabric that would blend into the wall, she made it a feature by covering it in a patterned fabric printed with colorful illustrations.
"Because that whole wall was white, it really needed something to make that pinboard pop," Ms. Robbins said. "It provides this fun background for the art we get from our children."
The paintings and drawings on display change with the seasons, which helps keep things fresh. "That's the beauty of a pinboard," she said. "You can constantly change things out with whatever art you want to put on the wall."
Make It the Center of Attention
If you're more interested in celebrating one or two special pieces than displaying a large collection, there are other options.
Sarabeth Arima, an Atlanta-based artist, specializes in elevating family portraits by creating one-of-a-kind works around a favorite photograph. "It's multimedia collage. I use paper, paint, pencil, you name it," Ms. Arima said.
"It was something I started doing for friends, but then I had more and more people asking me to do it professionally," she continued, noting that about a third of her commissions now come from interior designers. She described the pieces as "love letters to a family story."
If you have a piece that already transcends the everyday, you could also make it the center of attention in a room. Ms. Robbins hung a painting by her three children above her living room sofa, and based the color scheme of the room around it.
The painting came together when her father, an abstract painter named Michael Patterson, put a canvas on the floor of his studio and invited the children to get messy. As they got to work, "I looked at my dad and said, 'This is actually really good,"' Ms. Robbins said. When the adults provided some direction, it got even better.
Now framed and mounted above her sofa, "it's such a conversation piece," Ms. Robbins said. "People walk in and are like, 'Oh, my gosh, where did you get that piece?' And I'm like, 'Oh, my kids did it."'

Life After Loss Is Awful. I Need to Believe It's Also Beautiful.: [Op-Ed]

Full text: In Jewish tradition, a child who loses a parent is required to say Kaddish, the mourner's prayer, every day for 11 months, and the community recognizes you as an avel, a mourner, all that year. You are advised to eschew hilarity and concerts, wedding banquets and bar mitzvah parties. You aren't to seek out live music (unless your livelihood depends on it). You do not go out in search of unnecessary joy or frivolity. You inhabit a place of enhanced contemplation, by tradition as well as by religious law.
But as a parent who has lost a child, as I did this spring, when my 14-year-old daughter, Orli, died, you are on your own. There is no tradition of daily prayer or asceticism beyond the first 30 days. There is no rule requiring a yearlong ritual; you can do anything. You are in free fall. No one knows exactly how to relate to you. (It is not uncommon for people to cry when they see me.)
Without religious guide rails, and guarding ourselves from the anguish of others in the midst of our own, we have sought our own path. Where Judaism proscribes the child mourning her parent to avoid unnecessary joy, perhaps, I thought, my family had to actively seek beauty. We had to do what Orli had done.
In June last year, in the scant weeks between Orli's first brain tumor and her second -- when her multiyear battle with liver cancer, following round after round of chemotherapy and radiation, a liver transplant and umpteen surgeries, had morphed once more into something even more frightening -- our family was gifted a few days by the sea, in a tiny fishing town. One early morning Orli biked off alone, ignoring the concerns of her doctors (who worried about balance) and her parents (who just worried). I came upon her sitting on a jetty made from enormous boulders, a book in hand, staring out to sea. She turned when she heard me arriving and smiled enormously. This, she said, gesturing broadly, was so good for her mental health. She meant the sand, the sea, the solitude, the beauty, the autonomy. It did not take away what she had been through, and what she suspected was to come, but it sustained her, for a time. This, this is what I need, she told me.
This has been a season of trying to find what Orli saw there. I have spent these weeks insisting our remaining family go out into the world with me, to find it beautiful as well as horrible, amazing as well as painful. We are learning how to live now. We often stumble.
I had the idea at the outset of summer to go on a grand sadness tour, visiting places we once lived in Europe, in the years before all this began. I wanted to see and stay with friends, to try to, even briefly, recapture wonder. My younger daughter, Hana, and I decided that along the way we would drop white beads emblazoned with a gold O, a semi-permanent bread crumb, a way to take Orli with us, to keep her close. We looked for Orli as we went -- we looked to find ourselves. On the wild Spanish coast, 90 minutes above Barcelona, we hiked on rocky trails where the Mediterranean pines improbably grow into the inhospitable rock, clinging to life, thriving and green, but weathered and battered. Look how they survive, we said to each other. Look how they survive.
Hana's birthday fell when we were midway on this journey, in Paris. She asked friends to call or text at the exact hour of her birth. At the moment messages came in, a fast-moving summer thunderstorm abruptly swept through. While my partner, Ian, and I took shelter under the awning of a shuttered restaurant, Hana ran out to dance in the warm rain. She looked up and saw we were in front of number 13, Orli's birth date, her favorite number. "It's Orli!" Hana shouted. We thought: Who knows? Maybe it is.
In part I know that our travels were a means of running away. Indeed, I would have kept on running if Hana and Ian were amenable, if finances would have allowed. If I could have fully uprooted us, I probably would have. (I know we were fortunate, amid enormous misfortune, to be able to run at all.) Our home can feel heavy and haunted. I have spent hours cleaning Orli's room, first collecting medical equipment for donation and then swapping out the bedding that she died on. The room still carries her scent, in a tiny diffuser with wicking sticks that makes olfactory promises it cannot keep.
I have made the room beautiful, as though it is still hers. Orli's feminist posters are still on the wall, the books are still organized as she carefully placed them; the room is as she designed it, ever so slightly altered, stripped now of terror. When I finished overhauling the space, absent its oxygen machines and hundreds of pill bottles, its tubes and limb-adjusting cushions, its wheelchair and bedside commode, equipped with a new, subtly matching throw blanket and pillow and an Ikea duvet cover, I lay down on the bed and wept.
So all that's to say I am not nice right now. I don't want to speak, but I want you to write. When I interviewed the French author Anne Berest some weeks ago I told her I did not have one child, but two; one was gone. I began to cry. "I'm sorry," I said, gathering myself. "Why are you sorry," she said, looking directly at me. "It is sad." We sat together, comfortable in the discomfort.
I still have a tendency to wake in the night and go over and over all of the things that went wrong and where I imagine I might have protected Orli. I berate myself for having failed her. It is completely irrational; it is also true. I could not save her; she could not be saved. I am her mother; ergo, I failed. In the light of day, I see the faulty logic of 4 a.m. It reminds me of how, when we were first in the emergency room with her in November 2019, after a month of her pediatricians failing to see what was in front of them, of coming back to the doctors week after week and asking them to please, please look at her one more time, it was not them I blamed initially but myself. "But I breastfed her," I kept telling the emergency room physicians, into their downcast faces, as they explained that the pain she carried stemmed from innumerable liver tumors. "But I breastfed her."
I try to reorient myself walking each morning. I try to see the blooming flowers, the wild potato blossoms that run the stretch of the path near my home, the fecundity of August, the greenery that rushed in during the months since Orli left us here, to fend for ourselves. I find I cannot talk to people I see at the farmers market, but I can appreciate the ripening fruit, the taste of late summer, the heat in the skin of each peach.
Sometimes I have tried to share what I see. As Hana's birthday came to a close, long after the sky had cleared from that sudden downpour in which we looked for Orli, we stayed out too late. The day's scorching temperature had finally eased, it was still gorgeously light out, and we were walking with a wonderful French friend of many years who happened to be born the same day as Hana, some decades before her. The adults were loath to turn back to the apartment, basking in company long denied.
Hana suddenly hung back, upset. Life, she said, is terrible. I said: I know it is. I feel like that, too, all the time. But look around you, I said. We are in Paris. It is 10:30 at night and the world is filled with people. This street, these buildings are exquisite. The light is soft, it is beautiful here, there is a breeze. The pain is always there for us. It will be waiting at the apartment when we return tonight, it will be lying next to us in bed or come to us when we wake; we always have it. But we have to let this beauty in, too. That will be the work of all the rest of our days: to hold this pain and this beauty side by side, without letting the one crush or crowd out the other. We have to let this beauty in, too.

Full text: SWEDEN IS AMONG the world's most egalitarian societies, but you might not sense that when surveying the ancestral estates that rise above the gently rolling landscape of the southern Skåne province, near the country's border with Denmark. Among them is the 14th-century Högestad, outside of the town of Ystad, which has been owned for the last 300 years by descendants of Count Carl Piper, a nobleman who purchased the agricultural spread around 1705. His wife, Christina, who died in 1752, was one of the most successful entrepreneurs and real estate developers of her time.
The Pipers still farm beets and wheat on the land, but modern machinery long ago made obsolete the tenant farmers who once occupied dozens of cottages there. In the last century, the Pipers sold off most of those peaked-roof brick dwellings and, over the past few decades, new owners, including Copenhagen residents who make the drive over the bridge that connects the two countries, have reimagined some as weekend homes -- cozy retreats into an agrarian past.
But for years, one building remained largely untouched. Set on a quiet, grassy lane, the former schoolhouse constructed for workers' children in the 1920s had long been maintained by the local government. The light-filled, 4,300-square-foot space, split into five rooms, served as a community center and a venue for weddings and christenings.
In 1995, the officials sold it at last. The buyers were Ingegerd Råman, now 80, the legendary Swedish designer -- responsible for iconic Ikea collections, including the limited-edition 2016 Viktigt rattan-and-bamboo furniture and accessories line, as well as pared-down crystal vessels for the Swedish glassmaker Orrefors -- and her partner of more than 50 years, Claes Söderquist, 84, an artist and experimental filmmaker known for having been allowed onto California's Alcatraz Island in 1970 to document its occupation by the activist group Indians of All Tribes.
When the couple first saw the former schoolhouse, its interiors were painted in dowdy shades of yellow and green, but they were instantly struck by its pleasing proportions: The two-story structure, with white lime mortar-covered brick walls and a traditional red tile roof, is a near-perfect rectangle. In the years since, with help from the Stockholm-based architecture firm Claesson Koivisto Rune, they have transformed the building into a starkly graceful tabernacle of minimalism, as much a tribute to Japanese aesthetics as to modern Scandinavian style, warmed by artifacts from their bohemian life together and examples of Råman's ceramics and glass. At a right angle to the structure, in a plot of purple-blue and canary yellow wildflowers, there is a detached studio, an ultracontemporary concrete cube in which Råman handcrafts limited-edition earthenware of uncommon beauty.
THE DESIGNER AND the filmmaker have always functioned with marked independence from each other. Since 1969, they have maintained an equally understated apartment in Stockholm, about 400 miles north, which they use both together and separately, sometimes living apart. Råman, who has lately been collaborating with a company in the historic ceramic enclave of Arita, Japan, often flies to the Swedish capital from the nearby Malmö airport for a week or two of intense meetings and design work in her studio not far from the Moderna Museet; Söderquist spends time in the city on his own, too, recently producing a book about his films that was published last fall.
But on a late summer afternoon, the couple opened the 100-year-old doors to the former schoolhouse in Skåne together. They were dressed in black, as Råman always is -- she favors draped and tailored garments by Issey Miyake. "It's not as though I don't like color," she said, "but I think there are just the right times and places for it."
Those places would not, for the most part, be inside the couple's home: It takes a vivid imagination to picture a pack of rambunctious schoolchildren galloping up the three wide granite steps that lead to the building's entrance. Today, the tall wooden doors, crowned with a rounded transom, open onto a monastic white plastered hallway, which runs the span of the 40-foot-long structure. The floor, like those throughout the house, is the original pine sublayer that was covered with mustard linoleum when Råman and Söderquist bought the place; before bleaching the narrow boards, Söderquist pulled up thousands of nails, sliding across the surface in stockinged feet to make sure he got each one. On a shelf just beyond the entrance, one of Råman's charcoal-colored thrown pots holds a cascade of black petunias. At one end of the corridor is a small chamber containing a hulking gray steel machine on which Söderquist transfers and edits 16-millimeter film; at the other end is the home's sole bathroom, as simple and plain as an ancient Roman steam room, with white walls and a free-standing tiled divider at the center fitted with a hand-held shower arm. "We have always lived with emptiness," Råman said.
Behind the hallway, she and Söderquist have configured the house in a way that defies domestic convention but perfectly serves their partnership, in which there is always space for their work. Instead of using the entire 1,300-square-foot expanse as a vast living area arranged with huge-scale furnishings, in the manner of a TriBeCa loft, they confined their kitchen, dining and sitting room to little more than half of the available floor space. A black velvet-upholstered couch by the Swedish designer Alice Kunftova and an angular Eero Saarinen chair flank a white-painted cylindrical wood stove, which reaches nearly to the 12-foot-high ceiling; against one of the walls, tall white kitchen cabinets hold unassuming but elegant dishware and glasses of Råman's own design, including pieces from her spartan, handblown Bellman series, first created in the 1980s, which the couple use daily. A long custom-made oak dining table sits beneath the windows, bare but for an 18-inch-tall cast-bronze candelabra in a blobby organic shape by the Brazilian postmodernist sculptor Saint Clair Cemin. Surrounding it are six austere straight-backed wooden dining chairs amassed over decades. Each is slightly different, but Söderquist has painted them all the same shade of glossy red, a rare splash of color that throws the room's black-and-white palette into crisp relief. The effect is subtle, but emotionally redolent. "That way you have the memories of each, yet there's visual harmony," Råman said.
But in the adjacent 560-square-foot room -- reached through a large glass door -- the couple's priorities become clear: The 19th-century oak table at which Råman works, a relic from a nearby castle, sits in the center of the almost empty space. Here, as light streams through the windows, which were set high enough in the wall that distractions including passing cows wouldn't interrupt classes, she sketches and puzzles out ideas for glass vessels, candlesticks and carafes, as well as less expected commissions, including a series of large-scale peat-fiber acoustic panels for the Swedish company Okko Design.
Though the home's surfaces are mostly clear of objects, the desk is laid out as a constantly changing library of inspiration, so dense with beautifully shaped and patinated things that it's impossible to tell which are decorative, and which are tools for Råman's practice. Every piece has a story: "This is a French pipe for bird hunting calls," she said, picking up a thin carved wooden straw. "This one with the little pouf at the end? A Chinese ear cleaner. And here are my grandfather's calipers, which I use constantly. He was an engineer." In a central spot sits a small ivory-colored metal orb; the London-based, Cyprus-born industrial designer Michael Anastassiades, a frequent houseguest whom Råman taught to throw clay on the wheel in the next-door studio, made it to commemorate a favorite stone he found long ago on a beach. Often, before she travels, she slips it or something else from the table into her bag for comfort, an unexpectedly Proustian gesture for such a die-hard minimalist, perhaps, but one that reflects her complex relationship with objects, however simple they may seem. "They remind me of my life," she said.
THE SECOND FLOOR is as sparsely furnished as the first. Echoing the layout of Råman's office, the couple's extra-low platform bed, dressed in black woolen sheets, stands in the center of the spare peaked-ceiling chamber. "You want to wake up with all the air around you," she said. Running along the wall beneath two large casement windows is the room's sole nod to embellishment: a wood shelf holding an array of glass pieces designed by Råman and others, from squat columns with frosted geometric etchings to tall clear vessels. Some artisans and designers argue that the line between such high-level craft and fine art is porous, but Råman, an admirer of Donald Judd and the color field painters, especially Barnett Newman, isn't one of them. "I don't see what I do as art," she said, "which doesn't mean that it isn't good, but I am someone who needs material and an aim."
In Söderquist's office down the hall, next to which is a capacious guest room that looks out over the fields, the neighbor's charcoal-colored cat lounged on a pinewood daybed designed by Söderquist. ("He knows when we come home from our travels and invites himself in," Råman said.) On a wall hangs the final painting Söderquist made, in 1974, the year he gave up oils for film. It depicts a trapezoidal brick barn, which stood across the road from a house they once lived in, set against a snow-frosted field. Söderquist sold the canvas to a collector right after he finished it, but the couple had always dreamed of buying it back and did so in 2011. On a shelf below sits a group of rough-hewn, black animal-shaped whistles made of fired clay, which the pair found years ago in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. Råman picked up a tiny cow and blew softly into it. The pure, high sound filled the air. "They still seem so beautiful to me," she said. "You see, they have a purpose. Having a purpose, you know, is everything."

In Uganda, Renaissance For Distance Running: [Sports Desk]

Full text: With a mile to go in the 2017 World Cross Country Championships, Joshua Cheptegei had one thing on his mind: win gold for his country on home soil.
It was a balmy afternoon in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, and against a field of far more seasoned athletes, he was closing in on his goal. Halfway through the biennial event, in which the world's top distance runners compete over 10 kilometers of grass, mud and occasional barriers, he had gapped the field with a surge so elegant that it looked like he was floating.
Two hours earlier, his compatriot Jacob Kiplimo had hoisted the red, black, gold and gray-crowned crane of the Ugandan flag after winning the under-20 race. The raucous crowd, which included the Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, expected Cheptegei to do the same.
Now he was hanging on for dear life, determined to prove that Uganda, long overlooked in the distance running world, could hold its own against the sport's powerhouses, Kenya and Ethiopia. But the storybook ending, on this day, would not come to pass: In the final half-mile, as his body fended off dehydration, Cheptegei's engine sputtered. He slowed to an agonizing shuffle, coming in 30th out of 136 finishers.
Cheptegei's near-triumph would nonetheless prove to be a prelude to a Ugandan running renaissance. Two years later, he won the 2019 World Cross Country Championships in Denmark. Uganda's men took the team title.
Since then, Cheptegei has secured his place on the list of distance running's all-time greats, with an Olympic gold medal and two World Championship titles on the track, as well as world records in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters. Kiplimo, who dethroned Cheptegei as the current World Cross Country champion in February, now holds the half-marathon world record. In 2019, Halimah Nakaayi won the World Championship title in the 800 meters, and, in 2021, Peruth Chemutai won the Olympic gold medal in the 3,000-meter steeplechase.
In and around Kapchorwa, a small town in the foothills of Mount Elgon, a 14,000-foot extinct volcano that straddles the Kenyan border, hundreds of youngsters are hitting the roads with dreams of future glory. Though Uganda's volume of talent still lags behind that of Kenya and Ethiopia, the magnitude of its rise has been remarkable.
"Every year, as a country, we're getting better and better," Cheptegei said on an April afternoon, as he looked ahead to defending his 10,000-meter title at this month's World Athletics Championships in Budapest. "The Mount Elgon region has always been home to running talent, and we're only just beginning to showcase it."
Uganda's ascent, in many ways, is an outgrowth of longstanding success in Kenya. Since 1964, that country has won 105 Olympic medals in running events from 400 meters to the marathon; Kenya has also produced six of the 10 fastest male marathoners in history, and five of the 10 fastest women.
These exploits have been mainly concentrated among the Kalenjin, a community of nine closely related tribes descended from pastoralists that migrated south over the last few thousand years from the Nile River Valley. Most of the seven million Kalenjin today live in Kenya's western highlands, where altitudes ranging from 6,000 to 9,000 feet help them develop more oxygen-carrying red blood cells and greater lung capacities. Research has also shown that Kalenjin, on average, have especially thin lower legs and a high leg-length-to-torso ratio, which facilitates greater running economy, or the ability to make more efficient use of oxygen.
There are Kalenjin in Uganda, too, and if it weren't for the quirks of colonial history, there would be more: The original borders of Britain's Uganda Protectorate, hashed out by mustachioed bureaucrats in 1894, encompassed the bulk of the Kalenjin territory that is part of Kenya today. Adjustments to the boundary in 1902, driven by the desire to unify administration of a railway from the coast, unwittingly paved the way for Kenya's future running triumphs. Yet the new line, which cut through the crest of Elgon, severed one Kalenjin tribe, the Sabaot, in two. The descendants of those left in Uganda, who number roughly 300,000, live primarily in three districts on Elgon's western flanks -- an area of striking natural beauty known for its waterfalls, sweeping vistas and alpine forests.
It is here that Ugandan running is now thriving, though the region's talent took time to develop. While Kenya enjoyed relative stability in the decades after it gained independence in 1963, Uganda was at war for much of the 1970s and 1980s. Lawlessness pervaded the Mount Elgon region until the turn of the century: Bandits from neighboring tribes would sweep in at night and conduct raids on cattle, often killing locals in the process.
The area was also slow to modernize. Until the 1990s, the ancestors of many current athletes, including Cheptegei, Kiplimo and Chemutai, lived inside the forests of Elgon's upper belt, part of a small group of Sabaot that subsisted on milk, honey and meat from antelope and buffalo they hunted. Here, 9,000 feet up, there were no roads or schools, and no pipeline into competitive athletics. But according to Moses Kiptala, an elder who grew up in this community, endurance was of great value: The group's method of persistence hunting involved chasing animals for hours until they overheated.
Kiplimo, who comes from a family of runners and had planned to contest the 5,000 and 10,000 meters in Budapest before being sidelined by an injured hamstring, is of particularly distinguished stock. Kiptala recalls Kiplimo's grandfather being such a prolific hunter that the community called him Simba, or Lion.
Much had changed by the time today's stars were born: In 1983, Uganda's government began resettling the group, known as the Mosopisiek, downslope from the forest to make way for a national park. Most are now small-scale farmers. The resettlement process, Kiptala said, was traumatic, but it also helped unlock running talent. Through school, children could access competitions, and by the early 2000s, athletes from the Elgon region were beginning to appear in World Championship and Olympic finals.
Uganda's first champion of this period was a runner from the country's north, Dorcus Inzikuru, who won the 3,000-meter steeplechase at the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki. Elgon's watershed moment came seven years later, when the Kapchorwa native Stephen Kiprotich notched an upset win in the 2012 London Olympics marathon -- the country's first Olympic gold since 1972. He doubled down with a marathon title the following year in Moscow.
"Many Kenyans were saying London was a fluke, so I had to prove them wrong," Kiprotich said.
Among the legions inspired by those performances was a teenage Cheptegei, who had also grown up in Kapchorwa with dreams of running glory. His parents, who insisted that he enroll in college, were skeptical. But his progress, highlighted by a 10,000-meter world junior title, was so impressive that even President Museveni urged him to drop the books and focus full-time on athletics.
Like many Ugandan runners before him, Cheptegei left for Kenya, where there were more elites to train with and more sophisticated coaching. In 2016, determined to raise the sport's profile at home, he persuaded his management, the Netherlands-based Global Sports Communication, to establish an elite group in Kapchorwa.
Seven years later, Cheptegei is not only a national icon, he's also a force for talent development. Along with coach Addy Ruiter, he's pieced together a squad of two dozen globally competitive athletes, who live together in a stone-and-brick facility known as the Joshua Cheptegei Training Center, on the slopes above the town. An affiliated camp for up-and-coming junior athletes is a short drive away in Kween, a neighboring district.
Other management groups, including Kiplimo's Italy-based Rosa & Associati, have opened camps in the area as well, drawn both to the concentration of talent and the training environment. Though Kapchorwa sits at a slightly lower altitude than the main training hubs in Kenya and Ethiopia, the town's location halfway up a mountain enables greater versatility. Ruiter, a 60-year-old former triathlete who left a desk job at Ikea to move here from the Netherlands in 2019, said his athletes benefit from long runs that reach as high as 10,000 feet, as well as faster sessions at altitudes as low as 3,500 feet.
While a structure for continued success is now in place, Ruiter was quick to stress that the size of Uganda's talent pool will never quite measure up to Kenya's or Ethiopia's. He also described Cheptegei and Kiplimo as "once-in-a-generation talents" and said it could be a while before Uganda sees another athlete of their caliber. Eventually, though, he believes more champions from Mount Elgon will emerge.
Other roadblocks could still manifest. In recent years, Kenya's running pre-eminence has been marred by the specter of doping: As of Aug. 9, there were 64 Kenyan athletes ineligible to compete in World Athletics events because of drug-related violations. There were no Ugandans on the list, though earlier this month, Janat Chemusto, a 1,500-meter runner who trains in the Cheptegei camp, was provisionally suspended by the Athletics Integrity Unit, which investigates doping in the sport. In a statement, Erik van Leeuwen of Global Sports Communication said Chemusto would be defending her case but offered no further comment.
For Cheptegei, the focus is now on the World Championships in Budapest: He's expected to contend for the 10,000-meter title on Aug. 20 and may double back to vie for the podium in the 5,000 meters as well. And in December, he will make his marathon debut in Valencia -- the same city where he set his 10,000-meter record in 2020. Kiplimo has plans to eventually move up to the marathon, too, where the money is greater and new record-breaking opportunities await.
On that day in April, as he spoke from inside his camp after the day's training session, Cheptegei said he was simply grateful for the journey that he and his country had taken so far -- even the rare occasions when things hadn't quite worked out.
"It's one of those incidents that built me mentally," he said of the 2017 race in Kampala. "I had two options: Allow it to break me; or gather myself together and build an inspirational story."

Full text: Finding an apartment in Brooklyn isn't easy, but one interior designer had an advantage over other buyers: She wasn't afraid to live in a tiny space.
After years of renting apartments in Brooklyn, Alex Kalita was finally ready to buy in 2017. The idea of investing in real estate was appealing, but as the founder of Common Bond Design, an interiors firm, she also wanted the opportunity to renovate, so her home could reflect her sense of style.
"I made my Realtor's job difficult, because I was really looking for a feeling," said Ms. Kalita, 36. "I didn't have hard-and-fast criteria, like it has to have 1.5 bathrooms, a minimum number of square feet or any of those categories you would use in a filter on StreetEasy."
She did know that she wanted to live in Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill or Boerum Hill. But there wasn't a lot of inventory. Soon, however, she realized that she had something going for her that other buyers might not: her willingness to live small.
"I was willing to sacrifice on square footage, which I think gave us an advantage," she said. "I don't live with anyone, and I don't have a ton of stuff."
After about a year of hunting, she found a co-op apartment in Carroll Gardens that felt right: a third-floor one-bedroom of about 475 square feet, with windows that looked out through treetops. It was about half as large as the rental she was living in at the time, and the cramped bedroom was only eight feet wide, but she could envision ways to make the space work better.
She bought the apartment for $ 540,000 in September 2018 and got to work, using her mother's designer friend, Morrie Breyer, as a sounding board to make sure she didn't get too carried away.
Her first step was to do a little exploratory deconstruction. In the living room, the middle third of one wall was brick, while the rest was drywall.
"I was pretty sure that brick would have extended along the entire party wall," Ms. Kalita said.
She broke through the drywall to investigate and confirmed that she was correct, so she removed the framing and the rest of the drywall and painted the brick that had been hidden. "I was able to pick up four inches of extra living space," she said, noting that she added a simple, plaster-covered mantel as a focal point, although there's no fireplace.
Knowing that her living room would need to serve many purposes, Ms. Kalita set it up with multifunctionality in mind. After the movers destroyed her sofa, she kept the cushions and worked with Aaron Black, a furniture maker, to craft a new plywood daybed base for them. Now the piece can function as seating and a place for overnight guests to sleep.
Along the wall opposite the faux fireplace, Ms. Kalita reconfigured a wall-mounted Vitsoe 606 Universal Shelving System she owned to serve as a desk, library and media center. Then she added space-saving furniture, including a vintage footstool with an upholstered top that can be flipped over to function as a coffee table; a sprightly side table just large enough to hold a drink; and a Flos Parentesi floor lamp that suspends a light bulb on a slender cable.
"It's my living room, my guest room, my home office and occasionally my dining room when I have too many people to fit at the table in the kitchen," Ms. Kalita said. When that happens, she has a children's play mat she unfolds as a durable picnic blanket.
"It's a home gym as well," she added. (She keeps a yoga mat, yoga blocks, resistance bands and weights in a woven basket she bought at Salter House.)
For the kitchen, which is in a narrower part of the apartment, she added Reform cabinets with integrated finger pulls along one wall, topped by a shallow countertop.
"Usually, you want the counter overhang to stick out farther than the hardware," she said. But because there's no hardware on her cabinet doors, she was able to make the countertop flush with the cabinet fronts.
"It only saved about an inch, but that matters," she said. At the end of the kitchen, she recessed a pantry into a wall.
To expand the bedroom, Ms. Kalita demolished a closet, pulled the doorway back and replaced the lost storage with a free-standing Ikea Pax wardrobe. Working with Mr. Black, she designed a Shaker-inspired peg rail and hanging mirror that kept floor space open.
Where there were two closets off the hallway, she combined them to create a utility room with a washer-dryer and additional storage space.
After about eight months of construction, including a delay caused by a gas leak, the project was complete in the spring of 2019, for about $ 100,000.
"I did wonder if there would be times it felt too small," Ms. Kalita said. "But because I was able to design the storage to accommodate my specific needs, it feels like the most capacious apartment I've ever lived in."

Her Husband Came With a Paris Apartment: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: For two designers living in Brooklyn, meeting and marrying felt like destiny. The renovation of the grand apartment in France followed naturally.
By the time Megan Grehl finally met Côme Ménage, it felt as if their relationship was meant to be. Both had studied architecture and urban design internationally, and when Ms. Grehl landed in Shanghai in 2009 to work at the design firm Neri&Hu, she heard stories about Mr. Ménage, who had just left.
"We missed each other by a month," said Ms. Grehl, 37, who now runs her own interior design studio. "Our friends were like, 'Oh, it's too bad. You just missed Côme. He went to New York, and you guys would have gotten along so well."'
Ms. Grehl didn't think much of it at the time, but five years later, after she'd moved to New York, she and Mr. Ménage began following each other on Instagram. When she posted a photo of the Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, brownstone where she had rented an apartment, Mr. Ménage got in touch. It turned out they were next-door neighbors.
They became fast friends, and then a couple, marrying in 2017. Eventually, they moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where they now live with their children, Yves, 5, and Ren, 1.
But when Ms. Grehl married Mr. Ménage, she got more than just a husband and a family -- she got a home in the heart of Paris.
Mr. Ménage, 39, who grew up in France, lived a peripatetic life for years. But when he moved to New York, he decided he wanted to maintain a foothold in Paris. "I took an apartment that I could go back and forth to, and that some of my family members could sometimes use," said Mr. Ménage, an architect who founded the firm Re-A.D, which works in the United States and France.
The apartment in the Ninth Arrondissement was a rental, "and it was a deal," he said, "because the whole building had to be renovated." Initially, he was paying about 3,500 euros (about $ 3,900) a month, but the rent has since increased to about 4,000 euros (about $ 4,500).
Before he met Ms. Grehl, Mr. Ménage made some basic changes. "It was your typical Paris Haussmann-style apartment, with a grand salon," he said, that had plenty of ornate 19th-century details, and a back corridor leading to a cramped kitchen and bathroom. To make those back spaces feel larger, Mr. Ménage knocked down one wall of the old kitchen and concealed a back stairwell to make space for a powder room and a larger bathroom.
"It was actually quite simple," he said. "But once Megan came into my life, I brought her here and she was inspired, and that spurred the idea to do more."
Ms. Grehl also met Mr. Ménage's mother, Odile Vilain, a massage therapist who sometimes invited clients to the apartment, and the pair hit it off. Before long, the family planned to give the apartment a significant decorative boost, mixing contemporary art and design, finds from Parisian flea markets and Asian-inspired elements, in a nod to Ms. Grehl's background (her mother is Taiwanese and she grew up in Asia).
In the living room, or grand salon, they maintained the original plaster details, but gave the room an eclectic look by furnishing it with modern pieces, including a vintage Artichoke pendant lamp by Poul Henningsen, a bulbous Culbuto chair by Marc Held and a graffiti-style painting by an artist friend who goes by the name Chanoir.
In the dining room, they took a more daring approach, painting the original paneled walls black and gold, and letting the gold fade toward the top, "to draw the eye up to the ceiling," Ms. Grehl said, "because it's so beautiful."
Inspired by the Japanese artist Hokusai, they ordered custom wallpaper featuring waves and figures from the artist's work; the graphic pattern now covers some kitchen walls. Then they installed Ikea cabinets, a wood countertop and backsplash, Gaggenau appliances and a painted tablecloth depicting fish that they repurposed as a wall-mounted artwork.
They gave their bedroom a fresh treatment with simple white drapery and a pendant lamp from Merci with a fabric shade, then transformed the second bedroom into a spa for Ms. Vilain, placing a console by Philippe Starck over a miniature garden of dried moss, grasses and flowers.
The result: an 1,800-square-foot apartment where each room evokes a particular feeling.
"It's good to have different concepts for different rooms," Mr. Ménage said. "As you find more pieces, you're not tied down, trying to be coherent across all of the spaces."
He added: "It allows for more experimentation and gives us more freedom" to shop the flea markets.
Mr. Ménage estimated that they spent about 120,000 euros (or $ 134,000) updating the apartment. They inquired about buying it, but the owner wasn't interested, so for the foreseeable future they will continue renting.
"The idea is to have it for a very long time," Mr. Ménage said. And because of that, investing in updates "just makes sense, for the comfort of everybody."

Full text: After 16 years together, Sachi Takahashi-Rial and George Carollo drew up a timeline, which included a decision to legally tie the knot in 2023.
Sachi Alita Takahashi-Rial and George Carl Gaetano Carollo sent out their online wedding invitations in March, which left some people amused, and others guessing.
It said: "You're invited to the first Investor Offsite for pre-eminent investors worldwide. This exclusive event combines insights, innovation, vision, and, of course, cake."
Questions then quickly rolled in, mostly to their parents, regarding the unconventional three-day celebration at Yin Ranch, a 40-acre event venue in Vacaville, Calif., from Nov. 3 to 5.
"Are you getting married or raising a venture capital fund?" asked one friend.
After all, Mr. Carollo, 34, is a founder and the chief operating officer of Dover, a job recruiting technology platform start-up. He graduated with distinction with two bachelor's degrees, one in economics and another in urban studies, from Stanford, from which he also received a master's degree in civil and environmental engineering.
"Our sense of humor doesn't translate all the way," said Ms. Takahashi-Rial, 33, an associate director of partner services at Listen4Good, which assists nonprofit groups in getting feedback from their constituents.
She graduated with distinction with a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of California, Berkeley and received a master of public policy from Duke.
The two, together for 17 years, grew up in the same neighborhood in Sacramento, Calif., and got their start working on at least a dozen projects and studying together in high school. But it took them a while to get to that point.
They barely noticed each other in their sixth grade class at James R. Cowan Fundamental Elementary, and then she did her best to avoid him all through Arcade Fundamental Middle School.
"He was very uncool," Ms. Takahashi-Rial said.
Her attitude changed once they ended up in a highly competitive international baccalaureate program at Mira Loma High School -- she lived across the street; he three traffic lights away.
"It was an exceptionally nerdy place," said Mr. Carollo, who also had a growth spurt the summer before, and even became popular. "It was like AP classes on steroids."
They began hanging out with friends either at "the bench," a gathering spot on campus, or on AOL Instant Messenger after school and on weekends.
At her house sophomore year, they and classmates built a 15-foot-long float with thousands of flowers out of crepe paper folded, fluffed, and wrapped around chicken wire for an annual homecoming float competition. It won first place.

On Apr. 4, 2006, after studying for a biology exam junior year at her house, they walked over to the school baseball diamond and sat in the bleachers. Neither was dating anyone, and they had recently become flirty.
"She made a move and kissed me," he said.
Instead of going to the junior prom as friends, they went as boyfriend and girlfriend.
After graduation, they dated long distance, and spoke every day while he attended Stanford and she started out at the University of the Pacific, and then transferred to Berkeley two years later.
In 2015, after years of living together and apart, they moved into a big house with friends in the Cole Valley neighborhood of San Francisco. Two years later they all picked up and moved into another big house in the Duboce Triangle area.
"It was wonderful," he said, recalling late-night conversations, Thursday night family-style dinners and house parties.
For five years, Ms. Takahashi-Rial and Mr. Carollo entertained friends and family with their annual EOY memos, their End of Year spoof on a Christmas letter, sounding all-important on trivial matters, until the pandemic hit, and they got more serious.
In 2021 they were ready to leave San Francisco, put all their furniture in storage and packed up their Mini Cooper. They then stopped in places including Los Angeles, Dallas and Knoxville. By spring they rendezvoused with friends in Brooklyn.
After a couple of months, in August 2021, they got an apartment near the Empire State Building, and racked up about 10 miles each weekend exploring the city by foot.
To decorate, "we bought cheap stuff off Amazon," she said, and usually put two Ikea desks together for dinner parties.
In May 2022, when they decided to get a real dining room table, questions sprang up about their future. So they began mapping it out on a Google spreadsheet, labeled "Life Planning," on Mr. Carollo's laptop, and made a timeline on another tab. (They have 10 tabs now.)
"Would we move back to Bay Area, do we want kids in New York, and should we get married?" she said. "There wasn't a proposal. There was just a decision. We just project managed ourselves."
On July 28, George T. Carollo, a Universal Life minister, who is the groom's father, officiated outside the Sacramento courthouse, and without a fuss signed their marriage certificate before two witnesses, the groom's sister and her husband, in a parking area.
Afterward, they drove over to Frank Fat's, a local Chinese restaurant, to celebrate with family, and enjoyed its signature banana cream pie for dessert.
In November, they expect about 130 guests to join them during their three-day "investor offsite," which will include activity-themed breakout groups ranging from basketball games to cake-decorating, as well as dinner and toasts.
"We're excited to have a good party with the people who invested in us," she said.

Justices Temporarily Allow Regulation of Gun Kits: [National Desk]

Author: Liptak, Adam

Publication info: Liptak, Adam.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The federal government, citing a rise in violence involving untraced firearms, had asked the justices to step in. The court provisionally allowed the regulation while a challenge moves forward.
The Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily revived the Biden administration's regulation of "ghost guns" -- kits that can be bought online and assembled into untraceable homemade firearms.
In defending the rule, a key part of President Biden's broader effort to address gun violence, administration officials said such weapons had soared in popularity in recent years, particularly among criminals barred from buying ordinary guns.
The court's brief order gave no reasons, which is typical when the justices act on emergency applications. The order was provisional, leaving the regulation in place while a challenge moves forward in the courts.
The vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the court's three liberal members -- Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson -- to form a majority.
Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh noted dissents. Like the justices in the majority, they did not explain their reasoning.
The regulation, issued in 2022 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, broadened the bureau's interpretation of the definition of "firearm" in the Gun Control Act of 1968.
The change, Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar wrote in the Biden administration's emergency application, was needed to respond to "the urgent public safety and law enforcement crisis posed by the exponential rise of untraceable firearms."
The new regulation did not ban the sale or possession of kits and components that can be assembled to make guns, she wrote, but it did require manufacturers and sellers to obtain licenses, mark their products with serial numbers and conduct background checks.
Gun owners, advocacy groups and companies that make or distribute the kits and components sued to challenge the regulations, saying that they were not authorized by the 1968 law.
That law defined firearms to include weapons that "may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive" and "the frame or receiver of any such weapon."
Judge Reed O'Connor, of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas, sided with the challengers and struck down the regulation in July, saying that "a weapon parts kit is not a firearm" and "that which may become or may be converted to a functional receiver is not itself a receiver."
He added: "Even if it is true that such an interpretation creates loopholes that as a policy matter should be avoided, it is not the role of the judiciary to correct them. That is up to Congress."
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, refused to stay key aspects of Judge O'Connor's ruling.
When the Supreme Court struck down a New York gun control law last year on Second Amendment grounds, it split along familiar lines, with the six Republican appointees in the majority and the three Democratic ones in dissent. The vote in the new case revealed a different fault line, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Barrett taking a more cautious approach than the other four conservatives.
In the government's emergency application, Ms. Prelogar asked the justices to consider an analogy.
"Every speaker of English would recognize that a tax on sales of 'bookshelves' applies to Ikea when it sells boxes of parts and the tools and instructions for assembling them into bookshelves," she wrote.
A Supreme Court brief from one set of challengers said the comparison was flawed.
"A better analogy would be to a 'taco kit' sold as a bundle by a grocery store that includes taco shells, seasoning packets, salsa and other toppings, along with a slab of raw beef," the brief said. "No one would call the taco kit a taco. In addition to 'assembly,' turning it into one would require cutting or grinding and cooking the meat -- and until that was done, it would be nonsensical to treat it as food and the equivalent of a taco."
The two sides also differed on whether there has been a spike in homemade firearms.
Ms. Prelogar wrote that there had been "an explosion of crimes involving ghost guns," pointing to a sworn statement from an A.T.F. official. More than 19,000 firearms without serial numbers were recovered by the authorities in 2021, the official said, compared with about 1,600 in 2017. He added that in the 11 months ending in July, "a total of approximately 23,452 suspected privately made firearms were recovered at crime scenes and submitted for tracing."
Such weapons are particularly attractive to criminals and minors, Ms. Prelogar wrote, adding that they "can be made from kits and parts that are available online to anyone with a credit card and that allow anyone with basic tools and rudimentary skills (or access to internet video tutorials) to assemble a fully functional firearm in as little as 20 minutes."
The challengers' brief questioned the Biden administration's data.
"The government's alleged 'epidemic' of privately made firearms traced by the police appears to be largely an artifact of police departments changing their tracing practices in response to A.T.F. pressure," the brief said, adding that "nothing in the government's submission demonstrates that firearms made by individuals for their own personal use are fueling an increase in crime."
The brief also objected to the phrase "ghost guns," calling it "a propaganda term that appears nowhere in federal law" and one that includes both firearms "that are manufactured lawfully by individuals and those that have their serial numbers illegally obliterated."

Celebrating Miyazaki Movie Magic at Ghibli Park: [Travel Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: One of our first infractions at Ghibli Park was hoisting our 1-year-old onto the polyester tummy of a woodland spirit creature. Another was letting him slip under a barricade and shelter inside a furry bus with cat eyes for headlights.
"He's not following the protocol," I told my wife, as the staff overseeing the cat-bus play zone looked on anxiously.
"He's making a mockery of it," she said. But we didn't stop him.
Ghibli Park, which opened in November outside Nagoya, Japan, pays homage to the eccentric, enchanting films of Studio Ghibli, a company co-founded in the 1980s by the director Hayao Miyazaki. We took our two toddlers there because their favorite movie is "My Neighbor Totoro," a beloved 1988 Miyazaki film starring the spirit creature and its cat-bus sidekick.
As parents, we thought it would be fun for our boys, 3 and 1, to experience a "Totoro" immersion. And as longtime Ghibli fans, we were keen to see what the place looked like.
American visitors may wonder how Ghibli Park compares with Disney World. It doesn't really. It feels much lower-key and has no rides, exotic animals, jumbo turkey legs or animatronic American presidents, among other things. The main point is to wander around soaking up Miyazaki vibes.
Also, the park is not finished. Grafted onto an existing municipal park, it opened late last year, but as of early July only three of five planned ticketed sites were open. When I booked for a June visit, tickets to only one of those sites -- a building called "Ghibli's Grand Warehouse" -- were available to international visitors reserving through the park's website. (It was possible to book the other two sites through Japanese travel agencies, but I only learned that much later, from a Japanese speaker.)
Susan Napier, a biographer of Mr. Miyazaki at Tufts University who visited Ghibli Park in April, told me that it had struck her as a "work in progress." She also described the ticketing process, which has included lotteries and long online queues, as "byzantine and not fun."
Maybe this is why Studio Ghibli itself seems ambivalent about promoting Ghibli Park. In Japan, it has run advertisements advising fans to "take your time" visiting.
A hypothetical theme park celebrating Nintendo or Pokemon, two other iconic Japanese creative brands, would almost certainly feel more Disney World-like, said Matt Alt, the author of the 2021 book "Pure Invention: How Japan's Pop Culture Conquered the World." But he added that the park's diffuse layout and low-key marketing were in character for a studio co-founded by Mr. Miyazaki, a director who has never hidden his anticapitalist politics.
Ghibli Park is not a place to "turn your brain off," Mr. Alt told me. "It demands a level of intellectual engagement that most parks do not." When I booked our visit, in March, a bit of mental stimulation sounded nice. I imagined wandering the grounds in dappled sunlight, musing on Mr. Miyazaki's cinematic oeuvre as our boys paused to collect acorns -- just as the two sisters who star in "Totoro" do. (The boys, who are Anglo-American, love the acorn scenes so much that they learned the Japanese word for the nut, donguri, before the English one.)
In reality, we arrived just before our three-hour afternoon visiting slot at Ghibli's Grand Warehouse, and our intellectual capacity was limited. Our parental nerves were fraying from the hourlong journey from Nagoya and the general struggle of moving tiny, diapered humans around an unfamiliar place.
Our morning in Nagoya had already been tarnished by a 4 a.m. wake up and some public displays of unchecked toddler emotion. On the grounds of the 17th century Nagoya Castle, for example, our 3-year-old, nicknamed T, burst into tears when he learned that the castle was closed for renovation.
To break his mood, we took the emergency measure of buying him and his brother, nicknamed B, ice cream cones as a second breakfast. That stopped the crying, but our mounting fatigue had raised the stakes for our visit to Ghibli Park. Would the trip to meet our favorite magical creatures make all the time, money and energy that it entailed worthwhile?
Ghibli Park may see a bump in domestic tourism this summer because Mr. Miyazaki released a new film in Japan this month. But, for my family, making a pilgrimage there was all about seeing Totoro and the cat bus.
"Totoro" follows the two sisters, Mei, 4, and Satsuki, 10, as they settle into a spooky house in the Japanese countryside with their father, an archaeologist. Their mother is stuck in a nearby sanitarium, suffering from an undisclosed illness.
After Mei meets Totoro by stumbling into its lair inside a giant camphor tree (and falls asleep on its tummy), she and her sister encounter the creature a few more times and learn more about its magical powers. Eventually, as their mother's condition appears to worsen, they call in some very important favors from Totoro and the wild-eyed cat bus.
Professor Napier told me that "Totoro" illustrates an aesthetic that runs through the Ghibli catalog, and which tends to be more ambiguous and subtle than Disney's. She described it as "the immersive, low-key magic of being a human being connected with other things."
"It's a world that you like," Professor Napier, who is writing a book comparing Ghibli with Disney, said of Mr. Miyazaki's animated universe. "But it's also full of the unexpected and complex, and sometimes scary."
Totoro and the cat bus can indeed be a little frightening, especially when they flash their teeth. But the movie is much sweeter than it is scary. It's set in "a time before television," as Mr. Miyazaki once told an interviewer, and infused with sublime, hand-drawn pastoral imagery -- pastel sunsets, a snail crawling up a plant stalk -- that makes you want to be a kid growing up in rural idyll.
The film also celebrates a child's sense of wonder. Mr. Miyazaki created "Totoro" with kids in mind -- he said he hoped it would make them want to pick acorns -- and many critics have seen it as an ode to childhood innocence. It's no accident that Totoro and the cat bus are visible only to the sisters, not adults.
Maybe this is why I still cry every time I watch the final credits roll: "Totoro" reminds me that my boys will never be this young or innocent again.
In our Seoul apartment, they play with Totoro and cat-bus dolls, sleep in Totoro pajamas and sit on a Totoro potty. Their fandom is so intense that my mother-in-law bought us tickets to a "Totoro" stage adaptation at the Barbican Theater during our last trip to London.
In Nagoya, before we left for Ghibli Park, B demonstrated his enthusiasm by bringing a plastic cat bus to the hotel buffet -- and feeding it a breakfast of whipped cream. He also showed the toy to a man in a ninja costume who posed for a selfie with us outside the castle.
The ninja cracked a knowing smile, indicating that he, too, was a "Totoro" fan. "Cat bus," he said in Japanese, as if the phrase were a code word.
Ghibli Park lies in Nagakute, a small city in the hills outside Nagoya, a few stops down a highway from an Ikea. There's no Ghibli entrance gate, exactly; you just wander into an unremarkable municipal park and look around for the Ghibli sites for which you have reserved tickets months in advance.
The Grand Warehouse is a sleek, multistory building the size of a modest mall or sports arena, with plenty of sunshine streaming in through skylights. It sits near a grassy lawn, an ice rink and some future Ghibli sites that are under construction.
Inside, there are replicas of structures from the films, including the towering bathhouse from the Oscar-winning 2001 film "Spirited Away," and dozens of made-for-Instagram tableaux of Ghibli scenes and props.
The attention to detail is striking. In an area devoted to the Ghibli film "Arietty," I saw a giant drop of plastic dew affixed to a giant fake flower, for example. Nearby was an intricately detailed replica of the castle from "Howl's Moving Castle," my older son's favorite Miyazaki film after "Totoro."
"The castle, daddy!" 3-year-old T said with delight. At last, a Japanese castle that didn't make him cry.
The problem was that most of the tableaux were mobbed with Ghibli fans -- and lines that we didn't have time to stand in with restless toddlers. The building's only restaurant was similarly oversubscribed. We eventually found a kiosk advertising cake, but the staff said that the cake had run out.
After about an hour of canvassing the warehouse, we headed for "Children's Town," a play area devoted to scenes from "Totoro" and other Ghibli films.
Children's Town has three rooms. The first is a labyrinth combining scenes from more Ghibli films than I could count: The orange train from "Laputa: Castle in the Sky," the bakery from "Kiki's Delivery Service" and so on. The boys loved it, even if daddy thwacked his head following them through a crawl space.
The other rooms were devoted to "Totoro" and had mercifully higher ceilings. There was the house where Mei and Satsuki live with their dad. Over there was the camphor tree, where a giant Totoro lay regally beside some oversize donguri. And in the far corner sat the majestic, furry cat bus.
It all looked fun, kid-friendly and immersive -- almost, in fact, like something you'd find at Disney World. The boys were in heaven.
"Toe-toe-row! Toe-toe-row!" B said, standing inside the tree, with the same intonation as the movie's rousing, marching-band-style theme song.
"Hey, Totoro!" said T, who had been carefully inspecting the giant acorns. "Wake up!"
But even though Children's Town seemed designed to nurture the child's sense of wonder that Mr. Miyazaki celebrates in his movies, the warehouse staff informed us of several rules that dampened the vibe. Notably, it was forbidden to put children on Totoro's plush tummy, or to allow them to play inside the cat bus zone for longer than three minutes -- even if the zone was not crowded, which it wasn't.
The staff members were friendly, but their rules made little sense for kids as small as ours. I wondered if that was another sign that Ghibli Park was still a bit rough around the edges. Take your time visiting, as the studio says.
We grudgingly agreed to the no-tummy policy, but B wished to play nowhere else but inside the cat bus. We were with him. We had spent several months -- a good chunk of his life! -- waiting for this moment.
The staff, sensing our resolve, suggested a compromise. A special time extension could be granted under the circumstances, they said. Rather than the usual three minutes, our B could have six.
Make that nine. Then 12. Et cetera. At 5 p.m., he was among last, and smallest, Ghibli fans to leave the building.

Can Revisions Save 'Miss Saigon' for the 21st Century?: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A revival reimagines the polarizing musical for the 21st century while a new show offers a bawdy riposte.
"Miss Saigon" is back and so, inevitably, is the surrounding discourse.
Claude-Michel Schönberg's musical melodrama about an ill-fated romance between a Vietnamese sex worker and an American G.I. during the Vietnam War has polarized opinion ever since it was first staged in 1989. In that original West End run, Jonathan Pryce donned yellowface to play a mixed-race pimp, and the show's critics have continued to raise concerns about its portrayal of East Asian people, particularly its tawdry sexualization of Vietnamese women.
So not everyone was pleased when the Crucible Theater in Sheffield, England, announced it would stage a new production of "Miss Saigon" this summer. A British East and Southeast Asian theater troupe pulled their own show from the playhouse in protest, saying the musical peddled "damaging tropes, misogyny and racism."
The boycott may have been unwarranted, however, as this new production -- directed by Robert Hastie and Anthony Lau under the auspices of the acclaimed producer Cameron Mackintosh, and running through Aug. 19 -- sets out to address those longstanding criticisms, reimagining the musical in line with 21st-century liberal sensibilities.
The outline of the story, heavily inspired by Puccini's 1904 opera "Madama Butterfly," is largely unchanged. Chris (a compellingly lugubrious Christian Maynard) meets Kim (Jessica Lee) in a brothel and they fall in love, but their affair ends abruptly when the Americans withdraw from Saigon. Three years later, Chris, now married to an American woman, learns that he has a young son by Kim. Kim tragically takes her own life in order to ensure her child will be raised by his father in the United States, and thus have a better life than she can provide for him.
But the play's look and feel have changed. For starters, there's the casting: The hitherto male role of the Engineer, the scheming pimp whose machinations provide much of the story's motive force, is here played with a suitably brash, pantomimic vitality by Joanna Ampil, who played Kim in two 1990s runs at London's Theater Royal Drury Lane; Chris and his wife, Ellen (Shanay Holmes), are played by Black, rather than white, actors. While this neatly sidesteps some of the baggage associated with Chris being a "white savior," it does feel a little gimmicky, since what really matters to the plot is his American passport.
More significantly, Ben Stones's splendid set design eschews the hackneyed visual imagery associated with this show. The action plays out around an imposing industrial staircase set against a large, dark gray metal screen cut with a geometric pattern, a forbidding backdrop evoking a decidedly unsentimental urban landscape, which is a far cry from the idyllic visions of rural bamboo huts often seen in "Miss Saigon" productions.
Lee excels as Kim, rendering her with a dignified stoicism that imbues her sorrowful ballads with pathos -- despite the music being objectively corny. Neither she nor her supporting ensemble in the brothel are overtly sexualized: they are just people, doing what they must to survive.
The directors Hastie and Lau have argued the case for "reshaping and transforming" problematic narratives rather than doing away with them entirely, and with some tweaks to the script, made with Schönberg's blessing, they have succeeded in creating a relatively tasteful and humane version of this perennially contentious musical.
Yet it's hard to shake the suspicion that Orientalist kitsch was integral to the shows's commercial appeal. Remove the defamiliarizing frisson of the exotic and you have, essentially, a love triangle with an immigration paperwork angle. It's still a heart-rending tale, but is it as much of a spectacle?
Forty miles down the road, audiences in Manchester have been enjoying "Untitled F*ck M*ss S**gon Play," which runs at the the Royal Exchange Theater through July 22 as part of the Manchester International Festival before transferring to London's Young Vic in September, and is every bit as irreverent as its title suggests.
Written by the New York-based dramatist Kimber Lee and directed by Roy Alexander Weise, it features a succession of mordant sendups of the "Madama Butterfly" and "Miss Saigon" narrative arc, in which several iterations of the Kim character (Mei Mac) repeatedly endure the same ill-treatment at the hands of a would-be white savior (Tom Weston-Jones) while a narrator (Rochelle Rose) provides knowingly wry commentary.
The series of sketches begin in 1906 (the year "Madama Butterfly" premiered in New York) and ends in mid-'70s Vietnam (the setting for "Miss Saigon"), with pop-cultural touchstones along the way including the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "South Pacific" and the TV series "M*A*S*H."
It's a bawdy and playful pastiche, with the Orientalist elements hammed up for comic effect, in Kim's ludicrously doll-like passivity and the generic "hut-like dwelling" in which the romance unfolds: "The whole place looks like Pier 1 and Cost Plus had a three-way with Ikea and this hut is their bastard mixed-race child," the narrator quips.
Kim's American lover speaks to her in a nonsensical language made up of assorted Asian words -- bulgogi, sashimi, onigiri -- which the narrator translates into English, a pointed callback to the use of gobbledygook in lieu of Vietnamese in productions of "Miss Saigon" from the 1990s.
Things take an autofictional turn when the setting shifts to a dinner party in present-day New York. Kim is now a struggling playwright burdened by a sense of responsibility to push back against decades of racially offensive caricatures on stage and screen. At this point the fun fizzles out somewhat, giving way to essayistic soul-searching.
Kim's mother, Rosie (Lourdes Faberes), delivers an impassioned monologue on behalf of first-generation immigrants, explaining that insensitive representations were something they had to take in their stride. She would like her daughter to be less zealous, and just live her life. A friend implores Kim to make peace with the past, reminding her that American society has come a long way: "We could stop here. We could stay here. It's not so bad, is it?"
It's a vibrant, funny and intelligent show, but that loss of momentum in the latter stages exposes the limitations of activist theater in which the primary creative impulse is corrective: Once you've made your point, there is nowhere left to go.
In this regard, "Untitled F*ck M*ss S**gon Play" shares similarities with the new "Miss Saigon," a show whose moral and aesthetic merit derives primarily from what it omits -- the offensive caricature, the crass fetishism -- rather than what it contains.
These productions function as valuable cultural palate cleansers. But the drive to sanitize problematic content is, ultimately, a matter of commercial self-preservation: Juggernaut brands like "Miss Saigon" are too lucrative to be allowed to die.
Having outlived its relevance, the musical is doomed to an afterlife of well-meaning but slightly anodyne remakes as it slowly, inexorably fades into oblivion.

Full text: In 1973, Uri Geller claimed to bend metal with his mind on live television. Skeptics couldn't beat him. Now they've joined him.
In 1973, a young man named Uri Geller appeared on one of the BBC's most popular television shows, "The Dimbleby Talk-In," and announced that the laws of Newtonian physics did not apply to him. Or that, at least, was the implication. A handsome 26-year-old Israeli, dressed casually and flanked by a pair of academics, Mr. Geller performed a series of bewildering feats using nothing more, he said, than his mind.
He restarted a stopped watch. He duplicated a drawing that had been sealed in an envelope. Then he appeared to bend a fork simply by staring at it.
"It's cracking," Mr. Geller said quietly, speaking over a tight shot of his right hand, which was gently rubbing the fork between his fingers. "It's becoming like plastic."
A few seconds later, the top of the fork fell off and hit the ground. By the time the applause of the studio audience died down, Gellermania had begun.
Mr. Geller became not just a global celebrity -- a media darling who toured the world and filled auditoriums for dramatic demonstrations of cutlery abuse, with the humble spoon becoming his victim of choice -- but also the living embodiment of the hope that there was something more, something science couldn't explain. Because at the core of his performance was a claim of boggling audacity: that these were not tricks.
They were displays of raw psychic powers.
"I've never even seen a magic show," Mr. Geller, now a lean and tireless 76-year-old, said during a recent interview in Tel Aviv at the Uri Geller Museum, which he opened in 2021. "Except one: Siegfried and Roy in Las Vegas, because I missed a flight."
Charm and a seemingly bottomless supply of chutzpah were essential to his fame, and with fame came a one-man, multimillion-dollar enterprise, built on sales of tickets and books, and the reality TV show "The Next Uri Geller," which had versions in Israel, in the United States and around Europe.
It's a fortune he might have never earned, he said, without a group of highly agitated critics. Mr. Geller was long shadowed by a handful of professional magicians appalled that someone was fobbing off what they said were expertly finessed magic tricks as acts of telekinesis. Like well-matched heavyweights, they pummeled one another in the '70s and '80s in televised contests that elevated them all.
Mr. Geller ultimately emerged the victor in this war, and proof of his triumph is now on display in the museum: a coffee-table book titled "Bend It Like Geller," which was written by the Australian magician Ben Harris and published in May.
Timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the "Talk-In" appearance, the book celebrates Mr. Geller as a brilliant and highly original magical entertainer. Which represents a significant change of heart for Mr. Harris, who was once among Mr. Geller's most avid debunkers.
Today, Mr. Harris and Mr. Geller are friends who text or talk nearly every day. Mr. Harris looks back at his 1985 attack book, "Gellerism Revealed," as the work of an angry young man who had missed the point.
And the point is that Mr. Geller is an entertainer, one who'd figured out that challenging our relationship to the truth, and daring us to doubt our eyes, can inspire a kind of wonder, if performed convincingly enough. Mr. Geller's bent spoons are, in a sense, the analog precursors of digital deep fakes -- images, videos and sounds, reconfigured through software, so that anyone can be made to say or do anything.
Unlike a lot of self-help gurus, yogis and crackpot messiahs who rose to prominence in the early-1970s age of weird, Mr. Geller endured and his cultural impact proved both singular and lasting. Ikea produced a Geller stool, which had bent, wavy legs. Nintendo made a spoon-wielding Pokémon character, Kadabra, who could cause clocks to run backward. References to Mr. Geller, or mangled silverware, have appeared in songs by R.E.M., Toad the Wet Sprocket and Incubus, and made a memorable cameo in "The Matrix."
"It's not the spoon that bends," a bald tyke in a robe tells Neo, Keanu Reeves's character. "It is only yourself."
A mere handful of magicians have left anything close to this kind of imprint. If Mr. Geller can't actually bend metal with his brain -- and civility and fairness demands this "if" -- he is the author of a benign charade, which is a pretty good definition of a magic trick. Small wonder that the anti-Geller brigade has laid down its arms and led a rapprochement with the working professionals of magic. He is a reminder that people thrill at the sense that they are either watching a miracle or getting bamboozled. And now that fakery is routinely weaponized online, Mr. Geller's claims to superpowers seem almost innocent.
"I mean this in the most respectful way," said Andy Nyman, a magician and actor who a few years ago introduced a lecture by Mr. Geller at the Blackpool Magic Convention, an appearance that cemented this truce. "I think the world is aware that if he's fraudulent, there are bigger lies and bigger frauds out there that are far more damaging."
The best publicist in the world
A sloping 53-foot, 11-ton spoon made of rusting steel sits outside the Uri Geller Museum, in the ancient neighborhood of Old Jaffa. Throughout the day, tourists gather to gawk at the sculpture, and when Mr. Geller spots them, he often bounds down a flight of stairs to say hello and offer a quick performance.
"Where are you all from?" he asked a group of Austrians who gathered there one afternoon in May. As they answered, he quickly began to rub a spoon, which appeared to droop in his hands, that he autographed and tossed into the crowd, like a bouquet of flowers at a wedding.
"Thank you for coming to Israel!" he shouted as he walked off, to a round of applause.
The impromptu show lasted about a minute. He came, he bent, he left.
Mr. Geller is a vegan who doesn't drink or smoke, and he is always either moving or talking, usually both. During five hours of interviews over two days, he repeatedly said that he was shameless, which turns out to be one of his most winning qualities. He has a spoon tattooed on his right arm, which bends when he brings his hand to his shoulder, a hammy sight gag he'll perform for anyone.
He is less dogmatic about claims to otherworldly gifts now, preferring to call himself a "mystifier." Time and again, he emphasized his chops as a performer, a man who could mesmerize an audience, largely through ad-libbed interactions and charisma. When young magicians come and ask for advice, he suggests what amounts to a makeover.
"I tell them, 'Wear Armani T-shirts, buy Hermès after-shave, fix your teeth, smile a lot, be nice to people,"' he said, sitting in a chair in the middle of the museum. "This is the way to become famous and loved by your audience."
Mr. Geller never retired, though he doesn't travel much any more and spends nearly every day here, giving group tours -- no walk-ins, please -- to roughly 250 people each week. He spent $ 6 million buying and four years refurbishing the Ottoman-era soap factory, an investment he knows he will never recoup.
He and Hanna, his wife of 52 years, decided in 2015 to leave England, where the couple had raised their two now-adult children. The family had lived in a nine-bedroom mansion in a village outside London, with a Jacuzzi, tennis court, helicopter pad and glass meditation pyramid. His next-door neighbor was George Clooney; Jimmy Page lived down the street. The house is on the market for the equivalent of just under $ 10 million.
In Britain, Mr. Geller maintained the sort of profile that got him invited to appear on the TV show "I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!" as he found endless ways to insert himself into the news -- offering to stop Brexit telekinetically, taking credit for dislodging the tanker that was stuck in the Suez Canal.
"I'm the best publicist in the world, come on," he said, matter-of-factly. "You can promote Coca-Cola, you can promote a car. It doesn't matter, as long as you use my techniques, which are brilliant."
The museum tour he offers is a strange, slightly maddening way to spend an hour. Mr. Geller is a self-professed hoarder, and the place is essentially the contents of his attic, or a few storage bins, tastefully laid out as a permanent exhibition.
With a wireless microphone in hand, he seems intent on introducing visitors to every curio in the building. Here is a sculpture of a horse made of driftwood. That's a table designed by Versace. This is a piece of marble from the United Nations.
"Yoko Ono, amazing woman," he said, pausing by one of dozens of photographs. "She always wears Porsche glasses."
By the time you get to the 1976 Cadillac Fleetwood, covered with a few thousand bent spoons, you realize that the Uri Geller story isn't told at the Uri Geller Museum in a tour by Uri Geller. The experience ends with a somewhat perfunctory spoon bending ("Doesn't matter how I do it, whether it's real or not") and then a slightly off-key version of "My Way," in a recording sung by Mr. Geller himself, which plays over a montage of our hero with famous people -- including Salvador Dalí and Muhammad Ali.
"I have so many questions," said Gila Bublick, an American living in Israel, who was on the tour, sounding exhilarated and befuddled.
No questions were taken. Asked the next day why so little of his biography was in the tour, Mr. Geller said he thought his possessions were more interesting than his story.
Which is wrong.
Shouting 'Bend!' in unison
By the time Mr. Geller appeared on "The Dimbleby Talk-In," his career had already endured several near-death experiences. Raised in poverty as an only child, he said the first time he bent a spoon was while eating mushroom soup in his mother's kitchen around age 5. It didn't occur to him that this could be a profession until many years later, after he had left the army and was working as a courier and part-time model. At a photo shoot, he bent a photographer's key.
"The guy freaked out and said, 'I'm having a house party tonight, will you come and demonstrate your powers because nobody is going to believe me,"' Mr. Geller recalled. "I go and I'm stunned. I'm stunned by the reaction."
He soon was paid to perform at other parties, then small theaters, then larger ones. Each performance was unscripted and chaotic, its lack of polish only enhancing the sense that this was not a show.
Word spread about this hunky guy with the paranormal act. His first setback came in 1970, when a public relations man concocted and published a fabricated image of Mr. Geller with Sophia Loren, whom he'd visited in Rome. Ms. Loren's objections made front-page news in Israel, and Mr. Geller assumed he was finished. He asked his manager to cancel that evening's show in Haifa.
"I get to the theater that night, there are 400 people outside without tickets," he said. "It was sold out. That's when I realized controversy, for me, is a diamond on a silver platter."
There were soon more platters. In 1973, he was a guest on "The Tonight Show," and for 20 intensely awkward minutes Mr. Geller didn't even try to bend the objects laid out in front of him. (The vibe was wrong, he explained.) Astonishingly, viewers seemed to regard the failure as a sign of authenticity. Only someone at the mercy of the universe's unpredictable vibrations, went the theory, could have flopped like that.
His appearance on "The Dimbleby Talk-In," a few months later, was the performance of a daredevil who doesn't need a motorcycle to risk his life.
The two academics who sat on either side of Mr. Geller were, it turned out, both fans of the paranormal. (One, Lyall Watson, argued in a book that the emotions of plants could be registered on a lie detector.) The role of rational observer fell that evening to David Berglas, one of Britain's most famous magicians, who had been invited backstage by the show's host, David Dimbleby, to offer an instant assessment.
Now 96 years old, Mr. Berglas remembered the conversation in a recent phone interview.
"Can you do that?" Mr. Dimbleby asked him when the show was over.
"Of course," Mr. Berglas said. He then picked up a teaspoon and bent it after a brief rub.
"Yes," Mr. Dimbleby said, unimpressed, "but you're a magician."
'I basically call him a fraud'
One early Geller devotee was Mr. Harris, who watched the "Dimbleby" show from his grandparents' home in Sydney, Australia. He was 15 at the time and already a performing magician. After the broadcast, as instructed by Mr. Geller, he went to the kitchen, grabbed a utensil and willed it to bend. It did.
"I was totally sucked in," he said in a recent phone interview. "If it had been presented as a magic trick, I would have figured it out immediately. But this was something else, something standing on the edge of the unknown."
It was also something new. Psychic metal bending wasn't among the dozen or so genres of magic, like card tricks or levitation. And this guy didn't dress the part. He wore street clothes and lacked a patter. Briefly, Mr. Harris said, he imagined a better world, one in which the energy crisis was solved, in part, by mind power. Because if one guy could bend a fork, who knows what a few million people could achieve?
By 1976, Mr. Harris was becoming a doubter. That year, he attended a Geller show in Brisbane, along with about 4,000 others, and remembers an eccentric, riveting performance with a tray of spoons and keys provided by the audience and stretches of silence punctuated by inexplicable bends. After the show, Mr. Harris managed to get backstage, the first and only time he met Mr. Geller in person. He handed him a matchbox, wrapped in tinfoil and tape, containing a piece of metal.
"It was a challenge from a hyperactive young man," Mr. Harris said during a recent video call with Mr. Geller. "He started to unravel it, then said: 'No, no, no, you take it home, unravel it. See if it's bent and let me know."'
It was not bent. By then, Mr. Harris realized that the slight anomaly in his grandparents' spoon three years earlier had been there all along. Like many collections of well-worn utensils, they varied in curvature, something nobody ever had reason to notice until then.
Mr. Harris felt hoodwinked, which is why the book "Gellerism Revealed" is infused with the rage of disillusionment.
"I basically call him a fraud and charlatan," he said.
James Randi, a Canadian magician and escape artist, known professionally as the Amazing Randi, went much further. A relative unknown at the time, Mr. Randi, who eventually won a MacArthur Fellowship as a professional skeptic, was the loudest anti-Geller voice in the world.
"He is intending to enter the 'psychic healing' field soon, and when he starts into that racket he can kill people," he wrote in an edition of his book "The Truth About Uri Geller." He also called Mr. Geller a "dangerous and insidious figure," one he intended to stop "at all costs."
Those costs, it turned out, were high. Mr. Geller filed defamation lawsuits against Mr. Randi, including one for claiming that Mr. Geller was performing tricks once taught on the back of cereal boxes. The so-called cornflakes case ended with a dismissal, but over the years Mr. Randi burned through most of his $ 272,000 MacArthur grant covering personal legal expenses. He died three years ago and apparently loathed his nemesis to the end. He once asked that someone throw his cremated ashes into Mr. Geller's eyes, an obituary in The Economist stated.
The vitriol is a little hard to fathom. It's true that Mr. Geller had a lucrative side hustle in the 1980s working for mining companies who thought his putative psychic powers could help them determine where to dig. In a 1986 Financial Times story, he said that his standard fee was 1 million pounds per assignment, $ 3 million in inflation-adjusted terms, and that 11 companies had retained him.
Mr. Geller's track record as a prospector is not known, and he says he can't remember. But he never went into faith healing, nor did he charge enough to leave many with a case of buyer's remorse. He performed live shows and wrote books like "Use Your Psychic Powers to Have It All."
So watching the Geller haters now is like watching people run into nursery schools shouting that there is no Santa Claus. Consider Mr. Randi's appearance on Barbara Walters's talk show in 1974. He arrived soon after Mr. Geller had been there and entranced the host by bending her door key, apparently with his mind. Mr. Randi had now come to prove that there was nothing psychic about this feat.
"Here is my identical key," Ms. Walters told Mr. Randi, challenging him to equal Mr. Geller, and clearly hoping he would fail. "Touch it and make it bend."
A few moments later, the key is bent. Ms. Walters deflates. Suddenly, Mr. Geller seemed like a workaday huckster and the world seemed a little duller. She looked at the key that Mr. Randi had just bent and began theatrically boohooing, as if to say, "Thanks for nothing, you buzz killer."
The new sleight of hand
The science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke wrote that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic," and today magic and technology are merging. Start-ups in the field of artificial intelligence are the new masters of illusion; algorithms are the new sleight of hand.
"Geller's bent spoon demonstrations and deep fakes both create this conflict between what we think is possible and what we're seeing," said Alice Pailhès, an author of "The Psychology of Magic." "Both elicit strong emotional responses -- confusion, delight, distress, maybe even paranoia."
The stakes, of course, are different. Get fooled by a spoon bender and you're likely to end up with a smile on your face. Get fooled by a pernicious deep fake and you might end up believing that video posted last year of President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine appearing to surrender, or something else that is false and noxious. This time, it's going to take much more than Mr. Randi and Ben Harris to flag the frauds.
The upsides of digital fakes have, inevitably, intrigued more than a few magicians. Drummond Money-Coutts, the English conjurer who starred in the Netflix series "Death by Magic," said in an interview that he was looking into possibilities presented by Midjourney, the program used to produce an image of Pope Francis in a Balenciaga puffer jacket that went viral a few months ago. He still prefers nondigital methods, though, which he attributes in no small part to the influence of Mr. Geller.
Mr. Money-Coutts first met Mr. Geller in 2003. A student at the British prep school Eton who was a budding magician, he invited Mr. Geller to perform for 700 gobsmacked schoolboys. ("I was told to write a letter to the catering department to apologize because they basically had no spoons for weeks after he came," Mr. Money-Coutts recalled.) Mr. Geller had relocated to Britain by then, having spent 12 tumultuous years in the United States, most of them in New York City.
While there, he had gotten rich, but he wasn't equipped for money or fame on this scale, and he was rattled by the verbal assaults. He struggled with panic attacks and became anorexic and bulimic. He also shopped compulsively, once buying 100 silk shirts during a visit to a Brioni store in Milan, few of which he ended up wearing.
"It was decadence," he said. "I had 10 Gucci suitcases, leather Gucci suitcases. Do you know how much they cost?"
Mr. Geller gradually regained his mental equilibrium, though his taste for luxury proved hard to shake. When he moved to Britain in the mid-80s -- a relative suggested it would be a better place to raise a family -- he fell in love with a house in Sonning, a village 40 miles west of London, because it reminded him of Graceland and the White House. He more than doubled the square footage of the place, adding bedrooms, a cinema room and gold-plated bathroom fixtures. At some point, about six years ago, it all started to seem berserk.
"I just looked at the marble and the crystal chandeliers," he said of Sonning Court, as the house is known, "and I thought, 'I've got to get out of this."'
He wanted to radically downsize, he said, and today he lives in a modest one-bedroom apartment not far from where he grew up. He has settled where he began. On the off chance that he can't truly bend metal with his mind, he has done something less miraculous but nearly as implausible: He has earned a very comfortable living for 50 years performing what is essentially the most acclaimed party trick of all time.
Now and then, he speaks to magicians, giving tips and what are essentially motivational speeches. Be original, be persistent, stick with a persona, he tells listeners. At the Blackpool Magic Convention in February 2020, he gave all that advice to a packed room, and he performed a newish effect. He poured radish seeds into his hand and asked everyone to chant "Sprout!" over and over. As he swirled the seeds with a finger, a close-up camera showed a green shoot that seemed to materialize in the middle of his hand, as though it had been willed to blossom.
"Among magicians," asked a cheeky young man, during the question and answer part of the presentation, "was that a magic trick? Did you sneak a bit of cress in with your seeds?"
"Are you serious?" Mr. Geller all but shouted, more amused than galled. "Do you really think that I'm going to say at the age of 73 that this was a trick? Get a life!"

TEL AVIV, Israel — In 1973, a young man named Uri Geller appeared on one of the BBC’s most popular television shows, “The Dimbleby Talk-In,” and announced that the laws of Newtonian physics did not apply to him. Or that, at least, was the implication. A handsome 26-year-old Israeli, dressed casually and flanked by a pair of academics, Geller performed a series of bewildering feats using nothing more, he said, than his mind.
He restarted a stopped watch. He duplicated a drawing that had been sealed in an envelope. Then he appeared to bend a fork simply by staring at it.
“It’s cracking,” Geller said quietly, speaking over a tight shot of his right hand, which was gently rubbing the fork between his fingers. “It’s becoming like plastic.”
A few seconds later, the top of the fork fell off and hit the ground. By the time the applause of the studio audience died down, Gellermania had begun.
Geller became not just a global celebrity — a media darling who toured the world and filled auditoriums for dramatic demonstrations of cutlery abuse, with the humble spoon becoming his victim of choice — but also the living embodiment of the hope that there was something more, something science couldn’t explain. Because at the core of his performance was a claim of boggling audacity: that these were not tricks.
They were displays of raw psychic powers.
“I’ve never even seen a magic show,” Geller, now a lean and tireless 76-year-old, said during a recent interview in Tel Aviv at the Uri Geller Museum, which he opened in 2021. “Except one: Siegfried and Roy in Las Vegas, because I missed a flight.”
Charm and a seemingly bottomless supply of chutzpah were essential to his fame, and with fame came a one-man, multimillion-dollar enterprise, built on sales of tickets and books, and the reality TV show “The Next Uri Geller,” which had versions in Israel, in the United States and around Europe.
It’s a fortune he might have never earned, he said, without a group of highly agitated critics. Geller was long shadowed by a handful of professional magicians appalled that someone was fobbing off what they said were expertly finessed magic tricks as acts of telekinesis. Like well-matched heavyweights, they pummeled one another in the ’70s and ’80s in televised contests that elevated them all.
Geller ultimately emerged the victor in this war, and proof of his triumph is now on display in the museum: a coffee-table book titled “Bend It Like Geller,” which was written by Australian magician Ben Harris and published in May.
Timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the “Talk-In” appearance, the book celebrates Geller as a brilliant and highly original magical entertainer. Which represents a significant change of heart for Harris, who was once among Geller’s most avid debunkers.
Today, Harris and Geller are friends who text or talk nearly every day. Harris looks back at his 1985 attack book, “Gellerism Revealed,” as the work of an angry young man who had missed the point.
And the point is that Geller is an entertainer, one who’d figured out that challenging our relationship to the truth, and daring us to doubt our eyes, can inspire a kind of wonder, if performed convincingly enough. Geller’s bent spoons are, in a sense, the analogue precursors of digital deepfakes — images, videos and sounds, reconfigured through software, so that anyone can be made to say or do anything.
Unlike a lot of self-help gurus, yogis and crackpot messiahs who rose to prominence in the early-1970s age of weird, Geller endured and his cultural impact proved both singular and lasting. Ikea produced a Geller stool, which had bent, wavy legs. Nintendo made a spoon-wielding Pokémon character, Kadabra, who could cause clocks to run backward. References to Geller, or mangled silverware, have appeared in songs by R.E.M., Toad the Wet Sprocket and Incubus, and made a memorable cameo in “The Matrix.”
“It’s not the spoon that bends,” a bald tyke in a robe tells Neo, Keanu Reeves’ character. “It is only yourself.”
A mere handful of magicians have left anything close to this kind of imprint. If Geller can’t actually bend metal with his brain — and civility and fairness demands this “if” — he is the author of a benign charade, which is a pretty good definition of a magic trick. Small wonder that the anti-Geller brigade has laid down its arms and led a rapprochement with the working professionals of magic. He is a reminder that people thrill at the sense that they are either watching a miracle or getting bamboozled. And now that fakery is routinely weaponized online, Geller’s claims to superpowers seem almost innocent.
“I mean this in the most respectful way,” said Andy Nyman, a magician and actor who a few years ago introduced a lecture by Geller at the Blackpool Magic Convention, an appearance that cemented this truce. “I think the world is aware that if he’s fraudulent, there are bigger lies and bigger frauds out there that are far more damaging.”
The Best Publicist in the World
A sloping 53-foot, 11-ton spoon made of rusting steel sits outside the Uri Geller Museum, in the ancient neighborhood of Old Jaffa. Throughout the day, tourists gather to gawk at the sculpture, and when Geller spots them, he often bounds down a flight of stairs to say hello and offer a quick performance.
“Where are you all from?” he asked a group of Austrians who gathered there one afternoon in May. As they answered, he quickly began to rub a spoon, which appeared to droop in his hands, that he autographed and tossed into the crowd, like a bouquet of flowers at a wedding.
“Thank you for coming to Israel!” he shouted as he walked off, to a round of applause.
The impromptu show lasted about a minute. He came, he bent, he left.
Geller is a vegan who doesn’t drink or smoke, and he is always either moving or talking, usually both. During five hours of interviews over two days, he repeatedly said that he was shameless, which turns out to be one of his most winning qualities. He has a spoon tattooed on his right arm, which bends when he brings his hand to his shoulder, a hammy sight gag he’ll perform for anyone.
He is less dogmatic about claims to otherworldly gifts now, preferring to call himself a “mystifier.” Time and again, he emphasized his chops as a performer, a man who could mesmerize an audience, largely through ad-libbed interactions and charisma. When young magicians come and ask for advice, he suggests what amounts to a makeover.
“I tell them, ‘Wear Armani T-shirts, buy Hermès after-shave, fix your teeth, smile a lot, be nice to people,’” he said, sitting in a chair in the middle of the museum. “This is the way to become famous and loved by your audience.”
Geller never retired, although he doesn’t travel much anymore and spends nearly every day here, giving group tours — no walk-ins, please — to roughly 250 people each week. He spent $6 million buying and four years refurbishing the Ottoman-era soap factory, an investment he knows he will never recoup.
He and Hanna, his wife of 52 years, decided in 2015 to leave England, where the couple had raised their two now-adult children. The family had lived in a nine-bedroom mansion in a village outside London, with a Jacuzzi, tennis court, helicopter pad and glass meditation pyramid. His next-door neighbor was George Clooney; Jimmy Page lived down the street. The house is on the market for the equivalent of just under $10 million.
In Britain, Geller maintained the sort of profile that got him invited to appear on the TV show “I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!” as he found endless ways to insert himself into the news — offering to stop Brexit telekinetically, taking credit for dislodging the tanker that was stuck in the Suez Canal.
“I’m the best publicist in the world, come on,” he said, matter-of-factly. “You can promote Coca-Cola, you can promote a car. It doesn’t matter, as long as you use my techniques, which are brilliant.”
The museum tour he offers is a strange, slightly maddening way to spend an hour. Geller is a self-professed hoarder, and the place is essentially the contents of his attic, or a few storage bins, tastefully laid out as a permanent exhibition.
With a wireless microphone in hand, he seems intent on introducing visitors to every curio in the building. Here is a sculpture of a horse made of driftwood. That’s a table designed by Versace. This is a piece of marble from the United Nations.
“Yoko Ono, amazing woman,” he said, pausing by one of dozens of photographs. “She always wears Porsche glasses.”
By the time you get to the 1976 Cadillac Fleetwood, covered with a few thousand bent spoons, you realize that the Uri Geller story isn’t told at the Uri Geller Museum in a tour by Uri Geller. The experience ends with a somewhat perfunctory spoon bending (“Doesn’t matter how I do it, whether it’s real or not”) and then a slightly off-key version of “My Way,” in a recording sung by Geller, which plays over a montage of our hero with famous people — including Salvador Dalí and Muhammad Ali.
“I have so many questions,” said Gila Bublick, an American living in Israel, who was on the tour, sounding exhilarated and befuddled.
No questions were taken. Asked the next day why so little of his biography was in the tour, Geller said he thought his possessions were more interesting than his story.
Which is wrong.
Shouting ‘Bend!’ in Unison
By the time Geller appeared on “The Dimbleby Talk-In,” his career had already endured several near-death experiences. Raised in poverty as an only child, he said the first time he bent a spoon was while eating mushroom soup in his mother’s kitchen around age 5. It didn’t occur to him that this could be a profession until many years later, after he had left the army and was working as a courier and part-time model. At a photo shoot, he bent a photographer’s key.
“The guy freaked out and said, ‘I’m having a house party tonight. Will you come and demonstrate your powers because nobody is going to believe me,’” Geller recalled. “I go and I’m stunned. I’m stunned by the reaction.”
He soon was paid to perform at other parties, then small theaters, then larger ones. Each performance was unscripted and chaotic, its lack of polish only enhancing the sense that this was not a show.
Word spread about this hunky guy with the paranormal act. His first setback came in 1970, when a public relations man concocted and published a fabricated image of Geller with Sophia Loren, whom he’d visited in Rome. Loren’s objections made front-page news in Israel, and Geller assumed he was finished. He asked his manager to cancel that evening’s show in Haifa.
“I get to the theater that night; there are 400 people outside without tickets,” he said. “It was sold out. That’s when I realized controversy, for me, is a diamond on a silver platter.”
There were soon more platters. In 1973, he was a guest on “The Tonight Show,” and for 20 intensely awkward minutes, Geller didn’t even try to bend the objects laid out in front of him. (The vibe was wrong, he explained.) Astonishingly, viewers seemed to regard the failure as a sign of authenticity. Only someone at the mercy of the universe’s unpredictable vibrations, went the theory, could have flopped like that.
His appearance on “The Dimbleby Talk-In,” a few months later, was the performance of a daredevil who doesn’t need a motorcycle to risk his life.
The two academics who sat on either side of Geller were, it turned out, both fans of the paranormal. (One, Lyall Watson, argued in a book that the emotions of plants could be registered on a lie detector.) The role of rational observer fell that evening to David Berglas, one of Britain’s most famous magicians, who had been invited backstage by the show’s host, David Dimbleby, to offer an instant assessment.
Now 96 years old, Berglas remembered the conversation in a recent phone interview.
“Can you do that?” Dimbleby asked him when the show was over.
“Of course,” Berglas said. He then picked up a teaspoon and bent it after a brief rub.
“Yes,” Dimbleby said, unimpressed, “but you’re a magician.”
‘I Basically Call Him a Fraud’
One early Geller devotee was Harris, who watched the “Dimbleby” show from his grandparents’ home in Sydney. He was 15 at the time and already a performing magician. After the broadcast, as instructed by Geller, he went to the kitchen, grabbed a utensil and willed it to bend. It did.
“I was totally sucked in,” he said in a recent phone interview. “If it had been presented as a magic trick, I would have figured it out immediately. But this was something else, something standing on the edge of the unknown.”
It was also something new. Psychic metal bending wasn’t among the dozen or so genres of magic, like card tricks or levitation. And this guy didn’t dress the part. He wore street clothes and lacked a patter. Briefly, Harris said, he imagined a better world, one in which the energy crisis was solved, in part, by mind power. Because if one guy could bend a fork, who knows what a few million people could achieve?
By 1976, Harris was becoming a doubter. That year, he attended a Geller show in Brisbane, Australia, along with about 4,000 others, and remembers an eccentric, riveting performance with a tray of spoons and keys provided by the audience and stretches of silence punctuated by inexplicable bends. After the show, Harris managed to get backstage, the first and only time he met Geller in person. He handed him a matchbox, wrapped in tinfoil and tape, containing a piece of metal.
“It was a challenge from a hyperactive young man,” Harris said during a recent video call with Geller. “He started to unravel it, then said: ‘No, no, no, you take it home, unravel it. See if it’s bent and let me know.’”
It was not bent. By then, Harris realized that the slight anomaly in his grandparents’ spoon three years earlier had been there all along. Like many collections of well-worn utensils, they varied in curvature, something nobody ever had reason to notice until then.
Harris felt hoodwinked, which is why the book “Gellerism Revealed” is infused with the rage of disillusionment.
“I basically call him a fraud and charlatan,” he said.
James Randi, a Canadian magician and escape artist, known professionally as the Amazing Randi, went much further. A relative unknown at the time, Randi, who eventually won a MacArthur Fellowship as a professional skeptic, was the loudest anti-Geller voice in the world.
“He is intending to enter the ‘psychic healing’ field soon, and when he starts into that racket he can kill people,” he wrote in an edition of his book “The Truth About Uri Geller.” He also called Geller a “dangerous and insidious figure,” one he intended to stop “at all costs.”
Those costs, it turned out, were high. Geller filed defamation lawsuits against Randi, including one for claiming that Geller was performing tricks once taught on the back of cereal boxes. The so-called cornflakes case ended with a dismissal, but over the years Randi burned through most of his $272,000 MacArthur grant covering personal legal expenses. He died three years ago and apparently loathed his nemesis to the end. He once asked that someone throw his cremated ashes into Geller’s eyes, an obituary in The Economist stated.
The vitriol is a little hard to fathom. It’s true that Geller had a lucrative side hustle in the 1980s working for mining companies that thought his putative psychic powers could help them determine where to dig. In a 1986 Financial Times story, he said that his standard fee was 1 million pounds per assignment, $3 million in inflation-adjusted terms, and that 11 companies had retained him.
Geller’s track record as a prospector is not known, and he says he can’t remember. But he never went into faith healing, nor did he charge enough to leave many with a case of buyer’s remorse. He performed live shows and wrote books like “Use Your Psychic Powers to Have It All.”
So watching the Geller haters now is like watching people run into nursery schools shouting that there is no Santa Claus. Consider Randi’s appearance on Barbara Walters’ talk show in 1974. He arrived soon after Geller had been there and entranced the host by bending her door key, apparently with his mind. Randi had now come to prove that there was nothing psychic about this feat.
“Here is my identical key,” Walters told Randi, challenging him to equal Geller, and clearly hoping he would fail. “Touch it and make it bend.”
A few moments later, the key is bent. Walters deflates. Suddenly, Geller seemed like a workaday huckster and the world seemed a little duller. She looked at the key that Randi had just bent and began theatrically boohooing, as if to say, “Thanks for nothing, you buzz killer.”
The New Sleight of Hand
Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke wrote that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” and today magic and technology are merging. Startups in the field of artificial intelligence are the new masters of illusion; algorithms are the new sleight of hand.
“Geller’s bent spoon demonstrations and deepfakes both create this conflict between what we think is possible and what we’re seeing,” said Alice Pailhès, an author of “The Psychology of Magic.” “Both elicit strong emotional responses — confusion, delight, distress, maybe even paranoia.”
The stakes, of course, are different. Get fooled by a spoon bender and you’re likely to end up with a smile on your face. Get fooled by a pernicious deepfake and you might end up believing that video posted last year of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine appearing to surrender, or something else that is false and noxious. This time, it’s going to take much more than Randi and Harris to flag the frauds.
The upsides of digital fakes have, inevitably, intrigued more than a few magicians. Drummond Money-Coutts, the English conjurer who starred in the Netflix series “Death by Magic,” said in an interview that he was looking into possibilities presented by Midjourney, the program used to produce an image of Pope Francis in a Balenciaga puffer jacket that went viral a few months ago. He still prefers nondigital methods, though, which he attributes in no small part to the influence of Geller.
Money-Coutts first met Geller in 2003. A student at British prep school Eton who was a budding magician, he invited Geller to perform for 700 gobsmacked schoolboys. (“I was told to write a letter to the catering department to apologize because they basically had no spoons for weeks after he came,” Money-Coutts recalled.) Geller had relocated to Britain by then, having spent 12 tumultuous years in the United States, most of them in New York City.
While there, he had gotten rich, but he wasn’t equipped for money or fame on this scale, and he was rattled by the verbal assaults. He struggled with panic attacks and became anorexic and bulimic. He also shopped compulsively, once buying 100 silk shirts during a visit to a Brioni store in Milan, few of which he ended up wearing.
“It was decadence,” he said. “I had 10 Gucci suitcases, leather Gucci suitcases. Do you know how much they cost?”
Geller gradually regained his mental equilibrium, although his taste for luxury proved hard to shake. When he moved to Britain in the mid-’80s — a relative suggested it would be a better place to raise a family — he fell in love with a house in Sonning, a village 40 miles west of London, because it reminded him of Graceland and the White House. He more than doubled the square footage of the place, adding bedrooms, a cinema room and gold-plated bathroom fixtures. At some point, about six years ago, it all started to seem berserk.
“I just looked at the marble and the crystal chandeliers,” he said of Sonning Court, as the house is known, “and I thought, ‘I’ve got to get out of this.’”
He wanted to radically downsize, he said, and today he lives in a modest one-bedroom apartment not far from where he grew up. He has settled where he began. On the off chance that he can’t truly bend metal with his mind, he has done something less miraculous but nearly as implausible: He has earned a very comfortable living for 50 years performing what is essentially the most acclaimed party trick of all time.
Now and then, he speaks to magicians, giving tips and what are essentially motivational speeches. Be original, be persistent, stick with a persona, he tells listeners. At the Blackpool Magic Convention in February 2020, he gave all that advice to a packed room, and he performed a newish effect. He poured radish seeds into his hand and asked everyone to chant “Sprout!” over and over. As he swirled the seeds with a finger, a close-up camera showed a green shoot that seemed to materialize in the middle of his hand, as if it had been willed to blossom.
“Among magicians,” asked a cheeky young man, during the question-and-answer part of the presentation, “was that a magic trick? Did you sneak a bit of cress in with your seeds?”
“Are you serious ?” Geller all but shouted, more amused than galled. “Do you really think that I’m going to say at the age of 73 that this was a trick? Get a life!”

New Yorkers Are Bingeing in Comfort This Summer: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Dinner and a show -- that is, eating in front of the TV -- only gets easier with the right furniture and a can-do attitude.
The finale of "Succession" might have left die-hard fans wondering what Kendall was going to do with the rest of his life, but everyone else can now turn their attention to the summer television season.
"And Just Like That" (Max) and "The Bear" (FX on Hulu) had their season premieres last week. "Carpool Karaoke: The Series" and "Swagger" (both on Apple TV+) also returned. And "Claim to Fame" and "The Bachelorette" (ABC) return on June 26.
That is just the beginning.
So it's time to take a plate and a beverage into the living room to catch up on last year's obsessions and to cultivate new ones.
"The concept of watching television while you eat, first of all, of course has been happening since the invention of television," said Laura Shapiro, author of "Something from the Oven: Reinventing Dinner in 1950s America."
Eating in front of the TV got a huge boost from a company called Swanson in the 1950s. Although Swanson wasn't the first company to create compartmentalized aluminum tray dinners, in a "stroke of marketing genius," they coined the phrase "TV dinner," Ms. Shapiro said.
The old-school TV trays that went hand in hand with those TV dinners can feel too stuffy for some these days. Take a look at how these New Yorkers make sure they are as comfortable as they can be.
A Coffee Table for Two
When Kristen Meinzer and Dean McRobie, both in their 40s, bought their apartment in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, six years ago, they were newlyweds who aspired to be the kind of people who ate dinner together at the dining room table.
So they bought a dining room table. But after years of neglect, that particular piece of furniture has left the building. Ms. Meinzer is a culture critic and host of the podcasts "How To Be Fine" and the "Daily Fail." Mr. McRobie is a chief technology officer at an upcycled furniture marketplace. "We could literally count on our hands how many times a year we actually sat at the dining room table," she said
Turns out they weren't "those people," Ms. Meinzer said. Instead, they were people who ate dinner on the couch while streaming "Ted Lasso" or "Shrinking," and they were at peace with it.
The modern living room/dining room setup is not one-size-fits-all -- and couples' reasons for enjoying the experience are also somewhat varied.
Underutilized dining tables, insufficient space or a simple predilection for enjoying dinner and a show at home, have changed the way many New York City couples eat dinner.
Customizing the Experience
Kristen Hartke, 56, said that she and her husband, Rick Weber, 62, like to use nice cocktail glasses, cloth napkins, and silver once owned by Ms. Hartke's grandmother when they dine in front of the TV in their Yorkville apartment.
An ottoman, reupholstered by Ms. Hartke, holds a big wooden tray, with the contents and condiments to complement what's for supper. The couple, empty nesters, could just as easily sit at their dining table and watch the PBS NewsHour (a pandemic-era ritual that never stopped), but they prefer their living room's sofa and armchair.
"I like the mixture of formality and informality. We are using nice glassware and nice plates and cloth napkins and all of that stuff, but it doesn't feel fussy," said Ms. Hartke.
Space limitations in Jacob and Chelsie Starley's 450 square-foot apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn have forced the couple to get creative. With no room for a kitchen table and not a lot of room to play with in their living room area, the couple put low bar stools to work.
The Starley's vintage stools function as individual pseudo tables, perfect for holding the small bowl/plates that Ms. Starley said they enlist for almost everything the couple consumes, from soups to pastas. "Eating off of a flat plate feels a bit too precarious."
The Starleys, both 30 and co-founders of Astraeus Clarke, a design studio with a focus on light fixtures, think a lot about the way a room's lighting impacts its ambience. "Most of our lights are dim anyway, but when we're eating, literally every light is at about 8 percent," said Mr. Starley, creating a "nice warm glow."
Interior Upgrades
Furniture and design stores are creating alternatives for nontraditional diners in a range of prices.
Ikea has flexible solutions including the Ronninge bench ( $ 135), which often doubles as a coffee table. The top-selling Trulstorp coffee table ( $ 169) may be better suited for eating since its height is adjustable.
Large ottomans and C-tables, which are side tables with cantilevered tops that resemble the letter C, are also popular.
More and more, people are wanting to sit on something comfortable, said Nancy Ruddy, co-founder and executive director of design at CetraRuddy.
Thus, the problem to solve is: "How do you make dining a positive experience without worrying if I have the right height or if I'm going to drip the Szechuan sauce," said Ms. Ruddy, who designs interiors residential towers her company builds as well as for private clients.
Ms. Ruddy said these days clients are doing much more with large ottomans, which function as serving platforms for food items and dishes, "large enough to put a beautiful tray on or a series of trays." She is also seeing more C-tables, which replaced the folding TV trays from an earlier era, rise in popularity in recent years.
Suki LaBarre, the vice president of merchandising and e-commerce at ABC Carpet & Home, also favors the ottoman. "Many New Yorkers use their living rooms for dining to optimize space, so it's important to have furniture that's multifunctional without sacrificing comfort or convenience," Ms. LaBarre wrote in an email.
"I love using a large cocktail ottoman like our Delancey Ottoman ( $ 1,295), which serves as a soft landing for relaxing in front of the TV but can be transformed into a low-top dining table by adding a large tray like our Neon Pink Tray ( $ 350) for an easy, cozy dining experience," Ms. LaBarre said. Clockwise from top left: Rick Weber and Kristen Hartke eating dinner at home in front of the TV; Ms. Hartke using a wooden tray on the ottoman she reupholstered; Jacob and Chelsie Starley sharing the sofa at lunchtime; Dean McRobie grabbing a glass from his drink table; and Mr. McRobie and Kristen Meinzer eating lunch in their Prospect Heights apartment in Brooklyn.

At a German Museum With Russian Trustees, Teamwork Is Tense: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As a Berlin museum with Russian trustees commemorates an allied victory over the Soviet Union, it is also negotiating the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
As preparations get underway for the 75th anniversary of the Berlin Airlift, a Cold War victory for western allies over a Soviet blockade, one of the museums mounting a commemorative exhibition is negotiating the fallout from a more recent geopolitical conflict.
The Berlin-Karlshorst Museum, on the site of the German army's formal surrender at the end of World War II, commemorates what it describes as Germany's "brutal war of extermination" against the Soviet Union. Founded in 1995, when Germany and the Russian Federation were on friendly terms, the museum's collection includes many objects on loan from Russia, including a Soviet tank that stands at the museum entrance.
But at a time when Germany is contributing military hardware worth billions of euros to Ukraine so the latter can protect itself from invading Russian forces, the Berlin-Karlshorst Museum's management structure is -- to put it mildly -- awkward. Its board of trustees includes representatives from Russia's foreign, defense and culture ministries, plus members from three Russian museums and one from Russia's ally, Belarus.
Trustees on the opposite side of the current conflict come from a Ukrainian museum and several German institutions, as well as the foreign, defense and culture ministries. The Ukrainian representative stopped taking part in board meetings in 2014, in protest of Russia's annexation of Crimea.
"The situation is untenable," said the Berlin-Karlshorst Museum's director, Jörg Morré. "We know we are at a turning point. But you can't just throw trustees off a board. It's not straightforward."
The airlift exhibition, which the board approved before Russia's 2022 invasion, opens June 29, and will be staged outdoors at the former Tempelhof Airport. It was here, in 1948, that the United States and Britain flew fuel and food from bases in West Germany into a cold, hungry and bomb-ravaged Berlin that Soviet forces had sealed off.
Comprising photographs and text, the admission-free exhibition -- organized with two other museums -- will be presented in German, English, French and Russian, with handout documents in Ukrainian. Despite the Russians on its board, the Berlin-Karlshorst museum has thrown its weight behind the Ukrainian cause.
In a Feb. 21 statement, it said: "We continue to condemn this war in the strongest terms. We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people." Since the invasion, the board has not met, Morré said, and the Russian representatives have remained silent over the museum's stance.
At the time the museum was founded, Germany was grateful to Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, for tolerating reunification, and to Russia for the swift withdrawal of troops that had been stationed in East Germany. Germany's relief at a peaceful end to the Cold War was combined with guilt for the annihilation of 24 million Soviet citizens in World War II.
In that context, the new museum was "a gesture of reconciliation on a state level," Morré said. The German government meets all its costs.
Until as recently as 2020, cooperation between the Russian partner museums and the Berlin-Karlshorst Museum worked well, Morré said.
"We always looked for where we could find agreement," he said. "That has gone, it doesn't work anymore. The Russian view has become narrower and narrower. Now it is completely biased, propagandistic and distorting."
Germany's Culture Ministry said in a May 8 statement that its minister, Claudia Roth, "is preparing a reconfiguration" of the Berlin-Karlshorst board in consultation with the foreign and defense ministries. A spokeswoman for Roth declined to comment further and Russia's embassy in Berlin did not respond to a request for comment.
Even after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, Germany has remained committed to honoring Soviet soldiers' sacrifices in the struggle against Nazism. Across the country, but primarily in the former East Germany, there are more than 4,000 protected monuments to their memory.
Morré said he remains convinced of the importance of this memory work, which is the focus of a revamped permanent exhibition at his museum that opened in 2013. The trouble, he said, is that "the Russian Federation instrumentalizes everything: The Soviet victory in World War II becomes a Russian victory."
"It is not enough to say 'no, we are not going along with this,"' he said. "We have to actively distance ourselves from the Russian perspective."
Although the Ukrainian board representative, from the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in the Second World War, in Kyiv, no longer attends meetings, the two institutions continue to collaborate, Morré said. A historian from the Ukrainian museum joined Morré's team in Berlin temporarily after the invasion, and has since returned to Kyiv. The Berlin-Karlshorst Museum also works closely with exiled members of Memorial International, a human rights group that was banned by the Russian Supreme Court in 2021.
For now, Morré said, he can only work with Russian historians in exile. His colleagues at the three Russian museums represented on the Berlin-Karlshorst Museum's board -- the State Historical Museum, the Central Museum of the Armed Forces and the Victory Museum in Moscow -- have become silent partners.
"We know there are still good colleagues in museums in Russia who have a clear view of history," he said. "But they can't express it."
Morré said he doesn't know how the German government plans to rid the museum of its Russian trustees. One option may be to take legal action on the basis that Russia has breached the museum's statutes, which define one of its aims as "promoting understanding between peoples," he said.
If the Russian trustees leave, the Berlin-Karlshorst Museum may also forfeit a large chunk of its collection. About 1,000 of its 20,000 objects are on loan from the Russian Federation. In addition to the military hardware on display outside the museum, these include artifacts from the two-and-a-half year German siege of Leningrad, now St. Petersburg.
"I imagine that they will demand them back," Morré said. "It would be a very big loss."
The museum no longer describes itself as a "German-Russian" project, Morré said. The Russian and Belarusian flags hanging by the entrance were taken down on the day of the Russian invasion. Only one flag still flies -- and that's Ukraine's.
Morré said he could not foresee a revival of cooperation with Russia any time soon. "It will take a long time," he said.

Full text: A couple felt obligated to take the first apartment they saw in a crazy rental market. Then they wanted to move again, but cooler heads prevailed.
Rebecca Strassberg was fortunate. She had a deep and important relationship that lasted four years -- with her studio apartment in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn.
"I loved it on sight. It was an open layout with two huge closets and a separate, small kitchen," said Ms. Strassberg, 31, who is a branded content editor at the Hearst Corporation. She moved into the studio in 2018, paying $ 1,930 a month, and was thrilled because "it was bigger than anything I'd seen in my search."
Ms. Strassberg, who grew up in Midwood, Brooklyn, said that a lot transpired during those four years. She lived by herself for the first time, got a dog, Brisket, and survived the pandemic. In April 2021, she met William Muschinske, a 30-year-old graphic designer from Oklahoma, on the dating app Bumble.
Their relationship grew quickly. At the time, Mr. Muschinske, who works at Bazaarvoice, a business-to-business software company, lived in a large, two-bedroom townhouse in Gowanus, Brooklyn, with a roommate and a cat named Fran. Most of his time was spent working and living at Ms. Strassberg's. It didn't take long before they outgrew the 500-square-foot space.
They started looking seriously in May of 2022 for something bigger. Ms. Strassberg asked the management company that rented her the studio if there were any larger apartments available. The couple were promptly shown a one-bedroom railroad apartment in a converted firehouse-turned-10-unit walk-up building only two blocks away. The apartment was narrow and had no interior doors, except for the bathroom. The rent was $ 2,750 per month.
They were the first to see the not-yet-listed space, but when they walked in, Ms. Strassberg was horrified.
"The bathroom looked as if it had never been cleaned. There was almost no place for storage. I felt I was in a fun house and things were falling in on me," she said.
Mr. Muschinske agreed "it was bad," he said. "It was one step above a hoarder situation."
Still, the apartment had some appeal. It was bigger than the studio. Mr. Muschinske would have a small office area next to the eat-in kitchen, which came with a dishwasher -- a selling point for Ms. Strassberg. And once they removed the broken blinds from a bedroom window, they found that it provided a tremendous amount of light.
Since the couple loved their neighborhood, and were promised the apartment would be cleaned, painted and that the bathtub would be re-grouted, they took the apartment.
At the time, the couple were feeling the effects of a city scrambling for housing as the world tried to rebound in the pandemic. "There was fear and anxiety we wouldn't find anything. It felt like this was our one opportunity."
Mr. Muschinske, whose lease was up that July, didn't renew. Ms. Strassberg, who had until December, transferred hers over to the new apartment.
For the first four months, the couple coasted on decorating bliss. There were trips to IKEA, Home Depot and Lowes. Bookshelves and closets were built. Wood for an ambitious door project was purchased. Even Brisket and Fran were cohabiting nicely.
"I was excited to have separate rooms and the opportunity to make this a home," Ms. Strassberg said.
"The beginning felt really good," added Mr. Muschinske. "It was us officially starting our lives together under one roof. We discovered each other on a new level."

Occupations: She is a branded content editor at Hearst; he is a graphic designer at Bazaarvoice.
Design Challenge: "There's a curved wall in the living room, which, we guess, is part of the pole from the original firehouse. It's been a designing challenge for sure," Ms. Strassberg said.
An Extended Workweek: "Doing a six-month intensive class extended my schedule to a 75-hour workweek. That wore on both of us. We weren't enjoying the space. Any improvement felt like a task," Mr. Muschinske said. In September, with perhaps a stroke of bad timing, considering that both worked from home, Mr. Muschinske immersed himself in a six-month intensive design course. The demands of his job and the coursework kept him in front of the computer until 10 or 11 every night, and all day on Saturday. On Sunday, his only day off, doing chores and fixing the apartment were the last things on his list.
Soon, an unexpected renter's remorse consumed the couple like quicksand.
The missing doors allowed sound to travel everywhere. They became overwhelmed from the lack of available storage space and didn't know where to put their belongings. The narrowness of the apartment amplified the problems. If Mr. Muschinske's onscreen camera was on, it caught Ms. Strassberg's every move, like going into the kitchen or into the bathroom. AirPods became essential.
In a rash decision, Ms. Strassberg decided to sell her desk and buy a Peloton. That meant she was eating, working and napping from the couch, which she started to dread.
In January 2023, only six months in, they started looking for a new place, again.
Every day the couple scoured the internet, hoping for a two-bedroom with a yard.
"When we looked at other apartments, it was just as disappointing and difficult as the first time," Ms. Strassberg said. "We saw one place that after the costs and fees, we would need $ 16,000 just to get the keys. Other apartments were gone by the time we emailed someone to see it."
One saving grace during this period was the Congress Bar, their local watering hole, which "became an extension of our living room. We loved everyone there," said Ms. Strassberg. "It gave me a chance to get out of the house and gave Billy time to himself. We still loved the neighborhood and the friends we had made. We didn't want to leave that."
The couple needed to emotionally recalibrate. It helped that in March, Mr. Muschinske finished his class.
"It's mental, fixing the narrative in your head," Ms. Strassberg said. "We realized it made less and less sense to trade up. That we were better off saving the money and appreciating the stability we had here."
They returned to their decorating and enhancement projects. A new desk and chair were bought at IKEA. A free, almost new, computer monitor was acquired thanks to the Facebook group Buy Nothing. A proper work area was set up in the living room after space was made by moving Mr. Muschinske's sizable record collection into another area, which made the apartment feel larger and gave Ms. Strassberg a sense of her own space. A new couch was purchased. Plans for a gallery wall were set in motion. Doors for each room were back on the docket.
"We started investing in the apartment financially and emotionally again. I felt instant happiness," said Ms. Strassberg, noting that small changes make huge differences. "Now there's a feeling of hope every time we bring something new in."
Mr. Muschinske agreed, adding that the spark had returned.
"We wanted to put love into this because we want to enjoy the next 14 months," he said. "Not moving allowed me to apply my energy to this current space. We're also functioning as a team again. This experience has taught me how to deal with stress better, and how to be a better partner to Becca." For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

VW Sells Russian Operations, Including an Assembly Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The German automaker, which quit making cars in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, said it had sold its plant to a local auto dealership chain.
Volkswagen has sold its assembly plant and other operations in Russia to a local auto dealership, more than a year after the German carmaker ceased production in the country following the invasion of Ukraine, the company said on Friday.
Under the deal, which required approval from the Russian government, a Moscow-based dealership called Avilon acquired the assets of Volkswagen Group Rus, the carmaker said. Neither company specified a sales price, but Russia media, citing local records, said Avilon had paid about 125 million euros ( $ 135 million).
Volkswagen made the announcement in a terse statement, and declined to comment further on the deal.
The move makes Volkswagen the latest European carmaker to withdraw from Russia in the past year, joining several hundred other multinational corporations leaving a market where many spent decades currying and constructing. But outrage over Moscow's war in Ukraine, combined with the difficulties coping with tough economic sanctions aimed at punishing Russia, has made the Russian market less attractive.
Mercedes-Benz announced last month that it had sold its Russia division, including an assembly plant, to Avtodom, a Russian investor, roughly a year after it suspended local manufacturing and the export of passenger cars and vans to Russia. The sale included a limited repurchase option, the company said, but it did not give any further details.
Last year, the French automaker Renault negotiated a deal with the Russian government to sell its 68 percent stake in AvtoVAZ, Russia's biggest carmaker, to NAMI, an automotive research institute in Moscow, for the price of 1 ruble, with the option of resuming business in the country at a future date.
Volkswagen declined to say whether the sale included a clause to return to Russia. In addition to its plant, in Kaluga, a city in western Russia, the Volkswagen sale included the company's components and leasing divisions.
Avilon did not comment on the sale, and it was not immediately clear what its plans were for the Kaluga plant.
Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Avilon sold Volkswagen vehicles as well as dozens of other Western brands, including Mercedes, Jeep and Rolls-Royce. Since last year, it has also begun selling leading Chinese brands, such as Chery, Great Wall and Zeekr.
Volkswagen spent €774 million building the Kaluga plant, which opened in 2007. Two years later, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia flew in by helicopter to celebrate the start of full production of several of the company's best-selling models, as well as models from its Skoda line.
The plant had capacity to turn out 225,000 vehicles a year, nearly the number the company delivered to customers in Russia in 2021. Shortly after the invasion in February 2022, Volkswagen ceased operations at the plant. It also quit making cars at another plant, in Nizhny Novgorod, that was owned by the Russian company Gaz Group.
Gaz Group sued Volkswagen over the halt, seeking to freeze the German company's assets in Russia. Last month, a court ruled in Volkswagen's favor.
Over the past year, the Kaluga plant's 4,000 employees remained on the payroll as they waited for information on whether they would be allowed to return to work. The idle plant was a financial drain on Volkswagen, which is scrambling to expand its electric vehicle offerings and revamp its core brand. It is also losing ground to local brands in China, the world's largest auto market.
Observers believe that large companies waited for several months to gauge the situation before deciding whether to pull out of Russia. Large multinational companies that had spent several decades building supply chains and networks realized that the complexity and reach of those systems made it difficult to bring them to a swift halt, said Sebastian Hoppe, a political economist at Berlin's Free University who researches Russia.
"The more suppliers you have in Russia itself, the harder it is to pull out and the longer this whole process takes," Mr. Hoppe said.
Carmakers in Russia employed 300,000 people in 2021, according to the country's statistics agency, and up to 3.5 million more are estimated to work in related industries. Those jobs have been devastated over the past year, as auto production has dropped 77 percent in large part because Western firms have pulled up stakes.
Other firms are also deciding to turn their back on Russia. Henkel, a German maker of washing powder and other household products, and Ikea, the Swedish furniture company, sold their factories to local buyers in Russia this year.
The sale of factories and other assets may have come at a loss, but many Western companies do not expect Russia's economy to return to normal growth in the near future.
"What I think is also important, it is of course the case that the Russian market tends to be less attractive than it was before the war," Mr. Hoppe said.

For a Queens Couple, the Dream Life Includes a Private Spin Cycle: [Real Estate]

Full text: It was the neighborhood feel of Astoria, Queens -- the walkability, the thriving gay community, the relatively low scale -- that first attracted Steven Salazar and Stefano Verdesoto. Two years ago, the couple rented a one-bedroom there, paying $ 2,300 a month. They didn't have much use for the amenities but were smitten with their stacked washer and dryer.
They saved assiduously during the pandemic. After paying off their student loans, they were ready for "that next phase of our lives," said Mr. Salazar, 30, who is from El Paso, Texas, and works in advertising.
Mr. Verdesoto, 31, who grew up in Jackson Heights, Queens, after arriving with his family from Ecuador, said, "As an immigrant and a first-generation college graduate, the dream was always to buy property." He is an administrator in higher education.
Hoping to find a one-bedroom in or near Astoria with space for their six-seat dining table, they focused on new condominiums, mostly because they wanted in-unit laundry machines, and co-op apartments with washers and dryers in were scarce.
"It's funny how a basic thing is not basic in New York," Mr. Verdesoto said. In every common laundry room he encountered, he said, "I had flashbacks to having to do laundry in college."
Their budget was about $ 700,000. Inventory was limited, which was fine with them. "Anything beyond maybe four or five options creates analysis paralysis, where there's too much to consider," Mr. Salazar said.
For help, they contacted Harjot Kaur Nayar, a saleswoman at Keller Williams NYC, referred by a friend's sister.
"We reviewed what they would get in the $ 500s, $ 600s and $ 700s," Ms. Nayar said, "and what matched their financial preferences and comfort level."
Among their options:
This ground-floor one-bedroom was about 515 square feet, in a new seven-unit building with a common roof deck. It had an open kitchen with a peninsula, but no room for a dining table. The large finished outdoor space was reached by sliding doors from the bedroom and living room. The asking price was $ 688,000, with monthly charges in the low $ 900s.
This one-bedroom was about 615 square feet, in a 70-unit doorman development in Dutch Kills, a neighborhood just south of Astoria. It had an open living, dining and kitchen area. The building had a gym and a courtyard. The price was $ 695,000, with monthly charges in the $ 900s.
This two-bedroom, one-bathroom condominium was just under 800 square feet, in a new 17-unit elevator building with a roof deck. It had a large living space and an open kitchen. But the bedrooms were small, and the apartment was on a low floor, facing a parking lot. The price was $ 698,000, with monthly charges of around $ 800.
The ground-floor one-bedroom was the first apartment the couple saw. It struck them as small, but the patio, which was lined with shrubs, was enticing.
"It was an exciting first visit," Mr. Salazar said. "We were probably a little bit dazzled."
At the Dutch Kills apartment, Mr. Salazar disliked the lack of a conventional oven. "This is top-of-the-line everything and you don't have a full oven?" he said. "This is a staple, an essential."
The two-bedroom was appealing but the bedrooms were smaller than they appeared in pictures. And the couple didn't like the parking-lot view or the finishes.
So they returned to the first place they saw, and its patio. "There was an excitement, a brightness to it, having a personal backyard," Mr. Verdesoto said.
They negotiated the price down to $ 675,000 and arrived last winter.
A few things needed fixing: a nonworking outlet, warped floors, some dead shrubs.
"That was also a little bit overwhelming," Mr. Salazar said. "We dropped all this money and expected everything to be perfect sunshine and happiness, and then reality happened. It's actually kind of terrifying to be a first-time home buyer."
They reluctantly sold their dining table and bought an eight-seat outdoor table from Ikea for the patio, along with lounge chairs and a grill.
The unit came with a combination washer-dryer. "It takes more time and is a little bit louder," Mr. Salazar said. But they set the timer, so when they return from work the laundry is ready for folding. "Maybe down the road we can figure out how to install a stackable," he said.

This ground-floor one-bedroom was about 515 square feet, in a new seven-unit building with a common roof deck. It had an open kitchen with a peninsula, but no room for a dining table. The large finished outdoor space was reached by sliding doors from the bedroom and living room. The asking price was $ 688,000, with monthly charges in the low $ 900s.
2. High-Tech Condo in Dutch Kills
This one-bedroom was about 615 square feet, in a 70-unit doorman development in Dutch Kills, a neighborhood just south of Astoria. It had an open living, dining and kitchen area. The building had a gym and a courtyard. The price was $ 695,000, with monthly charges in the $ 900s.
3. Astoria Two-Bedroom Condo
This two-bedroom, one-bathroom condominium was just under 800 square feet, in a new 17-unit elevator building with a roof deck. It had a large living space and an open kitchen. But the bedrooms were small, and the apartment was on a low floor, facing a parking lot. The price was $ 698,000, with monthly charges of around $ 800.
Their Choice
The ground-floor one-bedroom was the first apartment the couple saw. It struck them as small, but the patio, which was lined with shrubs, was enticing.
"It was an exciting first visit," Mr. Salazar said. "We were probably a little bit dazzled."
At the Dutch Kills apartment, Mr. Salazar disliked the lack of a conventional oven. "This is top-of-the-line everything and you don't have a full oven?" he said. "This is a staple, an essential."
The two-bedroom was appealing but the bedrooms were smaller than they appeared in pictures. And the couple didn't like the parking-lot view or the finishes.
So they returned to the first place they saw, and its patio. "There was an excitement, a brightness to it, having a personal backyard," Mr. Verdesoto said.
They negotiated the price down to $ 675,000 and arrived last winter.
A few things needed fixing: a nonworking outlet, warped floors, some dead shrubs.
"That was also a little bit overwhelming," Mr. Salazar said. "We dropped all this money and expected everything to be perfect sunshine and happiness, and then reality happened. It's actually kind of terrifying to be a first-time home buyer."
They reluctantly sold their dining table and bought an eight-seat outdoor table from Ikea for the patio, along with lounge chairs and a grill.
The unit came with a combination washer-dryer. "It takes more time and is a little bit louder," Mr. Salazar said. But they set the timer, so when they return from work the laundry is ready for folding. "Maybe down the road we can figure out how to install a stackable," he said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: PARISIANS ARE OFTEN caricatured as blasé yet, when it comes to their city's cultural treasures, they can be disarmingly sentimental. New Yorkers may dismiss the Empire State Building as kitsch, but Parisians have an unironic love for the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe. There is likewise widespread devotion to the capital's artisanal past: Many wouldn't dream, for example, of getting their brass door hardware anywhere but the 19th-century A La Providence on Rue du Faubourg St.-Antoine, or their pencils anywhere but the 136-year-old art supply store Sennelier.
Such loyalty to the city's institutions has a relatively young champion these days: the 38-year-old illustrator Marin Montagut. Raised in Toulouse by antiques dealer parents, he was enamored as a child with images of Paris's Belle Époque and dreamed of moving to the capital to make art; at 19, he arrived with a single suitcase, a set of watercolors and a few sable brushes.
While sourcing furniture for film sets to make a living, he created an illustrated map of Paris highlighting some of its obscure craft ateliers and stores and sold it from the back of his Vespa to concept boutiques such as Merci and Colette. In 2013, he began producing tiny paintings of fin de siècle motifs -- the Jardin du Luxembourg's sage green chairs, wooden oil-paint palettes, tarot cards -- that have become his signature, printing them on silk scarves or porcelain. Later, after establishing a workshop that now employs 10 people, he started to experiment with blown-glass vessels adorned with hand-painted petals, the cut-paper dioramas (depicting everything from flaming hearts to hot-air balloons) that he calls wonder windows, candles, notebooks and papier-mâché boxes.
All of these are now sold at, among other places, Montagut's namesake boutique, which he opened three years ago on Rue Madame in the Sixth Arrondissement. Once occupied by an upholsterer, the space, with its windowed viridian facade and creaky floors, resembles a turn-of-the-20th-century curio shop; antique toys and objects, including mechanical puppets and handmade globes, sit beside the designer's wares in vintage walnut cabinets.
The effect might be camp if it weren't for the exquisite execution and the sheer sweetness of Montagut's brushstrokes. In 2021, Flammarion published his illustrated sourcebook of inspirations, "Timeless Paris," a tour of 19 renowned ateliers, lesser-known small museums and esoteric emporiums. With large-scale photographs, reproduced ephemera and hundreds of watercolors, it features chapters on the late 19th-century trimming factory Passementerie Verrier and the 143-year-old apothecary Herboristerie de la Place Clichy. A section focuses on Montagut's own shop, of course, pasting him, Zelig-like, into the city's legendary past, where he has always imagined himself.
THE BOOK ALSO, unexpectedly, helped the illustrator find the sort of home that had long been part of his fantasy. Among the businesses profiled is Soubrier, a 150-year-old family-owned firm based in the 12th Arrondissement, on the city's eastern edge, that originally produced period furniture and dealt in antiques but now rents out its inventory for film and photography sets. The company's 32,000-square-foot brick warehouse is where a props master might go to find a Napoleon III desk resembling ones from the Élysée Palace or a copper deep-sea diving helmet.
One day during Montagut's research, the company's current president, Louis Soubrier, showed him the private cobblestone alleyway next door. Lined with single-story windowed workshops, some of which had been converted into residences, it was everything the young designer had yearned for back in Toulouse. For more than a century, beginning in the Middle Ages, the street was under the control of the St.-Antoine-des-Champs Abbey, a coterie of nuns from highborn families whose connections helped turn it into a furniture-making mecca; during the French Revolution, the craftspeople were instrumental in storming the Bastille. And yes, there was a vacancy -- a cozy duplex apartment carved from a two-story house at the end.
The neighborhood's relative tranquillity is a relief for Montagut, who moved into the building two years ago with his partner, Alexis Gilot, an actor, director and stand-up comedian. Montagut has transformed the 1,292-square-foot, two-bedroom space into a fusion of Gilded Age Paris and his other geographic touchstone: Normandy, about an hour and a half west by car. "You have to pick your city and the place you belong in the country," he says. "And Normandy is my place." His mother runs an antiques shop there; he has a weekend house not far away.
Indeed, the couple's home, reached through a cerulean-painted wooden doorway overhung with grapevines, appears like a cottage nestled in the woods. The small entry, painted a ruddy brown and dominated by a seven-foot-tall forest green 19th-century embellished armoire, gives way to a kitchen wallpapered in cream and ocher stripes. Clustered on a raw wood-plank table are glass and silver candlesticks fitted with pink tapers half-melted during the couple's dinner parties, at which they serve pot-au-feu or boeuf bourguignon.
The loftlike span of the long, rectangular living area, which adjoins the kitchen, gives Montagut's innumerable objects space to breathe. Scores of vintage white plaster casts -- torsos, busts, feet -- many arranged on tall carved marble pedestals, punctuate the expanse; a Victorian crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling's narrow, rough-hewn wood beams. Next to the fireplace, framed by a carved mahogany mantel, sits a three-foot-tall wooden model of the Eiffel Tower, one of the dozens of miniatures that Montagut owns.
Along the moss-colored wall behind the staircase hang a tableau of religious artifacts from Portugal and Italy; the framed relics with their tiny jewels and cutouts of saints inspired Montagut's wonder windows. At the top of the steps, down the hall from the couple's bedroom, where a Swedish quilt with intricate chevrons enlivens the foot of the bed, is the small, crowded room around which Montagut's enterprise revolves: his studio. Unsurprisingly, he is not a designer who needs a whitewashed box to create in; he prefers to be ensconced in a cabinet of curiosities. One wall is a tapestry of tacked-up tarot cards, and on the surfaces are globes from every era, painted wooden figures, tiny boxes salvaged from the back of a dusty shop. As Montagut works -- at a vintage Ikea pine desk, topped with a sheet of cork and positioned in front of a large window overlooking the grape arbor below -- his brush flies among several watercolors in progress: of a chest of drawers, a heart topped with a diadem, a bergère upholstered in blue stripes. The afternoon sun slants through the glass, throwing shadows on a small twisted-wire Tour Eiffel at his elbow, and in the greenery below, as if on cue, a thrush begins its song.

A Life Less Toxic: [SpecialSections]

Full text: Advice on healthy candles, purging kitchen plastic and the art of dyeing fabric naturally.
This article is part of our Design special section about making the environment a creative partner in the design of beautiful homes.
I've heard some candles can create indoor air pollution and even be harmful. Are there safer alternatives?
Paraffin, the wax from which many candles are made, is derived from petroleum. When it burns, it emits toxic fumes. These irritate some people's eyes and can also exacerbate asthma and other respiratory conditions. Synthetic fragrances and colors can also produce irritating fumes. On top of that, some wicks contain lead (to make them firmer), which is released into the air.
Alternatives include beeswax as well as waxes made from soy, coconut, rapeseed and other oils. Some vegans do not support the use of beeswax because it is an animal product, and some feel the beekeeping industry is not cruelty free. Soy wax is certainly more sustainable than petroleum, but its possible negatives include the use of pesticides. (Look for organic soy wax.) The other vegetable waxes mentioned are relatively clean.
Be sure to read the fine print. I was recently lured in by a candle from a well-known brand that was "formulated with vegan-friendly ingredients" only to find it also contained paraffin. So make sure you're getting 100 percent of whatever alternative wax you seek. Also, check to see if artificial scents or other chemicals have been added. (Choose candles scented with nothing but essential oils.) Look for wicks that are made from cotton, wood or hemp -- and glass containers that can be recycled or reused.
Organic Savanna candles, poured in Kenya, are handmade from organic soy wax and locally sourced ingredients. One hundred percent of profits from the sale of the candles helps create jobs for Kenyan women and fund children's education. Les Crème candles have pure organic coconut wax and cotton wicks. Hive to Home candles incorporate locally sourced beeswax, organic coconut oil, cotton wicks and sustainable packaging. Rapeseed wax candles are harder to find, especially in the United States. But plenty of places sell the wax itself if you're a candle maker.
My kitchen feels like a toxic waste dump filled with plastic bags and storage containers, plastic wrap and more. Are there better choices?
Indeed there are. Plastic containers have gotten a lot of negative press, especially those that contain Bisphenol A, or BPA, which has been discovered to be an endocrine disrupter linked to all kinds of potential health issues and is banned in many states. Now we are swimming in BPA-free plastics. Unfortunately, these can contain Bisphenol S (BPS), which is chemically similar.
An alternative is glass or metal storage containers with silicone lids. (Silicone isn't perfect because many communities don't recycle it, but it is primarily made from a naturally derived material, silica, and lasts much longer than plastic.) Brands include Ikea, Pyrex, and Public Goods.
You can also reuse screw-top glass jars. (If the original housed something aromatic like garlicky dill pickles, you'll want to run the lid through the dishwasher first.)
Plastic wrap and even some wax paper also contain materials derived from petroleum. Also, they are (generally) one-time-use products, so they keep your bowl of guacamole fresh for a day before off to the landfill they go.
But there are plastic-free wraps, typically cotton fabric coated with some sort of wax, that can be used repeatedly to cover a jar or bowl, or wrap a piece of cut fruit or a wedge of cheese. They don't last forever but they are typically compostable (or can be used as fire starters). I find they sometimes pick up odors, but a thorough wash in cool water and mild soap, followed by a thorough air dry freshens them. Bee's Wrap has two versions -- one coated in beeswax, the other in a vegan-friendly soy-coconut wax blend.
Another clever product is Food Huggers, which are a set of five sizes of colorful, stretchy discs made from food-grade silicone. They are dishwasher, freezer, and microwave safe. You can use them as jar lids or slide them over the cut end of a lemon, onion, apple or other produce. The company also makes silicone "Hugger Bags" that take the place of plastic food storage bags.
I'm interested in trying natural fabric dyeing but am afraid it's really complicated. Where can I find out more?
Making dye from plants and animals goes back to ancient times and has been done by nearly all cultures. Today there is a community of dyers you can tap into for information, ideas and supplies.
I've long been a fan of indigo, a plant in the bean family whose leaves -- when soaked and fermented -- produce a beautiful deep-blue dye. Other colors can be produced using flowers, roots, berries, fruit and vegetable peels, wood, and even insects.
The Bible mentions a particular blue dye color, called tekhelet, whose exact formulation has been lost but is thought to have come from a secretion of sea snails.
But you're right. It's often more complicated than simply boiling some flower petals and dunking in a piece of fabric -- especially if you want the dye to be durable and stay uniform over time.
Botanical Colors, based in Seattle, offers education and natural dyeing materials. They support farmers and organic and regenerative farming, organizing workshops locally and sometimes in other parts of the country, on topics including dyeing with mud, indigo, persimmon tannins and more. They also have a biweekly online show called Feedback Friday, which began during the pandemic. The group's president, Kathy Hattori, and sustainability and communications director, Amy DuFault, speak with artists, writers and scholars about natural dyeing and color.
Maiwa, based in Vancouver, sells a large range of materials for the natural dyer as well as downloadable instructions ("How to Dye With Indigo," for instance), books, and fabrics. They promote "Slow Clothes," or the contributions of hand spinners, hand weavers and natural dyers as an antidote to mass production. They also offer classes, many of them free, through their School of Textiles.

Grocery Closure Reflects San Francisco's Woes: [National Desk]

Full text: Tech workers have stayed home, and ongoing social problems downtown are forcing civic and business leaders to confront harsh realities about the city's pandemic recovery.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Last year, with pandemic lockdowns in the rearview mirror, Whole Foods Market made a bet on a gritty San Francisco neighborhood. The high-end supermarket chain opened a giant flagship store in a part of the city that is home to both tech companies like Twitter and open-air drug dealing.
But the store was soon confronted head-on with many of the problems plaguing the area. People threatened employees with guns, knives and sticks. They flung food, screamed, fought and tried to defecate on the floor, according to records of 568 emergency calls over 13 months, many depicting scenes of mayhem.
"Male w/machete is back," the report on one 911 call states. "Another security guard was just assaulted," another says. A man with a four-inch knife attacked several security guards, then sprayed store employees with foam from a fire extinguisher, according to a third.
In September, a 30-year-old man died in the bathroom from an overdose of fentanyl, a highly potent opioid, and methamphetamine.
When Whole Foods announced in mid-April that it was closing the store, citing the safety of its employees, many in San Francisco saw it as a representation of some of the city's most intractable problems: property crimes like shoplifting and car break-ins, an entrenched network of dealers selling fentanyl and other illicit drugs and people suffering from untreated mental illness wandering the streets.
The closure also seemed to be the latest indicator of San Francisco's faltering economic prospects, providing more grist for an ongoing debate over where the city is headed after tying its fate to the tech industry. The Whole Foods was supposed to cater to tech workers and other professionals, part of a long-term redevelopment plan downtown. But the store fell victim to a grinding decline in the city's center that began with the pandemic and could continue for years as companies vacate offices because of remote work.
In a city famous for its boom-and-bust cycles, San Francisco's continued slump has left residents in a sour mood, angry at city leaders and waiting for the sparks of revitalization. Now, largely because the tech industry has so wholeheartedly embraced work-from-home, activity in San Francisco's downtown remains at roughly a third of prepandemic levels -- lower than in about 50 other major cities, according to one new study that used cellphone data as a measure.
"This is going to be a very slow recovery," Effi Shoua said this month from behind his desk at the downtown fine art gallery he owns in Union Square. The area is a prime spot for tourists, who have been steadily returning to the city, a bright spot and a contrast to the 26 percent vacancy rate of downtown offices.
Many merchants are worried about a domino effect of commercial failures if office workers are permanently absent for about half of the week, while people using drugs, going through mental crises or living on the street remain more visible than ever.
The impact on the city's budget is significant, too: Office-based industries account for nearly three quarters of the city's gross domestic product. After years of surpluses, the government now forecasts a $ 780 million deficit in the upcoming two fiscal years -- roughly a 6 percent cut in its general fund, according to the mayor's office.
City officials say they are searching for ways to diversify the economy and to reduce homelessness and drug dealing. They realize that some of the largest local employers, Big Tech companies, will not be towing San Francisco from its economic shoals. Twitter, Google, Facebook and Salesforce, all of which have offices in the city, have laid off thousands of workers.
San Francisco leaders point out that the city has rebounded again and again, including after the near-collapse of the tech industry in 2000 and the national recession about eight years later.
"We've been counted out before, and there have been others who have tried to imply because things aren't happening as fast or the way that they think it should happen, that it's over," London Breed, the city's mayor, said in an interview.
In the famously liberal city, where Republicans make up just 7 percent of the electorate, moderate Democrats like Mayor Breed are calling for aggressive steps to address public safety concerns while progressive voices decry law-and-order strategies as kneejerk responses that trample on the vulnerable.
City leaders face some limitations. A federal judge in April determined that San Francisco cannot clear homeless people from public spaces because it has not done enough to provide shelter. Mayor Breed is backing bills in the State Legislature that would make it easier to force mentally ill people into treatment. The mayor has also proposed addressing homelessness by building more: slashing the permitting process for construction with the goal of building 83,000 additional homes and apartments -- a 20 percent increase from the city's current total housing stock -- in eight years.
Even though the downtown is plastered with "for lease" signs, the city's unemployment rate is under 3 percent and the mayor and other officials say the engineering talent pool remains the city's top asset. And there is much more to San Francisco than its downtown. It has always been a constellation of very different neighborhoods, some of which have very few of the social ills that afflict the area near the closed Whole Foods.
Officials add that the downtown may ultimately emerge more resilient if it attracts industries like life sciences and bio-tech whose employees still need work space. There is growth in the tech industry, too: The development of artificial intelligence, which promises to transform the way that people live and work, is centered in San Francisco.
Garry Tan, the president of Y Combinator, a prominent venture-capital company, says he sees signs of renewal in San Francisco. "It's the gold rush over and over and over again," he said.
Mr. Tan is part of a generation of tech workers who are more assertive in their demands on city officials, unafraid to take sides in the city's internecine politics and funding organizations that press for more emphasis on public safety.
"Now the narrative out there for some of the founders in our community is, I'm not sure if I feel safe here. I'm not sure if I want to stay here. The quality of life issues are the question. Can I raise a family here?"
In early April, some tech leaders seized upon the recent fatal stabbing downtown of Bob Lee, a prominent industry executive, as an alarming sign that the downtown was unsafe. But an acquaintance was later accused of murder, and San Francisco's murder rate is quite low compared with other major cities. Overall, police statistics show fewer property and violent crimes in 2022 than in 2018, before the pandemic began.
Still, Bill Scott, the city's police chief, says many residents complain that they feel less safe, and the open-air drug use, much of it tied to fentanyl, is a major contributor.
Matt Dorsey, a member of the board of supervisors who lives steps away from the shuttered Whole Foods, said recent elections had signaled a shift in voter priorities. He pointed to last year's recall of the city's progressive district attorney, Chesa Boudin, who was replaced by a prosecutor who vowed to be tougher on crime.
"San Francisco is in the midst of a voter revolt on public safety," Mr. Dorsey said. In a poll conducted by the San Francisco Chronicle in September, nearly two-thirds of respondents said life in the city was worse off than when they moved here.
The new district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, has begun prosecuting more drug crimes than Mr. Boudin, but the city experienced a 40 percent jump in fatal overdoses in the first quarter compared with the same period last year. Citing that statistic, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday authorized an antidrug task force in San Francisco that will include members of the California National Guard and California Highway Patrol.
The mayor and the police chief have vowed to hire hundreds of additional officers, which would expand the force by more than one-fourth, a difficult proposition when law enforcement agencies nationwide are facing shortages.
Not everyone is on board with that.
Dean Preston, a member of the board of supervisors who was re-elected in 2020 on a Democratic Socialist platform, is against increasing police staffing and believes the idea of a shift in the electorate's view about public safety is overstated.
"There's been a massive propaganda effort to change public opinion around policing and public safety," he said.
Mr. Preston uses his district as an example of how uneven the pandemic recovery has been. Some areas like Japantown and Haight Ashbury are thriving, he said. Others like the Tenderloin, which is adjacent to the shuttered Whole Foods, are beset by drug dealing and homelessness.
One of the next big tests for downtown might be this summer's expected opening of an Ikea store not far from the Whole Foods site.
Police described theft as rampant at Whole Foods, with thieves walking out with armfuls of alcohol, at least at the start. After 250 shopping hand baskets were stolen, the company restocked with 50 more. Those went missing, too.
During the store's 13 months in operation, at least 14 people were arrested, including on charges of grand theft and battery, according to official reports. Chief Scott said that plainclothes officers were sent there and security improved over time, but seemingly not enough for the company.
On a recent chilly night across from the shuttered store, Joseph Peterson, a former construction worker who lost both of his legs to diabetes and is homeless, rolled down the sidewalk in his wheelchair. Mr. Peterson could see the 2,000-unit Trinity apartments, the high-end complex that Whole Foods had hoped would be its customer base. Across the intersection, security guards stood sentry in front of the Orpheum Theater, where "Pretty Woman: The Musical" was playing. A few dozen steps away, dealers peddled fentanyl and crystal meth.
Mr. Peterson said he understood why Whole Foods had closed the store.
"People kept stealing from it," he said. He, too, had taken macaroni and cheese and chicken from the hot food bar a number of times, he said. But he made a distinction. Other people stole from the store because they wanted to resell what they took.
"I just stole to eat," he said.

SAN FRANCISCO — Last year, with pandemic lockdowns in the rearview mirror, Whole Foods Market made a bet on a gritty San Francisco neighborhood. The high-end supermarket chain opened a giant flagship store in a part of the city that is home to both tech companies like Twitter and open-air drug dealing.
But the store was soon confronted head-on with many of the problems plaguing the area. People threatened employees with guns, knives and sticks. They flung food, screamed, fought and tried to defecate on the floor, according to records of 568 emergency calls over 13 months, many depicting scenes of mayhem.
“Male w/machete is back,” the report on one 911 call states. “Another security guard was just assaulted,” another says. A man with a 4-inch knife attacked several security guards, then sprayed store employees with foam from a fire extinguisher, according to a third.
In September, a 30-year-old man died in the bathroom from an overdose of fentanyl, a highly potent opioid, and methamphetamine.
When Whole Foods announced in mid-April that it was closing the store, citing the safety of its employees, many in San Francisco saw it as a representation of some of the city’s most intractable problems: property crimes like shoplifting and car break-ins, an entrenched network of dealers selling fentanyl and other illicit drugs and people suffering from untreated mental illness wandering the streets.
The closure also seemed to be the latest indicator of San Francisco’s faltering economic prospects, providing more grist for an ongoing debate over where the city is headed after tying its fate to the tech industry. The Whole Foods was supposed to cater to tech workers and other professionals, part of a long-term redevelopment plan downtown. But the store fell victim to a grinding decline in the city’s center that began with the pandemic and could continue for years as companies vacate offices because of remote work.
In a city famous for its boom-and-bust cycles, San Francisco’s continued slump has left residents in a sour mood, angry at city leaders and waiting for the sparks of revitalization. Now, largely because the tech industry has so wholeheartedly embraced work-from-home, activity in San Francisco’s downtown remains at roughly one-third of pre-pandemic levels — lower than in about 50 other major cities, according to one new study that used cellphone data as a measure.
“This is going to be a very slow recovery,” Effi Shoua said this month from behind his desk at the downtown fine art gallery he owns in Union Square. The area is a prime spot for tourists, who have been steadily returning to the city, a bright spot and a contrast to the 26% vacancy rate of downtown offices.
Many merchants are worried about a domino effect of commercial failures if office workers are permanently absent for about half of the week, while people using drugs, going through mental crises or living on the street remain more visible than ever.
The impact on the city’s budget is significant, too: Office-based industries account for nearly three quarters of the city’s gross domestic product. After years of surpluses, the government now forecasts a $780 million deficit in the upcoming two fiscal years — roughly a 6% cut in its general fund, according to the mayor’s office.
City officials say they are searching for ways to diversify the economy and to reduce homelessness and drug dealing. They realize that some of the largest local employers, Big Tech companies, will not be towing San Francisco from its economic shoals. Twitter, Google, Facebook and Salesforce, all of which have offices in the city, have laid off thousands of workers.
San Francisco leaders point out that the city has rebounded again and again, including after the near-collapse of the tech industry in 2000 and the national recession about eight years later.
“We’ve been counted out before, and there have been others who have tried to imply because things aren’t happening as fast or the way that they think it should happen, that it’s over,” London Breed, the city’s mayor, said in an interview.
In the famously liberal city, where Republicans make up just 7% of the electorate, moderate Democrats like Breed are calling for aggressive steps to address public safety concerns while progressive voices decry law-and-order strategies as knee-jerk responses that trample on the vulnerable.
City leaders face some limitations. A federal judge in April determined that San Francisco cannot clear homeless people from public spaces because it has not done enough to provide shelter. Breed is backing bills in the state Legislature that would make it easier to force mentally ill people into treatment. The mayor has also proposed addressing homelessness by building more: slashing the permitting process for construction with the goal of building 83,000 additional homes and apartments — a 20% increase from the city’s current total housing stock — in eight years.
Even though the downtown is plastered with “for lease” signs, the city’s unemployment rate is under 3% and the mayor and other officials say the engineering talent pool remains the city’s top asset. And there is much more to San Francisco than its downtown. It has always been a constellation of very different neighborhoods, some of which have very few of the social ills that afflict the area near the closed Whole Foods.
Officials add that the downtown may ultimately emerge more resilient if it attracts industries like life sciences and biotech whose employees still need work space. There is growth in the tech industry, too: The development of artificial intelligence, which promises to transform the way that people live and work, is centered in San Francisco.
Garry Tan, the president of Y Combinator, a prominent venture-capital company, says he sees signs of renewal in San Francisco. “It’s the gold rush over and over and over again,” he said.
Tan is part of a generation of tech workers who are more assertive in their demands on city officials, unafraid to take sides in the city’s internecine politics and funding organizations that press for more emphasis on public safety.
“Now the narrative out there for some of the founders in our community is, I’m not sure if I feel safe here. I’m not sure if I want to stay here. The quality of life issues are the question. Can I raise a family here?”
In early April, some tech leaders seized upon the recent fatal stabbing downtown of Bob Lee, a prominent industry executive, as an alarming sign that the downtown was unsafe. But an acquaintance was later accused of murder, and San Francisco’s murder rate is quite low compared with other major cities. Overall, police statistics show fewer property and violent crimes in 2022 than in 2018, before the pandemic began.
Still, Bill Scott, the city’s police chief, says many residents complain that they feel less safe, and the open-air drug use, much of it tied to fentanyl, is a major contributor.
Matt Dorsey, a member of the board of supervisors who lives steps away from the shuttered Whole Foods, said recent elections had signaled a shift in voter priorities. He pointed to last year’s recall of the city’s progressive district attorney, Chesa Boudin, who was replaced by a prosecutor who vowed to be tougher on crime.
“San Francisco is in the midst of a voter revolt on public safety,” Dorsey said. In a poll conducted by the San Francisco Chronicle in September, nearly two-thirds of respondents said life in the city was worse off than when they moved here.
The new district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, has begun prosecuting more drug crimes than Boudin, but the city experienced a 40% jump in fatal overdoses in the first quarter compared with the same period last year. Citing that statistic, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday authorized an antidrug task force in San Francisco that will include members of the California National Guard and California Highway Patrol.
The mayor and the police chief have vowed to hire hundreds of additional officers, which would expand the force by more than one-fourth, a difficult proposition when law enforcement agencies nationwide are facing shortages.
Not everyone is on board with that.
Dean Preston, a member of the board of supervisors who was reelected in 2020 on a Democratic Socialist platform, is against increasing police staffing and believes the idea of a shift in the electorate’s view about public safety is overstated.
“There’s been a massive propaganda effort to change public opinion around policing and public safety,” he said.
Preston uses his district as an example of how uneven the pandemic recovery has been. Some areas like Japantown and Haight Ashbury are thriving, he said. Others like the Tenderloin, which is adjacent to the shuttered Whole Foods, are beset by drug dealing and homelessness.
One of the next big tests for downtown might be this summer’s expected opening of an Ikea store not far from the Whole Foods site.
Police described theft as rampant at Whole Foods, with thieves walking out with armfuls of alcohol, at least at the start. After 250 shopping hand baskets were stolen, the company restocked with 50 more. Those went missing, too.
During the store’s 13 months in operation, at least 14 people were arrested, including on charges of grand theft and battery, according to official reports. Scott said that plainclothes officers were sent there and security improved over time, but seemingly not enough for the company.
On a recent chilly night across from the shuttered store, Joseph Peterson, a former construction worker who lost both of his legs to diabetes and is homeless, rolled down the sidewalk in his wheelchair. Peterson could see the 2,000-unit Trinity apartments, the high-end complex that Whole Foods had hoped would be its customer base. Across the intersection, security guards stood sentry in front of the Orpheum Theater, where “Pretty Woman: The Musical” was playing. A few dozen steps away, dealers peddled fentanyl and crystal meth.
Peterson said he understood why Whole Foods had closed the store.
“People kept stealing from it,” he said. He, too, had taken macaroni and cheese and chicken from the hot food bar a number of times, he said. But he made a distinction. Other people stole from the store because they wanted to resell what they took.
“I just stole to eat,” he said.

Fast Money and Faded Hope in China's Shopping Craze: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The yurt stood in the middle of a sweeping northern Chinese grassland, beneath a cloudless sky. A reedy folk tune played. Nearby, sheep grazed.
Suddenly the livestream, which had been showing the idyllic vista, cut to a man in his 30s, wearing a Mongolian hat with a pointed golden spire. "Welcome, brothers and sisters!" he announced from his perch atop a platform bed. "How's the signal? I set up Wi-Fi in my yurt." He held up a bag of beef jerky, branded with a cartoon image of his face. "If it's your first time here, I'm Taiping, and I make beef jerky."
It was another day at work for Taiping, a Chinese livestreaming salesman. Illuminated by carefully arranged studio lights, speaking into two iPhones propped up on a table, Taiping began wooing the thousands of viewers who tapped into his channel. He dangled unwrapped jerky before the camera, describing traditional Mongolian air-drying techniques. He shredded it with his fingers to show its tenderness.
Viewers, by typing comments, sent real-time questions that bubbled from the bottom of the video feed, about how spicy it was or which flavor was best. (Taiping, who read each comment aloud, suggested buying half original, half cumin.) Some longtime fans sent animated pink hearts or thumbs-up symbols, while others simply wanted to say hello. "I missed you, too," Taiping, who like many ethnic Mongolians uses only one name, replied to one viewer.
By the end of the four-hour session, during which he barely paused to drink water, he had received more than 650 orders, totaling $ 15,000.
Taiping is one of countless Chinese riding the explosive wave of influencer culture and live online videos in the country to transform the way people buy and sell. Last year alone, an estimated $ 500 billion in goods were sold via livestream on apps like Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, or Kuaishou, another short video platform -- an eightfold increase since 2019.
Star streamers have become celebrities. The most famous, including Li Jiaqi -- whose prowess at trying on and pitching makeup products earned him the nickname "lipstick king" -- are able to attract tens of millions of viewers per session. Kim Kardashian once appeared with another top Chinese streamer, Viya, to promote her perfume in China, selling 15,000 bottles within minutes.
The format emerged in China several years ago, then became ubiquitous during the coronavirus pandemic. Now nearly half of China's one billion internet users have tried it, even as it remains largely unfamiliar in the West. To Americans, it may be reminiscent of television shopping -- but interactive and, as a result, far more compelling.
The most successful streams are as much entertainment as they are sales pitches. Hosts hawk everything from makeup to microwaves, in an energetic patter that marries the urgency of an auctioneer with the intimacy of an old friend. They tell jokes and personal anecdotes to hold viewers' attention. They call individual fans by name to earn their trust. They promise exclusive deals to win their dollars.
For viewers, the appeal is not only convenience, but also the feeling of being catered to. They can ask a host modeling clothing to show it from a different angle, or inquire how long a snack will keep. They place orders in the stream, never interrupting their favorite host's spiel.
Restaurants, beauty salons, and even car dealerships and property developers now court customers in real time. Global brands from Ikea to Louis Vuitton have paid China's influencers to stream their products. But much of the appeal of this line of business is that anyone can do it: Farmers, factory workers and retirees have joined the frenzy.
Taiping, a former herdsman, now runs his own jerky factory and has more than one million followers. He recently starred in a Kuaishou ad campaign splashed across subway stations in Beijing.
Yet with the market's breakneck growth has come new challenges. Fierce competition has driven many streamers away. A broader economic slowdown has fueled layoffs at the companies behind the streaming platforms.
And the Chinese government, worried that the business was growing too big, too fast, has issued a flood of ever-evolving regulations. Celebrity hosts have abruptly disappeared from view.
The story of livestreaming e-commerce, then, is not only about the rise of a new form of shopping. It is a window into the opportunities and perils of doing business in today's China, as Beijing seeks greater control of private enterprise.
"The Chinese state is so caught up in this economy; it has a dual goal of boosting development, which is a huge imperative for them, and maintaining stability," said Lin Zhang, a media studies professor at the University of New Hampshire who has studied Chinese e-commerce. "Sometimes, this tension is impossible for them to resolve."
A High-Tech New Opportunity
Growing up, Taiping could hardly have imagined making a fortune by any means, let alone by talking into his phone. Born in the plains of Inner Mongolia, a region in northern China where temperatures can plummet to minus 20 degrees, he left school after fifth grade, working as a herdsman, security guard and truck driver. He hardly spoke Mandarin, China's dominant language, as his schoolteachers had taught mostly in Mongolian.
In 2015, noticing that his town's scenic grasslands were attracting tourists, Taiping, then 30 years old, decided to borrow $ 15,000 to make and sell his own beef jerky. But weeks later, the tourist season ended.
Then a friend introduced him to Kuaishou.
The app, pronounced kwai-show, started as China's first short video platform, a place where users shared clips of themselves dancing, cooking or harvesting crops. Taiping quickly saw business potential: He began posting prerecorded videos about his jerky, shipping it to people who messaged him to buy.
Soon, a different opportunity arose. Kuaishou itself had also been looking for ways to make money, and around the time Taiping joined, it introduced livestreaming. At first, streamers earned money purely by performing, trying to attract fans who could send virtual tips; the platform took a cut. But before long, some streamers began staging outlandish stunts to lure viewers, like eating light bulbs, or discussing topics considered taboo, like teenage pregnancy.
Chinese officials, alarmed by what they called "vulgar" content, ordered the company to clean up. Kuaishou scrambled for a new direction -- and, in 2018, landed on live sales. By encouraging streamers to sell products, it could still capitalize on the popularity of livestreaming, but in a more predictable context.
One day, Taiping received a phone call from a Kuaishou representative, who said the company was looking to support rural entrepreneurs. It wanted to help Taiping expand through livestreaming.
Taiping hesitated. "My Mandarin wasn't good," he recalled. "I was nervous. I didn't know how to interact with people."
But the company offered to fly him to Beijing for training; he had never been on a plane, so he agreed. He received a crash course in public speaking, employee management and trademark registration. Kuaishou, eager to advertise its wholesome new direction, promoted his journey in the media.
Over time, Taiping -- who at first had kept a Mandarin dictionary just offscreen -- became confident and unflappable. He heartily gnawed his jerky on camera. He invited fans, whom he called "old friends," to visit, promising a personal grasslands tour. When he occasionally still stumbled over a word, he poked fun at his limited education.
In 2018, he sold $ 650,000 worth of jerky -- earning 30 times more that year than two years earlier.
Then the pandemic hit, turbocharging online shopping. The value of Kuaishou's e-commerce sales grew six times in 2020 over the prior year, according to company statistics, mirroring booms at Douyin and Taobao Live, the other major live shopping platform. In 2021, Kuaishou went public for $ 5.4 billion, the world's biggest technology initial public offering since Uber.
Taiping's business soared, too. He now has 10 customer-service employees who help him respond to fans while he talks. He still sometimes streams from his grassland yurt but also had a yurt backdrop built above his brick-and-mortar store. Onscreen, he wears traditional clothing -- customers like the feeling of authenticity, he said -- but off duty, favors Fila athletic suits.
"Before, how would I know what a trademark was?" he said. "Now I have three."
Chasing an Elusive Dream
More than 1,000 miles south of Taiping's grassland empire, the city of Yiwu is a living showcase for how pervasive livestreaming sales have become.
The city, a manufacturing hub south of Shanghai, claims China's first college for livestreaming e-commerce, as well as multiple training academies that offer days- or weeklong courses. Its office towers house dozens of companies dedicated to managing streamers. The city government, to woo high-earning influencers, has promised prime school placement for their children. Officials built a red archway above a street, trumpeting in neon letters: "Social Media and E-Commerce Capital."‌
Every day, Yiwu draws aspiring streamers like Wang Tiebiao, 55, who is from a small city in eastern Shandong Province about 700 miles away. Mr. Wang had been delivering cargo and selling cheap stainless steel cookware, barely covering inventory costs. Then he saw a Douyin video recruiting streamers to sell home goods for a factory in Yiwu, and promising free training.
"If you open a physical business, you have to pay rent, buy goods, invest so much," Mr. Wang said in February, days after getting to the city. "For this, you just need yourself and a phone."
But the rapid expansion of the field, which has created more opportunities for anybody to jump in, has also made it more difficult to hang on. If Taiping embodied livestreaming's potential for riches, Yiwu is closer to most people's reality.
Under Mr. Wang's deal with the factory, he could choose any of its goods to promote on his personal Douyin account. He would receive a commission on any sales. He had no income otherwise.
To make a sale, however, he had to stand out against legions of other streamers -- not only the fellow newbies working for the same factory, but also the smooth-talking veterans trained and backed by production companies. From his free training, he learned only a few catchphrases and basic technical skills.
For several days, Mr. Wang wandered around the factory's showroom, assessing what among the rows of plastic bowls and spatulas he could pitch well. One morning, fixing his camera on a decorative hourglass shaped like interlocking gemstones, he tested the techniques he had learned for sweet-talking viewers.
"Fans are the heavens and earth, so hit that follow button," he said. His glasses and measured delivery gave him a soothing, professorial air, and he avoided extended silences. Still, his viewers stayed in the single digits.
"There's some metaphysics, or luck, or secrets that we don't know," Mr. Wang said.
Some secrets may be just a matter of money. Many streamers now complain that the apps promote only accounts that pay for traffic. Big agencies splurge on advertising.
Within days of arriving in Yiwu, several of Mr. Wang's fellow trainees had pivoted to looking for more traditional work. Still, Mr. Wang, who had amassed about 1,000 followers, planned to keep trying.
"If I were just another cog in a factory, I could make a few thousand dollars, but I don't want that," he said. "Since we all have to work anyway, I'd rather work for something that has a chance of success."
The State Tries to Clean Up -- And Control
But that success can vanish as quickly as it appears.
First to disappear was Viya, whose real name is Huang Wei, the livestreaming star who had broadcast with Ms. Kardashian. One day in December 2021, all of her social media accounts were deleted.
Several months later, Li Jiaqi, the lipstick king, was abruptly cut off midstream. He posted on social media that he was fixing a technical glitch -- then went silent.
Both had run afoul of the other major force reshaping the livestreaming market: government scrutiny.
Growth was so quick that at first few rules existed to govern it, and soon complaints of misconduct piled up. Brands accused influencers of faking viewership numbers to demand higher commissions. Shoppers reported receiving counterfeit goods from streamers who had seemed trustworthy. Beijing had little way of knowing just how much streamers were earning.
And as audiences grew, so did the potential for livestreams to promote ideas beyond what to buy -- in a format that was, by definition, unpredictable, posing political concerns for a government fixated on control.
Starting in late 2020, regulators began playing catch-up, issuing increasingly detailed restrictions on what streamers could say and do -- part of a broader crackdown on the tech sector, which Beijing believed had grown too influential.
Many of the regulations aim to protect consumers. Unproven claims that products can promote weight loss or improve feng shui are forbidden. Platforms often ban the use of superlatives, like "cheapest" or "best." The rules are enforced through a mix of human censors and artificial intelligence; penalties range from 10-minute suspensions to permanent bans.
Viya's offense was evading more than $ 100 million in taxes, according to the authorities. They fined her $ 210 million, then apparently erased her from the internet. More than a year later, she has not resurfaced.
But the government also wants live-streamers to abide by its moral and political standards. Platforms have banned smoking and low necklines. A state-issued code of conduct, issued in June, ordered hosts not to disparage the Chinese Communist Party, and to "establish a correct world outlook."
"To be a live-streamer, you must have reverence," a commentary in People's Daily, the Communist Party's mouthpiece, said. "You absolutely must not cross the bottom line for the sake of traffic, or test the law for the sake of money."
As the rules proliferated, they risked eroding the central appeal of live-streamed shopping: the entertaining, carnivalesque atmosphere. Mr. Li, the star streamer, had drawn an ardent following with his sassy, at-times off-color jokes, poking fun at other celebrities. But as regulations emerged, he said, he restrained his style. In an interview with a Chinese news outlet in 2021, he acknowledged that some fans thought he had become boring; sometimes, he said, he agreed.
But Mr. Li could not avoid all risks. In the livestream last year where he was cut off midstream, he pitched his viewers on a tank-shaped ice cream cake -- one day before the anniversary of the Chinese military's June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators. There is no indication that Mr. Li intended to deliver a politically charged message. The topic is heavily censored in China and many younger people do not know about it. Still, he vanished for three months.
The constantly evolving landscape has also weighed on smaller-time streamers, like Taiping.
Viewers frequently ask him to speak in Mongolian, and he used to readily comply. But then the streaming platforms started issuing automated warnings for speaking in languages other than Mandarin. (The government has made Mandarin usage a key part of assimilationist policies; other languages may also be harder for censors to understand.)
Taiping now at most says hello in Mongolian. "I won't talk at random," he said. "I've seen what happened to others, and I warn myself."
In recent months, the pace of new regulations has slowed, as the government has pledged to rejuvenate the economy, including by supporting tech companies. Government reports have called livestreaming e-commerce an important channel for boosting consumption.
Tech companies still see room for expansion. Douyin last year reported 124 percent annual growth in livestreaming sales.
In the United States, YouTube and Amazon have poured money into it. But it has struggled to catch on. Americans have returned to in-person shopping after the pandemic, and unlike in China, Western social media apps don't have as many built-in payment features. Facebook and Instagram recently abandoned live shopping.
Even in China, the future of the business is far from certain.
Taiping, despite his success, doesn't see himself streaming forever. Spending hours every day performing for the camera is exhausting; once the stream turns off, he often doesn't want to talk.
He dreams of moving to a big city, becoming a more traditional businessman.
Once, he imagined passing his account to his preteen daughter, but no longer. "By then, who knows if e-commerce will still be around?" he said. "There will probably be something new."

Apartment Rehabs That Rake In the Likes and the Cash: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Though they don't own their apartments, some renters are investing in the décor and design of their units to display on social media and are getting paid to do it.
During the summer of 2020, ‌Imani Keal ‌felt like the walls were closing in‌. Her Washington, D.C., studio apartment felt even smaller than it was. To decompress from pandemic-induced stress, she would stroll around the Georgetown neighborhood, picking up knickknacks, items discarded by fleeing students and left on the street.
She'd also wander into Ace Hardware just because. "I would be at Ace Hardware two to three times a day buying things I did not need because I did not have anything else to do," said Ms. Keal, a content creator‌ and a lifestyle blogger.‌
She took her social media friends on a journey with her during her hunts for trinkets, painting walls -- first green, then gray -- and staining her Ikea Gjora bed frame with Minwax. Soon, hundreds of followers on TikTok and Instagram turned into tens of thousands.
What began as therapy and an exercise in the limits of creativity became a $ 10,000 investment in her roughly $ 1,400-a-month rent-controlled apartment. She put in new light fixtures and received a new faucet worth $ 6,000 for the kitchen sink from a collaboration with a sponsor, updates she considered an investment into her rental apartment. But her interior design hobby became the ultimate work-from-home gig: She estimates she's made more than $ 80,000 from her apartment content through brand deals with companies such as Ikea, Walmart and the alcohol delivery platform Drizly -- enough to quit her job as a project management associate for a kitchen and bath company.
Homeownership ‌has long been held up as an investment toward‌ a wealthier future. But some renters -- particularly those in big cities where homeownership can prove elusive -- are making their rentals as homey as possible. And others are turning their rentals into moneymakers, cashing in on social media algorithms that favor so-called "aesthetic" apartments, often with picturesque views from floor-to-ceiling windows, white, cloudlike sofas and minimal, beige décor. Apartment dwellers who want their spaces to shine on social media platforms -- and potentially lead to brand deals -- should follow this aesthetic, says Ryan Serhant, a New York-based real estate agent.
"It's gotta be light, bright, with big views, or it's gotta have character," said Mr. Serhant, who also hosted the Bravo show "Million Dollar Listing New York."
Earnings can range from a few thousand dollars to sums in the low six figures, according to managers who broker deals between influencers and brands. Many influencers prefer monetizing their content through Instagram or YouTube, which allows creators to earn money through advertising revenue, over TikTok, which pays through a pooled creator fund.
Apartment dwellers willing to post their home décor and design on social media can also rake in money simply by showing off a rug or kitchenware gifted to them by a brand. (Companies, like Ruggable and the home fragrance company Pura, are known for working with influencers and content creators.)
Sometimes the payoff comes as a discount, like comped or discounted rates for an apartment move through well-known moving companies like Roadway or Piece of Cake, which offers a 10 percent commission when a person books a move using their referral link.
The money is a relief for some renters. The median rent in New York City is $ 3,350, and $ 2,600 in Washington, D.C., according to the real estate marketplace website Zillow. Buying a home in a large city isn't much easier, with the median asking price in Manhattan topping $ 1.6 million earlier this year, according to StreetEasy, and nearly $ 1 million across all boroughs. Most millennials and Gen Z'ers are renters, with about 39 percent of people under 35 owning a home, according to census figures.
Sharing your home life with the world isn't new or exclusive to social media, said Kelly Killoren Bensimon, a real estate broker with Douglas Elliman and a former cast member of "The Real Housewives of New York City‌." Shows, such as‌ "MTV Cribs" and "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous," became cult favorites, giving access into the lives of celebrities‌‌, from where they slept to what snacks they kept in the fridge.
"Everybody wants to know where people live and how they live," Ms. Bensimon said.‌‌
It turns out some celebrities were faking it for "MTV Cribs" -- just starting out or simply renting someone else's home.
As fast as the trend of "aesthetic" apartments has risen, a backlash has emerged. Units that aren't brand-new or don't look staged have taken off among some creators on TikTok and YouTube, promoting "normal" or "realistic" apartments, an alternative some have called "de-influencing" or "nonaesthetic."
Yosub Kim, a Brooklyn-based marketing professional looks to platforms such as TikTok but doesn't subscribe to specific aesthetics, in favor of a more "lived-in" apartment. That means everything is on display -- from skin care to Wi-Fi routers.
"It is my space -- I have lived here," said Mr. Kim, who splits a $ 3,400-a-month, two-bedroom in East Williamsburg with his partner. "I want people to feel like it's an actual home, and not like a setup or a place where it has to be photographed perfectly."
Simi Muhumuza, a Brooklyn-based stylist, is the creator of a TikTok sound that, she says, asserts her place in the home décor space without "identifying with specific aesthetics."
The sound, in which Ms. Muhumuza proclaims, "one thing about my house, it's gonna be a vibe. Period," is as much a bat signal to people with "regular apartments," as it is a meticulously-curated space with bright colors -- including a green velvet sofa -- and an accented wall in the living room.
"I sometimes think aesthetics can promise a version of a life that, maybe, isn't real," she said.
"I wanted to reemphasize that your home is valuable and worthy of being celebrated despite not having those things," Ms. Muhumuza said, who has since moved from the apartment showcased on TikTok to a brownstone in the Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood, where she pays about $ 6,500 a month.
There are also drawbacks to putting your home in front of a global audience. Strangers have intimate views into ‌your personal ‌life. In recent years, some creators have said they've been harassed by fans, while others say internet sleuths have deduced precisely where they lived based on cues from their neighborhood or even inside their apartments. Some creators said their dream apartments came at the expense of their happiness.
Others, who have pulled back on putting their homes out into the public, say they are re-evaluating how much of their lives they shared online with strangers at the beginning of the pandemic.
Taryn Williford, a former editor for Apartment Therapy, launched an online video series in which her apartment often took center stage. ‌
‌While she enjoyed helping people figure out cleaning routines during the pandemic, she noticed her job shifting from editing stories mainly behind the scenes to "showing my home and my face to people." That led to meticulous planning, a three-times weekly video shoot at her Atlanta apartment and worrying about online critics.
"I had a lot of knowledge that I loved sharing with readers," Ms. Williford said, who shared videos on Instagram and Apartment Therapy. "But there was this conflict between what I was telling readers to do about how to take care of their homes and how I was treating my own home life."
The idea of sharing your space with the world -- how much you pay, the throw blankets on your couch, even the dishes in the sink -- is likely to stay in the age of social media. Today's influencer, Mr. Serhant said, is yesterday's 'Sex in the City," -- a nod to the show that inspired a generation of people to move to the city seeking a space like Carrie Bradshaw's West Village pad.
"Everyone wanted to be next to Magnolia Bakery in the West Village," Mr. Serhant said. "Today, where are the influencers living? Right in the city -- they're in sky rises, have huge views, and have insane amenities. People are watching that and saying, 'I wanna go where that is -- I want the skyscraper."'

Wizardry Helps to Fit 250 Plants in 350 Square Feet: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: An interior designer who has made a career out of maximizing space in tiny homes has the answer.
If you visit Alejandro Aguilar's Brooklyn home in early spring, the best time to show up is between 6:30 and 7 p.m. That golden half-hour is when sunlight skims over the surrounding factory buildings and streams through the windows, kissing the leaves, fronds and spines of his 250-odd houseplants.
You'll find a white moth orchid posted at his doorway like a member of the King's Guard, and a cohort, beyond that, of snake plants and spider plants in little pots. Pothos dangle from beams like paratroopers; villages of cactuses are arranged in dusty clusters; and aloe vera plants spike the windowsills. In one corner, a corn plant towers over baskets of bromeliads and ferns.
Mr. Aguilar is vastly outnumbered by his greenery. It is a wonder that he has room to move around at all. The second-floor apartment, which is in a century-old brick townhouse in East Williamsburg, is only 350 square feet. But Mr. Aguilar, 60, is an interior designer who has made a career out of maximizing space in tiny homes.
He has skillfully arranged this one to feel like anything but a damp, loamy conservatory. Your first instinct is not to say, "Lordy, that's a lot of plants," but to marvel at the many moods, nooks and vignettes in what began as a simple square.
Mr. Aguilar, who was born in Honduras and has lived in New York for half a century, continues to embrace the lifestyle of a young urban newcomer, settling down in fringy neighborhoods until he is chased away by rising rents. He moved to this building in 2012 after eight years in North Williamsburg and has taken three and a half years to complete this renovation -- more or less.
"I'm waiting for the bathroom ceiling to collapse one more time," he said, at which point he can supervise the landlord's replacement of it.
And although the ax of gentrification has fallen on East Williamsburg, it is challenging to be woken at 5 a.m. by the warning beeps of freight trucks thrown into reverse gear, he said. People are not rushing to move into his building. His rent is still only $ 1,350 a month.
"This is Japanese living at its best," he said.
And his tiny domicile is palatial when you compare it to the 184 square feet he once occupied comfortably on the Lower East Side. Through an ingenious use of mirrors, sliding-glass doors, curtains and customized storage, he has managed to carve out no fewer than six distinct spaces within the apartment.
First is the entrance, which has a mirrored ceiling and a wall papered with a fragment of a botanical pattern called Scandinavian Bellewood. Translucent white, gridded fabric covers the opening of an overhead storage compartment. (The textile, which Mr. Aguilar picked up at a fabric store in Downtown Brooklyn for $ 1.99 a yard, reappears many times at many lengths throughout his home.)
The next room is a white, multipurpose space that shows off the unit's original wood floors and pressed-tin ceilings. Mr. Aguilar added beams that incorporate tracks for sliding-glass partitions and provide handy surfaces for plants and artifacts.
"I hate going into a kitchen right away" after entering a home, he said, so he tucked his refrigerator, sink and miniature bar into an ell that can be closed off (Space No. 3), and built a tall, narrow pantry as the room's central feature. Its open shelves hold glass jars, fruit bowls and greenery. The lowest shelf thrusts out to serve as a table, with a couple of stools stored underneath.
Turning right from the entrance takes you to Space No. 4: a strip that is Mr. Aguilar's office and shrine. He designed and built the slim, fold-down desk and shelving. (At this juncture, it should be noted that there is hardly an aspect of the renovation that he didn't nail, paint, glue or sew with his own hands.) Anchored by the corn plant, the shrine also includes pink Himalayan salt lamps, a Santeria statue and a large wooden sculpture shaped like a penis (a gift from an artist friend).
But all of this is just a prelude to Space No. 5, which Mr. Aguilar reveals with a flourish, sliding open another set of glass doors in the pantry/dining room and pulling back gossamer curtains like a magician's assistant.
What appears is a room less than eight feet wide with a maroon-painted tin ceiling, the color flowing a dozen inches down dark gray walls. Its cheerful-looking plants bask in light from a south-facing window. Its bookcases are cobbled together from Ikea plumbing tubes and plastic brackets. Its dusty rose daybed is Scandinavian.
"I use mirrors a lot, as you can see," Mr. Aguilar said, indicating one silvery wall. He made a panel out of nine mirrors that he found on the cheap and glued strips of stained wood to their surfaces to form a jazzy grid pattern. Because it is not easy to live in constant sight of one's own reflection, he said, he modified the mirrors further by cracking the glass.
And those paintings? he is asked about a pair of abstract canvases on the opposite wall.
"Those are actually fire-retardant panels I found on the street," he said. "And one day I was painting on them." The outlines of the sprayed objects with their neon halos led him to exclaim, "Oh, my God, this looks like art!"
And he sleeps where?
Mr. Aguilar leads his visitor to Space No. 6.
This pale blue room, off the study, has no obvious bed, but it does have a floor covered in soft mats and a pair of rings dangling from the ceiling for exercise. Handmade bookshelves painted in a mix of splashy colors are crammed with potted plants and art objects. Framed pictures stand five- and six-deep on the floor below.
"Everywhere you sit there's always something to look at, from every angle," Mr. Aguilar said, and then shooed his visitor from the room.
When the visitor was summoned back, the bed had appeared, having been lowered from its disguised vertical position fronting another set of bookcases at the room's entrance.
"I'm an intense guy, and kind of too much sometimes," Mr. Aguilar said after the tour was over.
His clients seem to adore him, nonetheless.
Raphaele de Boisblanc, the director of marketing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, met Mr. Aguilar seven years ago when she and her husband, Peter de Boisblanc, moved with their two young children into a brownstone in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. Their floor-through coop had two bedrooms and one bathroom, and the couple appealed to Mr. Aguilar to help them make efficient use of the space.
Ms. de Boisblanc, 47, who is French, recounted Mr. Aguilar's first observation in a recent phone interview: "Spaces are not the issue; people are," he told her.
Before entering a working relationship, he insisted on spending time with the family over multiple days to observe how they lived. "He said it was important that we felt comfortable around him, because it would be a process," she said.
The feeling cut both ways. "I don't like to work with people I don't like," Mr. Aguilar told her.
The designer does not have what one might call a head for business. He is not a great believer in contracts. He consults with his clients for free, spouting suggestions for improvements that they can take or leave. Rather than using computer software to render a design concept in a realistic way, he sometimes simply executes his ideas so that his clients can visualize what he had in mind, undoing the work if they are not enchanted.
That's how Quincey Smith, 33, came home one day to his one-bedroom apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, to find that Mr. Aguilar had rearranged the furniture and demarcated areas in the living room by painting the columns.
Mr. Smith, who works in external affairs and crisis management for an international organization, was not put off. Although he found the absence of any formal work agreement disorienting at first, he learned to trust Mr. Aguilar and enjoyed the many (unbilled) hours in his company discussing color and studying the changing light in his home. "It's clear that he cares so much about design, about the energy in a space," he said.
Mr. Aguilar's clients also described being awed at his resourcefulness, born of what appears to be an exhaustive knowledge of the inventory of every hardware store and housewares supplier in the New York metropolitan area.
"One of the great joys is going to Ikea with Alejandro," said Phoebe Holtzman, 34, who with her husband, Massimo Young, hired Mr. Aguilar to work on several projects in their brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. "Not only does he exactly know what is good quality and what isn't, but he knows where everything is, all the little back hallways."
Jarema Osofsky, 37, who hired Mr. Aguilar to build out her business in Gowanus, Brooklyn, an interior plant design and landscape design studio called Dirt Queen NYC, recalled how he created bamboo mobiles inspired by Alexander Calder sculptures. "He's a wizard with small spaces," she said.
"He is a ... how do you say...?" Ms. de Boisblanc turned away from the phone to speak French to her family. "Oh yes," she came back. "An elf. But a magical one, not a nasty one."

Full text: Jean-Yves Thibaudet is playing Messiaen's "Turangalîla-Symphonie" this week. But before, he debuted a night of jazz standards with Michael Feinstein.
PALM DESERT, Calif. -- "Jean-Yves, when did you start playing the piano?" Michael Feinstein asked from the stage of the McCallum Theater here on a recent Friday night.
"I started when I was 5 years old," said the star pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet, whose instrument was interlocked with Feinstein's for their cabaret-style show, "Two Pianos: Who Could Ask for Anything More?"
"Oh, me too," Feinstein responded.
"We both took a different path with our approach to the piano," Thibaudet continued, reading from an iPad on his music stand. "I studied classical music----"
"And I," Feinstein said, facing the audience, "studied nothing."
There was laughter throughout the auditorium, while onstage, Thibaudet looked tickled. Speaking during a concert, beyond introducing an encore, was new for him. But he was warming up to it quickly.
Even if he was dipping into the unfamiliar on that first of many "Two Pianos" performances to come (including next season at Carnegie Hall), that's business as usual for Thibaudet, 61, an artist who has, unusually for a classical musician, made a career of doing whatever he wants.
Brazenly himself -- openly gay before many of his colleagues, abandoning traditional concert attire for couture -- he has long been an eminent interpreter of classical music, but also a prolific collaborator and a soloist on movie soundtracks like Wes Anderson's "The French Dispatch." Through it all his tastes have been eclectic; he's as likely to take on lieder as he is the Great American Songbook and the jazz of Bill Evans. Characteristically, he is following "Two Pianos" with something like its opposite: Messiaen's thorny, monumental "Turangalîla-Symphonie," with the New York Philharmonic, beginning on Friday.
"There are soloists who only play one or two concertos a season," Thibaudet said during one of three interviews. "I couldn't do that. I would stop practicing. I always want to try things."
THIBAUDET WAS BORN in Lyon, France, in an environment he described as "fortunate." His parents were music lovers who supported him through the conservatory system -- including studies at the storied Conservatoire de Paris -- and didn't make much of his coming out.
At school, he learned a Mozart sonata, but would also experiment with something else if it interested him. That open-mindedness is reflected in his 2021 album "Carte Blanche," which starts with a new suite from the "Pride and Prejudice" soundtrack and continues with works from the Baroque period through the 20th century. The recording's program, Thibaudet said, was "like going to a restaurant and having all your favorite dishes in one meal -- with a lot of desserts."
Such a broad scope, and a willingness to give almost anything a chance, is essential to Thibaudet's artistry. "Obviously if I don't like it I won't do it again, but I at least tried it," he said. "My life has been so enriched by all that. Your brain is like a computer -- you're constantly feeding it. So if I play some jazz and then some Chopin, the jazz gives the Chopin a certain freedom and relaxation."
Relaxation, yes, but Thibaudet is also a proud Virgo whose lack of tension in performance would be impossible without a perfectionist's rigor. "He is an exquisitely gifted technician," Feinstein said. "And yet it is always the overarching intelligence behind an interpretation that makes his playing for me so special. He understands how to make any kind of music living and breathing, and never clinical."
Thibaudet won competitions as a teenager, and early in his 20s signed a recording contract with Decca. Young artists often face pressure from varied competing interests: managers, administrators, label executives. Even then, though, Thibaudet insisted on making critical decisions himself.
He didn't want his first concerto recording with Decca to be of French music -- "It's not your passport that makes your repertoire," he said -- so, he programmed Liszt. He traveled with his partner at the time, and declined dinner invitations abroad, no matter how prominent the company, if he couldn't bring him. "I was thinking," Thibaudet recalled, "if I had a wife, of course they would invite her."
Hiccups like that, though, were rare, and overall, Thibaudet said, being open about his sexuality has made him a happy, open person. Perhaps more remarked upon, back then, was Thibaudet's fashion. "I decided more than 35 years ago that I was not going to wear tails," he said. "That was a battle."
Thibaudet's clothing collection -- rivaled only by those of his fine wines and Champagnes -- is rich with museum-quality pieces. He had a fruitful relationship with Gianni Versace, and an especially prolific one with Vivienne Westwood before her recent death. For many years, though, writers often couldn't resist a disapproving comment about his outfits.
That cooled over time. There was one critic -- Thibaudet wouldn't name names, saying only that the newspaper was from a major city -- who, after reviewing his concerts for more than two decades, wrote something along the lines of: At the end of the day, if you're playing so well, you can wear whatever you want. "And I was like, there you go," Thibaudet said. "It took you 25 years. Finally."
ANOTHER PILLAR of Thibaudet's career has been collaboration. In film, one partner has been Dario Marianelli, who featured him on his Academy Award-winning soundtrack for Joe Wright's "Atonement" in 2007. More famous is their work together on Wright's adaptation, two years earlier, of "Pride and Prejudice," which opens with an elegant piano solo redolent of the Classical era, "Dawn."
"All over the world people know that score," Thibaudet said. "Then they go to hear Chopin or Debussy, and they tell me, 'This is my first classical concert.' I could play 'Turangalîla,' but they still come. It's great."
Some of Thibaudet's most treasured partnerships have been with singers. "The human voice produces something that you cannot do with any instrument," he said. "It touches your soul."
He has recorded with Renée Fleming, the superstar soprano, with whom he became fast friends in the 1990s. She recalled that when she bought an apartment in Paris, he offered to take her to Ikea to help her furnish it; what she didn't know until he pulled up was that he drove a Maserati with no trunk.
"Jean-Yves is an ideal collaborator," Fleming said. "He has tremendous personality and charm, both on and offstage, that he brings to the music, but he's also extremely flexible and sensitive."
Sensitive, but unwilling, she added, to "put something before the public unless it is prepared to the very highest standard." That much has been evident in his project with Feinstein, the reigning, de facto keeper of the Great American Songbook. Thibaudet and Feinstein already knew each other's work when they met a couple of decades ago as neighbors in Los Angeles. What started as dinner-party fun -- Richard Rodgers waltzes at the piano, and some improvisation -- became a formal program inspired by their mutual love for Gershwin and his contemporaries.
As a model they also looked to Yehudi Menuhin and Stéphane Grappelli's classical-meets-jazz collaborations, Feinstein said, in which Menuhin's parts were precisely notated while Grappelli's left room for improvisation. To pull off something similar with two pianos, Feinstein turned to his music director, Tedd Firth, who wrote most of the arrangements.
"I really wanted to focus on what they do best," Firth said, adding, "I didn't want to make Jean-Yves into a jazz player or Michael into a classical player, or water down either to create a neutral territory."
The result is a fantasia-like program of Lisztian virtuosity. Firth's arrangements have orchestral heft, with the melodies of each piece flowing freely between the two pianos. Sometimes Feinstein sings; sometimes Thibaudet plays alone; always, the music has the energy and showiness of an encore.
They rehearsed in Los Angeles before the McCallum Theater shows, putting in the hours of a full-time job in the days leading up to the premiere. During one of those sessions, Thibaudet behaved for a moment like a fan: He just wanted to hear Feinstein sing "Pure Imagination," from "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory." When the two fell out of sync during a Gershwin medley, Thibaudet said to follow the French national anthem, "La Marseillaise," because at roughly 120 beats per minute, it was nearly the same tempo. ("My whole life is in that piece," he added.)
By the sound check on opening night, both artists had been visibly nudged out of their comfort zones. But once the show started and the audience heard a familiar melody from Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue," the auditorium resounded with applause. "That was the greatest gift that either of us could have," Feinstein said. "It showed how excited they were to hear this music." Feeling the energy of the house, Thibaudet said, he became "dangerously comfortable" with speaking onstage -- even more so at the more assured performance the following night.
"Two Pianos" seemingly has a long life ahead of it, with dates still being booked at least two seasons ahead. An orchestrated version will play this summer with the Boston Pops at Tanglewood, the Cleveland Orchestra at its Blossom Music Festival and elsewhere. But before that, its two stars will continue with their separate careers. Feinstein has a Judy Garland celebration at Zankel Hall in New York later this month. And Thibaudet, of course, has "Turangalîla."
"Maybe I need a week to readjust, but this is me," Thibaudet said, adding with a giggle, "It's perfectly normal for me."

The Question of Identity Still Lingers: [Review]

Full text: The problem with this sequel is that the character used up his best ideas in the first movie.
Over the next three months, Warner Brothers will release two separate blockbusters starring super-dudes who zip around in red suits emblazoned with lightning bolts. "Shazam! Fury of the Gods," a sequel that trips over its desperation to amuse, needs the running start over "The Flash."
Not only does its lead character have lower brand recognition because of his inability to outrun a speeding trademark lawyer, he's also spent eight decades searching for a reason to exist. In 1941, two years after he was created, the character (known then as Captain Marvel) was the subject of a copyright infringement lawsuit by the publishers of Superman, who claimed that he was a knockoff with identical powers. Decades later, when he attempted a comeback, Marvel Comics stripped away his name with a cease-and-desist. Even here, within the safe space of his own overlong and clangy movies, he flails for an identity. Should he go by Thundercrack? Zap-tain America? The returning director David F. Sandberg's one good idea is centering the character's anxiety on his redundance -- a super-clone weighed down by impostor syndrome. Spin the jagged M of his lightning bolt horizontally and Sandberg could claim it stands for Captain Metajoke.
Two hours into his second movie, our hero (Zachary Levi) finally adopts the moniker Shazam!, which stands for his ability to channel the combined abilities of the gods Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury. Tweedy types, myself included, might grumble that Solomon and Achilles aren't technically gods -- and that, for consistency, Mercury should really be Hermes -- but what's the point when a guy with the supposed wisdom of Solomon opens the movie bleating, "I'm an idiot!"
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The problem with Shazam! -- let's do without the spirit fingers for the rest of this review -- is that the character used up his best ideas in the first movie, which came out in 2019. For his debut, Sandberg and the screenwriter Henry Gayden were graced with low expectations and a wallop of tenderness and wit. All they had to do was endear us to young Billy Batson (Asher Angel), a 14-year-old runaway who ka-pows into his magical alter ego (Levi) whenever the boy yells, well, you know. The heart came from watching the lonely child embrace his foster family and, ultimately, share his powers with five other orphans; the laughs came from the body-morphing comedy of seeing a teen in an adult-size skin suit realize that with great power comes the ability to buy booze. If the Avengers are swaggering mall cops who maintain order for the purpose of selling T-shirts and toys, Shazam is the juvenile delinquent shoplifting their dignity.
Levi boasts a dopey, roguish charm associated more with Super Bowl beer commercials than super-tights. He's a good physical comedian, especially when he gnaws a breath mint like a bunny. Yet, as the child version of Shazam nears 18, the character can't stay moronic forever -- and there won't be anything interesting about him once he matures. To stall for time, his character arc is merely a bunt. (As best I could figure, he has to either unite his family ... or learn to let them go?) The script, by Gayden and Chris Morgan, a longtime "Fast & Furious" scribe, clutters the bases with over a dozen distractions: six super-siblings at two age stages, three Greek gods, a half-dozen breeds of mythological beasties, two parents, one wizard, and one weak romance between the goddess Anthea (Rachel Zegler, who spends the running time fretfully furrowing her brow) and Billy's brother Freddy Freeman, played by Jack Dylan Grazer, an intense, moody actor with the potential -- and connections -- to be a serious star. (His uncle is the producer Brian Grazer.)
Drama starts when two daughters of Atlas, Hespera (Helen Mirren) and Kalypso (Lucy Liu), storm into an Athenian history museum to steal an ancient staff that will restore their celestial ability to raze and smash. I'd credit Mirren for the flourish when her character claws at the staff's display box like a cat pawing a fish tank, but I'm not entirely sure it was her under the pixels. Once empowered, the immortal sisters reduce the museum's treasures (and its tourists) to rubble, having as much reverence for human artifacts as we might have for an Ikea couch. Then the pair sets out to squeeze extra god juice from Shazam and his cohorts, who are, as one might expect from untrained children, so awful at hero-ing that their hometown, Philadelphia, has nicknamed them the Fiascos. (Still, to a city that treasures misfit mascots like Gritty and the Phillie Phanatic, that name may be somewhat affectionate.)
The quippy script doesn't take much seriously. The score, by Christophe Beck, insists that we do. It's an ungainly mishmash of tones that comes together only in one bizarre, wonderful gag when a graying wizard (Djimon Hounsou) barges into Billy's erotic dream to deliver some very serious exposition with his head fused to Wonder Woman's bronze-plated breasts.
Performance-wise, the film is cleaved into two camps: teens versus titans, or really, relentless wisecrackers in on the overall joke versus stern grande dames who treat the joke as sophomoric. The closest Liu comes to a smile is a twitch of anticipation just before she blasts someone with a laser beam. Mirren, looking otherworldly in white mascara and a taloned crown, only bothered to bring one expression to set, a non-emotion best described as "hypnotic cobra face." When Mirren allows herself to be body-slammed, the shock of seeing the cinema's queen thwacked into concrete makes it impossible to focus on the stakes of the scene. Instead of thinking about the division of god and mortal, we're distracted by the blurring of actors and wrestlers.
Sandberg started his career in small horror films, and doesn't seem to have much ambition to scale up. Most of the sequences are cut from medium shots strung together without much style -- they may as well be a "Saturday Night Live" sketch. The fight scenes are a repetitive headache of lightning zaps and crushed cars. (Twice, a bridge gets destroyed.) One team meet-up is staged, randomly, at an auto junkyard; it's as though these serial sedan-killers want to lord it over the corpses. The look is bold and blah, either blue-gray gloom or a shellacking of amber magic-hour glow. Whenever there's an image with visual awe -- say, Shazam battling through a blaze of electricity -- the movie hastily cuts away, as if embarrassed by its own aspirations. Relax, super-bro. You're not going to get sued for striving to be more than a runner-up.

Full text: Two product designers discuss their own private diasporas.
This article is part of our Design special section on how the recent push for diversity in design is changing the way the world looks.
People with a history of moving between worlds bring a unique perspective to designing for the home. Teresa Rivera, 30, grew up in New York's Dominican diaspora but now lives in London. Jean Lee, 40, emigrated from Taiwan to Oregon as a child and today splits her practice between Brooklyn and Seattle.
Each designer's experience recreating familiar elements in new contexts has influenced how she makes objects. For Ms. Rivera, who co-founded the studio Wilkinson & Rivera with her husband, Grant Wilkinson, in 2020, it has meant working together to reimagine traditional timber furniture, like a Windsor chair, with visually destabilizing squiggly lines.
For Ms. Lee, the founder, with Dylan Davis, of the 13-year-old design company Ladies & Gentlemen, a culturally complex upbringing has helped shape furniture, jewelry and light fixtures characterized by what the designers call "playful austerity."
When Ms. Rivera was in New York for a visit in January, she joined Ms. Lee at Ladies & Gentlemen's Red Hook work space to talk about how hybrid understandings of place have influenced their practices. (This interview was edited for length and clarity.)
You have these parallel stories. How did it happen for each of you, meeting your partners when you were studying and then later starting studios with them?
TERESA RIVERA: I'm from New York but I went to Tyler School of Art and Architecture in Philadelphia. Though their study abroad program is in Rome, I wanted to go to London -- I literally couldn't tell you why London. I forced myself into my own program at the University of the Arts London, and that's where I met Grant. We married really young, and I like to say that we grew into adults together. I'm the one who inspired him to get into woodworking. It's been a very interwoven journey.
JEAN LEE: That's funny because Dylan and I did a study-abroad program together in Rome. One of the things that really inspired us was the culture of Italian artisans earning a living from selling what they made at local markets -- it was so direct and pure. We'd been studying at the University of Washington in Seattle, where the trajectory for a lot of industrial design students was to work in tech designing cellphones and gadgets. I wasn't too interested in that.
When we started Ladies & Gentlemen five years later, it was the middle of the recession. A lot of designers were out of work and starting their own practices. We were part of a new wave of independent designers. I learned that when things fall apart, it actually allows room for new growth to come.
It's interesting what develops from a moment of crisis or disruption, whether it's the recession or the pandemic when you started your studio, Teresa. Was it something you'd been wanting to do for a while?
RIVERA: We were always thinking one day we'll do something together. But what happened was I fell pregnant. It was this massive change and we needed to restructure our lives. I was working as an interior designer for this small company, Fran Hickman Design & Interiors, and on a plane back to New York every other month for installs or a site visit. Not what you want to do with a baby. Grant had these three-hour commutes. It was ammunition enough to take the plunge.
One day Grant made this sketch, a very early rendition of our Windsor chair. It was like we were both having these existential crises, and then with this doodle, a light bulb went off. We got into a shared space, Blackhorse Workshop, and we built this chair with our baby strapped to my chest. I always call our son, Genie, our muse. When we launched the chair in March 2021, it was like we shot it out of a T-shirt gun.
It went viral, right?
RIVERA: It went viral on Twitter. It took on this Gen-Z narrative of anxiety and youthful angst.
LEE: Did you feel like that was accurate?
RIVERA: No, but we thought it was funny. We had the idea we were taking a very trad Windsor chair and almost passing it through a filter, like it was refracted in water.
What has moving to a new place changed most for you?
RIVERA: I think before I took for granted people's understanding or interpretation of me. The Dominican diaspora is concentrated in North Jersey, Upper Manhattan and the Bronx. You can't live in New York and not know what a Dominican person is. When I went to Philly, it was a shock, losing that immediate identification as a Dominican person.
Then moving to London, I became this embodiment of American-ness and often had to explain I was actually first-generation and didn't grow up encountering certain quintessential American traditions. On the census in London, they don't even have Latino as a category, but there are Latinos in London. When I was living in Seven Sisters, in North London, I found a Latino market, and it was the only place in London I've found the little empanada discs I need to make my pastelitos for the holidays.
LEE: There is nothing that can compare with the connection that food brings to people. I was born in Taiwan, but then we moved to the U.S. to this tiny little coastal Oregon town. I was the only Asian kid in my school and there were no Asian grocery stores in town. On the weekend we would drive two hours to Portland where there were bigger Vietnamese and Chinese communities. We'd eat as much as we could of dim sum dishes, and my aunts would stock up on Asian groceries. It was the best way for us to maintain our connection with our culture, and this idea seeps into how I work.
When you greet someone on the street in Taiwan, you say, "Hey, have you eaten yet?" instead of "How are you?" It's a way of making sure someone's taken care of, and that's how I approach design. I want to create objects and experiences that make people feel taken care of.
How have these experiences of dislocation influenced your approach to design?
RIVERA: My fascination with tweaking tradition probably comes from seeing it through the lens of an outsider. Grant and I want to create today's heirlooms. There was narrative and history around certain objects in my home. I grew up with this pilon -- my mom still has it -- a mortar and pestle, a free-standing one, maybe as tall as this table. It was my great-grandmother's and it's from the campo of the Dominican Republic. It traveled all this way and through these generations, a coveted piece of our family's history embedded with years of garlic juice.
My mother also has this chest which was her grandfather's. It's funny that they're both wooden objects. These are models for how we design. We want things to last.
Right, and not just end up like that pile of Ikea in the trash you see when someone's moving.
LEE: I feel that it's not so much about where you bought the object from, but more about having an awareness of valuing the object. In Taiwan, there's a real understanding of resourcefulness. The island was occupied by so many countries and didn't have its own identity until the '80s or '90s, so there's this hodgepodge approach to making things that adapt and evolve.
It's another thing that indirectly influences my approach. When we started our studio, we'd just go to the hardware store and find unassuming materials we could afford and play around with them. We love reimagining things most people overlook. Whether we're exploring a place or a material, it's the spirit, the intention to create a meaningful connection through design.
We've been in the industry for over 10 years now, and during the pandemic we had to reckon with ourselves and ask, what are we contributing? We realize that we can't just be in a bubble making and selling things while ignoring the rest of what's happening in the world. I don't have the answers yet, but we're still figuring out how design can be a platform for activism and community building. I can't help but think about how my heritage can feed into this idea.
The industry has had its own moment of reckoning when it comes to social issues and representation. Has that changed how you feel you're received?
RIVERA: The London design world is incredibly white. I had to learn how to exist being the only person of color in certain rooms. It's gone from something that wasn't addressed to, "Oh yeah, Teresa's Black" -- like people just remembered.
LEE: This growing awareness of racial diversity has empowered me to embrace my own heritage more, rather than feeling the need to dim my own light in order to assimilate.

Kitchen Cabinets, in All Their Complexity: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's more complicated than you might think. Here's what to consider before you spend a lot on the wrong ones.
Choosing cabinets for a kitchen renovation seems simple enough. They're essentially boxes for holding dishes, glasses and cooking utensils. How hard could it be?
The decision-making process, it turns out, can be quite involved, since there are so many design details and features available -- and considering the significant investment required. So it's worth making sure that you end up with cabinets you'll be happy with for a long time.
But how do you know what's best for your home?
"Obviously, it depends on what you're starting with," said Nina Farmer, an interior designer based in Boston. "An apartment versus a house is very different." So is a traditional home versus a modern one. Your ambitions for cooking and entertaining should also influence the design of your kitchen.
To help sort through the options, we asked interior designers and kitchen manufacturers how they help their clients find the best fit.
Focus on Drawers
Start by considering the lower cabinets: Some are made with doors and shelves, but many designers now prefer those outfitted with drawers.
"I find people get much more use out of something they can pull out, rather than a shelf," Ms. Farmer said. With a drawer, you don't have to stoop down to look inside, because all the contents are revealed when you pull it out.
If you prefer the look of a door, there's a workaround: Add tray-like pullout drawers inside the cabinet, Ms. Farmer suggested, behind a door that opens on hinges.
"That generally has the same capacity," she said. "Sometimes I'll even have a bottom drawer that pulls out with the door and then place another inner drawer on top."
Compared with a door-and-shelf design, she said, "it's always more functional."
Choose Upper Cabinets or Shelves
Eliminating upper cabinets in favor of open shelving above the counters has been a trend for years. But it's not right for everyone.
"Some of our clients are very into exposed shelves," said Christine Stucker, who runs Stewart-Schäfer, an interior design firm with offices in New York and Connecticut, with her husband, James Veal. "But I feel like we have to educate them that it has to be curated. You can't throw all of your kids' mugs and random stuff up there. Some people don't understand that when you see those pictures of shelves on Pinterest or Instagram, someone has spent hours curating them."
As a compromise, she and her husband frequently give homeowners both: some upper cabinets for basic storage and some open shelves where they can display favorite dishes. "It's a balancing act of managing how much storage they need and how much they're going to be able to keep up with the curated look," Ms. Stucker said. "You want a kitchen to look clean and put-together, not in disarray."
Decide Between Full Overlay and Inset Doors
One of the defining features of kitchen cabinets is whether they use full-overlay doors and drawer fronts, or inset ones.
Full-overlay doors are typically mounted with concealed European hinges and fully cover the edges of the cabinets when closed. Doors and drawer fronts can be positioned directly beside each other with only minimal gaps in between. Most Ikea and European cabinets are built this way, and the look is usually modern and sleek.
Inset doors and drawer fronts sit within a larger face frame that covers the edges of the cabinets behind, which spaces them out for a more traditional look with exposed hinges.
"There's a proper wooden door with butt hinges, sitting within a frame," explained Merlin Wright, the design director at Plain English, a British cabinetry company with U.S. showrooms in New York and Los Angeles. "Our approach is very traditional and based on Georgian and some Victorian originals that we see in the big old historic houses in the U.K."
Some kitchens also have half-overlay doors, where the cabinets have a face frame partially concealed by overlapping doors, but that style has largely fallen out of fashion.
One type isn't better than the others: The important thing is to figure out which look you prefer.
"When we're working with traditional spaces, we love to use inset panels," said Jensen Killen, who founded Logan Killen Interiors, in New Orleans, with Katie Logan Leblanc. "But a full-overlay slab front is great in a modern interior to give a very clean, streamlined look."
Consider Panels for Your Appliances
Another current trend is covering refrigerators and dishwashers with cabinetry panels to make them almost disappear.
In most cases, when Stewart-Schäfer designs kitchens, Ms. Stucker said, "we really like to hide the appliances as much as possible, so the kitchen feels like another communal room and doesn't read so much as a kitchen."
To do so, they buy panel-ready appliances, which come with no exterior door but are designed to accept a custom cabinet door.
Of course, paneled appliances aren't for everyone. "If someone cooks a lot and wants more of that chef's kitchen look, we might just go with really nice stainless steel appliances," Ms. Logan LeBlanc said.
Choose the Finish
Cabinet doors and drawer fronts are available in many finishes, including metal, solid wood, wood veneer, laminate and paint. When you're choosing one, style preferences, durability and affordability come into play.
Stainless steel and solid wood doors, for instance, are likely to stand up to crashing children's toys better than wood veneer, but they typically cost more. Laminate is extremely tough, but it might not provide the look you want. A painted finish offers flexibility, because the doors can usually be touched up or even repainted.
"With traditional hand-painted cupboards, you could not paint it for 20 years and it would start getting slightly shabby, but still look great," Mr. Wright said, adding that most Plain English cabinets are delivered with a hand-painted finish. "You could repaint it, if you want, to make it look new again, or you could repaint it to change the color."
Pay Attention to the Hardware
There are myriad handles to choose from, including knobs and bar pulls made in forms ranging from perfectly machined stainless-steel cylinders to cast-brass wabi-sabi grips. Many people mix knobs and bar pulls within a matching collection, using knobs on doors and smaller drawers, and bar pulls on larger drawers and appliance panels.
You can choose to celebrate the hardware with an expressive choice, de-emphasize it with a streamlined pick, or get rid of exterior hardware altogether by using touch latches or finger pulls.
Stewart-Schäfer frequently uses exposed pulls in traditional kitchens, choosing distinctive metal handles. But in modern kitchens, they often build cabinet doors with integrated grooves for fingers instead. "Unless it adds something to the overall look, we do try to avoid hardware," Ms. Stucker said.
Inside the cabinets, most people want the latest internal hardware for maximum functionality, whether the kitchen looks traditional or modern, Ms. Logan Leblanc said. She advised looking for smooth-running, full-extension drawer slides with soft-close mechanisms that prevent drawers from being slammed.
Design the Insides
Drawers that are empty boxes provide basic storage space, but do little to keep things organized. Building them out with integrated or customizable storage compartments and dividers can help maximize space.
While it's possible to add aftermarket drawer organizers later, it's rare to find products that are a perfect fit, because drawers are made in so many sizes. The advantage of a well-designed kitchen system that includes dividers is that it comes with everything figured out, said Scott Hudson, the chief executive of the kitchen companies Henrybuilt and Space Theory.
"You get these functional components that are unique," Mr. Hudson said. "So each drawer has a fitted system of containers, knife storage or ways to store cutting boards."
That, in turn, makes the kitchen easier to keep tidy -- because you can see where every item goes at a glance. "A good system automatically helps you stay organized because you don't even have to think about it," Mr. Hudson said.
Remember the Extras
Beyond basic cabinets, there are a few special features that can make a kitchen even more appealing. One is an integrated pullout drawer for trash and recycling, so you're not jamming a bin under the sink.
Although garbage usually isn't too exciting, Mr. Hudson described a trash pullout drawer as "a big level up."
Countertop appliances like toasters, kettles and coffee makers also have a tendency to look like clutter, so another option is adding an appliance garage -- a large cabinet with electrical outlets, usually at the same height as the counter.
"It's a big thing right now," said Mr. Veal, of Stewart-Schäfer. "We just completed one with a sliding door. It's almost like a continuation of the kitchen counter, just behind a door."
In one of Ms. Farmer's projects, she installed a cabinet from Plain English that looks similar to a stand-alone armoire. "You open it up and there's a marble countertop inside where you can hide your toaster and things like that," she said.
Imogen Pritchard, the U.S. design director at Plain English, said these kinds of cabinets are increasingly popular.
"It's a larder cupboard, which traditionally would have been a cool store for cheese, bread, butter and things that don't actually need to be in the fridge," Ms. Pritchard said. "But we realized that the larder cupboard actually makes the perfect breakfast cupboard."
A breakfast cupboard equipped with a coffee maker, juicer and toaster could even be considered a lifestyle upgrade, she added: "We look at how we can help make mornings a bit easier, by giving everything its place."

Little Houses on the Horizon: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: At the International Builders' Show, exhibitors offered mini prefab houses, kitchens 'like Swiss Army knives' and other strategies for dealing with a constrained market.
A tug of war is being waged over the size of the American home.
Pulling in one direction are the forces of expansion: the well-financed dream for many of a sprawling single-family house; the NIMBY activism that prevents the incursions of multifamily buildings into low-density neighborhoods; and -- not least, in the age of Covid -- the desire to contain one's life and work under a single roof without losing one's mind.
Lining up on the other side are the powers of compression: shrinking family sizes; rising energy costs; and policies that seek to relieve today's affordable housing crisis by creating more apartments and micro homes.
What is the net effect? That depends on when you freeze the frame. In November, the National Association of Home Builders reported that the median size of new family homes had dipped to 2,276 square feet and was expected to drop more in the coming months, as high interest rates stifled construction budgets. It was a reminder that living small is a topic that looms large.
So for the first installment of a new column called "Living Small" -- exploring the choices some people are making to live as simply, sustainably or compactly as possible, for ethical or aesthetic reasons, or both -- we visited the association's annual trade fair, the International Builders' Show, to see how builders, manufacturers and architects are responding to this struggle.
There is nothing small about IBS, as the show's name is unfortunately abbreviated. This latest edition, which ended on Feb. 2, was part of a multi-trade-fair extravaganza known as Design and Construction Week, with 1,800 exhibitors spread over a million square feet in the Las Vegas Convention Center.
Beyond the fairgrounds, undeveloped swaths of Las Vegas rolled out to distant, sugary mountains. Inside, vendors showed off their slab siding, permeable pavers, patio doors, crown molding, woolly insulation, architectural design software -- and every other imaginable thing used to build a home -- while remaining agnostic about size: Shingles are shingles, no matter how big your roof is.
But running through the three-day event was a conversation about constraint, as soaring interest rates and construction material costs, combined with a shortage of available land and skilled labor, have led to a precipitous decline in home building.
Robert Dietz, the chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders, estimated that single-family home starts, which fell 12 percent in 2022 (to 744,000 from 999,000), would drop an additional 26 percent in 2023 before reversing direction. In terms of multifamily housing, Mr. Dietz predicted a 28 percent decline (to 391,000 units in 2023 from 545,000 in 2022).
Based on his group's data, he reported a 1.5 million deficit in the number of new homes needed to make housing relatively affordable in the United States. "Just 42 percent of new and existing home sales are currently affordable to a typical household, which is a post-Great Recession low," stated a news release summarizing his analysis.
The show revealed that to make the most of hobbled opportunities, developers, architects and builders are trimming the size of primary residences. Or dropping accessory dwelling units into backyards (20 percent of remodelers have undertaken an ADU project, Mr. Dietz reported). Or investigating new technologies for building affordable housing, including three-dimensional printing or innovations in factory-built structures.
In a presentation called "Small Homes, Big Impact!," Brad Shapiro, an architect from Memphis, offered suggestions for making it less obvious that 10 to 15 percent had been shaved off a house that in more prosperous times would have been 2,400 square feet. His advice included familiar strategies like adding windows to let in sunshine and using pale interior paint. He also recommended doing away with hallways leading to second-floor bedrooms.
In another presentation, Donald Ruthroff, an architect from Northern California, addressed home trends and buyer preferences. Responding to the pandemic-era clamor for home offices -- a National Association of Home Builders survey revealed that 88 percent of home builders had seen an increased demand for them -- he said, "The days of offices with bookshelves behind the desk, and a couple of chairs, are over."
All you need now is a desk and a videoconferencing setup.
Mr. Ruthroff further noted that Americans are asking for kitchens that are "like Swiss Army knives" -- not bigger, but better equipped.
"Covid drove people to want larger homes, and low interest rates allowed them to buy them," said Rose Quint, the association's assistant vice president for survey research. In fact, she added, the only single-family residential construction category that has shown consistent growth since 2000 is that of properties with four or more bedrooms. These constituted 48 percent of new houses started in 2022, compared with 43 percent in 2019, 34 percent in the recessionary year of 2009 and 36 percent in 2000. (She attributed the increase mainly to adult children living with their parents.)
Yet when buyers were asked about compromises they would make to afford a home, Ms. Quint reported, the leading answer -- cited by 45 percent of respondents -- was living in a smaller house, followed by having more basic interiors (35 percent) and fewer outdoor amenities (34 percent).
A number of IBS presentations indirectly broached this theme of smaller living, with titles like "Delivering Detached Housing That Is Dense, Desirable and Affordable" and "Champagne Taste on a Beer Budget in a Tightening Market."
Exhibitors chimed in, too. Scott Philippe, the chief operating officer of a Canadian company called Beyond Sustainable, said he was helping to build a community of small, prefabricated houses in New Brunswick, Canada, that would be rented and eventually sold. (The structural system, called OSBlock, which consists of interlocking wood modules with attached insulation, was displayed a few yards away.)
"Young people don't want big mortgages or leases, especially after Covid," Mr. Philippe said. "They want to travel." (As a sweetener, he is developing housing in Acapulco, Mexico, where renters in the community will get to stay free one week a year.)
Viken Ohanesian, the founder and chief executive of BOSS Homes, near Los Angeles, presented the model of a tiny house: a 320-square-foot structure with paneled walls and a steel roof that three builders can assemble like Lego blocks in three days. (The company's name is an acronym for "built-on-site system.") Even upgraded with aluminum windows and doors and a mini-split heating-and-cooling system, the house sells for only a little more than $ 56,000, and that includes a paint job.
Mr. Ohanesian started his company to build average-size homes, but spun off a tiny-house division several years ago, when California passed legislation allowing ADUs. The customers he envisioned were people like his daughter, Lara Ohanesian, who, despite being BOSS's project manager, would not be able to afford a house in Southern California without the assistance of rental income from a backyard unit, he said.
And who doesn't love a little house? Visitors swarmed an outdoor area of the show where several factory-built examples had been erected. The most eye-catching was Casita, a 375-square-foot house that could be hauled to its site by a Tesla and unfolded like a flat-packed box. Manufactured by Boxabl, a Nevada-based company, Casita comes with plumbing, electricity and appliances, and costs $ 60,000. According to David Thompson, the company's social media manager, 160,000 names are on the waiting list, and Elon Musk uses one as a guesthouse at his ranch in Boca Chica, Texas.
Next to Casita was a Boxabl sibling created from two vertically stacked modules joined by a spiral staircase. The cost-cutting finishes of the houses lent a disposable feeling, like Ikea furniture on an enormous scale, but it was hard to argue with the price and speed of assembly. (Unfolding a module takes about an hour, Mr. Thompson said.)
On the other side of this exhibit was a 1,409-square-foot modular cottage from Impresa Building Systems, in Greenwood, S.C., with an overhanging roof supported by columns and front and back porches. (Impresa houses average about $ 200 to $ 250 a square foot for the building and all site work, according to the company's website.) This exercise in traditional charm had two bedrooms, one and a half bathrooms and a sleeping loft.
A couple of skeptics were overheard remarking that more living area could have been extracted from under the vaulted ceiling. They also muttered about the dangers the circular staircase posed to passing heads. It was a tough crowd.
The takeaway from the show was that 2023 will continue to be challenging for home builders and buyers. But with interest rates and construction costs dropping, if only incrementally, the outlook for 2024 is more optimistic. Mr. Dietz forecast a rebound in housing starts in the second half of 2023, culminating in a year-over-year increase of 24 percent next year.
In terms of square footage, Ms. Quint predicted, somewhat counterintuitively, that the average size of houses built this year will grow under economic stress and contract next year when conditions improve: "The move toward larger homes and more amenities in 2023 will reflect the preferences of those who can afford higher interest rates," she stated in a news release, "and in 2024, size will fall back as affordability improves with lower mortgage rates and more buyers re-enter the market."
But there was evidence at IBS that shrinking house sizes may be only a blip on a continuum of growth. It came from a concurrent exhibition at the Las Vegas Convention Center: the Kitchen and Bath Industry Show. There, you could find small appliances like 24-inch-wide-washing machines and four-burner stoves, but they were usually in the booths of European companies targeting dense urban markets like New York City.
Many Europeans also presented large appliances that the companies had no intention of selling back home. Ege Uysal, the sales manager of Vestel, a Turkish manufacturer, described the features considered nonnegotiable for a refrigerator for the United States: 18 cubic feet of volume, a water dispenser on the door and -- most novel to him -- an extra-wide condiment shelf to hold a gallon milk carton.
"Everything is bigger in America," he said.

A tug of war is being waged over the size of the American home.
Pulling in one direction are the forces of expansion: the well-financed dream for many of a sprawling single-family house; the NIMBY activism that prevents the incursions of multifamily buildings into low-density neighborhoods; and — not least, in the age of COVID — the desire to contain one’s life and work under a single roof without losing one’s mind.
Lining up on the other side are the powers of compression: shrinking family sizes; rising energy costs; and policies that seek to relieve today’s affordable housing crisis by creating more apartments and micro homes.
What is the net effect? That depends on when you freeze the frame. In November, the National Association of Home Builders reported that the median size of new family homes had dipped to 2,276 square feet and was expected to drop more in the coming months, as high interest rates stifled construction budgets. It was a reminder that living small is a topic that looms large.
So for the first installment of a new column called “Living Small” — exploring the choices some people are making to live as simply, sustainably or compactly as possible, for ethical or aesthetic reasons, or both — we visited the association’s annual trade fair, the International Builders’ Show, to see how builders, manufacturers and architects are responding to this struggle.
There is nothing small about IBS, as the show’s name is unfortunately abbreviated. This latest edition, which ended Feb. 2, was part of a multi-trade-fair extravaganza known as Design and Construction Week, with 1,800 exhibitors spread over 1 million square feet in the Las Vegas Convention Center.
Beyond the fairgrounds, undeveloped swaths of Las Vegas rolled out to distant, sugary mountains. Inside, vendors showed off their slab siding, permeable pavers, patio doors, crown molding, woolly insulation, architectural design software — and every other imaginable thing used to build a home — while remaining agnostic about size: Shingles are shingles, no matter how big your roof is.
But running through the three-day event was a conversation about constraint, as soaring interest rates and construction material costs, combined with a shortage of available land and skilled labor, have led to a precipitous decline in homebuilding.
Robert Dietz, the chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders, estimated that single-family home starts, which fell 12% in 2022 (to 744,000 from 999,000), would drop an additional 26% in 2023 before reversing direction. In terms of multifamily housing, Dietz predicted a 28% decline (to 391,000 units in 2023 from 545,000 in 2022).
Based on his group’s data, he reported a 1.5 million deficit in the number of new homes needed to make housing relatively affordable in the United States. “Just 42% of new and existing home sales are currently affordable to a typical household, which is a post-Great Recession low,” stated a news release summarizing his analysis.
The show revealed that to make the most of hobbled opportunities, developers, architects and builders are trimming the size of primary residences. Or dropping accessory dwelling units into backyards (20% of remodelers have undertaken an ADU project, Dietz reported). Or investigating new technologies for building affordable housing, including 3D printing or innovations in factory-built structures.
In a presentation called “Small Homes, Big Impact!,” Brad Shapiro, an architect from Memphis, Tennessee, offered suggestions for making it less obvious that 10% to 15% had been shaved off a house that in more prosperous times would have been 2,400 square feet. His advice included familiar strategies like adding windows to let in sunshine and using pale interior paint. He also recommended doing away with hallways leading to second-floor bedrooms.
In another presentation, Donald Ruthroff, an architect from Northern California, addressed home trends and buyer preferences. Responding to the pandemic-era clamor for home offices — a National Association of Home Builders survey revealed that 88% of homebuilders had seen an increased demand for them — he said, “The days of offices with bookshelves behind the desk, and a couple of chairs, are over.”
All you need now is a desk and a videoconferencing setup.
Ruthroff further noted that Americans are asking for kitchens that are “like Swiss Army knives” — not bigger, but better equipped.
“COVID drove people to want larger homes, and low interest rates allowed them to buy them,” said Rose Quint, the association’s assistant vice president for survey research. In fact, she added, the only single-family residential construction category that has shown consistent growth since 2000 is that of properties with four or more bedrooms. These constituted 48% of new houses started in 2022, compared with 43% in 2019, 34% in the recessionary year of 2009 and 36% in 2000. (She attributed the increase mainly to adult children living with their parents.)
Yet when buyers were asked about compromises they would make to afford a home, Quint reported, the leading answer — cited by 45% of respondents — was living in a smaller house, followed by having more basic interiors (35%) and fewer outdoor amenities (34%).
A number of IBS presentations indirectly broached this theme of smaller living, with titles like “Delivering Detached Housing That Is Dense, Desirable and Affordable” and “Champagne Taste on a Beer Budget in a Tightening Market.”
Exhibitors chimed in, too. Scott Philippe, the chief operating officer of a Canadian company called Beyond Sustainable, said he was helping to build a community of small, prefabricated houses in New Brunswick, Canada, that would be rented and eventually sold. (The structural system, called OSBlock, which consists of interlocking wood modules with attached insulation, was displayed a few yards away.)
“Young people don’t want big mortgages or leases, especially after COVID,” Philippe said. “They want to travel.” (As a sweetener, he is developing housing in Acapulco, Mexico, where renters in the community will get to stay free one week a year.)
Viken Ohanesian, founder and CEO of BOSS Homes, near Los Angeles, presented the model of a tiny house: a 320-square-foot structure with paneled walls and a steel roof that three builders can assemble like Lego blocks in three days. (The company’s name is an acronym for “built-on-site system.”) Even upgraded with aluminum windows and doors and a mini-split heating-and-cooling system, the house sells for only a little more than $56,000, and that includes a paint job.
Ohanesian started his company to build average-size homes, but spun off a tiny-house division several years ago, when California passed legislation allowing ADUs. The customers he envisioned were people like his daughter, Lara Ohanesian, who, despite being BOSS’ project manager, would not be able to afford a house in Southern California without the assistance of rental income from a backyard unit, he said.

Manufactured by Boxabl, a Nevada-based company, Casita comes with plumbing, electricity and appliances, and costs $60,000. According to David Thompson, the company’s social media manager, 160,000 names are on the waiting list, and Elon Musk uses one as a guesthouse at his ranch in Boca Chica, Texas.
Next to Casita was a Boxabl sibling created from two vertically stacked modules joined by a spiral staircase. The cost-cutting finishes of the houses lent a disposable feeling, like Ikea furniture on an enormous scale, but it was hard to argue with the price and speed of assembly. (Unfolding a module takes about an hour, Thompson said.)
On the other side of this exhibit was a 1,409-square-foot modular cottage from Impresa Building Systems, in Greenwood, South Carolina, with an overhanging roof supported by columns and front and back porches. (Impresa houses average about $200 to $250 a square foot for the building and all site work, according to the company’s website.) This exercise in traditional charm had two bedrooms, one and a half bathrooms and a sleeping loft.
A couple of skeptics were overheard remarking that more living area could have been extracted from under the vaulted ceiling. They also muttered about the dangers the circular staircase posed to passing heads. It was a tough crowd.

Playrooms That Not Only the Kids Will Love: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Thanks to an awareness that design affects children's development, playrooms are no longer 'the worst room in the house.' You may even want to hang out there.
If you were a child again, what kind of playroom would you rather have: a basement filled with castoff furniture (because no one cares if you jump on that worn-out sofa), or a colorful room that celebrates toys and art, inviting you to climb up the walls?
It's not hard to guess which one many parents have recently been choosing for their children.
"When I grew up, the playroom was always the worst room in the house, because there wasn't much attention given to it," said Karri Bowen-Poole, a former teacher who founded Smart Playrooms, a design firm in Rye, N.Y. "So it's been incredible for me to see the transformative thinking that's happened. Design does affect kids -- how they feel about themselves, what they do and what we can get them to do, just by how we create a space."
A thoughtfully designed playroom should be equally appealing to children and adults, said Anne Gillyard, an early-childhood development specialist who founded grOH! Playrooms, a design firm in Washington, D.C., with Jodi Arellano, a former teacher.
"One thing a lot of grown-ups feel when they walk into their children's playroom is, 'Oh, my God, I don't want to be in here,"' Ms. Gillyard said. "But if we can create this space where the whole family -- grown-ups and kids alike -- feel welcome and want to spend time, then they're more likely to use it, play in it, bond and just have this really rich relationship."
So what makes for an extraordinary playroom? We asked designers for some tips on how to create one.
Have Fun With the Décor
If there is one room where you should feel free to play with color and pattern, the playroom is it.
"This is the spot where you can do anything," said Susana Simonpietri, a partner at Chango & Co., a Brooklyn-based design firm that has attracted admirers on Instagram with photos of children's rooms blasted with color and pattern.
Ms. Simonpietri loves using bold, graphic wallpaper in playrooms, and has installed patterns with vibrant diagonal yellow stripes, illustrations of animals and large-scale overlapping geometric shapes. For durability, she sometimes chooses a vinyl-based wallcovering, but in most cases, a high-quality paper wallcovering will work just fine, she said, especially if the room has wainscoting.
Some of her clients worry that they'll tire of those eye-catching patterns or that the wallpaper will be damaged over time, Ms. Simonpietri said. But she reminds them that it can be replaced fairly easily.
"People think that wallpaper is this thing you have to love for the rest of your life, but it's actually temporary," she said. "You can go for it now and change it later."
Another option is to paint a mural or bright, solid colors on the walls and ceiling. The designers at grOH! Playrooms frequently design murals for walls and ceilings with motifs evoking mountains, rainbows and lily pads. Much like wallpaper, a mural may feel like a big decorative risk, but not if you remember that it can be painted over if you get tired of it.
Prepare the Floor
Hardwood, painted wood and wall-to-wall carpeting are all acceptable flooring choices for a playroom. But if you're renovating and have the opportunity to try something new, Ms. Bowen-Poole recommended choosing a tough material like luxury vinyl tile (also known as LVT) or laminate.
"They're just super easy to clean," she said. "Pets, kids and markers barely leave a mark."
Mary Flo Ouellette and Steven Santosuosso, the partners of Squarehouse Studios, a design firm in Somerville, Mass., like commercial-grade carpet tiles, like those from Flor. Not only are they easy to clean, but if you buy a few extra, it's easy to replace individual tiles in the future. That way, Ms. Ouellette said, "you don't have to worry about spills, paint and that kind of thing."
Layered on top of the primary flooring, area rugs can add softness and help define sections of the playroom. They're also easily replaced when they get worn or stained.
In active areas where there is the risk of a crash landing, Ms. Bowen-Poole likes to roll out a thick foam mat. And when there's enough space, she sometimes builds a pit of foam cubes.
Install Friendly Furniture
To furnish a playroom, Ms. Simonpietri prefers long, low seating options with no sharp corners, because they're just as good for headstands and somersaults as they are for lounging with a book. Sometimes she installs a low-slung sectional sofa. Other times, she uses French-mattress-style cushions on the floor, piling them with throw pillows in patterned fabrics.
Either way, she said, "you want something that's really well cushioned," to prevent injuries. And if you choose mattress-size floor cushions, she added, they can be pulled out into the room for sleepovers.
Tables can also be designed to move. Jen Talbot, an interior designer in Chicago who began her career designing children's spaces, often uses work tables on casters in playrooms.
"We do a lot of kids' tables on wheels, so you can move things around," Ms. Talbot said. When the table is in the middle of the room, it can be used for art projects, games and puzzles, she said, "but then it can move out of the way if they want to build some huge block structure."
Create a Toy Hub
Storage is critical if you want to keep a playroom from becoming a chaotic mess. And the most vital piece, Ms. Gillyard said, is a storage wall she calls a "toy hub."
This could be an inexpensive unit from Ikea or an elaborate set of built-ins, she said, but her favorite designs include cubbies that keep different types of toys separate. "It really helps kids know where things go back," she said.
Smaller toys can be collected in bins or baskets that are stored in the cubbies. "Larger or strangely shaped toys can go on bins on the floor," Ms. Gillyard said.
She also suggested having a set number of bins in the playroom and putting surplus toys in deep storage. "We often get the question, 'Well, where is everything else?"' Ms. Gillyard said. "Our answer to that is toy rotation, with a library of toys located somewhere else."
One advantage of this system, she noted, is that children often find old toys that have been in storage for a while enticing all over again.
If you'll be adding built-in shelving to the room, Ms. Ouellette recommended keeping it fairly plain rather than opting for a juvenile design, so it can be used as book storage in the future. "If you're going to do built-ins, and put that much work into a space," she said, "you need to ask how it's going to work for you in five to 10 years."
Add an Art Station
Beyond toys, an area for making art is a popular playroom feature. Depending on the shape of the room, a table and chairs could be set in an alcove or nook, or at one end of the room.
Walls near the table can play a supporting role. One or a few walls can be covered with chalkboard paint or a dry-erase coating to allow children to draw on the walls. Ms. Simonpietri has installed large bulletin boards. Ms. Talbot once strung a line with binder clips to create a place for displaying art.
For one playroom, Squarehouse Studios created a multifunctional wall by mounting floor-to-ceiling metal panels that work with magnets but are also coated with chalkboard paint. Then the designers added holders for rolls of paper that could be unfurled for painting.
Let Them Swing, Jump and Climb
If you have the space, you can add features that make your playroom feel like an indoor playground.
When Ms. Bowen-Poole started designing playrooms, she focused on toy storage and art stations, she said. But today she often looks for opportunities to introduce equipment that focuses on gross motor skills, including monkey bars, rock-climbing holds and swings.
"We can use the walls and ceilings, and have all these activities that meet their sensory needs, because they can swing, jump and get vestibular input," she said. When she couldn't find the products she was looking for, Ms. Bowen-Poole co-founded a second company, Project Playroom, to make them, and now sells the pieces to other designers and to individuals.
Children will likely tire of having just a few bars or climbing holds, she said, so when she installs them, she tries to create a circuit: for instance, a wall of climbing holds that leads to a run of ceiling-mounted monkey bars that leads to a suspended rope.
Just remember that such play equipment needs to be securely mounted into a material stronger than drywall. "You need some form of blocking, unless you have a concrete ceiling," Ms. Simonpietri said, referring to solid wood installed between ceiling joists that will accept mounting screws.
Ms. Simonpietri is also a fan of swings and suspended chairs in playrooms. "But we definitely crashed a couple of them when we first installed them," she said. "That's how we learned."

Restoring a House for Every Body: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Half a century ago, Marc Harrison built a prototype for a home that would accommodate people of all ages and abilities. Now his daughter has restored it.
In the early 1970s, when the house was built, it must have seemed like something from another planet. With its rounded, porthole-style windows and doors and its bubble skylights, it would have looked less like a home than a spaceship that had landed in the woods of northwestern Rhode Island, in a small town called Foster.
And in some ways, the structure was equally futuristic. A collaboration between Marc Harrison, an industrial designer, and his students at the Rhode Island School of Design, it was a showcase for what is now known as universal design -- a place where people of all ages and abilities could be comfortable. A house for every body.
The building, which was recently restored by Mr. Harrison's daughter, Natasha, a glass sculptor and the executive director of The Newport Tree Conservancy, and her husband, Ben Randall, a professional woodworker, was laid out to accommodate anyone who might have mobility issues or use a wheelchair. Not that you would notice those accommodations. Most of them are hidden in plain sight.
The light switches are flat. The outlets are raised to hip height. All the door handles and faucets are levers. The interior of the house is on one level, with wide doorways and no thresholds. The kitchen has pullout counters, a stove set at counter height with a door that opens like a cupboard and a sink that drains from the back, so you could wheel right up to it and not hit the drainpipe with your legs.
"Marc looked at everything through the eyes of the disabled body, and he believed if he solved the issues for a disabled person, he would have solved the issues for everyone," said John Behringer, an industrial designer who was a colleague of Mr. Harrison's at RISD. "He always said that the closer you got to solving the functional relationship of the object to the human being, the more pure the object became."
Mr. Harrison is probably best known for redesigning the Cuisinart food processor a few years after the house was built. In doing so, he applied the same principles -- drawing from studies of how people with arthritis, Parkinson's disease and impaired eyesight use kitchen tools -- to create a machine that could be operated by anyone. He replaced the tiny power buttons with paddle-like switches, streamlined and enlarged the work-bowl handle and made the plug bigger, among other innovations.
Mobility issues were not in his brief. Cuisinart's owner and creator, Carl Sontheimer, an MIT-educated engineer and entrepreneur, had simply asked Mr. Harrison to refine the machine, a modestly successful adaptation of an imposing French blender marketed to American cooks.
But Mr. Harrison had his own ideas. He had had a profound experience, as he put it, when he was 11 and a sledding accident sent him into a monthslong coma, after which he had to relearn how to move and speak. Years later, when he became a designer and educator, he was determined to make systems and objects as easy to use as possible, and to sensitize his students to the drawbacks and the possibilities of the man-made world. In short, he was a pioneer in universal design, a term coined in the late 1970s by Ronald L. Mace, an architect who had used a wheelchair since contracting polio as a child.
The new Cuisinart, which appeared in 1978, turned what had been a drab-looking machine with unlovely signage into a stylish, must-have kitchen tool -- an aspirational object for the aspirational kitchen -- and a design icon. Its pure lines were the inspiration for early Macintosh computers; Steve Jobs had admired Cuisinarts on the shelves at Macy's.
The Cuisinart's success was perhaps not surprising to Mr. Harrison, because he believed that if you designed for all abilities, you couldn't help but make better products. So when he was asked to rethink the American home as a showcase for prefabricated components -- also known as manufactured or industrialized housing -- he and his students tackled the assignment the same way. And then they built the house themselves, right down to the furniture.
What they came up with was a knockout, although it had an awkward name: the ILZRO House, for the International Lead Zinc Research Organization, the trade group that funded it, whose members were eager to get into the housing market. (It was Mr. Harrison's practice to bring industry and government sponsors and commissions into his classroom.)
The house was designed like a LEGO toy, a kit of parts that clipped together and then were bolted using basic tools -- no experience required. No part was so big or heavy that it needed any lifting equipment. And the pieces could be delivered in flat packs (as Ikea furniture would later be) on flatbed trailers.
The heady idea was that this form of construction would cut costs with its efficiencies, and with its material -- zinc panels filled with foam -- which could be recycled. (The cost was estimated at $ 20 a square foot, or about $ 133 today.) Maintenance costs would also be reduced, because zinc develops an appealing patina and doesn't need to be painted or repainted. (Think of the roofs of Paris!) It was soundproof, fireproof, bug proof, thermally efficient and, cunningly, magnetic, so that the sleek light fixtures (cone-shaped sconces in the bedrooms) and the magnetized picture hangers Mr. Harrison designed could be attached firmly to the walls and moved around easily.
He and his family lived in the house until 1978, when he sold it to a pair of RISD professors, Gerald and Lorraine Howes. After they divorced, Ms. Howes kept the house, maintaining it fastidiously. When she sold it recently to Ms. Harrison and Mr. Randall, there wasn't all that much to fix up. But the couple, who have no plans to live there, were intent on preserving the place as an important part of Mr. Harrison's legacy. And RISD professors are already including tours of it in their courses.
On a recent morning, nestled in a sea of ferns, the house sparkled. Mr. Randall had rebuilt the beds and refinished the low-slung sofas, making sure to reupholster them in orange fabric -- an essential hue in the palette of the early 1970s. (The original was rusty brown.) Ms. Harrison demonstrated the home's universal design features: the sturdy pullout "counter" under the oven; the chest-high acrylic storage tubs, for pantry items like pasta; the overall flow of the space.
Mr. Harrison always focused on the human experience: How did people move through space; what were the steps involved in their daily tasks; and how could he design to streamline those tasks?
Ms. Harrison recalled spending time in the place as a child, sleeping in the bunk bed her father had built for her -- it felt like being in a ship's cabin, she said -- and the endless pasta meals that served as tests for the Cuisinart's pasta attachment, which Mr. Harrison was developing. She also remembered the bad-tempered llama that lived in the barn/studio nearby, terrorizing her father's students. There, he worked nights making prototypes. "The smell of burning plastic was the perfume of my childhood," she said.
The ILZRO house was a prototype for a single-family home, but not only that: It was also a template for temporary shelters, post-disaster housing and multiunit dwellings. When it was completed in 1973, though, the American economy had begun sliding into a recession, and the building industry fell apart. The ILZRO house became, as Mr. Harrison put it, "an instant modern relic."
Prefab housing has a long history of never quite taking off. Perhaps the highest (and the lowest) moment came in the mid-20th century, with a government-backed effort to address the postwar housing shortage with enamel-coated steel houses made by the Lustron Corporation at a plant in Ohio. The project failed miserably, tanked by the cost of steel and shipping, as well as, one could argue, the rather grim design. In 2021, prefabricated -- or "non-site built," to use the industry term -- single-family homes accounted for just 2 percent of the total of homes constructed, according to census data and analysis from the National Association of Home Builders. That was down from 7 percent in 1998, the highest percentage in the last three decades.
For his part, Mr. Harrison saw his house as a failure. But Bess Williamson, a professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the author of the 2019 book "Accessible America: A History of Disability and Design," said it may be the rare example of a place built for accessibility, before widespread laws requiring it, that has survived intact. "Even FDR's house has been upgraded and altered," she said, referring to Top Cottage, the retreat the former president built at Springwood, his estate in Hyde Park, N.Y. (He was paralyzed from the waist down after contracting polio at 39.) Ms. Williamson added, "Most early disability sites were ad hoc and have not been preserved."
Like the Cuisinart, which she described as the first mainstream product designed for accessibility, the ILZRO house is a milestone in the history of disability and design.
The ideas and innovations in its kitchen showed up much later, in RISD's Universal Kitchen, a 1990s project five years in the making. It aimed to solve, in Mr. Harrison's words, the disaster that was the modern kitchen, which he thought was so poorly conceived and unaccommodating that it could disable the healthiest cook. The project, which he oversaw along with Jane Langmuir, a professor of interior architecture, and Peter Wooding, an industrial designer, involved the participation of more than 100 students, who set out to deconstruct the conventional kitchen. Their solutions included a pop-up dishwasher, a medley of refrigerators, some as small as drawers, pullout counters and appliances, a pasta station and other flourishes. The kitchen came in three sizes, which were exhibited in 1998 at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York, in a show called "Unlimited by Design."
Toward the end of the project, Mr. Harrison learned he had Lou Gehrig's disease, otherwise known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S. That he would find himself restricted in his abilities and using a wheelchair after a lifetime of designing for such conditions is an odd twist of fate. He died before the show opened, and the project was dedicated to him.
"Marc always said he didn't want to design objects that were for the prime of your life, but for your whole life," said Khipra Nichols, who heads RISD's industrial design department, as Mr. Harrison once did.
Mr. Nichols recalled walking through the ILZRO house when he was a student. "It struck me as a purposeful design, very clean and with nothing out of place," he said. "At the time, I didn't yet understand what it took to make something like that."

For Single Indian Women, Renting Is Complicated: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: India says it must do more to harness women's economic potential. A good place to start, many say, would be the many obstacles they face outside the workplace.
When Ruchita Chandrashekar decided to move to Bengaluru in November for a new job, she thought she had the perfect plan for avoiding the problems that come with house hunting as a single woman in India. She would find an apartment with a married friend whose husband was working in Paris -- and they would say they were sisters.
They were both professionals, in their 30s, with a sizable budget. Alas, they were still women unattached to men.
Brokers asked if they could promise to never bring men over. To never drink. To never, really, have a room of one's own. Several places they thought they'd secured fell through -- into the arms of families.
"Sometimes, this is a nice life," Ms. Chandrashekar said over a light lunch in Bengaluru, also known as Bangalore, where she works in organizational development for a tech company. "But then you meet all of these structures, like your landlords."
"There is always something to fight for," she added.
As they delay or reject marriage and live on their own, single working women like Ms. Chandrashekar are making their case for greater freedom from India's conservative norms. While they are a sliver of the country's total population, they still number in the tens of millions, and their often infuriating quest for housing is a barometer for the country's promises of modernization and rapid economic growth.
For years now, Indian women have been racing into higher education, with government figures from 2020 showing they now enroll at higher rates than men. And yet India is still one of the most male-dominated economies in the world.
Just under 20 percent of Indian women engage in paid work, compared with 62 percent of women in China and 55 percent in the United States, according to World Bank figures. Many women work in informal jobs in an economy that has failed to produce enough formal work for a growing population of 1.4 billion people. The unemployment rate is currently above 8 percent, according to data released this month. But if women were represented in the formal work force at the same rate as men, filling some jobs and creating others, India's economy could expand by an additional 60 percent by 2025, according to some estimates.
With this in mind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked state labor ministers in August to come up with ideas for harnessing women's economic potential. A good place to start, many say, would be the obstacle courses of life that exist for women outside the office or factory.
Working women living independently in India's cities -- whether single, divorced, widowed or living separately from their partners -- face endless sermons from strangers. They pay more for a narrower selection of housing. Worried about sexual violence, friends track one another by phone until they reach their destinations.
And still, they endure men who expose themselves at bus stops or landlords who, if they don't reject them, impose curfews and then waltz into their rented spaces unannounced.
"There is no lack, no dearth of aspirations in women, but still, our social and cultural shackles are so strong that they are curbing their freedom," said Mala Bhandari, founder of the Social and Development Research and Action Group, which studies gender and conducts training for businesses.
"Women know their rights," she added. "But when women become assertive for their rights, then the patriarchy, which is still so dominant in our society, plays its role -- its spoiled role."
Amartya Sen, the first Indian to win the Nobel in economic science, has called India "the country of first boys." He argues that the nation has made high-achieving men a cultural obsession, at the expense of nearly everyone else.
Women have only recently entered the fray in large numbers. The economic liberalization that started in 1991 led both to more female university students and more encouragement for them to study away home.
Many started out in single-sex "paying guest," or PG, hostels loosely attached to colleges -- private or government housing with shared rooms and food provided by adults seen as secondary parents.
Often, women like Ms. Chandrashekar's mother -- who set aside a law degree when she graduated and quickly married -- pushed their daughters away from rigid ideas of gender. As birthrates have fallen to two children per woman in India, fathers have also invested more in girls' education, with a mix of pride and fear.
The 2012 gang rape and murder of Jyoti Singh, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in Delhi, led to new laws and programs for protecting women. But by the rawest of measures, they have had little effect: In 2021, the last year for which data is available, India recorded 31,677 rape cases, up from 24,923 in 2012 -- a per capita rate below some countries, though sexual assaults tend to be underreported, complicating comparisons.
In interviews with more than a dozen unmarried working women in greater Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai, safety emerged as the top concern in choosing jobs and housing. They did everything possible to shrink the distance from home to work. And they all had torments to share: being slapped on the rear by a man on a motorbike; fleeing a drunk taxi driver; running away from men howling for attention.
The mean age for a woman to marry is around 21 in India. Single professionals from 23 to 53 said they felt more vulnerable because men saw them as sexually available, if not immoral.
"They think women should live according to a certain way," said Nayla Khwaja, 28, who works in communications in Delhi. "And if somebody is doing something out of that way, then that is something to notice."
Many landlords see renting to single women alone or in groups (and single men, to a lesser extent) as a risk -- to the stability of families, to the reputations of neighborhoods.
Dinesh Arora, 52, a broker in middle-class South Delhi, said few landlords rent to single women because they oppose their separation from family, or fear judgment if something goes wrong. India's rental market is more personal than transactional: Owners tend to see their property -- even apartments they rent out -- as their responsibility. Neighbors and the authorities tend to feel the same way.
"When you live in a small community, everyone worries about what's happening next door," Mr. Arora said between calls in his two-room office with an open door to the street. "When you see on the news all the crimes taking place, you worry."
Among those who lease to women, higher rents, surveillance and paternalism are often the urban norm. Even if they rise at work, many women end up back in paying guest hostels, with curfews at 9 or 9:30 p.m. and bans on drinking, smoking and male guests. A renter's religion, sexual orientation or caste can limit options even further.
Ms. Khwaja, who is Muslim, recalled a night when she was out late filming an event and the hostel where she was living in Delhi wouldn't let her back in.
"It was just 10:30," she said.
After Susmita Kandadai, 27, paid for an apartment in Pune, a city southwest of Mumbai, the landlord's lawyers sent her a lengthy agreement demanding that she never allow visitors, including relatives, and always be home by 9 p.m.
She refused and found herself in the landlord's kitchen -- he lived downstairs -- receiving a lecture from his wife about clothing choices and missing values. She fled a few days later, after the landlord grabbed her by the arm during another harangue.
"I just got so scared," she said. "I moved right out of there and slept on a friend's couch."
When women find a place that works, they hunker down. Meera Shankar, 59, the daughter of a female novelist known as Triveni, rents rooms, with no curfew or visiting rules, in her Bengaluru apartment to women in finance and education who have stayed for years.
Farther south in Bengaluru, Ms. Chandrashekar, who worked as a therapist before switching to tech, eventually got lucky, too: She found a tiny one-bedroom through a builder who had put up his sign on a complex still under construction. He was in his 20s and seemed to understand the challenge singles face.
The apartment is a 20-minute commute from work, and a friend lives a block away. As Ms. Chandrashekar unpacked on a recent Sunday, her face brightened with anticipation.
"I want to put, like, a nice three-seater couch there," she said, pointing to a wall by a window. "I want some new light fixtures, maybe from Ikea."
Her eyes darted toward the door as construction workers could be heard clomping up the outer stairs -- men who would notice a woman living alone.
When the building quieted down again, she relaxed, willing herself to positivity.
"I don't know what this space, for me, looks like yet," she said. "I'm excited."

BENGALURU, India — When Ruchita Chandrashekar decided to move to Bengaluru in November for a new job, she thought she had the perfect plan for avoiding the problems that come with house hunting as a single woman in India.

Full text: Ser Serpas, a young artist known for kinetic arrangements of discarded furniture, opens up about her expressive way of processing the used world.
PARIS -- Compared with the junk she's found in other cities, "Parisian trash is sturdy," Ser Serpas said. She speaks from experience -- at 27, the itinerant artist and poet is admired in European and North American art circles for precariously poised arrangements of urban discards found near the venues where they're shown. They become site-specific descriptions of a place, written in its own delaminating school desks and tarnished bathtubs.
Serpas belongs to a loose cohort of millennial artists and poets, including Hannah Black, Precious Okoyomon and Rindon Johnson, rethinking found materials through deceptively deadpan sculptures. Like many of her peers, she favors objects that bear the marks of use, as if, having inherited a sorely used world, she's making stanzas from its leftovers.
One blustery afternoon last November, I trailed Serpas and Rafik Greiss, her collaborator and gallery-mate at Balice Hertling there, as they hunted for inspiration in the 19th Arrondissement. Serpas was in Paris for a residency, relatively fresh from Tbilisi, Georgia; and Geneva before that.
"People tape things up here," she said. "It makes it into a new object. Like these poles." Right on cue, the city provided four metal rods loosely bundled with duct tape. Serpas moved in. She wove the rods through a wooden shipping pallet, and wedged up the contraption with a broken oscillating fan. Then she struck a pose herself, long hair wafting, electric-blue workwear and Day-Glo gloves popping against the wispy sky, while Greiss crouched and snapped his camera like a fashion hound.
Serpas usually works alone, and indoors, but this series is different. More narrative, she says, and more about her. The photos she and Greiss made are destined for her exhibition Jan. 25 through April 23, at the Swiss Institute in Manhattan, her largest institutional solo effort to date. The photos offer a peek at her process. The sculptures they depict lasted only minutes.
A culture's refuse says a lot. The trash in Switzerland, where Serpas earned her M.F. A., is scarcer and better maintained. You need to know the garbage routes. In New York, the trash is plentiful, unruly, almost a point of pride. The sculptures are also self-portraits, reflecting the artist's sensibility and spirit. In Paris, we came across a polite lineup of broken-up furniture against a hunter green fence. Serpas slotted the top of a captain's table into a mirrored medicine cabinet. "Oh," she said, "this makes a good tongue."
Serpas grew up in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. She shared a bedroom with her mother until she was 16. Her mother works for the Los Angeles Police Department; at onetime she processed property seizures, at another she registered sex offenders.
In early interviews, Serpas often mentioned her teenage activism. "I don't believe in art as activism, like, at all," she told me. She moved to Morningside Heights in 2013 to pursue urban studies at Columbia. In New York, though, classmates who'd attended elite private schools in New England talked down to her about gentrification in Los Angeles. She drifted away from the dissonance of collegiate politics and toward the blurry, permissive worlds of art, fashion and nightlife.
A fine-art concentration afforded Serpas a luxury she'd never had: four walls of her own. She dived into drawing, angsty verse and grungy assemblages of worn fabric, often passed down from model and designer friends.
Then, in 2017, Quinn Harrelson (son of Sarah Harrelson, founder of "Cultured" magazine) gave Serpas her first solo show at his Miami project space. Harrelson describes Serpas as "an inferno." She flew down and created dozens of artworks, in a smattering of media, right there in the gallery. But later, walking around the city, they noticed a recently foreclosed house, its guts expelled to the curb. The plan changed. They hired a van and a TaskRabbit, moved the trash into the gallery, and threw the old show away. Serpas stayed up all night in a Red Bull fugue turning the likes of a plate glass tabletop, an upright vacuum, and a thick flaking door into sculptures. "It happened really, really quickly," Harrelson says, "and extremely lyrically."
The destroyed materials anchored an aura of decline. The tension and balance of the sculptures echoed the precarity of many lives lived, and fortunes lost, but also their owners' fragile optimism. As Rindon Johnson wrote in a text for Serpas's Miami show, "Serpas weaves anti-portraits, that stick to your teeth like afterimages."
The move to larger objects was a breakthrough for Serpas. Invitations followed to repeat the ritual in cities from Detroit to Berlin.
After seeing a few of Serpas's sculptures -- a mattress kneeling through the hole in a countertop; an Ikea bookshelf sitting in a car seat -- their bodily syntax is unavoidable. There's something anthropomorphic about how the sculptures, fashioned from objects made for human use, limited by what one person can lift and construct without tools or fasteners, hold space. In Paris, I watched Serpas wrestle creamsicle-colored cabinetry into diamond-shaped stacks, but also delicately steady a weathered board on an aluminum rod, over a wavering puddle.
Serpas doesn't need to invent words; she scans stuff on a curb the way a poet scans language: with an eye for context, kinetics and usage, putting it together like it could all fall apart. She describes her work as "word games." Her titles are writerly. "This Laptop Has Been Drinking," in her 2020 show at LC Queisser in Tbilisi, comprises a stained table bearing what's described as a "wine-soaked laptop," lid closed, containing "four excised poems." The Miami show featured a scorched, overturned recliner. Only the lowercased title, "penultimate warrior (self-portrait)," hinted at the piece's confessional register, and only the list of materials could reveal that it was burned with estradiol, a flammable steroid used in hormone replacement therapy, which Serpas was undergoing at the time.
The word games also determine what her work is, and what it isn't. When agreeing to far-flung shows, she could be demanding. The work had to be made in situ, in person, by her. "It definitely came out of an angsty place," she said. "I was like, OK, you have to give me the key and there's going to be a lot of things in the recycling and I might have some friends over, but you just have to trust me and you'll get a show. But on my terms."
At the "Made in L.A. 2020" biennial, that wasn't possible. To protect the exhibition's two venues, as well as the other artists' work, from potential contaminants in her materials, like mold or oils, the curators planned to stage her sculptures outdoors at the Huntington and in a sequestered glass-walled gallery in the Hammer Museum lobby that had already been infested with moths.
Then, there was Covid. Her site-specific work for the biennial could not be realized. Both venues displayed materials their staff had gathered for the artist, unassembled. Serpas contributed text. "These objects constitute the potential for a work or works," she wrote of the stroller and bumper and grungy traffic cone, among other finds. "These objects will be properly disposed of at the end of 'Made in Los Angeles 2020.' "
The biennial was, if not a breakthrough, then a break. Serpas had grown tired of jet-setting around the artworld to make sculpture, and now that didn't seem necessary. For the Swiss Institute, Serpas doesn't feel compelled to show any sculpture at all. The temporary sculptures captured by Greiss's camera aren't bespoke portraits of New York City. Instead, they're pictures of Serpas, in Paris, working where she lives.
But the show will refer to the artist's formative New York years, too, by way of her college journals, packed with wild poetry and inebriated sketches, arrayed in a series of vitrines. And there will be paintings -- the latest from her ongoing series depicting faceless torsos and abstract clefts, bodies alone or cleaving. Some are lovers or would-be lovers, others before-and-after photos of plastic surgery found on the internet. Some are self-portraits. The idea is to fold her sought-after, signature sculpture practice into her larger, explicitly expressive body of work.
Serpas said such a revealing show could only happen at the Swiss Institute, under a curator, Daniel Merritt, whom she's known since Columbia. Merritt visited her teeming studio during her senior year. "She was hungry for material," he told me. He remembers one arrangement, a soiled onesie on a chessboard mat splashed with runic handwriting. "We're in a very unstable time," he says, "and I think with flair and heart and deep emotion, Ser instigates moments of instability. That process is how you make peace with a world that is constantly being described as crumbling."
The world of trash is indeed fleeting. As Serpas, Greiss and I wandered through the 19th, we passed a man trying to shove a water heater into a van stuffed with scrap. This way of working puts her in contact with others whose livelihoods depend on the consumption cycle. We paused in front of a sink, bottom out and clogged with hair, still set in its countertop. It didn't need much. Serpas scooted it in front of a roll-up gate, and posed. We hadn't walked 10 feet before someone carried it off.

In a City Determined to Work, the Office Is Wherever There's Power: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Sporadic power outages have people resorting to makeshift office spaces in the Ukrainian capital. Stores have set up power hubs, and workers are getting comfortable doing their jobs in home furnishing displays.
KYIV, Ukraine -- Artem Kudria lounged on a blue beanbag chair, his laptop plugged in, hoodie up and his feet -- clad in orange socks -- stretched out in front of him.
He was hard at work as a designer for a technology company. But this wasn't his living room or even an office lounge space. Instead, he was working in the furniture showroom of a department store, not far from a colorful children's bedroom display and a model kitchen that in another time and place might have been found at Ikea.
With power outages an all too familiar burden of everyday life in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, the store, called Epicentr, has opened a large free space for people to set up and work.
"I have no power in my office, there was no light there this morning, that's why I came here," explained Mr. Kudria, 28. He added, "When people are facing challenges which are trying to destroy their lives, the healthy response is to resist, to be defiant."
Around him, dozens of workers had taken up similar positions on the sprawling third floor in an area once packed with a selection of tiling, kitchen sinks and living room furniture.
As cities and towns across Ukraine grapple with outages, the result of Russian airstrikes targeting critical infrastructure, workers across all sectors have had to adapt quickly. And thanks to innovation, creativity and the generosity of businesses, they are finding a way to continue with one of the fundamental aspects of society -- work, even if it is sometimes interrupted by air-raid alerts.
Grocery stores have set up couches and extension cords for those dealing with power outages and are also advertising their parking lots as a free working space where people can get online in their cars. Open laptops are a common sight in Kyiv's metro stations, where people can get online and continue to work remotely while sheltering for hours amid the risk of airstrikes.
The free working hubs in places like Epicentr are comfortable and warm. The store has a small coffee machine, free internet and ample power outlets. On a recent day extension cords snaked across the floor.
Last week Mr. Kudria came to the store to work for three days when the electricity was out, and he was back again this week. He said the space had everything he needed to continue his design work.
"The main thing is to do at least something," productive, he said, even if it only meant working for three or four hours.
Nearby, a large banner with the words the "Unbreakable Hub" -- the name the store gave this free space -- hung above a young man wearing headphones and editing audio clips. Across the room, under a display of lighting fixtures once perused by customers, workers hunched over laptops.
Yevheniia Hrulenko, 30, a speech and language therapist, was conducting a session with one of her clients from the store via video call after the power went out in her home.
"I have to come here at least a few times a week to conduct lessons," she said.
She said her clients were getting used to adapting to the power outages, as well.
"At first, they would cancel lessons, because they didn't have power," she explained. "Now they are saying, 'Please wait five minutes, I'm going to go the nearest cafe or a place with a generator."'
Many of the outages in Kyiv can be anticipated -- the local government has issued a schedule of when the power will be shut down in different areas to conserve energy. But airstrikes mean there are still unpredictable blackouts.
Iryna Bezverkha, who works as a consultant, rushed over to Epicentr on Tuesday afternoon when the power suddenly went out in her home.
"When they are planned or scheduled outages, I try to adapt," said Ms. Bezverkha, 49, who tried to adjust her schedule around the blackout. "But when I have a called scheduled and I have an emergency outage, I come here."
To one side of her, a wedding photographer was editing photos; an accountant sat on the other side.
"It is a defiance," she said, to the uncertainty of life in a country at war. "You keep things going and keep doing what you are doing in your routine life. We just have to adapt."
In a central Kyiv subway station during Tuesday morning's rush hour, commuters crowded platforms and brushed past each other as they hustled to connecting trains, an indication of just how many people were headed to work.
"Right now I'm actually going from one office to the other," said Olha Dorofeyeva, as she rushed toward an arriving train.
She said she works for a governmental organization that has three office spaces in Kyiv, and the power had just cut out in the first one, forcing her to relocate. Ms. Dorofeyeva, 40, said she changes locations twice a day to keep ahead of the blackouts.
As she put it: "We all have certain duties, and each one of us has his or her own battlefront."
Many people in Kyiv said their determination to keep working stemmed from a commitment to help keep Ukrainian society functioning, as much as the practical need to provide for their families.
Serhii Titenko, 34, who works as a quality assurance engineer testing software for an IT company, described how his office has become more resistant to the outages.
"We have a little 'invincibility point' in our office," he said. "It's warm and we've got power."
He said his company purchased generators and a Starlink terminal, which offers online connection via orbiting satellites, bypassing conventional providers.
"All are trying to work," he said. "If you need power, you'd buy a generator or use alternatives, like car batteries at home. Long story short, none of my friends left, everyone is trying to stay here, be useful and work."
The Ukrainian government has made it a priority to keep the country's internet services functioning, searching for ways to ensure that mobile providers have enough energy to power their operations even when the grid fails. In an interview, Mykhailo Fedorov, the Ukrainian minister for digital transformation, said that the number of people accessing the internet using mobile data in Kyiv during the second week of this month was comparable to the same week one year earlier, before the Russian invasion.
Many small businesses, stores and restaurants now have generators, which has made working in those industries, which cannot be done remotely, less difficult.
Anna Polivoda, 32, works in Salon Special in central Kyiv and has spent the last several weeks working as the business owners have made it more resilient to power outages. When the regular blackouts first began in the autumn, she had to shift all of her scheduled haircuts to daytime hours, though she sometimes had a colleague holding up flashlight if it got too dark.
Unable to plug in the blow-dryers, Ms. Polivoda had to send clients home with wet hair. But that didn't stop them from coming.
"People just got to used to these difficulties," she said. "No one was angry, everyone understood."
Then, late last month, the salon owners bought a generator that allows them to keep the lights on and use the blow-dryers. They bought a larger boiler to ensure a surplus of hot water.
For now, Ms. Polivoda's clients keep booking haircuts and other beauty services.
"It's an act of resistance, in some ways, for normal people to be doing normal things, like getting their hair done, their nails done, going to get coffee, the cinema, the theater," she said. "It really stands in opposition to the war."

KYIV, Ukraine — Artem Kudria lounged on a blue beanbag chair, his laptop plugged in, hoodie up and his feet — clad in orange socks — stretched out in front of him.
He was hard at work as a designer for a technology company. But this wasn’t his living room or even an office lounge space. Instead, he was working in the furniture showroom of a department store, not far from a colorful children’s bedroom display and a model kitchen that in another time and place might have been found at Ikea.
With power outages an all too familiar burden of everyday life in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, the store, called Epicentr, has opened a large free space for people to set up and work.
“I have no power in my office, there was no light there this morning, that’s why I came here,” explained Kudria, 28. He added, “When people are facing challenges which are trying to destroy their lives, the healthy response is to resist, to be defiant.”
Around him, dozens of workers had taken up similar positions on the sprawling third floor in an area once packed with a selection of tiling, kitchen sinks and living room furniture.
As cities and towns across Ukraine grapple with outages, the result of Russian airstrikes targeting critical infrastructure, workers across all sectors have had to adapt quickly. And thanks to innovation, creativity and the generosity of businesses, they are finding a way to continue with one of the fundamental aspects of society — work, even if it is sometimes interrupted by air-raid alerts.
Grocery stores have set up couches and extension cords for those dealing with power outages and are also advertising their parking lots as a free working space where people can get online in their cars. Open laptops are a common sight in Kyiv’s metro stations, where people can get online and continue to work remotely while sheltering for hours amid the risk of airstrikes.
The free working hubs in places like Epicentr are comfortable and warm. The store has a small coffee machine, free internet and ample power outlets. On a recent day extension cords snaked across the floor.
Last week Kudria came to the store to work for three days when the electricity was out, and he was back again this week. He said the space had everything he needed to continue his design work.
“The main thing is to do at least something” productive, he said, even if it only meant working for three or four hours.
Nearby, a large banner with the words the “Unbreakable Hub” — the name the store gave this free space — hung above a young man wearing headphones and editing audio clips. Across the room, under a display of lighting fixtures once perused by customers, workers hunched over laptops.
Yevheniia Hrulenko, 30, a speech and language therapist, was conducting a session with one of her clients from the store via video call after the power went out in her home.
“I have to come here at least a few times a week to conduct lessons,” she said.
She said her clients were getting used to adapting to the power outages, as well.
“At first, they would cancel lessons, because they didn’t have power,” she explained. “Now they are saying, ‘Please wait five minutes, I’m going to go to the nearest cafe or a place with a generator.’”
Many of the outages in Kyiv can be anticipated — the local government has issued a schedule of when the power will be shut down in different areas to conserve energy. But airstrikes mean there are still unpredictable blackouts.
Iryna Bezverkha, who works as a consultant, rushed over to Epicentr on Tuesday afternoon when the power suddenly went out in her home.
“When they are planned or scheduled outages, I try to adapt,” said Bezverkha, 49, who tried to adjust her schedule around the blackout. “But when I have a called scheduled and I have an emergency outage, I come here.”
To one side of her, a wedding photographer was editing photos; an accountant sat on the other side.
“It is a defiance,” she said, to the uncertainty of life in a country at war. “You keep things going and keep doing what you are doing in your routine life. We just have to adapt.”
In a central Kyiv subway station during Tuesday morning’s rush hour, commuters crowded platforms and brushed past each other as they hustled to connecting trains, an indication of just how many people were headed to work.
“Right now I’m actually going from one office to the other,” said Olha Dorofeyeva, as she rushed toward an arriving train.
She said she works for a governmental organization that has three office spaces in Kyiv, and the power had just cut out in the first one, forcing her to relocate. Dorofeyeva, 40, said she changes locations twice a day to keep ahead of the blackouts.
As she put it: “We all have certain duties, and each one of us has his or her own battlefront.”
Many people in Kyiv said their determination to keep working stemmed from a commitment to help keep Ukrainian society functioning, as much as the practical need to provide for their families.
Serhii Titenko, 34, who works as a quality assurance engineer testing software for an IT company, described how his office has become more resistant to the outages.
“We have a little ‘invincibility point’ in our office,” he said. “It’s warm and we’ve got power.”
He said his company purchased generators and a Starlink terminal, which offers online connection via orbiting satellites, bypassing conventional providers.
“All are trying to work,” he said. “If you need power, you’d buy a generator or use alternatives, like car batteries at home. Long story short, none of my friends left, everyone is trying to stay here, be useful and work.”
The Ukrainian government has made it a priority to keep the country’s internet services functioning, searching for ways to ensure that mobile providers have enough energy to power their operations even when the grid fails. In an interview, Mykhailo Fedorov, the Ukrainian minister for digital transformation, said that the number of people accessing the internet using mobile data in Kyiv during the second week of this month was comparable to the same week one year earlier, before the Russian invasion.
Many small businesses, stores and restaurants now have generators, which has made working in those industries, which cannot be done remotely, less difficult.
Anna Polivoda, 32, works in Salon Special in central Kyiv and has spent the last several weeks working as the business owners have made it more resilient to power outages. When the regular blackouts first began in the autumn, she had to shift all of her scheduled haircuts to daytime hours, though she sometimes had a colleague holding up flashlight if it got too dark.
Unable to plug in the blow-dryers, Polivoda had to send clients home with wet hair. But that didn’t stop them from coming.
“People just got to used to these difficulties,” she said. “No one was angry, everyone understood.”
Then, late last month, the salon owners bought a generator that allows them to keep the lights on and use the blow-dryers. They bought a larger boiler to ensure a surplus of hot water.
For now, Polivoda’s clients keep booking haircuts and other beauty services.
“It’s an act of resistance, in some ways, for normal people to be doing normal things, like getting their hair done, their nails done, going to get coffee, the cinema, the theater,” she said. “It really stands in opposition to the war.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

China Yielded On Lockdown, But Woes Last: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Three weeks after Xi Jinping, China's top leader, tried to reinvigorate China's stalled economy by abruptly abandoning his stringent pandemic restrictions, he struck an upbeat note in his annual New Year's Eve address. "China's economy has strong resilience, great potential and vitality," he said.
But that optimism is hard to find in downtown Guangzhou, the commercial hub of southern China. Nearly three years of "zero Covid" measures have crushed businesses. Streets are lined with shuttered stores and workshops. Walls are plastered not with "help wanted" signs, but with notices from entrepreneurs putting their businesses up for sale. Roads and alleys once packed with migrant workers are now mostly empty.
China's reversal of its Covid restrictions in early December was meant to help places like Guangzhou. But the chaotic approach has contributed to a tsunami of infections that has swept across the nation, overwhelming hospitals and funeral parlors. In many industries, truck drivers and other workers have quickly fallen ill, temporarily stretching staff and slowing operations.
Now, faced with an unpredictable -- and uncontrolled -- epidemic and financial uncertainty, people and companies are spending cautiously, suggesting that the road to recovery will be uneven and painful.
China is also confronting broader challenges beyond its borders. The global economy is slowing, dragged down by high inflation, an energy crisis and geopolitical turmoil. As American and European shoppers tighten their budgets, China increasingly faces a double blow of slumping demand both at home and abroad.
Weak spending is further depressing the already razor-thin or nonexistent profit margins of many of the small private businesses that power China's economy.
In Guangzhou, Tony Tang, the owner of a fifth-floor workshop that makes women's clothing, said his sales had plunged by two-thirds in the past year. Competition among small factories in China and overseas is fierce, pushing down the wholesale price he can charge for a woman's jacket with no brand name from $ 14 to $ 11.30 apiece.
Mr. Tang's work force has shrunk from 30 to 10, but there is no shortage of labor. When he needed a worker to help sew an order of halter tops, he went out on a street corner with a handmade cardboard sign and hired one within several minutes, for one-sixth less than he paid about a year ago.
The problem, Mr. Tang said, is a lack of orders. His workshop has "a lot of workers, but we don't have work to do," he said.
China's factory activity contracted further in December as rapidly spreading infections grounded workers, snarled deliveries and dampened demand, according to a survey of manufacturers that the government released on Saturday. For service industries like restaurants, the same survey found, business was almost as bad as in early 2020, during the nearly nationwide lockdown that followed the first Covid outbreak in the city of Wuhan. Eateries and other businesses closed last month as customers stayed home to avoid infection or because they were sick.
"The epidemic has had a great impact on the production and demand of enterprises, the attendance of personnel, and logistics and distribution," the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement that accompanied its release of the survey data.
Manufacturing had already been in decline in November, when many cities and regions in China imposed lockdowns on residents in a futile bid to contain outbreaks. Car dealerships are crammed with unsold cars. Stores have little need to order more for their shelves when they are already full of unsold merchandise.
Nio, an electric car manufacturer in east-central China's Anhui Province, said that Covid outbreaks had affected its supply chain and reduced its car deliveries in December. Tesla suspended the production of cars at its factory in Shanghai for the last week of December, a move that Yale Zhang, managing director of Automotive Foresight, a consultancy in Shanghai, saw as a sign of flagging sales in China and elsewhere, partly because other automakers are introducing more electric cars.
But even as many cities and provinces are in the throes of deadly outbreaks that have silenced once-busy streets, in other places, there are early signs that economic activity is resuming. In a few cities in northern China like Beijing, which saw widespread outbreaks that have since peaked, people have been going out again in recent days.
The lifting of quarantine rules has helped drive sales of airline tickets ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday later this month. The removal of onerous Covid restrictions like daily P.C.R. testing on people and imported goods has saved time and money for companies and workers.
Xu Zeqiang, a truck driver in Yangjiang, a city in southeastern China that is a hub of knife and scissors production, said that he and his driving partner could now complete a round trip from Yangjiang to the ports at Shenzhen, 200 miles away, in a day, instead of two or three days.
"In the past, we could be stopped for P.C.R. test results and health code checks -- now, it's not required anymore, you can come and leave any time," he said.
Many European manufacturers in China have been forced to operate with about half their usual staff for two to three weeks, affecting output somewhat, said Klaus Zenkel, the chairman of the chamber's South China chapter. As a precaution against lockdowns, many companies had accumulated spare parts in warehouses before the Covid wave and have relied on those to keep running.
But to save on costs, a few small suppliers of specific components have stopped operations early for the Lunar New Year holiday, which starts on Jan. 21. "Everyone managed a way to continue somehow, to keep the damage at a minimum," Mr. Zenkel said.
The damage that "zero Covid" inflicted on China's once-unbeatable attractiveness as a manufacturing hub could be hard to repair.
Lockdowns and closed borders slowed or disrupted deliveries of goods and prevented many companies from sending buyers to factories. Some global retailers, seeing risk in overreliance on China, have turned instead to other countries for supplies. Walmart, for example, plans to ramp up imports from India to $ 10 billion a year by 2027.
Even Chinese exporters are trying to diversify.
In Yangjiang, Velong Enterprises, a Chinese manufacturer of knives, grilling thermometers and other kitchenware for Walmart, Ikea, Target, Carrefour and other retailers, is expanding its operations in Cambodia, Vietnam and India. It has shrunk its work force in Yangjiang from 1,700 to 1,200 through attrition and is considering potential factory sites from Mexico to Turkey, said Jacob Rothman, a co-founder and co-chief executive.
Companies like Velong find some savings when they venture out. The company pays workers in Cambodia half as much as its workers in Yangjiang.
But China's strengths in industrial prowess and labor, even in the midst of a raging epidemic, are hard to beat.
A fifth of Velong's remaining factory workers in China are now out sick. But the company has been able to avoid missing deliveries by hiring temporary workers from among the large pool of workers in Yangjiang with knife-making experience, said Iven Chen, the company's other co-founder and co-chief executive.
"Our employees can be trained in five to eight days, and the skilled ones need less than one day," said Ye Yuanqiang, a factory production manager at Velong. "I have worked in Cambodia, and sometimes I can't train them well in two months."
The pressure on exporters has only intensified in recent months. China's exports fell in November compared to a year earlier, led by a 25 percent plunge in exports to the United States. Households in the West had spent heavily on exercise equipment and other manufactured goods from China during the first two years of the pandemic, but are now more budget-conscious as prices rise.
The Communist Party has pledged to spur domestic demand to revive growth. But convincing people to spend after three years of stop-start activity and punishing lockdowns will be tough. Many Chinese workers are now looking for ways to rebuild their savings, even as the Lunar New Year holiday approaches, a time when families used to splurge.
"The overall wages are quite low, you can't make much money," said Gong Shuguang, a garment worker in Guangzhou who plans to stay in the city for the holiday instead of returning to his hometown in Sichuan Province for a family reunion. He lost two months' wages during a Covid lockdown in the autumn.
"I want to find more work to do," he said late last month. "I have worked here for seven or eight years and this year is the worst."
