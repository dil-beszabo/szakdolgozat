Full text: A dignified presence on camera, most prominently for CBS, he became the first Black announcer to call a major U.S. sports championship, the 2001 Super Bowl.
Greg Gumbel, the affable and low-key sportscaster who for more than five decades was a convivial play-by-play voice and studio host for N.F.L. games, Super Bowls, the Olympics and, most memorably, the madness that descends on college basketball every March, died on Friday at his home in Davie, Fla. He was 78.
His daughter, Michelle Gumbel, said the cause was cancer.
Few announcers have had longer or more accomplished careers in sports broadcasting than Mr. Gumbel.
He did play-by-play for N.F.L. games; he was the studio host for CBS's groundbreaking pregame show "The NFL Today"; and he became the first Black announcer to call a major sports championship in the United States -- the 2001 Super Bowl between the Baltimore Ravens and the New York Giants.
He also anchored ESPN's "SportsCenter" and called Major League Baseball and N.B.A. games. But it was with N.C.A.A. men's basketball, as the studio host of CBS's "March Madness" coverage for 25 years, that Mr. Gumbel achieved his greatest and most lasting fame.
This past March, citing family health issues, Mr. Gumbel missed the tournament. His absence from the fanatically watched show on which he annually announced the seeds and brackets was noted somberly by his longtime co-hosts.
"It's somewhat surreal that he's not to my right," the former pro basketball player Clark Kellogg said. Seth Davis, the longtime college basketball reporter, added: "He's one of my best friends in the world. He's watching and he's thinking, 'Stop talking about me and read the teams."'
On every stage, Mr. Gumbel maintained a quiet and dignified presence in front of the camera, with the gravitas of a Walter Cronkite. He never made himself the star, he avoided wild hyperbole, and he described what he saw with an understated exuberance, always choosing less over more.
"Too many broadcasters talk incessantly," Mr. Gumbel told The Chicago Tribune in 2001. "I've seen announcers get in the way. I say I'm here to tell you what you need to know. But I'm not going to beat my chest."
Jim Nantz, his longtime colleague at CBS Sports, said in an interview that Mr. Gumbel was "your classic anchor -- dependable, trustworthy, unflappable."
Mr. Gumbel, it turns out, wasn't any different in person from how he was on the air.
"He spent his career being the Greg Gumbel that you would meet on the street," Mr. Nantz said. "You just happen to have had him in your living room as a friend for over four decades."
After doing mostly play-by-play work, Mr. Gumbel got his big break at CBS in 1990, when the network chose him to replace Brent Musburger, a towering figure in sports broadcasting, as the host of "The NFL Today," the highly lucrative jewel of its football programming.
Ted Shaker, then the executive producer of CBS Sports, thought Mr. Gumbel's cool demeanor would help him overcome the pressure of replacing Mr. Musburger.
"I feel a certain comfort level when I watch him work," Mr. Shaker told Sports Illustrated. "He gives me information without asserting himself unnecessarily."
For Mr. Gumbel's co-host, CBS hired Terry Bradshaw, the former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, whose untamed, folksy personality probably made him better suited for calling rodeos. But the occasionally frantic ex-jock and the gentlemanly straight man had instant chemistry.
In his book "You Are Looking Live!: How 'The NFL Today' Revolutionized Sports Broadcasting" (2021), the sportswriter Rich Podolsky recalled the time that Mr. Gumbel and Mr. Bradshaw needled each other during an interview about the success of the show.
"I can honestly say that Greg is one of my five best friends," Mr. Bradshaw said, to which Mr. Gumbel replied, "And Terry is one of my 10 best."
Gregory Girard Gumbel was born on May 3, 1946, in New Orleans to Richard Gumbel Jr. and Rhea (LeCesne) Gumbel. His father was a judge. He grew up in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago.
Greg and his younger brother, Bryant -- who later became a sportscaster himself and a host of NBC's "Today" -- were big baseball fans growing up.
"Bryant hated the White Sox, and I hated the Cubs," Mr. Gumbel told Sports Illustrated, "but we loved baseball so much it didn't matter."
He played right field for Loras College, a Roman Catholic liberal arts school in Dubuque, Iowa, and graduated in 1967 with a bachelor's degree in English.
Mr. Gumbel worked in advertising for a clothing store in Chicago before becoming a salesman of medical supplies, including bedpans.
By then, Bryant Gumbel was working as a sportscaster at KNBC-TV in Los Angeles, and in 1972 he got a tip that WMAQ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Chicago, was looking for a weekend sportscaster. Bryant asked his brother if he was interested.
"Let me think about this: baseball or bedpans?" he recalled saying in an interview for Mr. Podolsky's book. "Let's see."
Mr. Gumbel auditioned. Three weeks later, he got the job. He was stunned.
"There are a number of reasons why people survive, and some of it is good fortune, and I feel like I've had a fair amount of good fortune," he told Mr. Podolsky. "I feel very fortunate that they stuck with me until I figured out what it was all about."
In 1981, Mr. Gumbel joined ESPN, where he anchored "SportsCenter" and assisted with N.B.A. coverage. He later served as studio host for pregame and postgame coverage of New York Yankees games. His least favorite job (other than selling bedpans), he said, was hosting a sports talk show on the New York radio station WFAN.
"I didn't like talk radio," he once said. "I don't like people yelling at me."
He joined CBS Sports in 1989. In addition to his football and basketball duties, he was an anchor for coverage of the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, and the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.
Mr. Gumbel married Marcy Kaszynski in 1976. In addition to their daughter, she survives him, as do a granddaughter; his brother, Bryant; and a sister, Rhonda Gumbel-Thomas. Another sister, Renee Gumbel, died in 2019.
Mr. Gumbel called a second Super Bowl in 2004 -- the one marred by Janet Jackson's so-called wardrobe malfunction during the halftime show.
As usual, he kept his cool and guided viewers back to the game.
"I think if you put Greg in a studio from Mars for the first broadcast from Mars, he would make it look like it's easy broadcasting from Mars," Mr. Nantz said. "He was such a gifted communicator. He was born to do this work."

Full text: The best place to wash your hands, the restaurant that will scare your parents and more 2024 superlatives.
By now you've probably read through our distinguished critics' list of the city's best new restaurants and best new dishes, each selection carefully considered and thoughtfully discussed. But who but us could take stock of the aspects of New York City dining that don't fit into neat categories of taste and quality. That's where the first-ever "Where to Eat" year-end awards come in, highlighting our most peculiar, confusing and delightful dining experiences in 2024.
Ugly Baby, M. Wells and La Grenouille
At seven-, 14- and 62-years-old, these three restaurants were hardly flashes in the pan and yet they will all be gone too soon. We'll miss Ugly Baby for its unapologetically spicy, make-your-nose-run Thai food, M. Wells for bringing the excesses of Joe Beef-style dining to Queens, and La Grenouille for hanging on as so many of its contemporaries disappeared (plus its brief stint as a cabaret lounge).
Coqodaq
No need to spend $ 125 on tomato leaf-scented hand soap from Loewe. Just drop by the marble communal sink inside this Korean fried chicken restaurant for a pump of the high life.
Keens Steakhouse
All you need to know about the reaction to Keens now sharing ownership with the Bubba Gump Shrimp chain is that a recent New York magazine article about the acquisition opened with, "Maybe New York is dead after all."
Café Carmellini
Complimentary petit fours at the end of the meal appear in the hollowed belly of a $ 650 creature-shaped catchall (actually the least freaky item from L'Objet's collaboration with Hass Brothers).
Chelsea Living Room
The cocktails are great, but they come with a 100 percent chance of appearing in the background of a TikTok.
Carnitas Ramírez
Laugh all you want Californians, but New York City isn't totally bereft of best-in-class tacos. (Is Jackson Heights a joke to you?!) After drawing lines down the block at Taqueria Ramírez in Greenpoint, Tania Apolinar and Giovanni Cervantes managed to replicate the success of their street food-style taqueria in the East Village, this time by hyper-focusing on carnitas tacos that use almost every part of the pig.
Maloya
New York City is a bastion of global cuisines. But the food of Réunion, a tiny island off the coast of Madagascar (970 square miles), is woefully underrepresented. Or it was until this Bushwick restaurant dedicated to the island's cuisine, remedied that. Don't miss out on the sautéed shrimp with vanilla bean-perfumed coconut milk.
Brass
What makes an epic room? How about a grand piano in the center, a domed skylight and plush banquettes? Brass has all that.
Eel Bar
In true "ugly-delicious" fashion, the grass-fed burger at this Basque- and French-influenced restaurant is as wonderfully appetizing as it is utterly offensive, bringing raw onions, tiny-but-mighty anchovies and musty Roquefort together in an unholy culinary polycule. Oh brave new world that has such burgers in it!
Sailor
Maybe Sailor didn't set out to become the parent restaurant of the year, but with its tastefully appointed interior and approachable-yet-sophisticated menu, there's simply no way it won't be a runaway hit with the people who raised you.
Medüza Mediterrania
It's like a Tulum-nightclub-inspired space station complete with a DJ bumping loud, ambient beats and a violinist stopping at each table to perform. Your dad's cocktail is likely to show up in a teapot or with a Popsicle in it.
Pearl Box
This new swanky cocktail-and-caviar bar opened just in time to take home this award for the $ 15 "candy bowl," a colorful bowl of mixed fruity candies like Sour Patch Kids, peach rings and gummy bears. OK, why not.
Kellogg's Diner
A year ago, the nearly century old Kellogg's Diner in Williamsburg seemed destined for condo-fication. But under the careful eye of two talented chefs who manage to balance classic diner fare with more cheffy dishes -- think chicken potpie with a cloud of puff pastry on top or a superb passionfruit Tajín icebox pie -- it seems as if it might stick around for at least another decade.
Penny
Sticker shock at restaurants might be the theme of the year, but it's refreshing when every bite is worth the coin. The seafood at Penny is the best version of itself, including each oyster, razor clam and piece of shrimp in the $ 98 ice box.
Waiting on a Friend and With Others
Actually a three-way tie if we include the recently shuttered jazz bar, Only Love Strangers.
Orion Bar
Fancier, more rarefied noodle dishes may exist, but when comfort is in order, nothing beats Sun ramen cooked in the style of carbonara and accented with kimchi. Well, that and a frozen cocktail in a Spam can.

Living and Working in an 'Emerald City': [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: A decade ago, Emily Eerdmans and her husband, Andrew McKeon, were living in a rented Brooklyn Heights garden apartment with low ceilings. They both worked from home: His office was very small, with a door. Her office was the ivory damask sofa in the living room -- a perch she described as the "ideal backdrop for my needlepoint pillow collection."
Just before her 40th birthday, Ms. Eerdmans, a design historian, decided she needed her own space "to make money."
She saw a New York Times real estate advertisement for a windowed basement office at 14 East 10th Street, an 1839 townhouse in Greenwich Village. For the next five years, she commuted to her gallery, Eerdmans Fine Art, from the apartment in Brooklyn. Customers ducked under the stoop to enter, the bathroom was freshly renovated and the landlady lived like a modernist on the patrician parlor floor right upstairs.
The landlady died and a year later, in the summer of 2020, Ms. Eerdmans began to envision a live-work duplex.
Fortunately, Mr. McKeon, too, could look past the many sloppy coats of paint and see the potential of the sublime neoclassical architecture. "Even in that glopity-glop state, you couldn't miss the beauty," he said. He agreed to give up their Brooklyn apartment to afford the extra rent on 10th Street.
Today, Ms. Eerdmans, 49, turns the duplex into a Christmas wonderland, taking liberties with the holiday decorations.
"Outdoors is Kansas, and you come into the Emerald City," she said.
Indeed, the upstairs parlor gallery at Eerdmans is lacquered Chic Lime, a Benjamin Moore green originally recommended by her mentor in decorating, Mario Buatta. "Some people want environments to soothe, but mine need to energize," she said.
Hanging on nails spiked into the shiny walls, an array of framed giclée prints by Tug Rice, a digital illustrator, is Eerdmans merchandise.
Private rooms in the apartment are off-limits to customers, but the public areas do double duty to connect them after business hours. If Ms. Eerdmans or Mr. McKeon, 66, wake up wanting a late-night snack, they walk down the hall, past the office, up the stairs from the basement, through the green parlor and into the adjoining kitchen.
Ms. Eerdmans has a background in design, including a master's degree from Sotheby's Institute of Art and work as a researcher and seller of English brown furniture at Hyde Park Antiques. But the duplex was her public debut as a decorator.
Also an author, Ms. Eerdmans took lessons from décor doyens she has written about. The walls of a moody parlor that the couple uses as a private living room have a multilayered purple paint finish that was a favorite of Mr. Buatta. Jaguar-print polypropylene carpet she installed on the stairs recalls woven leopard rugs that Madeleine Castaing, the Paris antiques dealer and designer, installed to camouflage dirt. A coat of Kelly green paint hides "terrible" architectural flaws in the stairwell.
"I just went crazy decorating," Ms. Eerdmans said.
Perhaps surprisingly, she calls herself not precisely "a Christmas person." Ms. Eerdmans's great-grandfather was a Christian publisher in Grand Rapids, Mich. Her mother is an artist who moved to Ohio, followed a macrobiotic diet and eked out a living as a potter. Her mother, who was single, always put presents under the tree, but holidays "were kind of a downer," Ms. Eerdmans said. "It would break my mother's heart."
When the family gained a stepfather who was Jewish, they also lit a menorah, for seven years, but she calls Christmas "the only holiday for us maximalists."
When it comes to decorating, Ms. Eerdmans said, "Humor is really important to me."
That's evident in this year's theme for the holiday bazaar, Disco Christmas. She asked the interior designer Harry Heissmann, who is based in Newburgh, N.Y., for "jazz hands and pizazz." Ms. Eerdmans originally hired him in 2022, he said, because "she knew I was a Christmas nut." Last year, he dressed her big tree to resemble an enormous pineapple. Aloha, SpongeBob.
At the recent opening night of this year's bazaar, the eighth, offering novelties and seasonal décor through Dec. 22, Ms. Eerdmans baffled her husband by hiring a gender illusionist. "Why do you need a Liza Minnelli impersonator?" asked Mr. McKeon, the executive director of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Most memorable parties transport guests to another dimension, Ms. Eerdmans said, and "it's fun to go over the top."
This year, the 13-foot fresh Christmas tree in the parlor is "for Andrew," Mr. Heissmann said. Mr. McKeon grew up in the South Bronx, the youngest of eight children living in their grandmother's Victorian mansion. The Christmas trees were very tall, the ceilings even taller.
"It's a sentimental time," he said.
Mr. Heissmann decorated the parlor tree with disco balls and tinsel icicles "to the max," under a cloud of metallic balloons that Mr. McKeon taped to the ceiling. It's a riff on Andy Warhol's 1966 "Silver Clouds" installation, floating balloons puffed with helium and air. The print of a 1970 photo showing the back of Mr. Warhol's head by Dustin Pittman, the nightlife photographer, hangs in the basement and sells for $ 2,500 on the store website.
The former basement office is now a gallery where small tinsel trees are hung with blown-glass pigeons and poop emoji ornaments, all for sale. The basement gallery walls sport mirrored mylar, and Mr. Heissmann hung a fringed tinsel miniskirt at the ceiling since he has had bad luck with fresh pine garlands indoors. "It's not pretty getting out the vacuum every day to suck needles off the floor," he said.
After the bazaar ends, the couple will load up their golden British Shorthair Cat, Babs, and pug, Pompey, and drive eight hours to Castine, Maine, where they have a seven-bedroom villa. A 1920s Spanish colonial revival by William Lawrence Bottomley, the New York society architect, the villa was known locally as "the pink palace," even after a former owner whitewashed its stucco exterior.
Mr. McKeon plans to cut yet another tree in the woods and set the library mantel at the villa with a century-old, tabletop ceramic crèche from Vatican City. (It was a gift to his parents from a favorite nun.) Ms. Eerdmans moved her mother into the old chauffeur apartment above the former garage, and a crew has already repainted half the stucco in a shell pink. Ms. Eerdmans shared plans to have white shutters on the outside, with her characteristic enthusiasm, but she reported that her husband "said he would divorce me if I got a pet white peacock."
For now, the couple is staying in the bedroom of the duplex with a door that opens out to the backyard. The walls are papered with a print from the 2017 Vogue Living collection that Schumacher developed with Hamish Bowles -- just one more very personal restoration of the sort usually reserved for apartments people own.
"Life is too short. Why waste a single day living in a dingy white box?" Ms. Eerdmans said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Using diplomacy, flattery and the occasional shot in the dark, Ukraine is doing everything it can to win over President-elect Donald J. Trump to its side.
From desperate stabs at diplomacy to fanciful expressions of flattery, Ukrainian officials are doing everything they can to bring President-elect Donald J. Trump into their corner as they try to strengthen their position in the war against Russia.
President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine traveled almost 1,500 miles last weekend on the off chance he could meet with Mr. Trump in Paris. (He did.) Ukrainian leaders have delayed signing a critical minerals cooperation agreement with the United States, with an eye toward letting Mr. Trump claim credit after taking office. (Rather than President Biden.) One Ukrainian lawmaker even nominated Mr. Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.
"The fate of Ukraine depends on Trump," said the lawmaker, Oleksandr Merezhko. He said he spontaneously nominated Mr. Trump for the prize last month because of his promise to bring peace to Ukraine and his decision to sell the country anti-tank Javelin missiles during his first term. "We should appreciate what he's done for us. We should be thankful."
Since the election in November, Ukrainians have repeatedly tried to press their case with the president-elect, known for his skepticism about American support for Ukraine's war effort and even about Mr. Zelensky himself. Mr. Trump recently told the French magazine Paris Match that ending the war in Ukraine would be his main foreign policy priority after his inauguration next month. He has vowed to try to start peace talks as soon as taking office.
With his military losing ground in Ukraine's east, Mr. Zelensky's public messaging has shifted since Mr. Trump's election. He is portraying Ukraine as being open to negotiations that could involve concessions, including ceding Russian-occupied territory in the east and regaining it later through diplomacy. That is meant as a signal to Mr. Trump's foreign policy team that the Ukrainian leader is reasonable compared with the nuclear saber-rattling of Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin.
"They want to secure their place on the new U.S. administration's radar," said Alyona Getmanchuk, the head of a Kyiv-based think tank, New Europe Center. "They're trying to establish contacts, build bridges."
Perhaps the most audacious effort occurred after Ukrainian officials learned that Mr. Trump planned to go to Paris last Saturday for the reopening of the Notre-Dame Cathedral.
First, they pushed for help from the French president's office to organize a meeting between Mr. Zelensky and Mr. Trump, according to a French official who requested anonymity to discuss the preparations. Then, with no guarantee of a meeting, Mr. Zelensky's team traveled many hours to Paris from Kyiv by train and plane.
The meeting was confirmed just before Mr. Trump walked into the Élysée Palace for talks with France's president. Less than an hour later, Mr. Zelensky joined them. The discussion between the three men, supposed to last 15 minutes, stretched to 45.
"President Trump is, as always, resolute," Mr. Zelensky wrote on social media shortly afterward, posting a photograph of their handshake under the palace's gilded ceilings and chandeliers. "I thank him."
On Tuesday, Mr. Zelensky added flattery, writing that he had told Mr. Trump that Mr. Putin "fears only him and, perhaps, China."
Other efforts to appeal to the president-elect included a trip to Washington this month by Mr. Zelensky's powerful chief of staff, who met with members of Mr. Trump's team.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the United States has been Ukraine's biggest supplier of military aid, more than $ 62 billion worth, and Mr. Biden has been one of Ukraine's biggest defenders on the international stage. But Ukraine's war prospects are looking dim: Russia now occupies about 20 percent of the country and is pressing ahead relentlessly to capture more eastern territory. And Ukraine's recruitment system has not produced enough qualified new soldiers.
During his campaign, Mr. Trump promised to end the war in 24 hours. He has not said how, but given his skepticism over aid to Ukraine, officials in Kyiv fear he will immediately cut off the flow of money and weapons and try to force a settlement on terms favorable to Moscow.
A hint at how Mr. Trump might proceed comes from Keith Kellogg, a former national security adviser whom the president-elect has nominated to be special envoy to Ukraine and Russia. In a research paper published by a pro-Trump think tank in April, Mr. Kellogg proposed peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow with major consequences: If Kyiv did not participate, U.S. aid would be cut off. If Moscow did not participate, Kyiv would get more U.S. aid.
Mr. Trump has had a tricky relationship with Mr. Zelensky -- the first phone call between them in 2019, in which Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Mr. Biden, led to Mr. Trump's first impeachment. Their second phone call did not happen until this past July.
Mr. Trump has also spoken favorably about Mr. Putin and said he wants to establish a positive relationship with him.
Mr. Zelensky's team is betting that Mr. Putin is not ready to negotiate in good faith, despite claims by aides that Mr. Putin is open to peace talks, analysts said.
"They're trying to explain to Trump and his people that if there is someone who doesn't want to negotiate now, it's Putin, not Zelensky," Ms. Getmanchuk said. "Part of the Ukrainian tactic is to show that they're constructive, realist."
Ukrainian officials and business people have also tried to appeal to Mr. Trump's transactional approach, saying the country is rich in natural resources that could support U.S. industries Mr. Trump wants to boost.
Ukraine has deposits of 20 critical minerals, such as cobalt and graphite, with reserves valued up to $ 11.5 trillion, according to Horizon Capital, Ukraine's leading private equity firm. The country is home to a third of Europe's proven lithium reserves, a key material for rechargeable batteries that could be of interest to the electric car business of Elon Musk, a Trump ally.
Ukraine had planned to sign an agreement to cooperate on extracting and processing minerals with the Biden administration. But the Ukrainian authorities have postponed the signing twice, according to officials on both sides -- a signal that Kyiv may be waiting for Mr. Trump to take office to present the deal as an early victory for his administration.
"This war is about money," Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a Trump ally, told Fox News last month. "So Donald Trump's going to do a deal to get our money back, to enrich ourselves with rare earth minerals. A good deal for Ukraine and us, and he's going to bring peace."
There are signs that Ukraine's message is getting through. On Sunday, the day after meeting Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump wrote on social media that Mr. Zelensky and Ukraine "would like to make a deal and stop the madness."
But there are also signs that Mr. Trump is hedging his bets. He told NBC's "Meet the Press" that he was open to reducing military aid to Ukraine.
One continuing point of friction is Mr. Zelensky's insistence that Ukraine be granted NATO membership. That demand is unlikely to resonate with Mr. Trump, who is skeptical of NATO itself and aware that Mr. Putin considers Ukrainian membership a nonstarter. Mr. Kellogg has said that Kyiv's allies should put off NATO membership for Ukraine for an extended period to persuade Mr. Putin to join peace talks.
For all of Mr. Trump's bluster, many in Ukraine have pinned their hopes on him to end the war on acceptable terms. A recent poll by the New Europe Center found that 44 percent of Ukrainians trust Mr. Trump, higher than in any other European country, including Trump-friendly Hungary.
Part of that support, Ms. Getmanchuk said, stems from the disappointment many Ukrainians feel with Mr. Biden's cautious approach to helping Ukraine's military. Some Ukrainians nickname Mr. Biden "2L" -- for "too little, too late." Mr. Trump's vow to end the war quickly has resonated with a growing number of war-weary Ukrainians who now favor peace talks, even though they do not want to cede territory.
At the Trump White Coffee Bar -- one of at least two Kyiv cafes named for Mr. Trump -- customers said they wanted him to fulfill his campaign promise.
"I hope Trump will do what he promised -- for peace to come to Ukraine," said Yulia Lymych, 25, a real-estate agent. "This is the main wish of Ukrainians. I feel very sorry for the guys who died at war. I have friends who died and friends who are still fighting. My boyfriend is fighting. I want them all to come back home."

KYIV, Ukraine — From desperate stabs at diplomacy to fanciful expressions of flattery, Ukrainian officials are doing everything they can to bring President-elect Donald Trump into their corner as they try to strengthen their position in the war against Russia.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine traveled almost 1,500 miles last weekend on the off chance he could meet with Trump in Paris. (He did.)

Dishes That Linger, Delightfully: [Correction]

Full text: Among the hundreds, if not thousands, of bites that restaurant critics take each year, there are some that suddenly make us sit up straighter, sharper and happier. These are the dishes that linger in our brains all the way home, that inspire obsessions over what exactly was going on in the kitchen to make those ingredients taste this good. They can be as simple as an ethereal tortilla or as elaborate as a deeply spiced, banquet-worthy chicken biryani.
This year, the task of eating out for The New York Times fell to three of us: Pete Wells, who left the table in August after 12 years on the job, and me and Melissa Clark, who have been serving since then as interim critics. Here are 26 New York City dishes we tasted in 2024 that we'll be thinking about long into the future. PRIYA KRISHNA
Beef Fahsa at Yemenat
It doesn't look all that promising, this thick stew darkly bubbling in a black stone pot. But fold a scalding wad of beef into some flatbread, wait until it's slightly less scalding, and all the spices of Yemen open before you. Rich cloves and cinnamon arrive first, followed by the warmth of Yemenat's custom-blended hawaij, and running through it all is a topping of fenugreek foam, both sweet and bitter. ( $ 22) PETE WELLS

Masa Pancake at Cocina Consuelo
Cocina Consuelo offers one of the homiest, coziest breakfasts in the city, thanks in no small part to this pancake. This is a dense specimen, redolent of sweet-scented masa, lathered generously with honey butter and crowned with a thick fruit compote (blueberries, at last visit). It's as if an arepa married a sticky toffee pudding. May they enjoy a longlife together. ( $ 16) PRIYA KRISHNA

Frogs' Legs at Le Veau d'Or
With their mild flavor, succulent, meaty texture and finger-food appeal, frogs' legs deserve to be as popular as chicken wings. If any restaurant in town can make the case, it's Le Veau d'Or, with its garlicky, bubbling rendition. Wait for the frantic sizzle to die down while you inhale the scent of brown butter and herbs, then use your hands to dig in. Licking the savory sauce off your digits might just be the best part.

Bake and Shark at Trinciti Roti Shop
I used to say there was no such thing as an exciting fish sandwich. Now that I've had the bake and shark from Trinciti, I'd like to take that back. The assembly process of this Trinidadian and Tobagonian favorite, sold only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, is dizzying. The toppings piled over the hunks of fried shark are almost uncountable, though they include tamarind, coriander chutney, Trini pepper sauce and a slab of pineapple. The final product is not easy to eat, but it should be eaten quickly, and with enthusiasm. ( $ 18) PETE WELLS

Patty Melt at the Commerce Inn
It was first served at family meal for the staff. Then it appeared as a blackboard special in the barroom. From there it sidled on to the brunch menu. As word got out, people started asking for it in the dining room. Of course, word got out. The Commerce Inn patty melt has all the classical attributes plus a few little subtle flourishes, like the scent of rosemary in the caramelized onions. It looks reasonably prim and proper, but mustard and mayonnaise and beef fat come gushing out when you eat it. ( $ 18) PETE WELLS

Jang Mool Hoe at Joo Ok
There's an aquarium in your bowl: barely poached bigfin reef squid, delicate Hokkaido scallops and a rich sliver of fresh sea urchin, all enveloped in a slippery, transparent layer of dashima jelly. The flavors are pleasingly restrained, accented by a few dots of chive and sesame oils and a small pool of broth (honeynut squash soy, for now). The jang mool hoe is an early course at this tasting-menu restaurant imported straight from Seoul, and it's a dish for those who delight in the tapioca pearls of bubble tea or the exuberant chew of an udon noodle.

Potato Salad With Trout Roe at Eel Bar
Potatoes and caviar are an eternal match, with the mild earthiness of the tuber balancing the saline funk of the fish eggs. At Eel Bar, the pairing is revamped as the sexiest salad imaginable, with a bed of creamy potatoes amply crowned by glowing beads of pungent trout roe. The brilliant soft and snappy contrast of textures may be as alluring as the flavors -- or almost. ( $ 18) MELISSA CLARK

Dungeness Crab Empanada at Blanca
If you have eaten in any of Victoria Blamey's restaurants going back to Chumley's, you are probably familiar with the way she prepares Dungeness crab. It's complicated. It's based on a Chilean abalone dish. It involves Chartreuse, fermented black beans, assorted bits of crab anatomy and other things that have no business sharing a plate. When you taste it, you feel the time-space continuum yawning open below your feet. In the past, Ms. Blamey has stuffed this crab into potpies and pithiviers, but at Blanca it assumes its most humble, most exalted form yet: an empanada. (Part of a $ 275 tasting menu) PETE WELLS

Paneer Ghee Roast at Lungi
You can smell the heady scent of curry leaves before the dish even hits the table at this South Indian and Sri Lankan restaurant. The squishy cubes are fried and stewed in a potent onion gravy, absorbing the invigorating flavor of the spices. Scoop up the cheese with thin, coconut-laced hoppers that will temper the lingering, near-punishing heat in the sauce. ( $ 24) PRIYA KRISHNA

Squab at Noksu
The pigeon's desiccated head and clenched foot lent a horror-movie touch to a dish that was otherwise quite inviting. The Cantonese roast duck you see hanging in Chinatown windows was the point of departure for Dae Kim, the chef at this tasting counter inside a subway station. The meat was pinker and juicier, though, and Dae Kim, gave the skin a gorgeous, burnished gloss; it was as crisp and shiny as the sugar on a crème brûlée. Mr. Kim took it off the menu two months ago, but it's too good to stay away for long. (Part of a $ 195 tasting menu) PETE WELLS

Rich Chocolate Cake at Dinner Party
The best chocolate cake is rife with contradiction. It needs to be dense and bitter but still light and sweet, and covered with enough frosting to grab your attention, but not so much that it overshadows the cake. This one hits all those notes with panache. The crumb is tender and moist, but not heavy, and full of dark cocoa powder for a bittersweet spine. Swirls of buttercream on top are infused with pink peppercorns for a spicy, piney character that might be the last thing you'd think to pair with chocolate cake -- until you take a bite. (Part of a $ 60 to $ 75 tasting menu) MELISSA CLARK
274 Hall Street (DeKalb Avenue), Clinton Hill, Brooklyn; 347-463-9173; dinnerpartybk.com
Yogurt Kebab at Bungalow
This kebab feels like a magic trick: crisp shreds of kataifi encase warm, spiced yogurt that oozes as you bite into it, with a flavor that flits between sweet and savory. The cabbage purée underneath is refreshingly tart, and its whimsical lavender hue only adds to the sense that this is more alchemy than cooking. ( $ 22) PRIYA KRISHNA
24 First Avenue (Second Street), East Village; no phone; bungalowny.com
Latifeh at Sofreh Cafe
Latifeh, a traditional Persian confection, may have assumed its highest and most fragrant form at Sofreh Cafe. Somewhere between a soft vanilla cookie and a dainty cake, two rounds of pastry are filled with fluffy, rose-scented cream, then rolled in chopped, salted pistachios, which add color and crunch to all that pale, ethereal softness. Nasim Alikhani, an owner and the chef, makes her latifeh often, so they never have a chance to get soggy. Each pastry is a diminutive masterpiece you can't help but devour. ( $ 8) MELISSA CLARK
216 Flatbush Avenue (Bergen Street), Park Slope, Brooklyn; 929-294-9240; sofrehnyc.com/sofrehcafe
Chalupas at Chalupas Poblanas el Tlecuile
First, you have to find it. This nomadic Pueblan chalupa stand bounces around northern Queens, occasionally posting intersections and hours on Facebook. From there, things get easier. While your batch of eight tortillas bathes quietly in hot lard, decide whether you want them covered with salsa verde, salsa roja, or both. Watch while they are stacked with white onions and shredded pork. Finally, come to terms with the reality that you aren't going to be hungry again for a long time. ( $ 10) PETE WELLS
Locations and hours: facebook.com/ChalupasPoblanasElTlecuile
Stir-fried Fatty Beef With Cilantro at Uluh
Cilantro, an essential ingredient in many Chinese dishes, is the whole point of this one. The juicy stems are tossed in so liberally that it almost becomes a salad. They pierce the aromatic foundation of garlic and fresh chiles like bright green needles. The beef is thinly shaved, tender and not as fatty as you might think. ( $ 28) PETE WELLS
152 Second Avenue (East 10th Street), East Village; 917-261-5963; uluhny.com
Suma Katsuo Sashimi at Sushi Ouji
Rarely seen outside Japan, suma katsuo (also called mackerel tuna) is a buttery-textured fish that's a bit like fatty tuna. Sushi Ouji is one of the few places to sample it in New York City, where it plays a starring role in the excellent omakase. To make the most of suma katsuo's bold oceanic flavor, the chef Ben Chen cold-smokes the fillets over cherry wood, then drizzles them with a tangy onion sauce sprinkled with sesame and nori. Wobbly cubes of ginger jelly on the side act as bracing palate cleansers -- and make the deeply haunting sashimi course exceedingly fun to eat. (Part of a $ 129 omakase menu) MELISSA CLARK
196 Prince Street (Sullivan Street), SoHo; 646-637-8322; ouji196.com
Passion Fruit Tajín Icebox Pie at Kellogg's Diner
The desserts from the pastry chef Amanda Perdomo often steal the show here, none more than the passion fruit pie. It's more than just a diner pie spiffed up with Tajín; there's creativity and finesse in Ms. Perdomo's vision. The graham cracker crust is elevated with brown butter, the curd filling has the creamy, wobbly texture of instant pudding and the Tajín meringue floats delicately atop, freckled with lime zest. ( $ 10) PRIYA KRISHNA
518 Metropolitan Avenue (Union Avenue), Williamsburg, Brooklyn; 718-782-4505; kelloggsdinernyc.com
Shrimp Cocktail at Penny
The brilliant simplicity of Penny's shrimp cocktail makes most other versions seem underwhelming. Argentinian red shrimp are cured, brined and steamed, then served ice-cold, their sweet, juicy flavor needing little else besides a spritz of lemon. Should you love cocktail sauce, the one at Penny is an overachiever -- tart, smooth and ketchup forward in the best way. ( $ 24) PRIYA KRISHNA
90 East 10th Street (Third Avenue), East Village; no phone; penny-nyc.com
Flour Tortilla at Corima
Serious flour tortillas are still an exciting find in New York City, and no restaurant takes them more seriously than Corima. Made from Mexican wheat, butter and sourdough starter, Corima's is almost flaky and pocked with brown patches where bubbles in the dough met the heat of the griddle, an upside-down wok. It is one flour tortilla that is delicious enough to eat on its own, which is exactly how it is served, with a smear of smoky chile butter. ( $ 9) PETE WELLS
3 Allen Street (Division Street), Lower East Side; 646-964-4836; corimanyc.com
Kohlapuri Goat at Javitri
At last, memorable goat curry around the corner from Bloomingdale's. Javitri's chef, Dhandu Ram, encourages the meat to relax during a patient, gentle braise in the pot, and wallops it with enough Maharashtrian spices and dried chiles to fell an elephant. It's a classic good cop-bad cop routine, and it's devastatingly effective. ( $ 35) PETE WELLS
132 East 61st Street (Lexington Avenue), Upper East Side; 212-206-7575; develop.stackblue.com/javitri-nyc
Pissaladière at Cafe Mado
Built on a foundation of puffy focaccia dough, this pissaladière doesn't hew to the classic line. The other ingredients in this delectably oily, savory tart are similarly innovative. Olive relish nestles next to the caramelized onions instead of whole black niçoise, fat premium Don Bocarte Spanish anchovies stripe the top in place of the usual French fish, and a shower of lemon thyme adds a deeply perfumed and unexpected aroma. It's not even quite as big as a typical pissaladière, but take one bite and you can taste the past melding with the here and now. It's not French -- nor Italian or Spanish -- but Brooklyn to its delectable core. ( $ 21) MELISSA CLARK
791 Washington Avenue (Lincoln Place), Prospect Heights, Brooklyn; 347-627-8298; cafemadonyc.com
Gongura Chicken Biryani at Hyderabadi Zaiqa
This small, subterranean restaurant dedicated to the food of Hyderabad may have more biryanis than chairs. One is made with hard-boiled eggs, another with mangoes and vegetables. More intriguing still is the variety featuring a chicken leg and seasoned with gongura. A leaf prized in parts of India for its lemony sourness, gongura wrests control away from the usual biryani spices, and this kitchen is not shy about spices, carrying the rice in a new and bracing direction. ( $ 16) PETE WELLS
366 West 52nd Street (Ninth Avenue), Hell's Kitchen; 646-952-0066; hyderabadizaiqa.com
Dry-Aged Duck at Heroes
Dry-aging is a technique usually applied to beef to tenderize it, and the process can add earthy, umami flavors to the meat along the way. At Heroes, the chef Aaron Lirette dry-ages duck breasts, and the result is an absolute stunner. After a 10-day stint in the fridge, the breasts are roasted on the bone and basted with yuzu and four kinds of peppers. Thin slices are served juicy and rare, still cloaked in their crisp skin, and impossible to stop eating ( $ 75, serves two). MELISSA CLARK
357 West Broadway (Broome Street), SoHo; no phone; heroesrestaurantnyc.com
Snow Crab Mandoo at Odre
The biggest surprise when you bite into a snow crab mandoo at Odre is the wrapper. Instead of meeting the bounce of dumpling skin, your teeth hit the delicate crunch of thinly sliced radish that's wrapped like a silky sheath around generous morsels of dense, soft crab. It's part of Odre's $ 42 tasting menu -- a true bargain, especially given the quality of the crab, and the finesse when using it. MELISSA CLARK
199 Second Avenue (12th Street), East Village; no phone; odrenyc.com
Fried Halloumi at Cafe Kestrel
These cigars of fried cheese don't look like much. But therein lies the beauty of Cafe Kestrel, where apparent simplicity belies bewitching flavors. The sharply salty halloumi is battered and coated with a coarse, heady mixture of fennel pollen and Espelette pepper. The raw wildflower honey poured over the cheese is so thick and luxurious -- and suffused with the warm spices below -- that it practically demands to be licked off the plate. ( $ 9) PRIYA KRISHNA
293 Van Brunt Street (Pioneer Street), Red Hook, Brooklyn; no phone; kesnewyork.com
Vin Jaune Gelato at Bridges
The Comté tart gets much of the spotlight at Bridges, and for good reason. But the sleeper hit is the restaurant's simplest dessert, a swoop of gelato infused with the floral, savory and even briny complexity of vin jaune, accompanied on my visit by a tart, oozy scoop of passion fruit in its nature-given glory -- seeds, pulp and all.

NEW YORK — Among the hundreds, if not thousands, of bites that restaurant critics take each year, there are some that suddenly make us sit up straighter, sharper and happier. These are the dishes that linger in our brains all the way home, that inspire obsessions over what exactly was going on in the kitchen to make those ingredients taste this good. They can be as simple as an ethereal tortilla or as elaborate as a deeply spiced, banquet-worthy chicken biryani.
This year, the task of eating out for The New York Times fell to three of us: Pete Wells, who left the table in August after 12 years on the job, and me and Melissa Clark, who have been serving since then as interim critics. Here are 26 New York City dishes we tasted in 2024 that we’ll be thinking about long into the future. — PRIYA KRISHNA
Beef Fahsa at Yemenat
It doesn’t look all that promising, this thick stew darkly bubbling in a black stone pot. But fold a scalding wad of beef into some flatbread, wait until it’s slightly less scalding, and all the spices of Yemen open before you. Rich cloves and cinnamon arrive first, followed by the warmth of Yemenat’s custom-blended hawaij, and running through it all is a topping of fenugreek foam, both sweet and bitter. ($22) — PETE WELLS
7721 Fifth Ave. (78th Street), Bay Ridge, Brooklyn; 718-491-5600; clover.com/online-ordering/yemenat
Masa Pancake at Cocina Consuelo
Cocina Consuelo offers one of the homiest, coziest breakfasts in the city, thanks in no small part to this pancake. This is a dense specimen, redolent of sweet-scented masa, lathered generously with honey butter and crowned with a thick fruit compote (blueberries, at last visit). It’s as if an arepa married a sticky toffee pudding. May they enjoy a long life together. ($16) — PRIYA KRISHNA
130 Hamilton Place (West 143rd Street), Harlem; 646-250-7172; cocinaconsuelonyc.com
Frogs’ Legs at Le Veau d’Or
With their mild flavor, succulent, meaty texture and finger-food appeal, frogs’ legs deserve to be as popular as chicken wings. If any restaurant in town can make the case, it’s Le Veau d’Or, with its garlicky, bubbling rendition. Wait for the frantic sizzle to die down while you inhale the scent of brown butter and herbs, then use your hands to dig in. Licking the savory sauce off your digits might just be the best part. (Part of a $125 prix-fixe menu) — MELISSA CLARK
129 E. 60th St. (Lexington Avenue), Upper East Side; 646-386-7608; lvdnyc.com
Bake and Shark at Trinciti Roti Shop
I used to say there was no such thing as an exciting fish sandwich. Now that I’ve had the bake and shark from Trinciti, I’d like to take that back. The assembly process of this Trinidadian and Tobagonian favorite, sold only on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, is dizzying. The toppings piled over the hunks of fried shark are almost uncountable, though they include tamarind, coriander chutney, Trini pepper sauce and a slab of pineapple. The final product is not easy to eat, but it should be eaten quickly, and with enthusiasm. ($18) — PETE WELLS
111-03 Lefferts Blvd. (111th Avenue), South Ozone Park, Queens; 718-641-3636; trinciti.com
Patty Melt at the Commerce Inn
It was first served at family meal for the staff. Then it appeared as a blackboard special in the barroom. From there it sidled on to the brunch menu. As word got out, people started asking for it in the dining room. Of course, word got out. The Commerce Inn patty melt has all the classical attributes plus a few little subtle flourishes, like the scent of rosemary in the caramelized onions. It looks reasonably prim and proper, but mustard and mayonnaise and beef fat come gushing out when you eat it. ($18) — PETE WELLS
50 Commerce St. (Barrow Street), West Village; no phone; thecommerceinn.com
Jang Mool Hoe at Joo Ok
There’s an aquarium in your bowl: barely poached bigfin reef squid, delicate Hokkaido scallops and a rich sliver of fresh sea urchin, all enveloped in a slippery, transparent layer of dashima jelly. The flavors are pleasingly restrained, accented by a few dots of chive and sesame oils and a small pool of broth (honeynut squash soy, for now). The jang mool hoe is an early course at this tasting-menu restaurant imported straight from Seoul, South Korea, and it’s a dish for those who delight in the tapioca pearls of bubble tea or the exuberant chew of an udon noodle. (Part of a $180 tasting menu) — PRIYA KRISHNA
22 W. 32nd St. (Fifth Avenue), Koreatown; no phone; joo-ok.com
Potato Salad With Trout Roe at Eel Bar
Potatoes and caviar are an eternal match, with the mild earthiness of the tuber balancing the saline funk of the fish eggs. At Eel Bar, the pairing is revamped as the sexiest salad imaginable, with a bed of creamy potatoes amply crowned by glowing beads of pungent trout roe. The brilliant soft and snappy contrast of textures may be as alluring as the flavors — or almost. ($18) — MELISSA CLARK
252 Broome St. (Ludlow Street), Lower East Side; 646-850-0140; eelbarnyc.com
Dungeness Crab Empanada at Blanca
If you have eaten in any of Victoria Blamey’s restaurants going back to Chumley’s, you are probably familiar with the way she prepares Dungeness crab. It’s complicated. It’s based on a Chilean abalone dish. It involves Chartreuse, fermented black beans, assorted bits of crab anatomy and other things that have no business sharing a plate. When you taste it, you feel the time-space continuum yawning open below your feet. In the past, Blamey has stuffed this crab into potpies and pithiviers, but at Blanca it assumes its most humble, most exalted form yet: an empanada. (Part of a $275 tasting menu) — PETE WELLS

Paneer Ghee Roast at Lungi
You can smell the heady scent of curry leaves before the dish even hits the table at this South Indian and Sri Lankan restaurant. The squishy cubes are fried and stewed in a potent onion gravy, absorbing the invigorating flavor of the spices. Scoop up the cheese with thin, coconut-laced hoppers that will temper the lingering, near-punishing heat in the sauce. ($24) — PRIYA KRISHNA
1136 First Ave. (East 62nd Street), Upper East Side; no phone; lungirestaurant.com
Squab at Noksu
The pigeon’s desiccated head and clenched foot lent a horror-movie touch to a dish that was otherwise quite inviting. The Cantonese roast duck you see hanging in Chinatown windows was the point of departure for Dae Kim, the chef at this tasting counter inside a subway station. The meat was pinker and juicier, though, and Kim gave the skin a gorgeous, burnished gloss; it was as crisp and shiny as the sugar on a crème brûlée. Kim took it off the menu two months ago, but it’s too good to stay away for long. (Part of a $195 tasting menu) — PETE WELLS
49 W. 32nd St. (Broadway), Koreatown; 626-657-8420; noksunyc.com
Rich Chocolate Cake at Dinner Party
The best chocolate cake is rife with contradiction. It needs to be dense and bitter but still light and sweet, and covered with enough frosting to grab your attention, but not so much that it overshadows the cake. This one hits all those notes with panache. The crumb is tender and moist, but not heavy, and full of dark cocoa powder for a bittersweet spine. Swirls of buttercream on top are infused with pink peppercorns for a spicy, piney character that might be the last thing you’d think to pair with chocolate cake — until you take a bite. (Part of a $60 to $75 tasting menu) — MELISSA CLARK
274 Hall St. (DeKalb Avenue), Clinton Hill, Brooklyn; 347-463-9173; dinnerpartybk.com
Yogurt Kebab at Bungalow
This kebab feels like a magic trick: crisp shreds of kataifi encase warm, spiced yogurt that oozes as you bite into it, with a flavor that flits between sweet and savory. The cabbage purée underneath is refreshingly tart, and its whimsical lavender hue only adds to the sense that this is more alchemy than cooking. ($22) — PRIYA KRISHNA
24 First Ave. (Second Street), East Village; no phone; bungalowny.com
Latifeh at Sofreh Cafe
Latifeh, a traditional Persian confection, may have assumed its highest and most fragrant form at Sofreh Cafe. Somewhere between a soft vanilla cookie and a dainty cake, two rounds of pastry are filled with fluffy, rose-scented cream, then rolled in chopped, salted pistachios, which add color and crunch to all that pale, ethereal softness. Nasim Alikhani, an owner and the chef, makes her latifeh often, so they never have a chance to get soggy. Each pastry is a diminutive masterpiece you can’t help but devour. ($8) — MELISSA CLARK

While your batch of eight tortillas bathes quietly in hot lard, decide whether you want them covered with salsa verde, salsa roja, or both. Watch while they are stacked with white onions and shredded pork. Finally, come to terms with the reality that you aren’t going to be hungry again for a long time. ($10) — PETE WELLS
Locations and hours: facebook.com/ChalupasPoblanasElTlecuile
Stir-fried Fatty Beef With Cilantro at Uluh
Cilantro, an essential ingredient in many Chinese dishes, is the whole point of this one. The juicy stems are tossed in so liberally that it almost becomes a salad. They pierce the aromatic foundation of garlic and fresh chiles like bright green needles. The beef is thinly shaved, tender and not as fatty as you might think. ($28) — PETE WELLS
152 Second Ave. (East 10th Street), East Village; 917-261-5963; uluhny.com
Suma Katsuo Sashimi at Sushi Ouji
Rarely seen outside Japan, suma katsuo (also called mackerel tuna) is a buttery-textured fish that’s a bit like fatty tuna. Sushi Ouji is one of the few places to sample it in New York City, where it plays a starring role in the excellent omakase. To make the most of suma katsuo’s bold oceanic flavor, chef Ben Chen cold-smokes the fillets over cherry wood, then drizzles them with a tangy onion sauce sprinkled with sesame and nori.

It’s more than just a diner pie spiffed up with Tajín; there’s creativity and finesse in Perdomo’s vision.

After a 10-day stint in the fridge, the breasts are roasted on the bone and basted with yuzu and four kinds of peppers.

What Kind of Cat Litter Is Best for the Planet?: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: House training cats is easy. Most will use a litter box instinctively before they're a month old. But what's the environmental cost of the litter they'll need over the years?
Some new cat box fillers are marketed as more sustainable than conventional litters, including a few that claim to be flushable or compostable. (Spoiler: They're not.) Others are made from agricultural leftovers like walnut shells.
We've dug deep to see which ones are good for your kitty and the environment. Here's what we learned.
The old-school option
Conventional cat litter is made from bentonite, a remarkably absorbent clay. Much of the world's supply comes from strip mines in the Western United States, especially Wyoming.
Strip mining, in which machines remove the top layers of soil over a wide area to reach a mineral instead of tunneling, can destroy ecosystems, cause erosion and pollute water.
Federal and state laws require bentonite mining operations to restore land they've excavated. But many bentonite deposits occur underneath sagebrush grasslands, a scrubby yet biologically diverse habitat that supports Western species like pronghorn and greater sage grouse.
In arid grasslands like those, it's hard to get native plants re-established, said Lyle King, an ecologist with a doctorate in soil science who has worked in bentonite mine reclamation for decades. Dr. King estimated that over the course of his career, less than half of the bentonite mining projects he has been involved with were fully restored to the satisfaction of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality.
Even those are fundamentally changed. "It always seems a shame to turn native habitat upside-down for kitty litter," Dr. King said.
What about 'flushable' litters?
Flushable litters get a resounding no from environmental and wastewater treatment experts. Flushing anything other than human waste and toilet paper risks compromising our already-fragile sewage infrastructure. Alternative cat litters are chosen for their absorbency and clumping ability, which would promote clogs that can cause sewage to flood into the environment.
And don't even think about flushing bentonite down the toilet. It swells many times its original size when it gets wet and could make for cataclysmic clogs that could cause sewage, including from your neighbors, to back up into your home.
Can I just flush the poop?
Some fancy litter boxes can scoop up your cat's poo and send it down the drain or toilet. You can also buy kits to actually toilet train your cat.
But experts say these are both bad ideas, because cats are hosts of a microscopic parasite called Toxoplasma gondii, which can infect humans and almost all warm-blooded animals. While the vast majority of humans won't experience symptoms from toxoplasmosis, it can be deadly for people with compromised immune systems and cause serious problems for developing fetuses.
T. gondii is very difficult for wastewater treatment plants to kill or remove, said Kellogg Schwab, an environmental microbiologist and engineer at the Johns Hopkins University who studies pathogens in wastewater. The parasite can make its way from wastewater into waterways or fields where food is grown. A kind of protective shell allows it to stay alive for months, and sometimes more than a year, in the wild.
In addition to its effects on human health, T. gondii can have devastating effects on wildlife. Researchers in California have found that infections were responsible for deaths of sea otters. In those cases, the strains were identical to those in nearby cat populations.
The best place for cat poop is "absolutely, emphatically" the landfill, Dr. Schwab said.
What about plant-based litters?
There are a slew of plant-based litters available, including ones made from corn, grass seeds, tofu and walnut shells. Unless somebody in your home is allergic to nuts, grasses or grains, these litters might be the way to go.
Things like leftover walnut shells or pea shells are essentially agricultural byproducts. That means water, pesticides and fertilizers aren't specifically allocated to produce them.
The main drawback of plant-based litters is what happens when you dispose of them. If they end up in a landfill, they'll get buried under heaps of other trash. There, without enough oxygen to decompose properly, they'll release methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
Can you compost plant-based litters?
Most municipal compost programs don't accept cat poo or used litter because of concerns about T. gondii and other nasty pathogens like salmonella and E. coli.
Theoretically, plant-based cat litters can be composted, but only under very specific conditions that will be difficult for most people to meet.
Most backyard compost piles aren't large enough to reach the temperatures needed to toast pathogens like T. gondii, said Liv Johansson, a former director of the Zoo Doo program at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle. The project composts manure and bedding from big cats including jaguars, tigers, lynx and lions.
To reach the required temperature of roughly 165 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 74 Celsius, she said, you'd need a compost pile at least two cubic yards (think two washing machines) regularly supplemented with woody material and monitored for moisture.
Even then, experts say, you shouldn't use the compost from cat litter anywhere near waterways or places where food is grown.
What's the bottom line?
From an environmental perspective, the best-case scenario seems to be a plant-based litter made from scrap material. If you can't compost the used litter with proper precautions, choose a slow-to-decompose product like wood chips or walnut shells to minimize methane release in the landfill.
As always, clumps of cat poop and pee should go into the regular trash.
If plant-based won't work for your household, you're best served by choosing the conventional cat litter you can use the least of. That means the one you find best for clumping and odor control.

Ukraine Makes Its Case to Trump's Team: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Kyiv is feeling a sense of urgency leading up to the Jan. 20 inauguration, given the American president-elect's vow to end the war quickly.
Ukrainian officials are visiting the United States this week to seek continued American support, and met with members of Donald J. Trump's transition team to appeal to a president-elect who has pledged to bring a quick end to Ukraine's war with Russia.
Ukraine's foreign minister, Andriy Sybiha, said at a NATO meeting in Brussels on Wednesday that Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelensky's powerful chief of staff, had made the visit for meetings that are "important for establishing relations, including with the leaders of the new administration."
Mr. Yermak and Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, met on Capitol Hill on Wednesday with JD Vance, the vice president-elect, and Representative Mike Waltz of Florida, Mr. Trump's pick for national security adviser, said a person with knowledge of the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity. Also present was a representative for Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general who is the president-elect's choice for envoy to Ukraine and Russia.
Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's first deputy prime minister, was also in the U.S. this week. She spoke of her country's energy investment opportunities at an Energy Transition Forum in Washington, in which she appealed to American businesses for investments such as oil and gas extraction, she said on social media.
With Ukraine's war effort showing signs of exhaustion and its forces losing ground daily, there are fears in the country that the period leading up to Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 could be exceedingly violent as Russia tries to capture more land before any talks are held.
Ukraine's leadership has been trying to court Mr. Trump and his team since before the election, and an added sense of urgency is compelling Ukraine's government to seek their support even before he takes office.
Some Ukrainian officials, including Mr. Zelensky, have presented the American election result as an opportunity for a new strategy in the war, but other Ukrainian politicians and political experts have expressed fear that it will mean reduced military aid.
On Tuesday, Speaker Mike Johnson dealt a blow to Ukraine's war effort by refusing to allow a House vote on the Biden administration's request for $ 24 billion in additional aid.
That echoed moves by him and other Republicans last winter to hold up a Ukraine aid package for months, although the Pentagon said this week that it was sending Kyiv an additional $ 725 million in military assistance from its stockpiles. That tranche that will be the largest that the United States has sent to Ukraine since a $ 1 billion shipment was announced in April.
Several Ukrainian officials have been looking for opportunities to reach out to Mr. Trump's incoming administration. Oleksandr Merezhko, the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament's Committee on Foreign Policy, said in an interview that he was planning a trip to Washington this month. "I would like to meet those people who are close to Trump -- it is important," he said.

Should You Still Learn to Code in an A.I. World?: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Coding boot camps once looked like the golden ticket to an economically secure future. But as that promise fades, what should you do? Keep learning, until further notice.
When Florencio Rendon was laid off from his third construction job in three years, he said, "it was the straw that broke the camel's back."
He was 36, a father of two, and felt time was running out to find a career that would offer higher pay and more stability. "I've always been doing jobs that require physical labor," he remembers thinking. "What if I start using my brain for once?"
An Army veteran, Mr. Rendon explored training programs he could fund using his military benefits. He landed on a coding boot camp.
At first, the intensive courses seemed intimidating. Mr. Rendon had gotten his high school equivalency diploma before joining the Army, and he had taken some college courses, but he didn't consider himself book smart.
Still, he thought about his children, who are now 4 and 2, and reasoned, "If I can make this work, then I should at least give it a try."
His application to a course run by the company Fullstack Academy was accepted, and he started classes in April 2023, with a grant for military veterans that covered the $ 13,000 tuition. While the material was challenging, he was pleasantly surprised to learn he could get the hang of it, and four months later, he graduated from an online program that he completed from his home in the Bronx.
The setback came after graduation: "Little did I know," Mr. Rendon said of his new skills, "that's not enough to get a job."
Between the time Mr. Rendon applied for the coding boot camp and the time he graduated, what Mr. Rendon imagined as a "golden ticket" to a better life had expired. About 135,000 start-up and tech industry workers were laid off from their jobs, according to one count. At the same time, new artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT, an online chatbot from OpenAI, which could be used as coding assistants, were quickly becoming mainstream, and the outlook for coding jobs was shifting.
Mr. Rendon says he didn't land a single interview.
Coding boot camp graduates across the country are facing a similarly tough job market. In Philadelphia, Mal Durham, a lawyer who wanted to change careers, was about halfway through a part-time coding boot camp late last year when its organizers with the nonprofit Launchcode delivered disappointing news.
"They said: 'Here is what the hiring metrics look like. Things are down. The number of opportunities is down,"' she said. "It was really disconcerting."
In Boston, Dan Pickett, the founder of a boot camp called Launch Academy, decided in May to pause his courses indefinitely because his job placement rates, once as high as 90 percent, had dwindled to below 60 percent.
"I loved what we were doing," he said. "We served the market. We changed a lot of lives. The team didn't want that to turn sour."
Compared with five years ago, the number of active job postings for software developers has dropped 56 percent, according to data compiled by CompTIA. For inexperienced developers, the plunge is an even worse 67 percent.
"I would say this is the worst environment for entry-level jobs in tech, period, that I've seen in 25 years," said Venky Ganesan, a partner at the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures.
For years, the career advice from everyone who mattered -- the Apple chief executive Tim Cook, your mother -- was "learn to code." It felt like an immutable equation: Coding skills + hard work = job.
Now the math doesn't look so simple.
Irresistible A.I.
Since their emergence in the mid-2010s, intensive courses in basic coding skills have been praised as a quick route to a high-paying career, especially for people who didn't graduate from college. President Barack Obama made them part of his jobs initiative, nonprofits set them up to propel people of diverse backgrounds into tech careers, and universities from Harvard to Berkeley offered their own versions.
And they worked. In a 2020 survey of 3,000 boot camp graduates by CourseReport, 79 percent of respondents said the courses had helped them land a job in tech, with an average salary increase of 56 percent.
But the industry pulled back from hiring at the same time that new A.I. coding tools were starting to become mainstream. In 2022, Google's A.I. team, DeepMind, reported that it had tested its A.I. model AlphaCode in coding competitions, and that it was as good as "a novice programmer with a few months to a year of training."
It took a few more years, but the tools available to a typical programmer have since improved markedly. This September, OpenAI released a new version of ChatGPT. It computes answers in a way that is different from previous models and may be even better at writing code. Tools like AlphaCode from Google and Copilot from GitHub generate snippets of code for specific purposes, testing or optimizing existing code and finding bugs.
The real proof is among developers: About 60 percent of 65,000 developers surveyed in May by StackOverflow, a software developer community, said they had used A.I. coding tools this year.
Not everyone sees these developments as a death knell for coding jobs. Armando Solar-Lezama, who, as the leader of M.I.T.'s Computer Assisted Programming Group, spends his days thinking about how to bring more automation into coding, said A.I. tools still lacked a lot of the essential skills of even junior programmers. His research has shown, for example, how large language models like GPT-4 failed to truly understand the problems they were solving with code and made sometimes ridiculous mistakes.
"When you're talking about more foundational skills, knowing how to reason about a piece of code, knowing how to track down a bug across a large system, those are things that the current models really don't know how to do," he said.
Still, A.I. is changing how software is made. In one study, an A.I. Coding assistant made developers 20 percent more productive. Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said on a recent call with analysts that more than a quarter of the company's new code was now generated by A.I., but reviewed and accepted by engineers.
As with any discussion about automation, there are two ways people tend to forecast the outcomes of this development. Mr. Solar-Lezama believes that A.I. tools are good news for programming careers. If coding becomes easier, he argues, we'll just make more, better software. We'll use it to solve problems that wouldn't have been worth the hassle previously, and standards will skyrocket.
The other view: "I think it's pretty grim," said Zach Sims, a co-founder of Codecademy, an online coding tutorial company. He was talking specifically about the job prospects for coding boot camp graduates.
Hiring: GPT Monkeys
To be clear, both Mr. Solar-Lezama and Mr. Sims -- and just about everyone working in technology whom I interviewed for this article -- still think you should learn to code. But some see a parallel with long division: It's good to understand how it works. It's an arguably necessary exercise for learning more advanced mathematics. But on its own, it gets you only so far.
Matt Beane, an assistant professor of technology management at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is studying how the use of A.I. tools is already affecting entry-level coders at five large corporations across industries like banking and insurance.
"The phrase GPT monkey has come up repeatedly and independently," he said. "They feel like they are relegated to small tasks that they just sort of churn through with the help of some A.I.-related tool."
Sometimes, the new coders he is tracking don't even get the opportunity to do that. Because A.I.-generated code is riddled with errors that are hard to spot without experience, senior developers sometimes find it easier to generate and edit it themselves than to let it fall to a junior programmer.
Mr. Beane observed the same conundrum with other skills in which work was being automated, like surgery and financial analysis: Beginners need more expertise to be useful, but getting the type of experience that would normally help build that expertise is becoming harder.
For a while, basic coding skills were a clear on-ramp to a tech career for people like Mr. Rendon who didn't have a college education or a lot of experience. In the future, entry-level coders may need a broader range of skills and more training to be effective. They may have to understand more about how their code works within a broader system.
Strategizing around business problems is also becoming more important, said Stephanie Wernick Barker, the president of Mondo, a tech staffing and recruitment firm, "So college degrees are still king."
In other words, the biggest change taking shape in software jobs may be not that A.I. replaces software engineers, but that it makes it more difficult to become one.
Stay Sharp. Keep Learning.
In the arena of cliché job advice, "learn to code" has been replaced by a call for "A.I. skills."
M.I.T., Cornell, Northwestern, Columbia and other universities now lend their names to A.I. certificates. Fullstack Academy, the coding boot camp Mr. Rendon attended, recently started a 26-week A.I. and machine learning boot camp. And companies like Booz Allen and JPMorgan Chase are offering free A.I. courses to employees.
The most popular job titles specific to A.I. include "machine-learning engineer" and "artificial intelligence engineer," according to CompTIA. Some skills listed in these job postings are "deploying and scaling machine-learning models" and "automating large language model training, versioning, monitoring and deployment processes."
You can't learn that quickly without a math or coding background.
Another category of "A.I. skill" feels more elusive. In a recent survey of more than 9,000 executives by Microsoft and LinkedIn, 66 percent said they wouldn't hire someone without A.I. skills, but it's unclear, exactly, what those skills look like.
It doesn't help that the technology is moving quickly: Depending on whom you ask, we may be either a few years or many decades away from A.I. that can basically do anything the human brain can. When I asked Mr. Beane what we should be teaching young people to make them employable, he said: "You have to just stay sharp. You have to keep learning. Until further notice."
Robert Wolcott, a venture investor who teaches business classes at both Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management and the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said he tells anxious parents that their children should study whatever they're passionate about, even if it's ancient architecture, but also take a class in statistics, accounting and computing.
"I think you learn to learn," said Mr. Ganesan, the venture capitalist.
Mike Taylor, the chief technology officer of the global tech services company World Wide Technology, provided perhaps the most straightforward list: "problem solving skills," "business acumen and values" and "clear and persuasive communication skills."
Compared with "learn to code," though, this is not easily actionable advice. For Mr. Rendon, the Fullstack Academy graduate, the dilemma isn't an abstract one.
When he didn't land any interviews for coding jobs, he went back to construction. The project finished, and he was laid off again.
When I first spoke with him in early August, he was pondering a choice. He was interviewing for a job with the Border Patrol, which would require moving his family out of New York. But he had also learned that his veterans' benefits would provide him with enough housing assistance that he could go to college to study computer science.
College seemed like a good idea, "but what if I go this route and it doesn't work out?" he asked.
Two months later, he had enrolled in the college classes. In his first computer science class, the professor went over the history of computers. It was a lot different from coding boot camp.
"This is more like general stuff that opens the possibility for other things," he said.

Russia Strikes Ukraine, With Aim to Step It Up: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ukraine said the attacks targeted energy infrastructure. President Vladimir V. Putin said they were retaliation for Kyiv's use of long-range American missiles.
Russia attacked Ukrainian energy infrastructure with missiles and drones on Thursday, in what President Vladimir V. Putin said was retaliation for Kyiv's hitting Russian territory with long-range American missiles.
Mr. Putin suggested that such strikes could be stepped up, after millions of Ukrainians were left without power on Thursday, Ukrainian officials said. Ukraine's energy ministry said it was the 11th major attack on the country's energy infrastructure this year.
The total extent of the damage was not immediately clear, but explosions were heard in cities across Ukraine, and many officials reported power outages. Six people were reported injured across the country, according to the regional authorities.
"The energy sector is under massive enemy attack again," Ukraine's energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, wrote on his Facebook page. The operator of the Ukrainian transmission system "has urgently introduced emergency power outages," he added.
Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in an escalating cycle of strikes against each other in recent weeks. While attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have long been a tactic used by Russia, some analysts say both sides are also trying to improve their negotiating position before the inauguration of President-elect Donald J. Trump.
Mr. Trump has promised to end the conflict, without specifying how.
Speaking at a meeting of a Moscow-led security alliance in Kazakhstan, Mr. Putin warned that Russian strikes on Ukraine could intensify, saying that his country has been selecting targets for missile strikes in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and that they might include "decision-making centers" there.
"At present, the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff are selecting targets to hit on Ukrainian territory," Mr. Putin said. "These could be military facilities, defense and industrial enterprises, or decision-making centers in Kyiv."
Russia said on Tuesday that Ukraine had used more than a dozen U.S.-delivered missiles known as Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, to strike its territory twice in the previous few days. That came after a Ukrainian attack involving the same missiles last week, the first time Ukraine had used the longer-range weapons to strike in Russia since the United States granted permission to use them this month.
That strike prompted Russia to respond by test firing an Oreshnik, an intermediate-range ballistic missile designed to deliver nuclear weapons, though it was not armed with nuclear warheads.
Mr. Putin said that Russia would respond forcefully to strikes on its territory with the use of long-range Western-made missiles, "possibly continuing to test the Oreshnik in combat conditions."
Mr. Putin said Russia had several Oreshnik missiles in stock that are "ready to be used."
Speaking later at a news conference that concluded his visit to Kazakhstan, Mr. Putin said that Russia would use "all available weapons" at its disposal if Ukraine acquired nuclear arms. Earlier, some Western officials had suggested that the United States could return nuclear weapons to Ukraine that were taken from it after the fall of the Soviet Union.
After the strikes Thursday, more than a million people were without power in the western regions of Lviv, Volyn and Rivne, officials said. Farther to the east, the city of Zhytomyr was without power and water. The southern city of Kherson was also without electricity, as was much of Kyiv.
Ihor Polishchuk, the mayor of Lutsk in the Volyn region of western Ukraine, said there had been several hits on his city and the surrounding area. Six people were reported injured across Ukraine, according to the regional authorities.
Russia has attacked cities in Ukraine with drones almost every night since September in a campaign that analysts say is intended to test and wear down air defenses, and it has recently stepped up missile attacks.
The attacks have also targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure in an effort to plunge the population into cold and darkness as winter sets in.
Ukraine's Air Force reported that 91 missiles and 97 drones were fired at the country overnight. It said that 79 missiles were downed, and that all of the drones were either downed or jammed. All told, 188 strikes were aimed at Ukraine's energy infrastructure, the air force said.
In his comments Thursday, Mr. Putin said Russia had launched "a comprehensive strike" overnight on Ukraine using 90 missiles and 100 drones. He said 17 targets, including "military facilities, defense industry facilities and support systems" were hit.
Cruise and ballistic missiles were launched from planes that took off from airfields in three Russian regions and Crimea, the air force said. The Black Sea fleet at Novorossiysk also contributed to the attack with Kalibr cruise missiles.
More than 40 percent of Ukraine's generating capacity had already been destroyed and occupied before Thursday's attacks, according to Stanislav Ignatiev, executive director of Ukraine's Institute of Sustainable Development, a nongovernmental organization.
The damage and destruction of Ukraine's power generating capacity means that the country will face energy problems for a while, analysts said.
"Unfortunately, we have to state that in the near future, we will be limited in generating capacity for at least three to four years until we build new ones," Oleksandr Kharchenko, a director of the Energy Industry Research Center, an independent institute, said this week.
The strikes on Thursday came just after Mr. Trump appointed a retired general, Keith Kellogg, who was a national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence during the first Trump administration, as his special representative for Ukraine and Russia.
Mr. Kellogg is a co-author of a peace proposal submitted to Mr. Trump last summer that included a moratorium on NATO membership for Ukraine and that would leave Russia in charge of the Ukrainian territory it currently occupies.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: KYIV, Ukraine — Russia attacked Ukrainian energy infrastructure with missiles and drones on Thursday, in what President Vladimir Putin said was retaliation for Kyiv’s hitting Russian territory with long-range U.S. missiles.
Putin suggested that such strikes could be stepped up, after millions of Ukrainians were left without power on Thursday, Ukrainian officials said. Ukraine’s energy ministry said it was the 11th major attack on the country’s energy infrastructure this year.
The total extent of the damage was not immediately clear, but explosions were heard in cities across Ukraine, and many officials reported power outages. Six people were reported injured across the country, according to the regional authorities.
“The energy sector is under massive enemy attack again,” Ukraine’s energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, wrote on his Facebook page. The operator of the Ukrainian transmission system “has urgently introduced emergency power outages,” he added.
Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in an escalating cycle of strikes against each other in recent weeks. While attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure have long been a tactic used by Russia, some analysts say both sides are also trying to improve their negotiating position before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.
Trump has promised to end the conflict, without specifying how.
Speaking at a meeting of a Moscow-led security alliance in Kazakhstan, Putin warned that Russian strikes on Ukraine could intensify, saying that his country has been selecting targets for missile strikes in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, and that they might include “decision-making centers” there.
“At present, the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff are selecting targets to hit on Ukrainian territory,” Putin said. “These could be military facilities, defense and industrial enterprises, or decision-making centers in Kyiv.”
Russia said on Tuesday that Ukraine had used more than a dozen U.S.-delivered missiles known as Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, to strike its territory twice in the previous few days. That came after a Ukrainian attack involving the same missiles last week, the first time Ukraine had used the longer-range weapons to strike in Russia since the United States granted permission to use them this month.
That strike prompted Russia to respond by test firing an Oreshnik, an intermediate-range ballistic missile designed to deliver nuclear weapons, though it was not armed with nuclear warheads.
Putin said that Russia would respond forcefully to strikes on its territory with the use of long-range Western-made missiles, “possibly continuing to test the Oreshnik in combat conditions.”
Putin said Russia had several Oreshnik missiles in stock that are “ready to be used.”
Speaking later at a news conference that concluded his visit to Kazakhstan, Putin said that Russia would use “all available weapons” at its disposal if Ukraine acquired nuclear arms. Earlier, some Western officials had suggested that the United States could return nuclear weapons to Ukraine that were taken from it after the fall of the Soviet Union.
After the strikes Thursday, more than 1 million people were without power in the western regions of Lviv, Volyn and Rivne, officials said. Farther to the east, the city of Zhytomyr was without power and water. The southern city of Kherson was also without electricity, as was much of Kyiv.

Strong Showing Spurs Midwest Mechanic to Empower Working Class: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Osborn, the industrial mechanic who turned a long-shot Senate bid in red Nebraska into an unexpectedly tight race, is starting a PAC aimed at recruiting more blue-collar candidates like himself.
Dan Osborn, an industrial mechanic who ran as an independent Senate candidate in Nebraska, came up short in his quest to unseat Senator Deb Fischer, a low-profile Republican whose closer-than-expected victory in a red state clinched Senate control for her party on election night.
But Mr. Osborn's 47 percent of the vote in Nebraska well outpaced Vice President Kamala Harris's 39 percent, and in what he called his "almost success," there might be clues to how a more populist approach could wrest the working class from Republicans, not through partisan warfare but class consciousness.
"Who's the one doing the dividing here?" Mr. Osborn asked in an interview on Monday. "I think it's the people who are laughing all the way to the bank while us common folk live paycheck to paycheck."
On Tuesday, Mr. Osborn, 49, will return to work as a union steamfitter in Omaha, facing a pile of bills from his time off campaigning, including a $ 4,000 veterinarian's bill for the Addison's disease his dog developed during the election year. He is also announcing a new super PAC, the Working Class Heroes Fund, to try to recruit more blue-collar workers to run for office, and to organize the working class to vote in their economic self-interest.
"I just think it means everything that working people have a seat at the table because we have enough, you know, high-profile lawyers and business execs," Mr. Osborn said. "I'm not saying they shouldn't have a seat at the table. Of course they should for what they've accomplished in their lives. But I feel like what I've accomplished as a working person, although it's not as glittery and glorious as a C.E.O. starting a company, I've certainly given my family a good life."
Before Mr. Osborn announced his campaign late last year, his only leadership role had been leading his union on strike at an Omaha Kellogg's cereal plant in 2021. With little money and almost no name recognition, the mechanic crisscrossed Nebraska, leaning on union workers far from the Democratic pockets of Omaha and Lincoln while rejecting the endorsement of the Nebraska Democratic Party.
He tried to prove his independence with a pro-gun, tough-on-the-border message, but he also favored abortion rights and new rules to make it easier for unions to organize.
Mainly, though, his biggest calling card was his genuine working-class identity and a penchant for listening. It wasn't a particularly substantive campaign -- he still struggles to articulate the policies that distinguished him from Republicans and Democrats -- but it was one that avoided the impression that many Democrats leave, that in appealing to working-class voters, they talk down to them.
"I'm not a huge political person," Mr. Osborn allowed. "I'm not certain how many people ran similar to me, numbers-wise. I can just tell you I spoke to people like a person. And that was the secret to my almost success."
He added, "I had 180 publicly advertised events; a lot of those people in the events were just like me, people who live paycheck to paycheck, working for a living."
"And whether it was a group of five or a group of 80, we would sit down, focus on issues and try to resolve things," he said.
The most resonant issues, he said, revolved around the yawning wealth gap between the billionaire classes on the coasts and virtually everyone else in the middle. Advocacy, he said, should not be built around forcing everyone to share but creating "an equal playing field" where "mom-and-pop shops" are able to compete with prices of chain stores like the Dollar Generals commonplace in Nebraska's small towns.
For much of this year, Ms. Fischer and the Republican campaign apparatus in Washington largely ignored Mr. Osborn, but last month, as polling showed a tight race, Republican super PACs and operatives swept in to rescue Ms. Fischer. A blitz of advertising portrayed Mr. Osborn as "a Democrat in disguise." The race also turned personal, with attacks on his family.
Mr. Osborn, a political neophyte, remains angry and hurt by the way the campaign closed.
"I've been in a hole, licking my wounds," he said, before adding that he can't afford to take any more time off.
"I'm going back to work tomorrow as a steamfitter because I tried to call all my bill collectors," he said, and they didn't care "that I ran a close Senate race. They want their money, they want their mortgage, they want their car payments, their insurance, their electrical bills."
Even now, with the campaign over, he insists he is an independent, although he has supported Democrats in the past. But he said his super PAC's recruitment of genuinely working-class candidates will be nonpartisan. He does not care what party they want to run with, as long as they truly come from the working class.
"If I have to go around the country on my weekends to help other working-class people get a seat at their table," he said, "whether that's state legislatures or county boards, however that looks, that's how I want to help."

Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Leaders Get Sentences Up to 10 Years: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The 45 defendants, including Joshua Wong, were at the forefront of the opposition movement crushed by Beijing. Many had already been in jail for years.
Anywhere else, it wouldn't have been controversial: a public vote by pro-democracy activists trying to strengthen their hand in legislative elections, to decide who should run. More than 600,000 people took part in the peaceful, unofficial poll.
But this was Hong Kong, just after the imposition of a national security law by Beijing, and officials had warned that even a straw poll would be taken as defiance.
On Tuesday, the price of defying Beijing was made clear. Forty-five former politicians and activists who had organized or taken part in the 2020 primary by the opposition camp were sentenced by a Hong Kong court to prison, including for as long as 10 years.
The sentences were the final step in a crackdown that cut the heart out of the city's democracy movement, turning its leaders into a generation of political prisoners. Among them were veteran politicians, former journalists and younger activists who had called for self-determination for Hong Kong.
In a courtroom that had to be created just to accommodate them, the 45 defendants sat shoulder to shoulder on Tuesday on long benches, behind a glass partition and flanked by police officers. A judge read their sentences aloud, referring to them not by their names but by their numbers on a list. The hearing was over in half an hour.
It was the most forceful demonstration of the power of a national security law Beijing imposed on Hong Kong in response to months of large protests against Chinese rule in 2019.
The court sentenced Benny Tai, 60, a legal scholar and opposition strategist, to 10 years in prison. Twenty opposition politicians and activists were given terms ranging from five to nearly eight years. Joshua Wong, 28, a prominent pro-democracy activist, was among 24 others whose sentences ranged from just over four to just under five years.
Gwyneth Ho, 32, a former journalist who was known for covering a mob attack on antigovernment demonstrators trapped in a subway station, was sentenced to seven years for running as a candidate. She had refused to plead guilty.
"Our true crime for Beijing is that we were not content with playing along in manipulated elections," said a statement posted on Ms. Ho's Facebook account, apparently by her supporters, on Tuesday after the sentencing. "We dared to confront the regime with the question: will democracy ever be possible within such a structure? The answer was a complete crackdown on all fronts of society."
The trial made clear that any form of dissent or criticism, however moderate, carried significant risk, analysts said. "If you are being critical of the authorities both in Hong Kong and in China, then it's open season," said Steve Tsang, a Hong Kong-born political scientist and director of the SOAS China Institute in London.
The ruling Communist Party in China says the law is needed to purge threats to Beijing's sovereignty, but human rights activists, scholars and Western governments have said that it has eroded Hong Kong's once-vaunted judicial independence.
Even before their sentences were handed down, many of the defendants, who were arrested in early 2021, had already been in jail for nearly four years, as they awaited and then stood trial. That was because the law has made it harder for defendants to be released on bail, which in most nonviolent cases is routinely granted.
Instead of a jury, the case was heard by three judges handpicked by the city's Beijing-backed leader, as allowed by the law.
"The authorities wanted to show the public that they have the power to bring a big group of people to trial all at once," said Patrick Poon, a visiting researcher at the University of Tokyo who studies freedom of expression in Hong Kong and China. "They want to show residents that anyone who tries to protest like this group of people will receive their same fate."
Prosecutors accused the defendants of "conspiracy to commit subversion," a national security offense, arguing that the objective of the election primary was to "undermine, destroy or overthrow the existing political system and structure of Hong Kong."
The outcome of the primary made clear that the residents who voted favored candidates who were prominent supporters of the 2019 antigovernment demonstrations. The pro-democracy camp argued that the primary vote was little different from others held in democracies around the world. The hope was to maximize the camp's chances of gaining more seats in a legislative chamber that already heavily favors the Beijing-backed establishment.
But they never had a chance to test the plan: The election was postponed, and most of the candidates were arrested.
Mr. Tai, the legal scholar who was sentenced to 10 years, had designed the electoral strategy, and prosecutors deemed him a mastermind. Mr. Tai had long been involved in efforts to persuade China to live up to a promise that has been central to Hong Kong since its 1997 return to Chinese control: that its residents would someday get to choose their own leaders. In 2014, he was one of the leaders of the Occupy Central movement that brought the city's central business district to a halt in a peaceful call for freer elections.
Other defendants included Leung Kwok-hung, a 68-year-old activist known as Long Hair for his unkempt mane, who was sentenced to six years and nine months; Claudia Mo, 67, a veteran former lawmaker, sentenced to four years and two months; and Lam Cheuk-ting, 47, a former anti-corruption investigator, sentenced to six years and nine months.
Mr. Tai and 30 other defendants had pleaded guilty. The court convicted 14 of them in May and acquitted two others.
Outside, hundreds of people waited in line to enter the gallery, braving a downpour and a heavy security presence around the courthouse, including an armored vehicle, police cars and barricades. Several dozen police officers were stationed on every street corner along the whole block.
As she left the courthouse, Elsa Wu, the mother of Hendrick Lui, one of the defendants, unfurled a poster in protest of the sentencing. Several police officers led her away into a police van and tried to slide the door shut.
"Tell me, why does he have to go to prison?" she called out, beating her fist. Mr. Lui was sentenced to more than four years in prison. "He is a political prisoner. He shouldn't be in prison. He is a good person. Why does he have to be in prison?" she said.
Thomas Kellogg, the executive director of the Georgetown Center for Asian Law, said he thought the case would be seen by many in the international community as the "final nail in the coffin for the rule of law in Hong Kong."
Despite the prospect of more prison time, some defendants were simply anxious for the trial that had left their lives in limbo to come to a conclusion, according to friends who had visited them.
Emilia Wong, a gender rights activist, said in an interview ahead of the sentencing that her boyfriend, Ventus Lau, an organizer of the 2019 antigovernment protests, had been studying toward a degree in translation. She said she had been regularly visiting him in detention for the past three years, but it was clear the isolation was taking a toll on him.
"The scary thing about prison is not being locked up in one place. It is the loss of connection with people and society that is scary. To him, it was painful," she said.

Kennedy Vows A Risky Battle With Big Food: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Processed foods are in the cross hairs of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but battling major companies could collide with President-elect Donald J. Trump's corporate-friendly goals.
Boxes of brightly colored breakfast cereals, vivid orange Doritos and dazzling blue M&Ms may find themselves under attack in the new Trump administration.
In excoriating such grocery store staples and their mysterious ingredients, Robert F. Kennedy tapped into a zeitgeist of widening appeal for healthy foods to curb obesity and disease that helped propel President-elect Donald J. Trump to select him to oversee the country's vast health agency.
"We are betraying our children by letting these industries poison them," Mr. Kennedy said at a campaign rally on Nov. 2, to raucous applause.
As Mr. Trump's choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services, he would have far-reaching authority over the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates about 80 percent of the nation's food supply. That includes shaping regulations on packaging that declares something "healthy" or discloses the amounts of sugar, salt and other ingredients in most packaged foods.
But in vowing to upend the nation's food system, Mr. Kennedy is taking a direct shot at Big Food, one of the country's most powerful industries whose traditional allies are Republicans. Even something as simple as removing artificial dyes is likely to result in a knockdown battle for the multibillion-dollar food sector, which is wary of higher manufacturing costs or a dip in sales of products favored by loyal consumers.
More broadly, Mr. Kennedy has set an agenda to root out what he considers corruption in the arena of government and public health, arguing that regulatory agencies overseeing food and drugs have been working hand in hand with corporate America to enhance profits rather than to benefit consumers.
Many of the issues Mr. Kennedy raises about healthier foods and on changing the practices of established industries through tougher measures have traditionally been pursued by Democrats.
But Mr. Trump has adopted Mr. Kennedy's sentiments, at least for now. In announcing his choice to run the top federal health agency, Mr. Trump said on social media: "Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation and disinformation when it comes to public health." He said he expected Mr. Kennedy to "end the chronic disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!"
Mr. Kennedy still faces the challenge of being confirmed by the Senate amid concerns about his persistent vaccine skepticism and a long history of espousing conspiracy theories. On the food front, his singling out of seed oils like canola and sunflower as a root cause of disease, a position that puzzled many experts, could give the industry the ammunition it needs to derail him.
Those who carefully watched Mr. Trump's first term in the White House also question whether Mr. Kennedy may be setting off on a collision course with the president-elect, whose record of deregulation is well-documented. And forcing changes could further raise the cost of food at a time when the public is frustrated with grocery prices.
Clamping down on the food industry also pits Mr. Kennedy against agricultural and food titans, companies that have a history of wielding their power as major donors in congressional and presidential elections.
The lack of policy coherency -- and a boss who loves McDonald's burgers -- could limit Mr. Kennedy's reach, said Mary Summers, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania who lectured on the politics of food.
"On the one hand, he's claiming he's going to dismantle it all," she said, noting his threat to fire F.D.A. staff members who "suppressed" certain therapies. "On the other hand, he's claiming, I'm going to regulate. I'm going to go to war for you and battle all this bad stuff in your food. And those two things don't go together."
The food and agriculture industries are already eyeing the landscape of a second Trump administration, generally viewed as corporate-friendly. They are calculating where they are likely to have easy victories, say, on removing regulations that they view as overly burdensome or cutting too deeply into profits, like the new requirements to track food items carefully so they can be recalled in the event of contamination.
And the industries are assessing the potential battlefields, like the threat of mass deportation of immigrants, whom giant industrial farms rely on to harvest crops, slaughter cattle and provide the bulk of their labor force.
The rise of Mr. Kennedy and the Make America Healthy Again movement are making the food industries particularly nervous.
"When political ideologies are used to create fear and disregard the role of science, it undermines public trust in food safety and can cause consumers, particularly those in vulnerable populations, to lose access to safe, nutrient-dense foods," Sarah Gallo, a senior vice president of product policy for the Consumer Brands Association, a lobbying group for the food and beverage industry, said in an emailed statement.
Still, Mr. Kennedy has struck a rich crossover vein marrying odd alliances by taking aim at ridding the food supply of artificial colorings and chemicals that have been banned in European foods for years. In addition, his interests have aligned with groups -- traditionally associated with Democrats -- that are concerned about whether processed foods and excess sugar and sodium have contributed to a rise in obesity, diabetes, heart disease and chronic illnesses.
The growing power of social influencers has helped to magnify his cause. Among them is Casey Means, a Stanford-trained physician whose name has been floated as the next commissioner of the F.D.A. She blames the ultra-processed food system for much of the chronic disease in America. Another prominent social influencer is Vani Hari, known online as the Food Babe, a clean-food activist who has been campaigning for WK Kellogg to remove artificial dyes and chemicals from its U.S. cereals.
"There have been people working on this issue for a long time," Ms. Hari said, "but it feels like a lot of momentum is coming now from Kennedy joining forces with Trump."
Both women, along with Mr. Kennedy, were speakers at a nearly four-hour round table in September hosted by Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican of Wisconsin, that focused on alternative diets, the risks of processed foods and the conflict-ridden food and drug regulatory agencies. The event also drew the attention of other Republican lawmakers who joined the audience.
But getting the food industry to change its formulations may not be easy. Nearly a decade ago, companies responded to public pressure, and Kellogg's, Mars and General Mills removed synthetic colors from cereals and snacks. Some companies said sales slumped because consumers missed the bright colors, so they reverted to those ingredients.
Mr. Kennedy has singled out Froot Loops as an example of a product with too many artificial ingredients, questioning why the Canadian version has fewer than the U.S. version. But he was wrong. The ingredient list is roughly the same, although Canada's has natural colorings made from blueberries and carrots while the U.S. product contains red dye 40, yellow 5 and blue 1 as well as Butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT, a lab-made chemical that is used "for freshness," according to the ingredient label.
In a statement, WK Kellogg, the manufacturer of cereals that was formed last year when parent company Kellogg Co. split into two separate companies, said that its cereals complied with U.S. and Canadian regulations. The artificial dyes it uses are certified by regulators and allowed in Canada, the company said. Lastly, Kellogg said that its foods have evolved and that "70 percent of our cereal sales have less than 50 calories from added sugar" and 85 percent of cereal sales do not contain artificial dyes.
Still, other companies have successfully removed artificial dyes from popular foods, including Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, which bowed to public pressure in 2016 and switched to turmeric and paprika to keep its characteristic orange noodles.
European Union regulators have already taken stricter measures, requiring a warning label on foods that included artificial colors linked to attention and behavioral problems in children.
The U.S. food system, under the F.D.A., operates very differently than the food system in Europe, where chemicals tend to be subject to safety review before they enter the food supply. In the United States, new ingredients regularly debut in food with no notice to the F.D.A. or the public.
Companies are allowed to certify an ingredient as "generally regarded as safe," or GRAS, and file a report supporting their decision. Congress meant for the designation to apply to common ingredients like olive oil or vinegar.
"In 1958, Congress imagined 99 percent of the chemicals would be reviewed by F.D.A.," said Scott Faber, of the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit advocacy group. "And perhaps one percent would enter commerce through the GRAS loophole. Today, the reverse is true."
Left-leaning lawmakers have long supported consumer advocates and activists who have pushed for scrutiny of chemical additives in foods. Now those arguments are being embraced by some on the right as well.
"Historically, Republicans haven't been very supportive of this issue," said Jerold R. Mande, a former regulator in the Clinton and Obama administrations who is now an adjunct professor of nutrition at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard University. "But, more recently, we've seen Republicans join in on the discussion."
Democrats including Senator Edward Markey, of Massachusetts, and Representative Rosa DeLauro, of Connecticut, recently introduced bills to tackle the food-ingredient loophole.
Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat of New Jersey and co-sponsor of one of the bills, agreed in an opinion essay for The Hill just before the election that the food system was "painfully broken." But he argued that moves made in the first Trump administration, like reversing efforts to make school lunches healthier and allowing the use of dozens of toxic chemicals that are banned in other countries, illustrated that Mr. Trump "has no intention of bringing needed change to our food system."
This week, Dr. Robert Califf, commissioner of the F.D.A., said he did not want to respond to Mr. Kennedy's threats issued during an NBC interview to fire agency nutrition staff. He also said that there were things he wanted to overhaul, but that he faced "gridlock of various interests that made it difficult to change things."
In recent months, the F.D.A. has responded to rising public concerns by reorganizing its food division, now run by Jim Jones, who reviewed chemicals for the Environmental Protection Agency. The agency has been advancing a plan to update how food companies can use the term "healthy" on packaging. In recent weeks, the agency held a meeting about an effort to review chemical additives.
Other federal officials have been reviewing whether dietary guidelines should warn against ultra-processed foods, although a panel of experts recently said various research studies were too limited to clearly link the foods with obesity and other health issues.
Stuart Pape, a lawyer who represents food companies, said it could take two years or more for the F.D.A. to decide whether to remove a single ingredient from products. But a more forceful team, he said, could find a way to move faster.
"Process and guardrails matter only if the person in authority cares about process and guard rails," Mr. Pape said. He added that he would expect the Trump administration to "find ways to push the edges to find ways to be more disruptive more quickly."
In recent years, absent regulation by the F.D.A., some states are imposing their own rules. Last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that banned several food additives, including Red Dye No. 3, which the F.D.A. had outlawed in cosmetics decades earlier over cancer concerns. (The F.D.A. said it was reviewing the dye, with a determination expected soon.)
Similar bills are pending in New York and Illinois. Another New York proposal would require companies to disclose the ingredients they designated as generally safe.
"There is a valid sort of outrage at the system," said Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy for the Consumer Federation of America, a trade group. "Because it's not like the F.D.A. has been heroically standing up to the food industry under Democratic or Republican administrations."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the cramped kitchen of a home in Queens, Tiana Webb slowly flipped empanadas in a pot of hot oil as they turned crispy and brown -- just like her Jamaican-Puerto Rican family taught her.
Nearly 1,800 miles away in Hutto, Texas, Davila Dion pounded plantains into a chewy bread the way her mother taught her in Ivory Coast.
"When you use a blender, it doesn't give the taste that you want," Mrs. Dion said, opting for a mortar and pestle to mash the fruit into dough for a dish called fufu.
Ms. Webb's business, T's Kitchen, and Mrs. Dion's business, WAfrica Taste, have dozens of loyal customers.
But neither of them have storefronts, employees or commercial kitchens.
Instead, like thousands of other unlicensed restaurateurs across the country, Ms. Webb and Mrs. Dion have found success selling their home cooking through an unexpected platform: Facebook Marketplace.
Yes, that Facebook Marketplace. The internet's garage sale. Best known for offering sweet deals on used furniture and electronics.
Thanks to the rising cost of eating out, the coronavirus pandemic and changes to state laws, Marketplace and other social media sites have become a popular place to buy and sell freshly made meals. On Meta's plainly designed, free platform for listing just about anything, thousands of people -- many of them immigrants or the children of immigrants -- are working side gigs.
These home cooks operate in a sort of legal gray area, with some states expanding cottage food laws and broadening opportunities for home food businesses. Unlike street food vendors and food truck owners, who apply for permits that are often highly difficult to obtain, home restaurant businesses have fewer hoops to jump through and rules are not often enforced. Many only sell a few meals a day or week.
"When you're sitting down with a plate of her food, it's not like food that you got out at a restaurant," Brittani Bacchus, a friend and one of Ms. Webb's customers, said of her cooking. "Somebody's mom made that food or somebody's grandmother made that food."
Everything Ms. Webb, 28, and Mrs. Dion, 33, know about cooking they learned from their families. Ms. Webb's grandparents were from Jamaica and Puerto Rico and her food is inspired by both cuisines.
"It has helped me become more connected to my own culture," Ms. Webb said of her cooking.
Mrs. Dion moved to New Jersey from Ivory Coast when she was 25, and settled in Hutto in March. It's hard to find great fufu in Texas, she said.
"They have African restaurants, but they have more Ethiopian, Nigerian," said Mrs. Dion, a stay-at-home mother.
Ms. Webb started looking for a side gig after feeling the pressure of pandemic-era inflation, and Mrs. Dion was looking for ways to make money at home. Both were skilled cooks, but opening a brick-and-mortar restaurant was prohibitively expensive and neither could pick up work that took them away from their children.
Mrs. Dion began advertising the food she cooks at home -- a tropical smattering of flavorful rice, juicy chicken thighs, stewed meat and caramelized plantains -- to Marketplace in June. Now she has 30 loyal customers who buy her fufu, okra stew, peanut butter soup and whole fried tilapia. She charges $ 15 a plate for pickup and an additional fee for delivery.
Often served in aluminum catering trays or Styrofoam clamshell plates, Marketplace meals have no-frills packaging but are packed with flavor.
In a plate from Ms. Webb, her pernil -- slow-cooked pork shoulder -- falls into singular strands of flesh at the touch of a fork. Her mac and cheese has a crispy Cheddar crust and a gooey core. But the scene stealer is arroz con gandules, or rice with pigeon peas. The rice is impeccably seasoned and provides the perfect bed for the pernil juices.
Looking for a way to make a little money on the side, Ms. Webb, who works in marketing, began selling food on social media in December 2023. She now gets thousands of hits to the Instagram and Marketplace pages for T's Kitchen each month, she said.
"I didn't even expect the response to be so crazy," Ms. Webb said. "In the past year, it's grown so much."
A quick search for "food" on Marketplace in the New York area alone brings up hundreds of listings from home cooks like Ms. Webb and Mrs. Dion, selling Pakistani, Indian and Haitian cuisine, to name a few.
Experts who study food policy and social media trends say that home-restaurant businesses are growing across the country.
On Marketplace, "selling food is part of a newer trend," said Cliff Lampe, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Information who studies human-computer interaction. "It's not something that you saw on Marketplace five years ago."
Nancy Qian, an economics professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, attributes the boom in sales of homemade meals on social media to labor shortages, which have driven up the cost of food in restaurants and allowed at-home cooks to undercut them.
Daniela Morales, 33, a lab technician at a water treatment plant in Tucson, Ariz., spends her weekends making hundreds of tamales to sell on Marketplace. Tamale-making runs in her blood: Her grandmother sold the corn husk-wrapped dish out of her home in Sinaloa, Mexico, for nearly 30 years, she said.
"I use my grandma's recipe," Ms. Morales, who grew up in Sinaloa but now lives outside Tucson, said in a phone interview. "Everything is from scratch."
And at $ 22 for a dozen tamales, it's a bargain for her customers.
Today, in many states, what is known as cottage food -- nonhazardous items like breads and preserves -- can be sold legally from home. The rules for home-cooked hot meals are more stringent in order to prevent food-borne illness, but certain exceptions have been carved out.
In March, Gov. Katie Hobbs of Arizona signed into law a fought-over piece of legislation nicknamed the "tamale bill" that broadened the types of foods that can be cooked at home, allowing Ms. Morales to operate above board.
Where Ms. Webb and Mrs. Dion live, in New York and Texas, cottage food like cakes and preserves may be sold from home kitchens without inspections. But hot meals often cannot be sold without a permit, a process that usually requires the cook to have a second kitchen or to use a satellite kitchen. Those options can be prohibitively expensive for some, so Marketplace food is often served without obtaining the required permits.
The Food and Drug Administration said in an email to The Times that the agency was "working to address any gaps" in the regulatory landscape for home restaurant businesses.
A spokesman for Meta, Facebook's parent company, declined to respond to a list of questions about food being sold on Marketplace. He pointed to the platforms' rules allowing for food to be sold as long as sellers "comply with local laws."
Ms. Webb hopes to eventually own a home with two kitchens so she can legally cook full meals from home.
But that's a dream for another day. In two hours, customers would be at her door to pick up her empanadas that have been in her family's recipe book for generations.
She took a breath to collect herself, refreshed her Marketplace profile, and flipped another empanada in the oil, watching it brown. She glanced at a photo on the wall of her late grandfather, Ralph. Ms. Webb thinks about him every time she cooks.

Kennedy’s Vow to Take On Big Food Could Alienate His New GOP Allies

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/kennedy-s-vow-take-on-big-food-could-alienate-his/docview/3128909137/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Boxes of brightly colored breakfast cereals, vivid orange Doritos and dazzling blue M&M’s may find themselves under attack in the new Trump administration.
In excoriating such grocery store staples and their mysterious ingredients, Robert F. Kennedy tapped into a zeitgeist of widening appeal for healthy foods to curb obesity and disease that helped propel President-elect Donald Trump to select him to oversee the country’s vast health agency.
“We are betraying our children by letting these industries poison them,” Kennedy said at a campaign rally Nov. 2, to raucous applause.
As Trump’s choice to head the Department of Health and Human Services, he would have far-reaching authority over the Food and Drug Administration, which regulates about 80% of the nation’s food supply. That includes shaping regulations on packaging that declares something “healthy” or discloses the amounts of sugar, salt and other ingredients in most packaged foods.
But in vowing to upend the nation’s food system, Kennedy is taking a direct shot at Big Food, one of the country’s most powerful industries whose traditional allies are Republicans. Even something as simple as removing artificial dyes is likely to result in a knockdown battle for the multibillion-dollar food sector, which is wary of higher manufacturing costs or a dip in sales of products favored by loyal consumers.
More broadly, Kennedy has set an agenda to root out what he considers corruption in the arena of government and public health, arguing that regulatory agencies overseeing food and drugs have been working hand in hand with corporate America to enhance profits rather than to benefit consumers.
Many of the issues Kennedy raises about healthier foods and on changing the practices of established industries through tougher measures have traditionally been pursued by Democrats.
But Trump has adopted Kennedy’s sentiments, at least for now. In announcing his choice to run the top federal health agency, Trump said on social media, “Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation and disinformation when it comes to public health.” He said he expected Kennedy to “end the chronic disease epidemic, and to Make America Great and Healthy Again!”
Kennedy still faces the challenge of being confirmed by the Senate amid concerns about his persistent vaccine skepticism and a long history of espousing conspiracy theories. On the food front, his singling out of seed oils like canola and sunflower as a root cause of disease, a position that puzzled many experts, could give the industry the ammunition it needs to derail him.
Those who carefully watched Trump’s first term in the White House also question whether Kennedy may be setting off on a collision course with the president-elect, whose record of deregulation is well-documented. And forcing changes could further raise the cost of food at a time when the public is frustrated with grocery prices.
Clamping down on the food industry also pits Kennedy against agricultural and food titans, companies that have a history of wielding their power as major donors in congressional and presidential elections.
The lack of policy coherency — and a boss who loves McDonald’s burgers — could limit Kennedy’s reach, said Mary Summers, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania who lectured on the politics of food.
“On the one hand, he’s claiming he’s going to dismantle it all,” she said, noting his threat to fire FDA staff members who “suppressed” certain therapies. “On the other hand, he’s claiming, ‘I’m going to regulate. I’m going to go to war for you and battle all this bad stuff in your food.’ And those two things don’t go together.”
The food and agriculture industries are already eyeing the landscape of a second Trump administration, generally viewed as corporate-friendly. They are calculating where they are likely to have easy victories, say, on removing regulations that they view as overly burdensome or cutting too deeply into profits, like the new requirements to track food items carefully so they can be recalled in the event of contamination.
And the industries are assessing the potential battlefields, like the threat of mass deportation of immigrants, whom giant industrial farms rely on to harvest crops, slaughter cattle and provide the bulk of their labor force.
The rise of Kennedy and the Make America Healthy Again movement are making the food industries particularly nervous.
“When political ideologies are used to create fear and disregard the role of science, it undermines public trust in food safety and can cause consumers, particularly those in vulnerable populations, to lose access to safe, nutrient-dense foods,” Sarah Gallo, a senior vice president of product policy for the Consumer Brands Association, a lobbying group for the food and beverage industry, said in an emailed statement.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: NEW YORK — In the cramped kitchen of a home in Queens, Tiana Webb slowly flipped empanadas in a pot of hot oil as they turned crispy and brown — just as her Jamaican Puerto Rican family taught her.
Nearly 1,800 miles away in Hutto, Texas, Davila Dion pounded plantains into a chewy bread the way her mother taught her in Ivory Coast.
“When you use a blender, it doesn’t give the taste that you want,” Dion said, opting for a mortar and pestle to mash the fruit into dough for a dish called fufu.
Webb’s business, T’s Kitchen, and Dion’s business, WAfrica Taste, have dozens of loyal customers.
But neither of them have storefronts, employees or commercial kitchens.
Instead, like thousands of other unlicensed restaurateurs across the country, Webb and Dion have found success selling their home cooking through an unexpected platform: Facebook Marketplace.
Yes, that Facebook Marketplace. The internet’s garage sale. Best known for offering sweet deals on used furniture and electronics.
Thanks to the rising cost of eating out, the coronavirus pandemic and changes to state laws, Marketplace and other social media sites have become a popular place to buy and sell freshly made meals. On Meta’s plainly designed, free platform for listing just about anything, thousands of people — many of them immigrants or the children of immigrants — are working side gigs.
These home cooks operate in a sort of legal gray area, with some states expanding cottage food laws and broadening opportunities for home food businesses. Unlike street food vendors and food truck owners, who apply for permits that are often highly difficult to obtain, home restaurant businesses have fewer hoops to jump through and rules are not often enforced. Many only sell a few meals a day or week.
“When you’re sitting down with a plate of her food, it’s not like food that you got out at a restaurant,” Brittani Bacchus, a friend and customer of Webb’s, said of her cooking. “Somebody’s mom made that food or somebody’s grandmother made that food.”
Everything that Webb, 28, and Dion, 33, know about cooking they learned from their families. Webb’s grandparents were from Jamaica and Puerto Rico, and her food is inspired by both cuisines.
“It has helped me become more connected to my own culture,” Webb said of her cooking.
Dion moved to New Jersey from Ivory Coast when she was 25, and settled in Hutto in March. It’s hard to find great fufu in Texas, she said.
“They have African restaurants, but they have more Ethiopian, Nigerian,” said Dion, a stay-at-home mother.
Webb started looking for a side gig after feeling the pressure of pandemic-era inflation, and Dion was looking for ways to make money at home. Both were skilled cooks, but opening a brick-and-mortar restaurant was prohibitively expensive and neither could pick up work that took them away from their children.
Dion began advertising the food she cooks at home — a tropical smattering of flavorful rice, juicy chicken thighs, stewed meat and caramelized plantains — to Marketplace in June. Now, she has 30 loyal customers who buy her fufu, okra stew, peanut butter soup and whole fried tilapia. She charges $15 a plate for pickup and an additional fee for delivery.
Often served in aluminum catering trays or Styrofoam clamshell plates, Marketplace meals have no-frills packaging but are packed with flavor.
In a plate from Webb, her pernil — slow-cooked pork shoulder — falls into singular strands of flesh at the touch of a fork. Her mac and cheese has a crispy cheddar crust and a gooey core. But the scene stealer is arroz con gandules, or rice with pigeon peas. The rice is impeccably seasoned and provides the perfect bed for the pernil juices.
Looking for a way to make a little money on the side, Webb, who works in marketing, began selling food on social media in December 2023. She now gets thousands of hits to the Instagram and Marketplace pages for T’s Kitchen each month, she said.
“I didn’t even expect the response to be so crazy,” Webb said. “In the past year, it’s grown so much.”
A quick search for “food” on Marketplace in the New York area alone brings up hundreds of listings from home cooks like Webb and Dion, selling Pakistani, Indian and Haitian cuisine, to name a few.
Experts who study food policy and social media trends say that home restaurant businesses are growing across the country.
On Marketplace, “selling food is part of a newer trend,” said Cliff Lampe, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Information who studies human-computer interaction. “It’s not something that you saw on Marketplace five years ago.”
Nancy Qian, an economics professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, attributes the boom in sales of homemade meals on social media to labor shortages, which have driven up the cost of food in restaurants and allowed at-home cooks to undercut them.
Daniela Morales, 33, a lab technician at a water treatment plant in Tucson, Arizona, spends her weekends making hundreds of tamales to sell on Marketplace. Tamale-making runs in her blood: Her grandmother sold the corn husk-wrapped dish out of her home in Sinaloa, Mexico, for nearly 30 years, she said.
“I use my grandma’s recipe,” Morales, who grew up in Sinaloa but now lives outside Tucson, said in a phone interview. “Everything is from scratch.”
And at $22 for a dozen tamales, it’s a bargain for her customers.
Today, in many states, what is known as cottage food — nonhazardous items such as breads and preserves — can be sold legally from home. The rules for home-cooked hot meals are more stringent in order to prevent foodborne illness, but certain exceptions have been carved out.
In March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed into law a fought-over piece of legislation nicknamed the “tamale bill” that broadened the types of foods that can be cooked at home, allowing Morales to operate above board.
Where Webb and Dion live, in New York and Texas, cottage food such as cakes and preserves may be sold from home kitchens without inspections. But hot meals often cannot be sold without a permit, a process that usually requires the cook to have a second kitchen or to use a satellite kitchen. Those options can be prohibitively expensive for some, so Marketplace food is often served without obtaining the required permits.
The Food and Drug Administration said in an email to The New York Times that the agency was “working to address any gaps” in the regulatory landscape for home restaurant businesses.
A spokesperson for Meta, Facebook’s parent company, declined to respond to a list of questions about food being sold on Marketplace. He pointed to the platforms’ rules allowing for food to be sold as long as sellers “comply with local laws.”
Webb hopes to eventually own a home with two kitchens so she can legally cook full meals from home.
But that’s a dream for another day. In two hours, customers would be at her door to pick up her empanadas that have been in her family’s recipe book for generations.
She took a breath to collect herself, refreshed her Marketplace profile, and flipped another empanada in the oil, watching it brown. She glanced at a photo on the wall of her late grandfather, Ralph. Webb thinks about him every time she cooks.

Re "Donald Trump Returns to Power, Ushering In New Era of Uncertainty" (nytimes.com, Nov. 6):
I woke up today in a different country. After more than eight years of watching and listening to Donald Trump's vitriol, his lying, his relentless clawing at any and all soft underbellies, we said, "Yes, we want more."
He comes into power this time with an army of sycophants. He comes into power as the world writhes in discord and the planet itself is in peril. He comes into full power possibly having control of every lever of government. All because we said, "Yes, we want more."
During this most recent campaign, I sometimes heard the words of Maya Angelou invoked: "When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time."
Well, America, you have shown us who we are. And it's not a pretty sight.

To the Editor:
Election Day was one of the longest days in my memory. The anxiety, the void, as if time had stopped as we waited for the polls to close. Early in the evening, my husband, speaking more to himself than to me, said, "Just imagine if we wake up tomorrow and Trump has won."
The unimaginable has happened, and our country is broken. There is no choice. We must pick up the pieces and continue to fight for justice -- for immigrants, women, gay and transgender people -- for all the citizens and institutions targeted by the Trump-Vance ticket as they plowed their path to victory to "make America great again."

To the Editor:
Something more than just another presidential election occurred Tuesday night. After nine years of the most unrelenting demonization of any presidential figure in American history, Donald Trump emerged as a heroic figure.
Not only for his emphatic victory over the Democrats, in which he likely swept all seven swing states and even took the national popular vote while leading the G.O.P. to control of the Senate and perhaps retaining the House.
It's also about his stoic perseverance despite assassination attempts and the decade-long avalanche of hate from the nation's liberal intelligentsia in media, academia and Hollywood. I doubt if liberals even realize how much their exaggerations, lies and deceptions on everything from Russian collusion to Hunter Biden's laptop are responsible for this.
Not your president? Yes, he is. You created him.
Mark Godburn

To the Editor:
Uncertainty? There's no uncertainty. Donald Trump has said exactly what he will do. Want a list?
He will seek revenge on anyone who held him accountable. He will carry out mass deportation of immigrants who are the backbone of our food industries. He will shove the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community back in the dark. He will use the military to arrest his enemies. He will side with Russia against Ukraine and the Israelis against the Palestinians.
And unlike his first term there will be no guardrails. With a MAGA Congress and a conservative Supreme Court his promises will become real. Arrest Americans for the sole reason that they disagree? Isn't that what you do to "the enemy from within"?
We need to make plans for how we are going to hang on to our constitutional republic. Stop pussyfooting around pretending we are "uncertain." Donald Trump has told us. This is our mess. Americans voted for this very dangerous man. Stop being so damn polite.

To the Editor:
Misogyny won Tuesday night. Kamala Harris's greatest deficit was being born with the XX chromosomes, making her a woman. Unlike most of the rest of the world, this country is not ready for a female head of state. If you look at the male vote, it was pro-Trump.
This election tells us something about who we are. It is incumbent upon all of us who were not Donald Trump supporters to work for the success of this country and the continuation of the values and institutions we hold dear. We will survive.

Re "A Splintered Nation in Suspense as Millions of Votes Are Tallied" (front page, Nov. 6):
As it turns out, the nation was not so splintered after all; it was poised for a Republican wave.
Not only did Republicans gain strength in virtually every region of the country, they also secured millions of new votes from traditionally Democratic groups including Hispanic, Black and young people. The only question now is whether the Democratic Party and many in the national media will learn from this election and expand their understanding of the American electorate and what drives American democracy.
A good analogy is the 1980 presidential election, when Ronald Reagan stunned political and media elites by dramatically expanding the Republican base and re-shifting the electoral map. Those who denied that the election was a true realignment against a lethargic Democratic Party found out the hard way with Reagan's 49-state historic landslide in 1984.
Since the Obama years, the Democratic Party has moved further and further to the left on economic, environmental and cultural issues, but was able to rely on the foil of Donald Trump and concerns over the "death of democracy" to stay competitive in national elections.
The 2024 election put a definitive halt to the march of those policies, and to the Democrats' fear-driven electoral strategy. New (and healthy) coalitions are forming in American politics that want government to get back to traditional concerns such as economic mobility, secure borders and safe streets. Democrats and their political allies ignore this new reality at their own peril.

To the Editor:
It's a sad day. The southern border and the price of eggs beat democracy and abortion.
Core values mattered, but not enough. I'm not surprised. I am thoroughly disgusted, but it proves once again that liberals in today's world just don't get it. The Democrats were on the wrong side of a harsh reality: A Black and South Asian woman was not going to win over voters who don't give a damn about democratic ideals when Frosted Flakes can cost $ 10.
Kamala Harris didn't convince enough people that she really represented a fresh start with an understandable plan to better people's everyday lives.
We make choices, and we'll have to live with this one for four more excruciating years.
Peter Alkalay

To the Editor:
This foreign observer feels as though an old friend who has been ailing for several years has died.
To quote the songwriter Joni Mitchell: "Don't it always seem to go that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?"
May American democracy rest in peace ...
Ken Cuthbertson

To the Editor:
The pundits and political analysts are spouting a plethora of reasons we now, again, have to endure Donald Trump being our president. Let me add one more: an individual who should bear a lot of responsibility, but likely accepts none. That person is Merrick Garland, the attorney general of the United States.
Had he not inexplicably dragged his feet for almost two years before moving forward with a special counsel to investigate Mr. Trump, the former president could have faced prosecution for his role in inciting the onslaught at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
If he had been tried, convicted and perhaps incarcerated, his further political ambitions would likely have been obliterated. So, Attorney General Garland, your judicial timidity is going to cost this country dearly.
Ken Derow

To the Editor:
Perhaps the sole consolation of Donald Trump's victory is the likelihood that there will be no civil unrest in the wake of the election. What a sad commentary on the state of the nation.
Michael Silk

To the Editor:
Act I of Shakespeare's play "Richard III" starts with Richard saying, "Now is the winter of our discontent."
I asked ChatGPT to paraphrase the full quote so as to reflect what actually happened in America on Tuesday, after explaining the result of the election.
Below is what that A.I. algorithm came up with, in about three seconds. I think it strikes the right chord for the way I, and many millions of other Americans, feel now.
Now is the season of our fading light
Made shadowed gloom by one man's towering might;
And all the hopes that brightened up our past
Lie in the murky shroud of darkness cast.
If I were an English teacher, I would give ChatGPT an A+ for its work here.

A Model for Taking on Republicans in Red States: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The first person I met at a Monday night meet-and-greet for Dan Osborn, the independent Nebraska Senate candidate, was a Donald Trump-voting Republican named Joe Hallett. He'd worked, alongside his wife, Sherri, with Osborn at Omaha's Kellogg plant. Explaining Osborn's appeal, Joe said, "He's not a millionaire or anything like that." Sherri added: "He works hard. We did the same thing."
Neither was a fan of Osborn's opponent, the Republican senator Deb Fischer. "We were never impressed with her because she was never personable," said Sherri. "She was never around."
Osborn, by contrast, has been around a lot. The Monday event, at a cider house in Ashland, a town about 30 miles from Omaha, was one of more than 170 he's done all over the state. It drew a few dozen people -- more Democrats and independents than Republicans -- and Osborn stayed to talk and shake hands until the place closed. Afterward, I went with him to a nearby bar to talk about his surprisingly competitive race against Fischer, which has become an unexpected problem for Republicans as they seek to retake the Senate.
As we walked, a young opposition researcher who tracks Osborn at most of his events shouted questions about which presidential candidate he'd voted for in 2020, hoping to catch him on camera saying something damaging. Osborn refused to answer, just as he won't say whom he'll vote for in November, insisting that the heat of partisan politics makes substantive discussion of the issues impossible. When I asked him to name a politician in Washington he hoped to work with, he said he hadn't given the matter much thought.
The bar, with its brown walls, dropped ceiling and fluorescent overhead lights, was the apotheosis of Midwestern drab. Osborn, a tattooed Navy veteran and former union leader with a short gray beard, declared it his kind of place. As he nursed a Busch Light, I sensed he was eager to finish our interview and join Joe Hallett, who was waiting to catch up with him. But when I mentioned a book I'd heard Osborn talk about, "Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy," by the progressive writer Matt Stoller, he seemed to perk up.
"What that book taught me was this is not a new idea what we're doing here," he said of his campaign, which is focused on the predations of concentrated wealth. Ever since the Industrial Revolution, he said, corporations have sought to buy more and more political power, and though they succeed for a time, people eventually revolt. "I think that's where we're at right now," said Osborn. "We're at the apex of a corporate-run government."
At such moments, he said, people's frustrations inevitably reach a boiling point. "So they start electing a different government, a more populist message, because they know that their lives are getting harder and their government is not working for them."
The word "populist," as it happens, is tied up with Nebraska political history. It was coined to describe members of the People's Party, which held its first convention in Omaha in 1892, seeking to represent farmers and laborers against what it called the "power and plunder" of the two major parties. "I have read about the prairie populism, and I hope we can emulate that," said Osborn.
Osborn is still an underdog, but his mix of leftish economics and deep anti-elitism has already shaken up politics in bright-red Nebraska, making the Senate race far closer than almost anyone predicted. The Cook Political Report initially considered the seat "Solid Republican," but in late September it changed its forecast to "Likely Republican." The day I met Osborn, Cook shifted its rating another tick in Osborn's direction, to "Lean" Republican.
Though both the Fischer and Osborn camps have released internal surveys with their candidates leading, there have been only a couple of nonpartisan polls, the most recent of which showed Osborn up by 5 points. That was in early October, and it's entirely possible that it doesn't capture the current state of the race. But the G.O.P. is clearly concerned; as Semafor reported this week, the Senate Republicans' top super PAC is pouring $ 3 million into Nebraska to bolster Fischer in the race's final weeks.
If Osborn wins -- and maybe even if he doesn't -- his campaign will likely be seen as a model for running pro-worker candidates in places where majorities have drifted away from the Democratic Party. Democrats, like traditionally left-leaning parties across much of the developed world, have been losing working-class voters to the right, even as they attract more support from educated, cosmopolitan urbanites. Though Joe Biden has been the most pro-labor president in recent history, he's been unable to reverse this trend.
Now Osborn's campaign is testing a new approach to class politics. Can a message based on workers' rights and corporate greed win over red-state voters when it's decoupled from the cultural baggage that adheres, however unfairly, to the Democratic Party? "Ultimately I want people to see what we've done here, and to be able to do it in their states too," Osborn told me.
Osborn, who spent 20 years as an industrial mechanic at Kellogg, insists he was never particularly political until 2021, when, as president of his Omaha union, he started negotiating with management over a new contract. As essential workers during the Covid pandemic, he told the crowd at the cidery, he and his members had worked 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, at least when they weren't sick or stuck in quarantine. In 2020, Kellogg's sales and profits had risen, and its chief executive's compensation increased 20 percent to more than $ 11.6 million.
Osborn went into talks with management sure he and his fellow workers would "share a little sliver of the pie." Instead, he said, Kellogg tried to cut their health benefits and cost-of-living raises, and to expand a two-tier wage system in which new employees could be paid significantly less than existing ones. "That was my 'oh, crap' moment," he said.
When talks failed in October, Osborn led workers at his Omaha plant out on strike. "One of the hardest things I've ever had to do, leading 500 of my friends and their families out into the great unknown, not knowing if we were going to have a job at the end of it," he said. It lasted 77 days and ended with most of the strikers' demands being met.
Osborn no longer works at the plant; Kellogg fired him in 2023. The company accused him of watching Netflix on the job, but he believes it was retaliation. He retrained as a steamfitter, which was what he was doing last year when a union official named Jeff Cooley approached him about mounting an independent challenge to Fischer.
The senator, now running for her third term, had repeatedly enraged railroad workers, including by voting to thwart their ability to strike in 2022. The best way to oust her, union leaders believed, was to run an independent who could avoid getting bogged down in what Cooley called "wedge issues" that alienate social conservatives. If neither political party could come up with a viable pro-labor candidate, Cooley recalled thinking, "we'll find our own."
Nebraska's Democratic Party is not pleased about the way Osborn has bypassed it. Initially, he'd sought Democratic support, hoping to build a coalition that included Libertarians and some Republicans. Then the campaign's strategy changed, and he announced he wouldn't accept partisan endorsements. At that point, it was too late for Democrats to field their own candidate. Partly as a result, the Nebraska Democratic Party chair, Jane Kleeb -- a woman who has worked hard to rebuild the party's neglected rural infrastructure -- regards Osborn with deep distrust.
"Do I think the vast majority of Democrats are going to vote for him because they don't like Deb Fischer?" she asked. "Yes. Do I think he has a shot? Absolutely. Do I think he's being inauthentic? Yes. Do I worry that if he gets elected, that he's going to be Kyrsten Sinema, the person that destroys really good bills for their own ego? Absolutely."
But Osborn has different politics than Sinema, who regularly put the interests of her rich donors over those of her constituents. Though he insists he doesn't plan to caucus with either the Democrats or the Republicans, he shares many key Democratic priorities. Osborn wants to raise both corporate taxes and the minimum wage. Like Biden, he champions the PRO Act, which would make it easier to organize a union. On the stump, he attacks price gouging, an issue Kamala Harris has highlighted.
Nor is he entirely at odds with the Democratic Party on social issues. He's personally opposed to abortion, but he believes it should be legal. He's protective of Second Amendment rights but backs the sort of regulation often supported by urban police forces.
His differences with the party often seem less about policy than about vibes. Osborn said he felt "talked down to by the Democrats," a sentiment he believes many others share. While Republicans promise to protect people's paychecks, "the Democrats come in and say that you need to respect people's pronouns," he said. "People who are working 80 hours a week in meatpacking plants or on farms or anything else -- they're not too concerned about that."
This seems like a caricature -- I can't think of a single influential Democrat who talks about pronouns more than wages -- and I can see why it would infuriate Kleeb. But ultimately, a candidate who rejects Democratic branding seems infinitely preferable to one who rejects democratic principles.
"Imagine the ramifications on American politics if Nebraska elects an independent mechanic to the halls of power," Osborn said at the cidery.

An Independent Narrows the Gap in a Sleeper Nebraska Senate Race: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At a recent series of campaign stops in small-town Nebraska, Dan Osborn, the little-known labor leader and car mechanic who is running for Senate as an independent, made his pitch to voters in the form of an allegory about the mice who elect cats to represent them.
As Mr. Osborn tells it, the mice keep voting for different breeds of cats in the hope that one will make good on their promises to make things better, but none ever do. Eventually, the mice realize that their real problem is not which cat they elect -- it's that they keep electing cats in the first place.
"We have to stop electing cats," Mr. Osborn told about 50 supporters who had gathered in his campaign's new field office in downtown Kearney on a recent Sunday afternoon, one of four opened weeks before Election Day as part of a last-minute campaign sprint. "We are ruled by the millionaire and billionaire class that are inoculated from the very laws that they make."
The populist appeal -- in which members of both major political parties are cast as feline villains and Mr. Osborn as one of the preyed-upon rodents -- has helped propel his challenge to Senator Deb Fischer, a second-term Republican who until recently had appeared to be on a glide path to re-election. Now, polls show the two in a tightening race that could potentially sway the balance of power in the Senate.
Over the past two decades, Republicans have consolidated a near monopoly in the Great Plains, a shift across a stretch of prairie once dominated by Democrats that could become complete in November if Senator Jon Tester of Montana loses his seat.
But this year, Nebraska has thrown Republicans for a loop. Mr. Osborn's dark-horse, grass-roots campaign has transformed what was expected to be a sleepy race into a late-breaking and high-stakes clash that has forced Ms. Fischer and her allies to invest millions of dollars to avoid an upset.
In the Omaha suburbs, one of Republicans' most battle-tested incumbents in Congress, Representative Don Bacon, is facing stiff headwinds, thanks to his party's lurch to the right and his recent endorsement of eliminating a provision that awards an electoral vote to the party that wins his district. The result has been an influx of cash into Mr. Bacon's increasingly liberal district, leaving him in an uphill fight for political survival.
In the Senate contest, Mr. Osborn is tapping into a well of discontent with Congress and leaning on his status as a political newcomer and his background as a union laborer to appeal to working-class voters from across the political spectrum. He has eschewed any connection with Democrats, rejecting an endorsement from the Nebraska Democratic Party this year and insisting that he would not caucus with either party if elected.
That has not stopped Ms. Fischer from labeling him as a "Democrat in disguise." Mr. Osborn's deep experience in the labor movement -- he is best known for leading 500 of his workers out of a Kellogg's cereal plant in Omaha and onto a picket line -- and his support for codifying abortion rights into federal law seem to indicate that he would side with Democrats on at least some major economic and social issues.
Still, Mr. Osborn appears to be drawing interest among voters of different political stripes. At recent events, several attendees said they planned to vote for former President Donald J. Trump, and a few indicated they were supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris.
Ms. Fischer, a former school board member and state lawmaker whose family owns a cattle ranch, won both of her previous Senate races by double-digit margins and has kept a relatively low profile since taking office. She has voted multiple times to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Soon after taking office in 2013, she cosponsored the Life at Conception Act, which would have effectively outlawed all abortions without exception and aspects of certain fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization. Ms. Fischer, who praises the overturning of Roe v. Wade, has said in recent weeks that she would support exceptions to an abortion ban for cases of rape and incest and to protect the life of the mother.
Mr. Osborn, who enlisted in the Navy after high school and served in the Nebraska Army National Guard, has pitched himself as a consensus-builder across party lines. At his recent events, he described how he tried to make the Kellogg's strike a nonpartisan issue by persuading Mr. Bacon to walk the picket line with the workers and Pete Ricketts, the governor at the time, to write a letter to company executives urging them to make a deal. (Mr. Ricketts, a Republican and now Nebraska's junior senator, is expected to handily win a special election and retain the seat he was appointed to in 2023 after Senator Ben Sasse resigned.)
"I didn't see men or women, or Black or white, or Republican or Democrat out on the picket line," said Mr. Osborn, who was recruited to run by railroad unions in western Nebraska that turned against Ms. Fischer because of her backing for legislation that is favorable to the rail industry. "I just saw people that wanted to go to work for a fair wage and fair benefits."
When he jumped into the political fray last September, Mr. Osborn had little name recognition and even less money, and pundits and the news media had largely written off the race. But funding is no longer a barrier; his campaign hauled in close to $ 3.3 million last quarter and spent nearly all of it on advertising, according to federal filings.
As polls have shown Mr. Osborn closing the gap, Ms. Fischer and her Republican allies have been forced to pour millions of their own into the race. Two recent nonaffiliated surveys showed Mr. Osborn within a few points of Ms. Fischer. The Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, on Monday promised an additional $ 3 million in ad spending in the final two weeks before the election.
Ms. Fischer's campaign has called Mr. Osborn "simply too far left" and is running multiple ads that quote him saying that he "loves" Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent known for his progressive policies. (According to audio circulated by Republicans, Mr. Osborn apparently made the remark as a point of contrast as he discussed the need to appeal to conservatives.)
"Nebraskans support me because I've delivered results," Ms. Fischer, whose campaign did not respond to a request for an interview, said in a statement. "I have a long, conservative record that's helped build Nebraska and keep America strong."
Some of the Republican attacks on Mr. Osborn appear to be resonating with voters. Peter Rishel, a retired police officer who attended his event in Kearney, asked whether it was true that Mr. Osborn wanted to give Social Security cards to illegal migrants, a claim made in several of Ms. Fischer's ads.
Mr. Osborn chuckled before bluntly declaring that, no, he does not want "amnesty" for "people who come here unlawfully," nor does he want to give them Social Security benefits. He then criticized Ms. Fischer for voting twice against the bipartisan border bill led by Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, at the behest of Mr. Trump.
Mr. Rishel, who said he planned to vote for Mr. Trump, left the event intrigued by Mr. Osborn, who he said gave a "pretty impressive" pitch for how he would take on Washington elites. But Mr. Rishel said he was reluctant to vote against Ms. Fischer, whose office helped him and his wife navigate a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over their income tax refund.
"I just thought the world of her when she helped us," Mr. Rishel said. "And to step away from that -- God, that's a pretty big step."
Abortion could also play a role in the race. Nebraska voters face two competing ballot measures this year that would alter the state's abortion law, which bans the procedure at 12 weeks with exceptions for rape and incest and to protect the life of the mother. One of the proposals, which has garnered national support and funding from abortion rights groups, would enshrine the rights in the state Constitution up to the point of viability. The other would add a 14-week ban to Nebraska's Constitution.
During a swing through small towns in western Nebraska on a recent Sunday afternoon, after several voters asked for his stance, Mr. Osborn said he supported codifying the protections of Roe v. Wade into federal law.
"I don't believe it's my place or the government's place to tell people when they should or shouldn't start families, and that includes I.V.F. and contraceptives," Mr. Osborn told the crowd at his newly opened office in Grand Island.
Earlier that day, in response to a similar question from a voter in Hastings, Mr. Osborn said: "Bottom line is, since Roe's been overturned, women are dying. And I've got a problem with that."

Help for Harris? Send in the Juggalos.: [National Desk]

Full text: Endorsements, how do they work?
The clowns are for Kamala.
Violent J, who makes up one-half of the rap duo Insane Clown Posse, recently told an interviewer during a segment on "The Daily Show" that he supported Vice President Kamala Harris. His biggest issues: taxation of the poor, women's rights and incurring the wrath of his mother if he does not vote.
"I want her to win because she's a Democrat, and I love my mom," Violent J, a Detroit native, said in one of the few printable quotes from an expletive-laced interview that aired last week.
The celebrity endorsement from Violent J -- whose legal name is Joseph Frank Bruce -- might not be as coveted as, say, Taylor Swift's, but Insane Clown Posse has one of the most devoted fan bases in popular music. Up to two million people self-identify as fans, or Juggalos or Juggalettes, according to some assessments.
The group's supporters tend to be young, male, and disengaged from the political process, and they sometimes view themselves as outsiders. Those are the exact types of people both Ms. Harris and former President Donald J. Trump are trying to win over in a very tight race. Insane Clown Posse's roots in Detroit mean that Michigan, a key battleground state, is the heart of the Juggalo movement.
Which is not to say, of course, that clowns could decide the election.
Insane Clown Posse has a complicated history with the federal government. In 2014, the duo unsuccessfully sued the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation after the F.B.I.'s National Gang Intelligence Center classified Juggalos as "a loosely organized hybrid gang." The center cited episodes in which people suspected of being "Juggalo associates" had committed violent acts. The rap pair's argument was that they had been misunderstood.
Over the next 13 days, the race will be a mad scramble for undecided or tuned-out voters. Mr. Bruce may speak for at least a handful of them.
During the "Daily Show" interview, Mr. Bruce learned how to say the vice president's given name -- "Fresh," he said, when he mastered the pronunciation. He said he had grown to dislike Mr. Trump over his plans to build a border wall, and he offered his support for environmental issues: "Let me tell you what a superior animal is: a whale."
His was maybe the most unconventional endorsement in Ms. Harris's recent wave of celebrity support. On Tuesday evening, the rapper Eminem, another Detroit native, took the stage at a rally and urged Michigan residents to vote.
"I don't think anyone wants an America where people are worried about retribution," he told the crowd before throwing his support behind Ms. Harris and introducing the night's headliner, former President Barack Obama, who promptly rapped a few bars of Eminem's hit "Lose Yourself."
The value of a celebrity endorsement is difficult to measure. There is research that suggests Oprah Winfrey had a decisive influence in Mr. Obama's primary election success in 2008, driving as many as a million votes his way, according to a report by the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.
Enthusiasm in the diffuse age of social media is harder to gauge: Ms. Swift's endorsement in September drove about 406,000 people to Vote.gov, a government-run website with voter-registration tools, but that number does not mean that many people actually registered to vote.
"Almost anything can matter, but it probably won't," Mark Harvey, the author of "Celebrity Influence: Politics, Persuasion, and Issue-Based Advocacy," said in an interview. "We really only have one study that has indicated that an actual endorsement has made a difference, and that is Oprah. Most of the time, when you ask people when they're going to vote, it's going to be on the economy or party ID. It's not really about what Taylor Swift thinks."
On the effect of Eminem and Insane Clown Posse, two acts from a crucial swing state, Mr. Harvey added, "If I were Harris, I'd think, 'If I could strip any of those people away, I'm going to try to do it -- even if they're clowns."'
The Harris campaign on Wednesday did not immediately comment on the universe of endorsements, including the one from half of Insane Clown Posse. The other half, Joseph Utsler, who performs as Shaggy 2 Dope, has not said which candidate he supports.

To Marshal Women, Christian Conservatives Turn to a Biblical Queen: [National Desk]

Full text: Alarmed by abortion and transgender rights, Christian activists are invoking the Old Testament story of Esther, the Jewish orphan who bravely saved her people.
The biblical story of Esther, the Jewish orphan who became queen and bravely saved her people, has been a potent symbol for women and girls, a call to lead a life of courage, sacrifice and purpose.
Sojourner Truth invoked Esther as she fought for women's rights and civil rights. Hillary Clinton, when running for president in 2008, named Esther's story as a favorite. And prominent Black pastors have used her story to galvanize support for Vice President Kamala Harris as she seeks the White House.
On Saturday at the National Mall in Washington, the queen's story is being marshaled once again, this time by a group of conservative and largely charismatic Christians, who drew hundreds of followers to "A Million Women: an Esther Call to the Mall."
They hope to mobilize conservative Christian women, just weeks before the election, to turn America back to God -- and toward issues they care about, which also align with former President Trump's presidential campaign. Their goals include ending abortion, opposing transgender rights and supporting Israel.
"We just believe that there's a crisis," said Laura Zavala Allred, an organizer of the event. God, she said, has called modern-day Esthers "for such a time as this," referencing the story's most well-known phrase.
The morning began with a crowd of participants gathering and praying. Many waved flags that said, "Don't mess with our kids" and "Jesus." Organizers chose to hold the event on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, because it is a day to atone for sin.
Ronda Lamont, a rally participant who traveled from Fort Worth, Texas, and claimed that attempts at voting fraud were widespread, said that issue and "sexual sins" were among the main reasons that motivated her to travel to Washington. "The enemy has taken over the world," she said. "It's the end times."
In the grand scheme of politics, such an event might seem minor. Only about a fourth of the area reserved for the event was filled. But the gathering is the latest example of how partisan politics and Christian worship have blended in recent years. And it reflects the rising charismatic Christian movement, which sees world events as part of a cosmic battle between good and evil. With Esther as a touchstone, these Christian women, of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, are casting themselves as key players in a contemporary political and religious drama.
Only two books in the Bible, Esther and Ruth, are named after women. And Esther is the only book that does not name God. Instead, redemption comes through her actions.
In the story, Esther is an orphan and beautiful young woman, cared for by a relative named Mordecai, while the Jews are exiled in ancient Persia. The king, who is angry at his wife, picks Esther as his new queen. But she does not reveal she is Jewish.
When the king issues an edict to kill all the Jews, Mordecai begs Esther to intervene. "Who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?" he says. Afraid, she asks the Jews to fast for her success, saying, "If I perish, I perish." In the end, she saves her people.
Jews remember Esther during the holiday of Purim. Yet religious scholars note that over centuries, her story has been widely embraced because anyone can see themselves in Esther.
"How do you know that you are not alive in this moment to do something extraordinary?" said Erica Brown, vice provost at Yeshiva University, who has studied Esther. "There's something much larger in life for her than the beauty queen role."
Even in the darkest of times, her story suggests, hope comes from the unlikeliest places and people, even an orphan.
But that universal story can also lead to divergent interpretations. For some conservative Christians, Esther offers a model of what they see as appropriate female leadership. The Esthers, as the women organizing the event in Washington call themselves, cite the queen to amplify their own voice -- and define feminism on their terms -- at a moment when progressive women have been newly energized by the end of Roe v. Wade, and the prospect of the first female president.
Dehavilland Ford, a pastor in Fort Worth, Texas, led a six-month study of the book of Esther by Zoom this year for women interested in preparing for the Washington gathering.
For Ms. Ford, the story is one that every woman can relate to in some way. "She's an orphan, she's hiding her identity, she's a woman," she explained. The story suggests that "not one woman is disqualified from the calling of God."
The Washington gathering for Esther was organized primarily around prayer and fasting, but politics and social issues are integral to those prayers. At least one local Republican group from Virginia publicized the event.
Folake Kellogg, 52, had dreams of women rising up like Esther and fighting for their families, which prompted her to fly from Washington state to be part of the event.
She was horrified when Planned Parenthood offered free abortion medication at a mobile clinic near the Democratic National Convention. "As a Black African," she said, referencing her Nigerian heritage, she stood for the opposite. "The Esthers are ones with compassion for life."
"I am not going to be voting for someone that is having abortion that is on demand, I am not going to be voting for same-sex marriage," she said. "I am voting because I am an extension of God's kingdom."
The longtime activist and evangelist Lou Engle, who organized the Washington event, has invoked the queen in some of his large prayer gatherings and calls to fast for specific political outcomes. In 2018, he asked his followers to participate in an "Esther Fast" for the end of Roe v. Wade. After the 2020 election, he urged Christians to fast "for the exposure of voter fraud." In July, after Ms. Harris became the Democratic nominee, Mr. Engle called on Esthers to rise up, because "witches worldwide are cursing President Trump."
A spokesman said Mr. Engle, who was nearing the end of a 40-day fast, was not available for an interview. But Mark Gonzales, who leads the Hispanic Action Network and is the executive director for the Esther event, said that mothers are pushing back against the campaign for transgender rights.
"When they begin to touch the children, the mothers begin to rise up," he said. And in this battle, it is not only about the Esthers, he added. Men like him are key.
"There wouldn't be an Esther if there hadn't been a Mordecai," he said.
Another organizer, Jenny Donnelly, 49, an activist, evangelist and mother of five from Washington state, also said she has been thinking about Mordecai, specifically when he asked Esther to risk her life for her people. Once Esther assumed her role as queen, Ms. Donnelly said, Mordecai pushed her to use it for good.
To Ms. Donnelly, that story offers a lesson about leadership. She wants a movement that does not strip women of their power. At the same time, she said, she wants to see "a women's movement that does not disregard the place of men and strip them of their power."
Esther also speaks to Ms. Donnelly personally, as a story of redemption from trauma. Esther was an orphan; Ms. Donnelly's own father left the family when she was 6.
And just as Esther acted during a crisis, Ms. Donnelly said she was called to activism during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, when she watched schools and churches shut down in her hometown, Portland, Ore.
Today, she is worried about the number of Gen Z adults identifying as L.G.B.T.Q. and fears a future in which parents lose rights to their children if they oppose gender transitions.
Esther's story asks, "What if?" Ms. Donnelly said. "What if this whole crazy traumatic story is because you are going to actually save the Jews?"

The House That Malin+Goetz Built (And Built Again): [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After a fire ravaged a farmhouse owned by Matthew Malin and Andrew Goetz, the founders of the eponymous apothecary brand, the couple decided to recreate the structure.
The 200-year-old Greek Revival house in Chatham, N.Y., was crumbling, and the 187 acres surrounding it were overgrown. But Matthew Malin and Andrew Goetz, the founders of the modern apothecary brand Malin+Goetz, saw the potential for a perfect country life that had eluded them for years.
Their first rural outpost in nearby Kinderhook offered scant land to cultivate. A second house just south of Hudson, didn't feel quite like home for the both of them. But this one, the one that had laid fallow for three decades, was just right.
"We bought it because of the house," said Mr. Goetz, 62. It was a "gem," despite the decrepitude, according to Mr. Malin, 57. A contractor told the couple that the structure, with its heavy old oak internal framing and beams, would stand for two centuries more. The couple began renovations in 2021, preserving whatever they could: the doors, the floors and the antique handrail and newel post.
Move-in was just three weeks away when the couple received a devastating phone call on Oct. 26, 2022, as they headed to their Upper West Side apartment in a taxi after dinner with a beauty editor. "I don't know how to tell you this," Mr. Malin recalled the ominous first words from a farmer who helped them care for the property. "We were told there was no reason to drive up."
The restored house had been consumed by flames that lit up the night sky.
The next morning, they could still smell smoke. They snapped pictures of the smoldering pile, though Mr. Malin deleted them as shock blurred into numbness. Local fire officials did not respond to inquiries about the cause of the fire; the couple's insurance claim remains unresolved. "It was traumatic, he recalled. "We went through a series of emotions."
But they decided to rebuild. And after 18 months of focused construction, a farmhouse phoenix has risen 500 feet away from the original structure.
Freshly painted white and fitted with new mahogany shutters, this new old house is nearly finished. "I'm anxious, and excited to move in," said Mr. Malin.
All that remains -- the stacked-stone basement of the burned house -- is the site of the earliest completed act of recovery. The great timbers inset in the foundation retain a heavy char, a chic shou sugi ban finish achieved entirely by accident. The basement is now a verdant sunken garden spiked with unruly elderberry bushes.
"Gardening helps us decompress after time in the city," Mr. Malin said.
The couple, who have been romantic partners for three decades, have opened apothecaries from Larchmont to London and sell in most of the European Union, five Asian countries and Australia.
Together, Mr. Goetz and Mr. Malin named the property, with its swaying willows and a spring-fed pond thick with duckweed, Haroldhurst Farm -- after Harold van Goetz-Malin, their pug puppy, and as a riff on Sissinghurst Castle Garden, in South East England.
Getting to this point was an exercise in patience and persistence. The extensive renovations began here without illusions about potential roadblocks and delays -- which the couple knew to be as inevitable for houses as for the creation of Malin + Goetz, started 20 years ago in a storefront beneath their apartment in Chelsea.
The couple sells scented candles and no-nonsense luxury skin cleansers in unadorned packaging, sometimes with a wink. Their sought-after Cannabis fragrance, a spicy marijuana-free floral with black pepper and bergamot notes, hit stores in the era when smoking a joint was punishable by law.
Though their Upper West Side apartment exudes an urbane minimalism, rurality lets them unplug. Their first country house was the move-in-ready Greek Revival in Kinderhook that had little land to garden. Mr. Goetz deemed it too close to State Route 9H and pushed to sell. Mr. Malin agreed to move but never got over leaving. "It was filled with love," he said.
Next was 10 acres in the countryside several miles south of Hudson. Selling shares of their business to an investor funded restorations and additions. Andrew Bernheimer, the architect for a number of their apothecaries, made an airy, contemporary addition behind the antique house, yet another Greek Revival. Jim Joseph, of Hottenroth + Joseph Architects, undertook historical restoration of one Federal-era outbuilding.
Mr. Malin says he never felt strongly connected to the property. He proposed a "retirement" project, and Mr. Goetz was game, though he objected to the word retirement. "We love the creative process so much," he said.
Then along came what has become Haroldhurst: The land had ancient trees and a brook. There were dozens of acres of overgrown pasture that a tenant farmer now mows for hay. An old red barn offered footage to add a solarium and an exercise room on the ground floor.
The barn ended up being more important than they anticipated: For the last six months or so, they have bunked there with their pugs, also home to the only working toilet around. Visitors are encouraged to pee in the weeds anywhere they please on these 187 acres.
Their 18-month renovation was led by Mr. Joseph. Even with 80 percent of the surfaces replaced, Mr. Joseph said "it really did feel like an old house."
The couple ditched some outdated updates, like a mismatched family room addition still sporting "one of those bad 1970s stained glass windows," Mr. Malin said.
And then came the stunning phone call, freezing Mr. Goetz and Mr. Malin in the back of that cab. The fire wrecked their dream.
Mr. Goetz, with his professional reputation as a modernist, wondered if they should rebuild in a contemporary style or sell and start fresh elsewhere. Either would cost precious time. The men asked existential questions around rebuilding. Would it "look like a fake old house?" Mr. Malin asked. Maybe not, since the new materials of their restoration had mostly hidden its old oak structure. "Do I care whether a two-by-four is hundreds of years old, or 90 days old?" Mr. Goetz asked.
Mr. Joseph, who lost his own house in a fire, advised a prompt return to the plan he had developed for the original renovation. He said that "starting from scratch would have been too difficult" emotionally, as well as logistically.
Mr. Joseph relocated the house across the pond, on a knoll with superior exposures and views.
The old-growth pine floors are level "as opposed to rolling all over the map," he said.
The living room mantelpiece is architectural salvage, likely taken from a stately house in the Hudson Valley. Key elements blur boundaries between original and reproduction.
In a stroke of fortune, the handrail and newel post that greeted visitors for centuries were off-site for restoration and did not burn. Today they serve the replica stairs, right where they belong.
"This is lemonade from lemons, a silver lining," said John Hulka, a family friend and designer who helped Ralph Lauren create the Polo Bar in New York. Mr. Hulka had decorated the couple's Hudson house and is working with them in Chatham.
His casual new interiors, which measure around 3,000 square feet, may not have a wow factor. "We are going for an Aah factor," he said.
The farmhouse library walls, ceiling and trim will be drenched in Van Courtland Blue, a Benjamin Moore Historical Collection paint that evokes stormy skies. The dining room will get a Dutch-style brass vintage chandelier from Frederick P. Victoria & Son over the space-age vintage Saarinen dining table currently waiting in the barn solarium. Mr. Joseph may add plaster crown molding to match the living room.
The side door of the farmhouse was built with a window by the Connecticut cabinetmaker who recreated the dozens of other replica wood windows with double panes.
That door leads to a manicured one-acre kitchen garden with dinosaur kale, Macoun apple trees and 13-foot branching sunflowers, all laid out by Jamie Purinton, a local landscape architect the couple has employed for more than a dozen years.
Construction can't be finished fast enough for Mr. Goetz and Mr. Malin. Before they moved into the barn, they were in another temporary living situation. Once the farm is complete, maybe they can finally turn their attention to a planned Haroldhurst Farm lifestyle brand.
"I want my life back," said Mr. Goetz.
Yet life on Haroldhurst has presented the partners with a host of new opportunities.
"We've become obsessive gardeners, but how are we going to keep our fingernails clean?" Mr. Goetz asked.

Eric Adams Gives New Meaning to 'Frequent-Flier Program': [Op-Ed]

Author: Collins, Gail; Stephens, Bret

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gail Collins: Well, Bret, the mayor of New York is certainly in a ton of trouble. Any thoughts? I couldn't help noticing that a lot of Eric Adams's misdeeds seem to involve him getting cushy flights to places like Turkey and Sri Lanka. Remembering the scandal over Justice Clarence Thomas's super-luxe flights in a plane belonging to a billionaire named Harlan Crow.
Do you think young people contemplating a career in public service these days think of it as a way to avoid sitting in the middle seat while flying cross-country or cross-world?
Bret Stephens: Gail, I remember a lot of high-profile prosecutions of government officials that fell apart in court. The Alaskan senator Ted Stevens comes to mind, as does Ray Donovan, Ronald Reagan's secretary of labor, who asked, "Which office do I go to to get my reputation back?" after his acquittal on fraud and larceny charges.
So I'm not going to join the stampede calling for Adams's immediate resignation, particularly because his would-be interim successor, Jumaane Williams, the public advocate, is a democratic socialist. I also have to wonder whether accepting discounted airline tickets and sleeping in a nice hotel room are the kind of offenses that should bring down an elected mayor. As Liel Leibovitz wrote in Tablet, "Prosecuting New York City mayors for their proximity to one form or another of local corruption is like prosecuting bartenders for their proximity to gin."
Guessing you, uh, don't agree.
Gail: Well, prosecuting bartenders for their proximity to gin makes sense if the bartenders are drinking deeply from the cup.
Bret: Well, sure, though whether you're willing to fire and charge the bartender depends, also, on how much he's drinking -- and how well he mixes the drinks.
Gail: Adams is also charged with using $ 10 million in what were supposed to be public funds for his mayoral campaign.
Bret: A more serious charge, but the case is no slam dunk. Again, as an American, I believe in hearing out the defense.
Gail: As a New Yorker, I don't believe we deserve to be stuck with an indicted mayor. And I have faith that in a special election, which Williams would have to call almost immediately if Adams resigns soon, we'll pick somebody better. And that in the meantime we'll survive a few months of being governed by a left-leaning interim mayor.
Bret: Well, then I hope you're excited about Mayor Andrew Cuomo.
In other news, Kamala Harris paid a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border last week. She seems to have changed her mind on building the border wall. Has she changed yours?
Gail: When it comes to the border, I don't think Kamala Harris's basic position has changed.
Bret: Uh oh.
Gail: Much of it was included in a bipartisan bill that offered a sensible solution -- and which Donald Trump demanded the Republicans kill off.
Bret: Except that the solution turned out to be an executive order Joe Biden issued earlier this year -- and which he could have issued three years ago.
Gail: Now, of course, Harris is desperate to look as moderate as possible on immigration issues. The solution -- which is obviously never going to be perfect -- involves more spending for Border Patrol to secure the border and counseling for people who do make it across as to their legal rights.
The wall was always a stupid idea, but the current version is just a modest, unnecessary project funded by money Trump had already gotten appropriated. The megamonster he campaigned for is nowhere in sight and never will be.
What's your reaction to all this?
Bret: The wall is an imperfect idea -- migrants have other ways of slipping across our borders, usually by just overstaying their visas -- but a necessary one. It would deter a lot of dangerous border crossings and encourage migrants to seek legal entry. It would improve the security of Americans living close to the southern border. And it would tamp down the populist fury over the perception of a virtually open border. Harris should say, "When the facts change, I change my opinion. What do you do, sir?"
Gail: I do wish you could join that speech-writing team.
Bret: Well, I'm plagiarizing John Maynard Keynes.
Now that I think about it, here's what she should also say: that she'd appoint Stanley McChrystal, the retired general who just endorsed her in a Times guest essay, as secretary of Homeland Security, and James Stavridis, the retired admiral and NATO commander, as director of central intelligence, and retired admiral Bill McRaven as secretary of defense. With that, she could add one more New York state vote -- namely, mine -- to her tally.
Gail: OK, Bret. I was going to try to avoid nagging you about that, but you've opened the door. Appreciate that you're considering supporting her, but that does seem to be a heck of a long list of very specific demands.
Bret: Naming that kind of team right now would put Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Ali Khamenei immediately on notice that America under a Harris administration is not to be messed with. Democrats who aren't ultra-lefties should be stoked for that lineup. I'd add Jamie Dimon's name as Treasury secretary, but maybe I'm pressing my luck.
Gail: While the presidential race keeps chugging along, people are starting to take note of the very big problems Democrats are going to have hanging on to the Senate. Are you rooting for a President Harris immobilized by a Republican upper chamber?
Bret: I'm a fan of divided government. I'd feel the same way if Trump were to win -- I'd want at least one house of Congress to be controlled by Democrats. Preferably the Senate, since the thought of MAGA judges freaks me out.
But, you know, holding on to the Senate means supporting Democratic candidates who can appeal to Trump voters. In other words, people more in the mold of Joe Manchin than Elizabeth Warren. Are you OK with that?
Gail: My reservations about the extremely malleable Senator Manchin were less about his love of the middle road than the financial investments he had in the West Virginia coal industry that benefited from public policies he had some influence over.
If Democrats find a candidate in a swing state who can compromise his way into office without embracing anything appalling, obviously I'm game. We both like Sherrod Brown in Ohio, right? But lately he's been losing some of his lead in a race against a wealthy Republican opponent.
Bret: I have faith that gifted, decent, relatable Sherrod Brown will pull it out, though Bernie Moreno, his Trumpy opponent, has moved up in the polls and Ohio is an ever-redder state. I'm also hoping for an upset in the Senate race in Texas: I'd love to see the Democratic candidate, Colin Allred, in the Senate, but what I'd love so much more is to see Ted Cruz not.
Gail: Texas, I know you're a very right-leaning state. But everybody knows Ted Cruz is awful in every possible way. Including sneaking off on vacation to Mexico while his fellow Texans were suffering from a crippling utility outage. Really, this is the easiest possible moment to do what's right.
Bret: My all-time favorite comment about Cruz comes from the (sadly former) senator Al Franken: "I like Ted Cruz more than most of my other colleagues like Ted Cruz. And I hate Ted Cruz."
Gail: What about over in Nebraska, Bret? Any interest in that race? The incumbent Republican senator, Deb Fischer, isn't particularly controversial, and that's a red state. But her opponent, Dan Osborn, seems to be doing pretty well running as an independent working guy who led a successful strike against a big Kellogg plant.
Know how you love those union heroes, hehehehe. Any thoughts?
Bret: I know zippo about Nebraska politics. All I know is that somewhere in the middle of the state, just off Interstate 80, there's a gas station with a sign that says, "YOU ARE NOWHERE." Which feels like the most honest place in America.
Gail, we have to say a word about the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. For all of my bellyaching about big government, I'm grateful for the work of people in agencies like FEMA, bringing relief to the areas that have been hit hard.
Gail: Thanks, Bret. Of course our hearts go out to the victims who've lost everything from loved ones to homes to employment. And yes, you're right: These are the times when we're most proud and happy to see big government at work, and the marvelous people who do the job.
I do appreciate it when you take that road. Maybe it's another good sign about your vote in November.
Whoops. Wasn't going to go there. Take the final, please.
Bret: It's fun to end our conversations by pointing our readers to a terrific story in The Times. And nothing I've read in the last few days has moved me so deeply as Shawn McCreesh's beautifully crafted report on Beverly Aikins, better known as JD Vance's mom. Aikins's life was scarred by years of addiction. It's been redeemed by a decade of sobriety. Whatever one thinks of her son's politics, her story deserves attention, honesty and empathy. Shawn offered a journalistic master class -- hardly his first -- in how to tell it right.

Building a World Out of Beads: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Author: Ryzik, Melena

Publication info: Ryzik, Melena. 

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/building-world-out-beads/docview/3111035332/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A gun, a bottle of Jack Daniels, a splatter, a million beads. With these details, the California artist Liza Lou tells you stories. And just a minuscule bead, she explains, is like an underlined word: it can focus your attention, and slow you down.
"Beads highlight what is ordinary and make you look at it," said Lou, known for her life-size beaded sculptural installations, including "Kitchen" (1991-96), in the collection of the Whitney Museum, and "Back Yard," acquired in 2002 by the Fondation Cartier. She was speaking recently in front of "Trailer," another massive construction, originally made 25 years ago and filled with tens of millions of Czech glass beads. It just arrived at the Brooklyn Museum.
Lou, 55, has reached a turning point in her career, as she transitions from the objects that put her on the map -- the Museum of Modern Art recently acquired a beaded teacup and saucer -- into more abstract work, all created with her favorite material, which she called "tiny messengers of pigment, dot size expressions of joy."
Carmen Hermo, a curator who worked on the "Trailer" installation, said, "There is a tenderness to the attention that Liza pays" to every detail and bead placement. The meticulousness of works like "Trailer," she added, "just kind of messes with your mind. There's something so everyday but also very uncanny about it."
Lou, a feminist artist and art school dropout who received a MacArthur Foundation ("genius") grant in 2002, started her career thinking big and small simultaneously, with "Kitchen," a full-scale replica -- down to the dishes in the sink; an actual refrigerator; a box of Frosted Flakes -- composed of perhaps 30 million cylindrical beads, according to one estimate. She created it entirely solo, beginning in 1991; it took five years to complete.
It was followed by "Back Yard" and then by "Trailer," the final piece of what she sometimes thinks of as an Americana trilogy. It asks questions about whose labor is valued, and how; about self-sufficiency and isolation; about gender and power. It is also winningly flecked with humor, rewarding close observation.
"Trailer," which Lou worked on from 1998-2000, fills a 35-foot-long midcentury Spartan Royal Mansion mobile home. The museum had to remove its back doors to roll it into place. A gift of the collectors Sherry and Joel Mallin -- he is a trustee -- it will be on view in the lobby indefinitely.
Its grayscale interior tells a very different story from the primary colored, Pop Art-esque delights of "Kitchen" and "Back Yard." It is more narrative and masculine, by design.
It's also a league away from the abstract expressionist bead-laden paintings in her sold-out exhibition at Lehmann Maupin, on view in its Chelsea gallery through Oct. 12.
In Lou's mind, if you look out the window of "Kitchen," past "Back Yard," maybe down an alley, you'll see "Trailer." She bought it from some desert homesteaders, in part for its shape -- "really, a little sinister," she said.
In America, she said, "it turns out that often trailers are the last place a person lives. " (This one, she noted, has a particular coffin shape.)
Once she cleaned it out, she began to think: "Well, what happened in here? Who lived here?"
"I wasn't going to just be talking about leisure," she added. "I was going to be talking about loss."
"My material tends to get people all kind of giddy," Lou said. "Like this 'Ya -- hoo! Cocoa Puffs' kind of reaction to the beads. And I wanted to just drain all that and sort of take the viewer by the hand through a darker and darker place."
"The darker place was in the 'Kitchen' and those other works too," she continued, just "not quite so apparent."
Lou doesn't sketch much, but she may first paint her patterns out. Often working on her hands and knees, she lays strands of beads on a glue-covered surface, painstakingly pushing them into place with a toothpick. "To me, it doesn't feel intense," she said. "In my head when I'm doing this, I feel like I'm making sweeping gestures -- like I'm skydiving."
"It's a sense of fascination," she went on. "Like, how could you physically do that? How would you put this tiny material on an entire 35-foot-long room? That sounds impossible, and really hard. And then there's this big piece of me that's like, 'Hell yeah, let's do that!' It's just crazy how much fun it is to me. It's funny to me that it's weird to people."
Lou had some assistance for bigger parts, like the walls -- a "surreal wood panel," she called it. The flooring throughout the trailer is based on an Egyptian pattern. Even in monochromatics, the glint of beads gives everything an almost Vegas pizazz. "I love pattern," she said, citing Henri Matisse's shapes and the wit of Marcel Duchamp as inspirations.
"I think about the beads themselves almost in a literary sense -- word by word, sentence by sentence," she added.
The portrait she was building was of a solitary person whose objects -- hunting gear, girlie magazines, booze -- suggest a stereotypical macho-ness. It's all so palpably lifelike, it seems as if smoke could rise from the ashtray.
Until "Trailer" she had never put a human form in her work. Then she added a leg with an Oxford shoe in the bedroom, a revolver nearby, the sound and light of an old film noir blaring behind a door. She was circumspect about what the scene represented.
"I think that as an artist, you're dealing with your own mortality," she said, "in the making and describing of a certain life." The object she's most proud of in "Trailer" is a typewriter, surrounded by crumpled paper, and a handwritten note: "Keep your eyes on the road to liberty." Strung together, the tableau was a tale too.
"All the furniture is built, it's all papier-mâché. You can't sit on anything in the trailer. It is an actual bottle of Jack. I'm not going to say whether or not I drank it."
Applying a delicate material like a seed bead to a weapon -- "Trailer" is filled with blades and guns -- made her laugh. "It's twisted," she said. "It's wrong. It shouldn't be done."
Lou began experimenting with abstract images, the focus of her gallery show of framed canvases that combine beads and paint, after she returned from almost a decade in South Africa, where she worked with a female collective of bead artisans. Back home in Los Angeles, she thought she was done with the material; she donated her entire 30-year collection to her studio team. But they kept cropping up, including in a shipment of her belongings from South Africa: totally new beads. "They keep stalking me," she said, pointing to a gold orb wedged into the grooves in her sneaker sole.
For her show at Lehmann Maupin, she mixed Japanese glass beads with paint and applied them with a brush, building undiluted "strokes" of beaded color and texture that was quickly permanent.
"I'm trying to make the heroics of painting even more heroic," she wrote in her artist's statement. Like Jackson Pollock, she didn't premeditate, letting pigment land where it might -- her own commentary on the male stars of 1950s Abstract Expressionism, where, she joked, "every brush stroke is a penis."
Viewed closely, her work looks organic, like a vibrant coral reef that teems with hidden life, and some resembled the emotionally intense brushstrokes of Joan Mitchell.
Lou sees a connection between the decades-old "Trailer" and her newest paintings, which she was itching to get back to making in her studio in Joshua Tree, Calif. "It's like taking masculinity with a twinkle in your eye," she said.
When Lou started out, the divide between what was considered art and craft was still bright. "Why wasn't Native American basketry looked at, taken seriously and understood?" she said. "Why weren't they seen as the first abstract artists?"
While she never borrowed directly from Native American traditions, "I certainly was arguing for its importance through using beads," she added. "I'm saying, this is just as valid as paint."
And it's more elemental than that. Examining paint under a microscope, Lou saw clusters that, she said, "look just like beads" -- or like micro-organisms, cellular life itself.
"It turns out that everything, underneath, looks like a bead."

Democrats Maintain Narrow Path For Keeping Control of the Senate: [National Desk]

Author: Weisman, Jonathan

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Strong showings in new Times/Siena College polls leave a narrow path open for Democrats to keep hold of the chamber, but Republicans maintain an advantage with the map.
Democratic Senate candidates in the Upper Midwest states of Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin hold leads over their Republican competitors, keeping a narrow path open to maintaining Democratic control of Congress's upper chamber next year, according to new New York Times/Siena College polls.
And, in a surprise that could shake up the Senate battlefield, Dan Osborn, a union organizer and industrial mechanic running as an independent, has jumped to a strong lead in Nebraska's Second Congressional District, in and around Omaha, over the incumbent Republican, Senator Deb Fischer, reaching a level of support that could keep him competitive in the heavily Republican state.
The showing in the Midwest is a testament to the ability of Democrats, as well as Mr. Osborn, to separate the Senate contests from the presidential race, and keep control of the chamber in play. Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, veteran incumbents, have created political brands that appear to be independent of their national party, while in Michigan, Representative Elissa Slotkin may be drafting on the strength of Democratic women in her state who occupy the posts of governor, attorney general and secretary of state.
In Ohio, Mr. Brown leads his Republican challenger, Bernie Moreno, 47 percent to 43 percent, drawing in 10 percent of voters that support former President Donald J. Trump and 13 percent of those self-identified as Republicans. Ms. Baldwin leads her Republican challenger, the banker Eric Hovde, 50 to 43, in Wisconsin, while Ms. Slotkin leads the former congressman Mike Rogers, 47 percent to 42 percent, in the race to succeed Michigan's retiring Democratic senator, Debbie Stabenow.
The strong showing by Democratic Senate candidates does not necessarily mean the party will maintain control of the chamber next year. Their current one-seat majority is almost certainly lost, with the retirement of Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and the near certainty that the state's Republican governor, Jim Justice, will succeed him.
Democrats, lead by Vice President Kamala Harris, would need to hold the White House and win every other endangered Democratic Senate seat -- including Senator Jon Tester's, in deep red Montana, potentially the deciding race -- to preserve a 50-50 split, with a Vice President Tim Walz breaking the tie. Or, Democratic candidates need to pull off an upset against an incumbent Republican, such as Ted Cruz in Texas or Rick Scott in Florida.
On that front, the New York Times/Siena College polls offered another tantalizing data point regarding Senate control: In Eastern Nebraska, Mr. Osborn, a political newcomer, is leading Ms. Fischer, 49 percent to 38 percent. That might be enough to keep his long-shot bid competitive in a suddenly important statewide campaign.
Republicans had high hopes for the Senate race in Michigan, where they got the mainstream candidate they had wanted. Mr. Rogers is an Army veteran, former special agent in the F.B.I. and former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
But Ms. Slotkin, who like Mr. Rogers comes from the mid-Michigan region around Lansing, made her career appealing to centrist voters in that swing House district, and she continues to draw 6 percent of likely voters in Michigan who say they will vote for Mr. Trump and 7 percent who say they voted for Mr. Trump in 2020.
Reginald Gooden, 66, who identified himself as a semiretired health care professional, in Commerce Township, Mich., said he was backing Mr. Trump reluctantly, because he is "singularly" worried about how Ms. Harris would handle autocrats abroad. But, he said, he is a moderate, and likes Ms. Slotkin's politics.
"There's a sense of balance with her," he said.
In Ohio, where Mr. Trump holds a comfortable lead over Ms. Harris, Mr. Brown is in need of even more ticket splitters to beat Mr. Moreno, a wealthy, Colombian-born businessman who prevailed in a brutal Republican primary in March on the strength of Mr. Trump's endorsement. Republicans knew that Mr. Brown would draw some Republican support, but figured there just would not be enough Trump-Brown voters in 2024 to secure his re-election.
So far, they appear to be wrong.
In addition to the 10 percent of Trump voters who say they plan to vote for Mr. Brown, the senator is showing strong support in Ohio's suburbs and enjoys a 21-percentage point lead among women, in a state where 57 percent voted last December to enshrine abortion rights in the Ohio constitution.
"There's a lot of work that's been done before, you know for the local people," said Victoria Williams, 42, a Trump supporter and quality manager at a steel manufacturer in Centerville, Ohio, explaining her support for Mr. Brown. "He's done a lot for, I don't want to say this badly, but for the poor, the working class."
Mr. Moreno's 16-point lead among men -- 54 percent to 38 percent -- is not enough to close the gender gap.
The polls were taken just as a recording came to light of Mr. Moreno suggesting that abortion rights shouldn't concern women over the age of 50 -- "I don't think that's an issue for you," he said on tape, in Warren County, Ohio, last weekend.
In Wisconsin, the gender gap is even more stark. Mr. Hovde made mistakes early in the campaign, suggesting, for instance, that "almost nobody in a nursing home is at a point to vote." Ms. Baldwin's campaign used that quote, plus a comment that overweight people should pay more for health insurance and another that "the old physical toil" of farming had given way to "largely driving around on a tractor," to paint her opponent as a rich, out-of-touch Republican from Southern California.
According to the polls, Ms. Baldwin leads Mr. Hovde among women by 29 percentage points, holds a lead among white voters -- a rarity for Democrats in their campaigns this year -- and is taking about 5 percent of voters who say they cast their ballots in 2020 for Mr. Trump. Her lead among independents is 51 percent to 39 percent.
It isn't just women who say they feel insulted by Mr. Hovde.
"Some of the stuff that I've seen from Tammy Baldwin I like," said Paul Markunas, 55, of Harris, Wis., who owns a post-construction cleaning company, "and some of the things he has said I really don't like."
Mr. Markunas said he will be voting for Mr. Trump and Ms. Baldwin.
In Nebraska, Democrats should not get too excited yet about the prospect of the unexpected defeat of Ms. Fischer. Mr. Osborn has guarded his independence in a state that is hostile to Democrats, refusing to say which party he would caucus with if elected. And even his 11-point lead in the state's second district may not be enough unless he can make inroads in the heavily Republican first and third districts. The Times/Siena poll did not canvas the entire state.
But for an underfunded candidate whose main political experience was leading a strike against Kellogg's in 2021, Mr. Osborn is showing remarkable strength. Running as a blue-collar mechanic, he is leading in Nebraska's purple second district among women and men and among voters without a college degree. He is also taking 12 percent of the Republican vote.
"He's gaining strength in Nebraska," said Linda Lough, 74, a retired human resources manager in Omaha who supports Mr. Osborn as well as the Republican senator, Pete Ricketts, who is running in a special election for the state's other Senate seat. "I think he's just very straightforward, he's really a working man and he understands problems that working people have."
Mr. Osborn's campaign manager, Dustin Wahl, said the candidate has made inroads into the more heavily Republican districts. That has been enough this week to prompt the first surge of attack ads of the race from Ms. Fischer.
Without a political party behind him, Mr. Osborn has been able to raise only about $ 1.6 million compared to Ms. Fischer's $ 6.3 million. He also rejected the endorsement of the state's Democratic Party, depriving himself of institutional support.
But for an incumbent Ms. Fischer has kept a low profile. With Mr. Osborn's pitch claiming that the Senate needs a true working-class voice, he has been able to hang close enough in the few statewide polls that prognosticators have begun hedging their bets on an easy re-election for Ms. Fischer.
Here are the key things to know about these polls
Interviewers spoke with 688 likely voters in Michigan, 687 likely voters in Ohio, 680 likely voters in Wisconsin and 680 likely voters in Nebraska's Second Congressional District from Sept. 21 to 26, 2024.
Times/Siena polls are conducted by telephone, using live interviewers, in both English and Spanish. Overall, about 97 percent of respondents were contacted on a cellphone for these polls. You can see the exact questions that were asked and the order in which they were asked here.
Voters are selected for the survey from a list of registered voters. The list contains information on the demographic characteristics of every registered voter, allowing us to make sure we reach the right number of voters of each party, race and region. For these polls, interviewers placed nearly 260,000 calls to just over 140,000 voters.
To further ensure that the results reflect the entire voting population, not just those willing to take a poll, we give more weight to respondents from demographic groups that are underrepresented among survey respondents, like people without a college degree. You can see more information about the characteristics of respondents and the weighted sample at the bottom of the results and methodology page, under "Composition of the Sample."
The margin of sampling error among likely voters is about plus or minus four percentage points for each poll, and about plus or minus 2.5 percentage points when the three state polls are joined together. In theory, this means that the results should reflect the views of the overall population most of the time, though many other challenges create additional sources of error. When the difference between two values is computed -- such as a candidate's lead in a race -- the margin of error is twice as large.

Political Protests Land Hong Kong Men in Prison: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Three men were the first to be convicted under the city's recently expanded national security law, which has greatly curtailed political speech.
Wearing a T-shirt with a protest slogan.
Scrawling pro-democracy graffiti on public bus seats.
Criticizing Xi Jinping on social media.
Three men in Hong Kong were sentenced to prison last week for these acts of protest, which in another era probably would have drawn little notice -- showing the power of a newly expanded national security law aimed at muzzling dissent.
The rulings, rendered over two days by a judge whom Hong Kong's leader handpicked, highlight the political transformation that has taken place here.
A financial center and a city accustomed to freedom of political expression, Hong Kong now more closely resembles mainland China, where criticism of the ruling Communist Party is rarely, if ever, tolerated.
China agreed to preserve Hong Kong's "lifestyle" for 50 years after the territory's return to Beijing from British colonial rule in 1997 under a "one country, two systems" formula. But demands for greater democracy, culminating in antigovernment demonstrations that engulfed the city in 2019, led to a political crackdown that has eliminated virtually all public opposition to Beijing. A once freewheeling news media has also been silenced. Two editors who led the now-defunct Stand News were the first journalists in decades to be convicted of sedition.
"We are still in the midst of the national security reordering of the civic space in Hong Kong," said Thomas Kellogg, executive director of the Georgetown Center for Asian Law. "Public debate and discussion is a shadow of its former self, and the government will continue to use its national security tool kit to police what people say and write."
First Convictions Under New National Security Legislation
The three men were the first to be convicted and sentenced to prison under the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance, which was passed in March at the behest of Beijing by a legislature lacking any opposition lawmakers. The legislation had previously been shelved for two decades because of fierce local opposition.
Sometimes referred to as Article 23, the ordinance augments an existing national security law imposed by China in 2020 in response to the protests a year earlier. At least 303 people have been arrested, and 176 individuals and five companies charged, under both laws, according to Hong Kong's Security Bureau.
The Safeguarding National Security Ordinance targets political crimes like treason and insurrection, imposing penalties that include life imprisonment. It also covers offenses such as "external interference" and theft of state secrets.
The three were all convicted under a part of the ordinance targeting sedition, which the law describes as "hatred, contempt or disaffection" for China and the Hong Kong government. It replaced a colonial-era anti-sedition law by increasing penalties to as much as seven years in prison, up from two. If the person "colludes with an external force" the sentence can be as long as 10 years.
Pleading Guilty to Slogans
The first man sentenced last week was Chu Kai-pong, 27, arrested in June at a subway station for wearing a T-shirt that said, "Free Hong Kong" in English and "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times," a popular protest slogan, in Chinese. Mr. Chu pleaded guilty and received a 14-month prison sentence from Chief Magistrate Victor So Wai-tak, one of more than two dozen judges believed to have been selected by Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee to handle national security cases.
Shortly after Mr. Chu's ruling, Judge So sentenced Chung Man-kit to 10 months in jail for scrawling "seditious" graffiti on public bus seats between March and April. Mr. Chung, 29, pleaded guilty to writing slogans such as "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times" and "Hong Kong independence, the only way out." Mr. Chung told the police investigating his case that he wrote the slogans believing he had the right to criticize the government because of free speech protections.
The day after Mr. Chung's sentencing, Au Kin-wai, 58, pleaded guilty to "knowingly publishing publications that had a seditious intention" on social media. Mr. Au, who had no more than 20 online followers, got a 14-month sentence for his crime, which included hundreds of antigovernment posts on Facebook, YouTube and X.
Mr. Kellogg said, outside of vandalism, the three men's offenses would not be considered "legally actionable in most other, rights-respecting jurisdictions" because they would be deemed acceptable political speech.
Setting an Example
Judge So and the Hong Kong government said the men's actions were aimed at stirring hatred and contempt for the authorities, and that their convictions needed to deter others.
"If the law does not intervene early and individual inciting behaviors are condoned, the cumulative effect will eventually cause society to fall into chaos again," Judge So said in Mr. Chu's ruling.
The Hong Kong government said in a statement that the convictions showed that "clear lines" had been drawn between "unlawful seditious acts and expressions, and lawful constructive criticisms under the Safeguarding National Security Ordinance."
Legal experts, however, said any criticism of the government could now be considered risky.
"The authorities," said Eva Pils, a professor in international human rights law at FAU Nuremberg, Germany, "have constructed a tight net to catch everyone."

Three men in Hong Kong were sentenced to prison last week for these acts of protest, which in another era probably would have drawn little notice — showing the power of a newly expanded national security law aimed at muzzling dissent.

Is the Secret to a Longer Life Hidden in a Transplant Drug?: [National Desk]

Full text: Rapamycin is typically prescribed as an immunosuppressive, but off-label users believe it can do much more.
In March, Robert Berger, 69, a self-proclaimed "better-living-through-chemistry type of person," started taking a small dose of rapamycin once a week with the goal of increasing his "health span" -- the amount of time he might live without serious disease.
Rapamycin is typically prescribed to organ transplant patients to suppress their immune systems. But many scientists and longevity seekers like Mr. Berger think the drug can do much more than that: They say it can delay aging and age-related diseases.
Mr. Berger, who lives in Saratoga, Calif., learned about rapamycin through a friend who runs Rapamycin News, an online forum for people who experiment with the drug. He said he hasn't experienced any "'Oh my God, I'm a different person' kind of change" since taking it, though his dentist remarked that his gums looked healthier than they had in a long time, and he feels like he has more energy these days. But he admits "it's really hard to tell: How much is this placebo?"
On podcasts, social feeds and forums devoted to anti-aging, rapamycin is hailed as the "gold standard" for life extension. Longevity influencers Dr. Peter Attia and Bryan Johnson are believers, both saying they've taken rapamycin for years, and touting research to their millions of followers that shows the drug can extend the life spans of mice by over 20 percent.
There isn't data on how many people use rapamycin for anti-aging purposes, since the drug is taken off label or purchased from overseas providers. Like Mr. Berger, some of the other users interviewed for this article said they believed rapamycin has provided mild benefits, such as helping them lose weight, alleviating their aches and pains or even causing them to regrow dark hair years after going gray.
But while users are optimistic and the evidence that rapamycin can increase longevity in animals is promising, the research in humans is thin and long-term side effects are uncertain. In the few studies in which rapamycin has been compared to a placebo, tangible benefits are hard to come by.
Why all the hype?
Scientists first learned about the longevity-enhancing potential of rapamycin, also called sirolimus or Rapamune, in 2006, when a study showed that it could extend the life span of yeast. Enthusiasm mounted three years later, when another group of researchers found that mice given the drug lived roughly 12 percent longer.
Other medications had been tested for their possible anti-aging properties as part of a National Institute on Aging research program, but "rapamycin was the first one that actually made a difference in longevity and health span in both male and female mice," said Dr. Dean Kellogg Jr., a professor of medicine and geriatrics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.
After that came studies in worms, flies and more mice -- almost all showing that rapamycin extended life span.
"The demonstration that you could get the same effect across broad evolutionary distance -- yeast, worms, fruit flies, mice -- that really got people believing that this was something important and fundamental," said Matthew Kaeberlein, who published the first study on rapamycin in yeast while he was a researcher at the University of Washington. (He is now the chief executive officer at Optispan, a longevity startup.)
Preliminary data presented earlier this year at the American Aging Association annual meeting suggested that rapamycin also works in closer cousins to humans: Marmosets given the drug showed roughly a 10 percent increase in life span. While the study isn't done yet, the lead researcher, Adam Salmon, a professor of molecular medicine also at UT Health San Antonio, said of the six animals that are still alive, five received rapamycin and one a placebo.
Scientists think rapamycin increases life span in animals, and maybe people too, by inhibiting the mTOR complex, a fundamental biological pathway that is involved in many aspects of cellular health. Suppressing mTOR sets off a domino chain of events, altering several key processes in ways that appear to be beneficial for long-term survival. For example, it seems to decrease inflammation and ramp up a cellular trash removal process known as autophagy.
"If you look at the hallmarks of aging, you can find evidence in the literature that rapamycin affects all of them," Dr. Kaeberlein said.
Some experts think that rapamycin may slow down the aging process itself; others believe that it increases longevity by delaying or even preventing the onset of deadly age-related diseases. For example, inflammation is linked to diabetes and cardiovascular disease, not to mention general aches and pains, so reducing it is thought to be broadly beneficial. And it's conceivable that increasing autophagy could help to clear out toxic proteins that start to accumulate with age -- like amyloid and tau, which are widely thought to cause Alzheimer's disease.
So does it work in people?
Anthony Holman, 54, had previously experimented with fasting to try to optimize his health, but "as it turns out," he said, "I enjoy eating." About two years ago, he came across research that suggested rapamycin has some of the same biological effects as fasting. Around that time, he also learned that he carries one copy of a gene that increases his risk for Alzheimer's disease. Motivated to do everything he could to try to stave off the condition, he sought an off-label prescription for rapamycin at a concierge longevity medicine clinic.
After taking a small weekly dose for approximately 15 months, Mr. Holman, who lives outside Raleigh, N.C., said he hasn't experienced many changes, positive or negative, though he has noticed a subtle decrease in daily aches and pains. "It's almost like taking vitamins," he said. "You don't take vitamins because you're expecting some immediate benefit. You take it to hopefully see a benefit over time."
Whether or not people will see a benefit over time remains murky: Results from the handful of studies conducted in humans have been much less clear-cut than the research on other animals.
The strongest piece of evidence, according to rapamycin enthusiasts, is not a sweeping finding about longer, healthier living. It's a 2014 study in which adults aged 65 and older who took another mTOR inhibitor, called everolimus, had a more robust antibody response to the flu vaccine than those who got a placebo. The promise of those findings is limited, but not without value: Typically, the immune system declines with age. The greater response to the vaccine implies the drug countered that effect.
"It really did suggest that in humans, these drugs, mTOR inhibitors, can improve something that becomes impaired with older adults," said Adam Konopka, an assistant professor of geriatrics and gerontology at the University of Wisconsin, who was not involved in the research.
Subsequent studies have produced mixed results, and many have involved small numbers of participants and time frames that experts said were too short to really determine much.
The most recent study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, is one of the largest to-date and was conducted by AgelessRx, an online pharmacy that sells a low dose of rapamycin for longevity purposes. In it, more than 100 people took either rapamycin or a placebo once a week for nearly a year. There were no clinically significant differences in terms of physical benefits or negative side effects between the groups, though people on rapamycin reported feeling that their health had generally improved over the course of the study.
When broken down into subgroups, the handful of people taking the highest dose did see some additional benefits: Men showed increased bone density and women had increased lean muscle mass; the women also said they experienced less pain than they used to.
"We do see some people who benefit a lot," said Stefanie Morgan, the vice president of research and applied sciences at AgelessRx. But others "don't really benefit at all."
A small study Dr. Kellogg published in 2018 among adults 70 and older who took a daily dose of rapamycin for eight weeks also saw no clear benefits from the drug. However, the treatment group did experience a slight increase in a marker of insulin resistance compared to adults who received a placebo -- something that could be a cause for concern, especially among people who already struggle to keep their blood sugar in check. Anecdotally, some of the people who take rapamycin off label (including Mr. Berger) have reported a similar side effect; others have seen an increase in their cholesterol levels.
Experts said it's not surprising that there are few, if any, immediate benefits from taking rapamycin -- and added that it doesn't necessarily mean the drug isn't working. In older animals, rapamycin appears to "prevent and preserve things" rather than rejuvenate them, Dr. Salmon said. "So unless you're doing a long-term human study looking at preservation of health," you shouldn't expect to see significant improvements.
It's difficult and expensive to do a decades-long longevity study in humans. Instead, scientists are launching new clinical trials to look at how rapamycin affects age-related diseases, including Alzheimer's, as well as biological markers of aging.
If scientists can use rapamycin to "improve the different indices that become impaired with aging, then that can help serve as a proxy of health span," said Dr. Konopka, who is running a clinical trial testing everolimus, the other mTOR inhibitor.
Is it safe to try rapamycin?
While a few scientists interviewed for this article said they had tried taking rapamycin, most said they were waiting for more studies in humans to shed light not just on the benefits, but also the risks.
In the research conducted so far, nausea and mouth sores were the most common side effects, though there are also the reports of increased cholesterol and insulin insensitivity.
"The way people are using rapamycin off label today -- which is mostly once a week, not super high doses -- the risks are pretty low," said Dr. Kaeberlein, who has taken rapamycin himself. But, he added, they're not nothing.
The bigger concern, considering rapamycin is more typically used to prevent organ transplant rejection, is that the drug will dampen people's immune functioning and therefore increase their risk for infection and disease.
Transplant patients prescribed the drug take a higher dose than those who take it for aging, and there haven't been serious indications of immune suppression in the human longevity studies conducted so far. But it's conceivable that a low dose could still cause people to get more infections, or more severe infections, particularly among those with underlying health conditions, said Andrew Dillin, a professor of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in aging.
"Let's see, taking something that's risky, that's going to have no benefits?" Dr. Dillin said. "I'll pass."

Full text: Last year, Jackie Carnesi received an unusual proposal. Would she be willing to leave her job as the executive chef of a popular Brooklyn restaurant to work in a nearly century-old New York City diner?
Kellogg's Diner, a chrome clunker at a busy corner in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, had shuttered suddenly last January after its owners filed for bankruptcy. The new owners wanted to keep it a diner. But they needed a chef.
Had the proposal been made earlier in her career -- Ms. Carnesi, 37, previously worked at Empellón Cocina and Roberta's -- she would have said no. "My ego would never have listened," she said. But they'd caught her at the right time.
"How could you not be excited about being part of something that has so much history?" Ms. Carnesi said. "It's high pressure, right? You don't want to let anyone down."
Kellogg's, which opens to the public on Friday, is the latest in a string of decades-old diners that have been saved from closing or spared the ultimate indignity -- being razed to make way for luxury apartments.
To keep these diners open for decades longer, their new owners are looking to chefs with modern sensibilities and approaching the restaurants like restoration projects, tweaking menus, prices and interiors with extreme care.
Louis Skibar, one of the new owners of Kellogg's Diner, first put this experiment to the test at Old John's, a 73-year-old diner on the Upper West Side where he once worked as a delivery boy. When the restaurant closed during the pandemic, Mr. Skibar took over the lease, updated the menu with the help of the two-time "Top Chef" competitor Grayson Schmitz and reopened Old John's in 2021.
"The response was amazing," Mr. Skibar said. The diner recently took over a shoe store next door.
Mr. Skibar and his business partner, the interior designer Nico Arze, believe this same formula will work for Kellogg's. They've kept the diner's name and neon sign intact, but gutted the interior to make it more expansive and bright.
Ms. Carnesi was tasked with creating a menu of elevated takes on diner foods. For her, that meant invoking her Brownsville, Texas, roots in the form of enchiladas and housemade queso while keeping classic diner fare, like hamburgers and pancakes, on the menu.
"People find a lot of comfort in Kellogg's," Ms. Carnesi said. "First and foremost, I was looking to not alienate those people."
In nearby Brooklyn Heights, Montague Diner underwent a similar transformation after the producer Gabriel Nussbaum noticed that Happy Days Diner, open since 1991, was up for sale. He shot a text to his wife: "Should I open a diner?"
Mr. Nussbaum, 41, and his business partners fantasized about reopening the restaurant with minimal changes to the interior -- but that fantasy was short-lived. "It was a very lived-in diner," he said, adding, "You would pick up a booth and it would disintegrate."
The owners overhauled the interior and put together a new menu, with help from Halley Chambers and Kip Green of Margot, an upscale restaurant in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Their goal, Ms. Chambers said, was to improve the quality of the food without going too far.
Early on, for instance, they experimented with sourdough pancakes. "Hard veto," Mr. Nussbaum said. He reasoned that if his children visited the diner, ordered those pancakes and puckered, they would "lose their minds."
"It was about being true to the classics and not trying to inject too much creativity," said Ben Gross, an owner.
But they made other "concessions to modernity," he added. The diner accepts reservations on Resy -- virtually unheard-of in the first-come-first-served diner landscape -- and it's no longer open 24 hours. Patrons can also find bistro items like steak frites and roast chicken tucked between the classic pancakes and corned-beef hash.
Richard Gutman, the author of four books on diners, said he noticed that a new generation of chefs was taking over old diners about a decade ago, a trend that has accelerated since the pandemic. And while it may seem as if diners are frozen in place, they have always changed with the times and often reflect modern dining trends.
Today's diners serve vegan and gluten-free options -- and better-than-usual pancakes are a natural step in the evolution of the American diner. "It is going to cost you more money," he said, "but you'll get better food."
Persuading customers to embrace higher prices, however, is far more difficult.
After Eduardo Sandoval and Gavin Compton took over the nearly 80-year-old Three Decker Diner in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, "everyone assumed the worst," said Mr. Sandoval, the chef and a co-owner. "It's natural."
For the first six months, he didn't touch the menu. Instead, Mr. Sandoval, 41, worked shifts at Three Decker and spoke with the regulars. From those conversations, he realized that while many customers relied on the diner's affordable prices, some were open to improvements to the food: fresh vegetables over frozen ones, a better-tasting meatloaf.
When Mr. Sandoval and Mr. Compton began making changes at the start of 2023, along with slight increases in prices of 50 cents to one dollar, the menu was mostly well-received. "Our regulars are a little particular," Mr. Sandoval conceded.
Eric Finkelstein, an owner of Court Street Grocers, also agonized over raising prices in service of better quality Reubens and tuna melts when he and his business partner, Matt Ross, took ownership of Eisenberg's, a beloved 94-year-old lunch counter in Manhattan.
"What if somebody bought Katz's, a place that I've loved my whole life, and I walked in one day, and all of a sudden they were using better bread?" Mr. Finkelstein, 42, thought to himself. "Would I be upset that they were using better bread because it didn't match my experience? Or would I be psyched?"
He reasoned that if he stayed true to the original menu and didn't get "too conceptual," he could attract a new generation of customers and the regulars wouldn't be too upset.
When they reopened Eisenberg's, now known as S & P Lunch, their bet paid off. Several customers pulled Mr. Finkelstein aside to thank him for "not touching" the French fries, and for keeping several of the "original decorations" on the wall -- some of which he and Mr. Ross had added during the renovation.
"It felt natural to them," he said. "That felt good."

Anti-Aging Enthusiasts Are Taking a Pill to Extend Their Lives. Will It Work?

In March, Robert Berger, 69, a self-proclaimed “better-living-through-chemistry type of person,” started taking a small dose of rapamycin once a week with the goal of increasing his “health span” — the amount of time he might live without serious disease.
Rapamycin is typically prescribed to organ transplant patients to suppress their immune systems. But many scientists and longevity seekers like Berger think the drug can do much more than that: They say it can delay aging and age-related diseases.
Berger, who lives in Saratoga, California, learned about rapamycin through a friend who runs Rapamycin News, an online forum for people who experiment with the drug. He said he hasn’t experienced any “‘Oh my God, I’m a different person’ kind of change” since taking it, though his dentist remarked that his gums looked healthier than they had in a long time, and he feels like he has more energy these days. But he admits “it’s really hard to tell: How much is this placebo?”
On podcasts, social feeds and forums devoted to anti-aging, rapamycin is hailed as the “gold standard” for life extension. Longevity influencers Dr. Peter Attia and Bryan Johnson are believers, both saying they’ve taken rapamycin for years, and touting research to their millions of followers that shows the drug can extend the life spans of mice by more than 20%.
There isn’t data on how many people use rapamycin for anti-aging purposes, since the drug is taken off label or purchased from overseas providers. Like Berger, some of the other users interviewed for this article said they believed rapamycin has provided mild benefits, such as helping them lose weight, alleviating their aches and pains or even causing them to regrow dark hair years after going gray.
But while users are optimistic and the evidence that rapamycin can increase longevity in animals is promising, the research in humans is thin and long-term side effects are uncertain. In the few studies in which rapamycin has been compared with a placebo, tangible benefits are hard to come by.
Why all the hype?
Scientists first learned about the longevity-enhancing potential of rapamycin, also called sirolimus or Rapamune, in 2006, when a study showed that it could extend the life span of yeast. Enthusiasm mounted three years later, when another group of researchers found that mice given the drug lived roughly 12% longer.
Other medications had been tested for their possible anti-aging properties as part of a National Institute on Aging research program, but “rapamycin was the first one that actually made a difference in longevity and health span in both male and female mice,” said Dr. Dean Kellogg Jr., a professor of medicine and geriatrics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.
After that came studies in worms, flies and more mice — almost all showing that rapamycin extended life span.
“The demonstration that you could get the same effect across broad evolutionary distance — yeast, worms, fruit flies, mice — that really got people believing that this was something important and fundamental,” said Matthew Kaeberlein, who published the first study on rapamycin in yeast while he was a researcher at the University of Washington. (He is now the CEO at Optispan, a longevity startup.)
Preliminary data presented earlier this year at the American Aging Association annual meeting suggested that rapamycin also works in closer cousins to humans: Marmosets given the drug showed roughly a 10% increase in life span. While the study isn’t done yet, the lead researcher, Adam Salmon, a professor of molecular medicine also at UT Health San Antonio, said of the six animals that are still alive, five received rapamycin and one a placebo.
Scientists think rapamycin increases life span in animals, and maybe people, too, by inhibiting the mTOR complex, a fundamental biological pathway that is involved in many aspects of cellular health. Suppressing mTOR sets off a domino chain of events, altering several key processes in ways that appear to be beneficial for long-term survival. For example, it seems to decrease inflammation and ramp up a cellular trash removal process known as autophagy.
“If you look at the hallmarks of aging, you can find evidence in the literature that rapamycin affects all of them,” Kaeberlein said.
Some experts think that rapamycin may slow down the aging process itself; others believe that it increases longevity by delaying or even preventing the onset of deadly age-related diseases. For example, inflammation is linked to diabetes and cardiovascular disease, not to mention general aches and pains, so reducing it is thought to be broadly beneficial. And it’s conceivable that increasing autophagy could help to clear out toxic proteins that start to accumulate with age — like amyloid and tau, which are widely thought to cause Alzheimer’s disease.
So does it work in people?
Anthony Holman, 54, had previously experimented with fasting to try to optimize his health, but “as it turns out,” he said, “I enjoy eating.” About two years ago, he came across research that suggested rapamycin has some of the same biological effects as fasting. Around that time, he also learned that he carries one copy of a gene that increases his risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Motivated to do everything he could to try to stave off the condition, he sought an off-label prescription for rapamycin at a concierge longevity medicine clinic.
After taking a small weekly dose for approximately 15 months, Holman, who lives outside Raleigh, North Carolina, said he hasn’t experienced many changes, positive or negative, though he has noticed a subtle decrease in daily aches and pains. “It’s almost like taking vitamins,” he said. “You don’t take vitamins because you’re expecting some immediate benefit. You take it to hopefully see a benefit over time.”
Whether or not people will see a benefit over time remains murky: Results from the handful of studies conducted in humans have been much less clear-cut than the research on other animals.
The strongest piece of evidence, according to rapamycin enthusiasts, is not a sweeping finding about longer, healthier living. It’s a 2014 study in which adults aged 65 and older who took another mTOR inhibitor, called everolimus, had a more robust antibody response to the flu vaccine than those who got a placebo. The promise of those findings is limited, but not without value: Typically, the immune system declines with age. The greater response to the vaccine implies the drug countered that effect.
“It really did suggest that in humans, these drugs, mTOR inhibitors, can improve something that becomes impaired with older adults,” said Adam Konopka, an assistant professor of geriatrics and gerontology at the University of Wisconsin, who was not involved in the research.
Subsequent studies have produced mixed results, and many have involved small numbers of participants and time frames that experts said were too short to really determine much.
The most recent study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, is one of the largest to-date and was conducted by AgelessRx, an online pharmacy that sells a low dose of rapamycin for longevity purposes. In it, more than 100 people took either rapamycin or a placebo once a week for nearly a year.

Anecdotally, some of the people who take rapamycin off label (including Berger) have reported a similar side effect; others have seen an increase in their cholesterol levels.

Full text: The co-owner of Miriam opens Rafael, Brass enlists Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske Valtierra, and more restaurant news.
Opening
Kellogg's Diner
The 1928 original, a classic of the genre, has been reborn. The restaurateur Louis Skibar has put Jackie Carnesi, formerly of Roberta's and Nura in Greenpoint, in charge of the kitchen. ("I love diners," said Mr. Skibar, whose portfolio includes a few.) At 37, Ms. Carnesi said she no longer had to prove her chops and could concentrate on a menu notable for approachability and affordability. At the same time, you'll find herbed mayo and marinated tomatoes in the BLT; guajillo-braised short rib hash, a nod to Ms. Carnesi's Texan roots; huevos rancheros; and nachos. A highlight on Amanda Perdomo's dessert menu is strawberry pretzel salad. The design, an updated restoration, is by Nico Arze and Matthew Maddy. (Opens Friday)
518 Metropolitan Avenue (Union Avenue), Williamsburg, Brooklyn, kelloggsdinernyc.com.
Rafael
The chef Rafael Hasid brings Mediterranean and Middle Eastern to neighborhood settings. Having successfully planted Miriam in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and a sibling on the Upper West Side, he has now turned his attention to the Upper East Side. This time his name is on the awning; Miriam was for his mother. The townhouse space on several levels is simply done with pale wood, blue accents (a thing this year), some rough-hew stonework and Middle Eastern design touches. The repertoire of the executive chef, Francisco Da Silva Rosa includes shakshuka, Israeli chopped salad and lamb in a burger. (Opens Thursday)
917 Lexington Avenue (71st Street), 646-918-7971, rafaelues.com.
Brass
A challenge when opening a restaurant is the name. Here's one that has been hiding in plain sight -- clever for an American brasserie. The place in question is in the Evelyn Hotel in NoMad, where the entrepreneur Nick Hatsatouris has already opened the Tusk Bar. He has again enlisted Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske Valtierra as partners for a menu that talks brasserie with an American accent. Mussels with chickpea fritters, an onion tart in a buckwheat crust, Amish chicken rolled around a mousseline of herbs and truffles, and a profiterole masquerading as a banana split are what you'll find in a room with a vintage piano centerpiece that will be put to use. (Thursday)
27 East 27th Street, 212-971-9746, brassny.com.
Corner Store
Michael Vignola, Catch Hospitality's culinary director, and Paul Castro, the executive chef of this spot moving in to a space on the edge of SoHo once occupied by Dos Caminos, dress some American classics with luxury touches. Wagyu is in a French dip. A two-pound lobster is escorted by frites, and an apple hand pie comes encased in buttery shortbread. Drinks include martinis, like a sour cream and onion version served with dip and chips. A bar, two dining rooms done in green velvet and leather, and a glass-enclosed patio define the premises.
475 West Broadway (West Houston Street), 212-271-9240, thecornerstoresoho.com.
Dilly Dally
A white storefront and a red awning announce this newcomer to Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. There is a chef's counter but the place is better defined by unpretentious fare like meatballs, lasagna, ravioli with sage, crackers and dip, Caesar salad, shrimp cocktail and crisp steelhead trout. Dave Patry's goal is comfort and familiarity, and he is working with the culinary director Diego Moya, a chef with pedigree.
626 Vanderbilt Avenue (Prospect Place), Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, 646-481-0754, dillydallybk.com.
Taqueria El Chato
For the tacos here, using housemade tortillas, the list of fillings has been tightly curated. It includes one with a mix of pork and beef for more juice. The restaurant is the work of Chris Reyes and the chef Gerardo Alcaraz, the owners of Aldama (closing soon to become Bar Aldama) in nearby Williamsburg. Quesadillas and a Vampiro (a crunchy quesadilla with cheese on top) are on the menu.
620 Manhattan Avenue (Nassau Avenue), Greenpoint, Brooklyn.
Bellies
The Wonder food halls have added this children's restaurant to the mix. The menu features chicken tenders, burgers, pasta, salad, grilled cheese, sweets and drinks. $ 1.95 to $ 11.95. The idea is to provide an option for children to enjoy from their own "restaurant" while their adult companions enjoy adult fare like a Bobby Flay steak.

Branches
Salt & Straw
The much adored Portland, Ore.,-based ice cream shop, which already has a presence in six states and national distribution, is opening its first locations in New York City. First up is on the Upper West Side on Saturday, followed by the West Village about a month later. The company, founded in 2011, is known for such innovative and seasonal concoctions as pear and blue cheese, and caramel apple sherbet. (Friday)
360 Amsterdam Avenue (77th Street), 540 Hudson Street (Perry Street), saltandstraw.com.
Looking Ahead
Chef x Chef
The chef Gabriel Kreuther has created this series to explore the influence of French culinary heritage around the world in Francophone places like Senegal, Haiti and Quebec, and also their impact on French gastronomy. First up will be Pierre Thiam, the Senegalese chef of Teranga in Harlem on Sept. 25 with a five-course dinner, $ 225.

Oktoberfest
This fall, the Bavarian beer and wurst party at Dickson's Farmstand Meats in Chelsea Market has taken a new approach. It will feature only New York State craft beers and will be a walk-around bash, not a seated event. A brass band will enliven things from 8 to 10 p.m. and after there will be a German disco. Threes Brewing, Industrial Arts and Wild East are some of the breweries represented; the cooks at Dickson's are whipping up their wurst along with spaetzle, sauerkraut, smoked meats and pretzels. Sept. 27, 8 p.m. to midnight, all you can eat and open bar, $ 65, dicksonsfarmstand.com.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Opendorse's Black Book, a kind of Zillow for college sports detailing athletes' expected annual pay, is being used by many players and administrators to set market rates.
What wins college football championships? A potent defense? An explosive offense? In the era of name, image and likeness, it is money.
Lots of it.
It can cost as much as $ 10.5 million for a title-contending starting offense and defense in the new Power Four conferences. The big-ticket item, of course, lines up behind the center. A blue-chip quarterback in a Power Four conference -- schools like Alabama, Michigan and Washington -- can expect to earn hundreds of thousands of dollars annually through name, image and likeness, or N.I.L., deals. A quarterback in the Southeastern Conference can bring in more than $ 1 million, on average.
And that is merely an average. Ask the Texas Longhorns.
Their starter, Quinn Ewers, has N.I.L. deals worth nearly $ 2 million annually, according to the website On3, which tracks deals for college athletes. Arch Manning, his backup, who hails from one of football's royal families, has deals worth more than $ 3 million. Georgia's quarterback, Carson Beck, brings in enough that he recently bought a Lamborghini that retails for $ 270,000.
Between the cash pouring into athletic programs via collectives -- a fancy name for boosters who funnel much of the N.I.L. money to players -- and more lenient transfer rules, a sort of eBay to buy athletes has been created, transforming how powerhouse teams are built.
"It's whoever wants to pay, the most money raised, the most money to buy the most players, is going to have the best opportunity to win," Nick Saban, the recently retired football coach at the University of Alabama, told Congress in March.
But how do athletes, coaches and administrators determine the going rates? Many consult the Black Book, a kind of Zillow for college sports, which details an athlete's expected annual earnings, and, in the case of sports like football and men's and women's basketball, even breaking them down by position and conference.
Opendorse, the company behind the Black Book, projects around $ 1.7 billion in transactions in the N.I.L. market this year.
Of that, 80 percent will come through collectives like Texas' Team One Foundation and the Classic City Collective at the University of Georgia. But even that is an incomplete picture of a rapidly changing N.I.L. frontier awash with money.
There is no universal requirement for athletes to disclose how much they are being paid. Less than a third of the money that student athletes are making is publicly known, according to Opendorse.
Still, the Black Book is a must have for university collectives and collegiate athletic officials, as well as the lawyers involved in House v. N.C.A.A., an antitrust case in which the Black Book and all Opendorse data from 2016 through 2022 were subpoenaed. The sides recently agreed to a $ 2.8 billion settlement. If a federal judge approves it, schools will be allowed to set aside around $ 20 million per year, beginning in the fall of 2025, to pay athletes. (The proposal also calls for a program by which athletes' N.I.L. deals could be reviewed.)
The Black Book, copies of which were obtained by The New York Times, shows that, even as football remains the dominant sport financially, sports like women's basketball have become increasingly lucrative. In her final season at the University of Iowa, Caitlin Clark sold out arenas, increased television ratings and had sponsorship deals valued at $ 3 million.
Clark may have been the sport's unicorn, but title-contending programs are expected to spend more than $ 730,000 on their starting five, with guards being the most valued at $ 225,000.
The N.I.L. era has also created a new generation of entrepreneurs and given them a more concrete sense of their earning potential. For instance, Alex Glover, a star volleyball player who recently concluded her career at Southern Methodist University, made more than $ 100,000 from sponsors who wanted to be associated with her Instagram video series, called "Day-In-The-Life of a D1 Volleyballer."
Olivia Dunne, a gymnast at Louisiana State University, has become something of a celebrity in recent years. Dunne, who goes by Livvy, has leveraged a large social media following -- she has over five million followers on Instagram -- to notch deals with major brands like Nautica and Vuori.
Paige Bueckers, a standout basketball star at the University of Connecticut, similarly has millions of followers on social media and has signed N.I.L. deals with Nike, Gatorade and Verizon.
The top N.I.L. earners in women's gymnastics usually make around $ 20,000 annually, about 10 times as much as their male counterparts, according to data from Opendorse. Besides the major men's sports -- football, basketball and baseball -- collegiate female athletes typically earn more than male athletes in the same sport.
"By nature, athletes are disciplined and purpose-driven," said Blake Lawrence, the co-founder of Opendorse. "What has been really cool to see is how many athletes on our platform, especially the women, lean into the opportunities to be creative and build a brand. They don't want to get paid just for going to practice and games."
Lawrence, a former starting linebacker at the University of Nebraska, began Opendorse in 2012 to help his former teammate Prince Amukamara monetize his brand after he entered the N.F.L. as a first-round draft pick with the New York Giants. Lawrence understood the commitment required of college athletes and anticipated that the pay-to-play model was coming sooner rather than later. More than a decade on, some 150,000 athletes have used his platform to grow their name, image and likeness revenues.
The company compiles its numbers based on previous N.I.L. marketing deals signed by a large cross section of football and basketball players and competitors in the so-called nonrevenue Olympic sports. Clients that pay for the information include university athletic departments, their collectives and athlete agencies.
"I know what it takes to be an athlete and wanted to create something like Expedia or Zillow that took the mystery out of getting good value and putting that power in the hands of athletes," said Lawrence, who offers tutorials on topics like marketing and pay benchmarks on his Instagram feed. "This is all new to them. I see six contracts a second and want them armed with information to make what could be life-changing decisions."
Like the American economy, college sports have a hierarchy, and its "1 percenters" are the so-called Power conferences like the SEC and the Big Ten.
The expected annual N.I.L. compensation for a top-10-earning football player at any position is $ 216,000 for the Big Ten and $ 565,000 in the SEC, which is more than three times the annual earnings of $ 159,000 in the Big 12.
The SEC's stature is even more pronounced this year. The former Big 12 powerhouses Texas and Oklahoma have joined the conference, which is made up of state universities that have long taken football seriously and invested heavily in athletics. The top-10-earning SEC players at every position -- except for tight ends and specialists -- earn more annually on average than players in any other Power Four conference. A running back in the SEC can now expect to make about half a million dollars, almost as much as a Big 12 quarterback. Offensive and defensive linemen in the SEC do even better, tallying upward of $ 700,000.
For the smaller, so-called Group of Five conferences, which include Conference USA and the Mountain West, the new N.I.L. environment puts football championships even further out of reach. The average value of top 25 players at any position at schools such as Liberty (part of Conference USA) or Boise State (in the Mountain West) is just under $ 50,000.
The money is lucrative in the top tier of men's and women's basketball, as well: A starting five of top-25-earning men's basketball players costs about $ 3.3 million, with forwards on the top of the pay scale making around $ 750,000. And while women's basketball earnings are comparatively much lower, top-level women's players have had substantial growth since last year, with pay across all positions up by $ 30,000.
Even better for basketball stars? With their faces and personalities in full view during games, it is easier for them to enhance revenues beyond collective money through sponsorship partnerships with national brands.
This new market allowed Armando Bacot, who played at the University of North Carolina, to remain in college last season and begin work on a master's degree in business. His partnerships with the Opendorse clients Dunkin and Kellogg's Frosted Flakes, as well as others with regional and local companies, have made him a multimillionaire. Many star players like Bacot are now forgoing the ritual of leaving school after just a year or two to enter the N.B.A. Instead of jumping (ready or not) into the draft in search of riches, more players are choosing the ample N.I.L. pay and more time to work on their games and degrees. (Bacot went undrafted and signed with the Utah Jazz this summer.)
"With more and more veteran guys staying in school longer, it's going to be harder and harder for freshmen to get big minutes, because coaches would rather have veterans," said Daniel Hennes, the chief executive of Engage, which represents college basketball stars like Bacot in N.I.L. deals. "So, underclassmen will stay in school longer, and the draft will get older and older. In a lot of ways, that's good for everyone."
Mike Boynton is among the many college coaches who are not so sure. He brought the future N.B.A. star Cade Cunningham to Oklahoma State with four years of shoe leather. He outworked more accomplished rivals with national titles on their résumés with the promise of doing right by the young star.
"I can't work that hard anymore," said Boynton, now an assistant at the University of Michigan. "Not when you can say, 'Hey, here's $ 500,000 to come spend nine months over here."'
For many athletes -- those who aren't top stars in the marquee sports -- the N.I.L. era is different, though no less exciting. Zoe Ledet, a 19-year-old sprinter at West Virginia State University, joined TikTok in 2020, at the height of Covid-era teenage boredom. She said she quickly amassed a following for "funny skits, hair care, you know, relatable stuff" and now has 1.7 million followers on the platform and nearly 300,000 on Instagram. Still, Ledet never thought brands would be interested in working with her as an athlete.
"I knew that big track athletes like Sha'Carri could get deals with Nike, but I didn't know there were smaller deals to be had," said Ledet, referring to the Olympic sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson.
Last year, during her freshman season, Ledet was approached by B.E. Collective+, an organization that supports student athletes from historically Black colleges and universities in the N.I.L. market. She signed with the group and had N.I.L. deals worth about $ 3,500 in her first year.
For Ledet, those earnings aren't life-changing money, but she has been able to use platforms like the BE Collective+ and Opendorse to gain a better sense of her value in the new marketplace. Her followers now ask her to post more about track and to share videos from meets, content that she hopes will in turn lead to more N.I.L. deals.
"There are a lot of athletes bigger than me, of course, but N.I.L. has allowed athletes like me to widen our platform and get more recognition, too," she said.

High-Security Detainees Are Moved Amid Structural Problems at Guantánamo: [National Desk]

Author: Rosenberg, Carol

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The military, which in 2021 disclosed its last major internal relocation of Guantánamo prisoners, declined to discuss this week's security operation.
Undisclosed infrastructure problems forced the military to evacuate the prison housing the men accused of plotting the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and other detainees from the war against terrorism, according to Defense Department employees.
The military had no comment on the sudden closure over the weekend of its former showcase prison. But by Tuesday, all 30 detainees at Guantánamo Bay were believed to be confined to a medium-security prison building, called Camp 6, the Defense Department employees said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the details of the security operation.
Camp 6 was built in 2006 for $ 39 million to house up to 200 detainees, and until this week held 16 general population prisoners in communal-style detention. All 16 have been approved for transfer to the custody of other countries, including 11 Yemeni men whose transfer to Oman is on hold.
Camp 6 is designed with separate cellblocks, each containing about two dozen cells, a large common room and an adjacent outdoor area monitored by banks of cameras. When it is operated as a medium-security facility, guards remotely open all the cell doors for much of the day, permitting the prisoners to eat, pray, watch TV and engage in other communal activities until they are ordered back to their cells.
As the detainee population has shrunk, fewer men were held in each cellblock, depending on their disciplinary status. Individual cells were replaced with a pantry, a library and other rooms that could be inspected by guards during hours of lockdown.
But until this week, 14 high-security prisoners were held next door in Camp 5, a smaller, maximum-security facility with about 75 cells. They included Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who is accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks, and the other defendants in his death-penalty case; Osama bin Laden's former propaganda chief; two Malaysians and an Iraqi man who have pleaded guilty to war crimes charges; and so-called high-value detainees who have never been charged with crimes.
Camp 5, a two-story structure, was built in 2004 for $ 17 million using the design of a state prison in Bunker Hill, Ind. During the Trump administration, it was retrofitted with a modest detainee health clinic and a psychiatric ward with a padded cell.
Both Camps 5 and 6 were built by the contractor KBR, sometimes referred to as Kellogg Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton, the company run by Dick Cheney before he was vice president.
Defense Department employees with knowledge of the move said the consolidation followed several weeks of failing infrastructure at Camp 5, including water gushing through the prison's walls. One defense lawyer said descriptions of conditions at Camp 5 were similar to problems in a now-defunct secret facility called Camp 7, which was abandoned in 2021.
It was not possible to independently evaluate accounts from the prison, which as of April had a staff of about 900 troops, civilians and federal contractors. No reporter has been allowed to visit the detention zone since 2019, when the Trump administration ended media visits, which had been allowed since the prison opened in January 2002. At the height, up to 20 reporters at a time were allowed to tour the detention facilities.
During those visits, Camp 5 was the showcase prison. The air-conditioned facility had individual cells with metal cots where detainees could be held for up to 22 hours a day and received their meals through a slot in the door.
For years, commanders encouraged photography of Camp 5 in an effort to show how much conditions had improved since 2002, when journalists on Pentagon-sponsored visits documented the first prisoners at Guantánamo. At the time, the detainees, wearing orange jumpsuits, were held in open-air cages at the original prison, called Camp X-Ray.

Markets Climb Higher as Inflation Data Meets Expectations: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: U.S. stocks ticked higher in a quiet Wednesday after the latest update on inflation came in almost exactly as economists expected.
The S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent to follow up on one of its best days of the year and climb within 3.7 percent of its high set last month. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 242 points, or 0.6 percent, to finish a day above the 40,000 level for the first time in nearly two weeks. The Nasdaq composite edged up less than 0.1 percent.
Treasury yields were also relatively steady in the bond market after the U.S. government said consumers paid prices last month that were 2.9 percent higher for gasoline, food, shelter and other things than a year earlier.
The data should keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut its main interest rate at its next meeting in September, a move that Wall Street has long been looking forward to. The Fed has been keeping rates at an economy-crunching level in hopes of stifling inflation that topped 9 percent two years ago, and lower interest rates would ease the pressure on both the economy and on prices for investments.
The only question is how big the first cut to rates since the 2020 Covid crash will be: the traditional quarter of a percentage point or a more dramatic half point?
Wednesday's reading on inflation at the consumer level wasn't as cool as the prior day's update on inflation at the wholesale level, but it likely doesn't change much, according to Chris Larkin, the managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.
If most of the data over the next few weeks points to a slowing economy, he said the Fed may cut more aggressively. That includes a report coming up on Thursday about how much U.S. shoppers spent at retailers.
While the economy is still growing, and many economists see a recession as unlikely, worries have risen about its strength after a much-worse-than-expected month of hiring by U.S. employers in July.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 3.83 percent from 3.85 percent late Tuesday. It's been coming down since topping 4.70 percent in April, as expectations have built for coming cuts to interest rates.
The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, edged up to 3.95 percent from 3.94 percent late Tuesday, as traders weigh whether September's anticipated cut will be the traditional or jumbo-size move.
On Wall Street, Kellanova rose 7.8 percent after Mars said it would buy the company behind Pringles, Cheez-Its and Kellogg's for $ 83.50 per share in cash. The companies put the deal's total value at $ 35.9 billion, including debt. Kellanova was created when the Kellogg Co. split into three companies in the summer of 2022.
Cardinal Health rose 3.7 percent after joining the parade of companies that have reported stronger profit for the spring than analysts expected.
On the losing end was Brinker International, the company behind Chili's and Maggiano's restaurants. It fell 10.7 percent after reporting weaker profit for the latest quarter than expected. That was despite strengthening sales trends at Chili's, which got a boost from higher prices, increased traffic and the launch of its "Big Smasher" burger. Expectations were high coming into the report for Brinker International, whose stock is still up 45.6 percent for the year so far.
Starbucks fell 2.1 percent to give back some of its big gain from the prior day after it said it had lured Brian Niccol away from Chipotle Mexican Grill to become its chief executive.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 20.78 points to 5,455.21. The Dow gained 242.75 to 40,008.39, and the Nasdaq composite rose 4.99 to 17.192.60.
In stock markets abroad, indexes were modestly higher across much of Europe and mixed in Asia.

Sweet Would Marry Salty In $36 Billion Acquisition: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Mars is acquiring Kellanova in one of the largest deals in the industry in years, creating a new global giant with a stable of well-known brands.
Mars, the company behind M&M's and Snickers, has agreed to acquire Kellanova, the snack food business spun off by Kellogg's last year, in a multibillion-dollar deal that will create a new global food giant.
The acquisition, one of the largest food deals in years, was announced on Wednesday. The all-cash deal values Kellanova at $ 35.9 billion, including debt, a hefty premium to the company's market value before news of the deal first began to leak.
Kellanova owns a large menu of brands including Cheez-It, Pringles and Eggo.
Mars, which is privately owned and best known for its chocolate candies, has tried to broaden beyond sweets. In 2020, it bought Kind North America, the company that makes Kind Bars. Mars has also invested heavily in its sizable pet business, which includes the pet food brand Iams, as well as animal clinics and hospitals.
Acquiring Kellanova would allow Mars to offer an array of both salty and sweet food. It would echo a strategy that Hershey employed, with its acquisition of the parent company of SkinnyPop and Dot's Pretzels.
"In welcoming Kellanova's portfolio of growing global brands, we have a substantial opportunity for Mars to further develop a sustainable snacking business that is fit for the future," Poul Weihrauch, the chief executive of Mars, said in a statement.
The deal comes at a tenuous time for food and beverage manufacturers. For more than two years, Big Food has steadily increased prices on products, partly to cover higher commodity and labor costs but also to expand their profit margins. Now, some consumers are pushing back, either buying less or trading down to generic brands. The result for many food companies has been slower revenue growth and fewer items sold.
Executives at Kellanova noted this month that consumers who earned $ 100,000 or less in income and had children were proving to be especially price sensitive when shopping at the grocery store. Kellanova has increased its promotions in hopes of luring the shoppers back.
"Consumers are getting more used to these prices," Steve Cahillane, the chief executive of Kellanova, said to analysts and investors on an earnings call. "It doesn't mean they're not still under pressure and that we have to, you know, make sure to some of the earlier conversations, we're hitting the right price points, the right pack sizes, you know, the right promotions at the right time of the month."
Those promotions are, so far, supporting volume growth in key markets. In the quarter ending late June, the company reported a 4 percent increase in organic net sales -- excluding currency and the divestiture of its business in Russia -- with volumes growing 2 percent in North America, which makes up roughly half of its business.
Kellanova was created by the food giant Kellogg's, which spun off its North American cereal business, now known as WK Kellogg Co., from its snack business, rebranded as Kellanova, last year.
Kellanova, which says it operates in 180 markets, generated more than $ 13 billion in revenue last year. It employs roughly 23,000 people. Mars, with more than 150,000 employees, recorded about $ 50 billion in sales last year.
The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year, the companies said. The acquisition could attract the attention of regulators, who have taken a tough approach to corporate consolidation under the Biden administration. Analysts from Jefferies said in a report on Wednesday that they found an overlap in only 18 country-product combinations, out of hundreds of possibilities, "likely limiting any roadblocks to the deal," they said.
Deal-makers have been scrambling to better understand what antitrust policy might look like after November's presidential election, under either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald J. Trump.
Shares of Kellanova rose, but hovered a bit short of the $ 83.50 price per share offered by Mars, implying some uncertainty about the deal getting done.

WK Kellogg to Shut Down Cereal Plant in Nebraska
WK Kellogg plans to shut down its plant in Omaha by the end of 2026 under a reorganization that will also reduce the cereal maker's headcount by more than 17 percent, it said on Tuesday, as it streamlines its production.
The company projected 2024 adjusted net sales to come in at the lower end of its prior forecast range of 1 percent growth to 1 percent decline. It also posted in-line net sales of $ 672 million for the second quarter.
WK Kellogg is the North American cereal business of the packaged food giant Kellogg. The reorganization, approved by the board on July 31, is expected to result in cumulative restructuring pretax charges of between $ 230 million and $ 270 million. Under the plan, the Froot Loops maker will consolidate its manufacturing network beginning with a phased reduction in production at the Nebraska plant and scaling back production at its Memphis facility, starting in late 2025.

Taco Bell Sustains Profit
For Yum Amid Sales Hit
Yum Brands beat expectations for second-quarter profit on Tuesday as strength in the Taco Bell business and cost controls helped offset a sales hit from weak demand at KFC and boycotts related to the Middle East conflict.
Like its peers in the fast-food industry, Yum has been investing in loyalty programs and refreshing its menus in an attempt to appeal to budget-conscious consumers, but stiff competition for value meals and promotions has dogged its KFC business in the U.S. this year.
Company executives said on a post-earnings call that the impact from boycotts related to the Middle East conflict have surfaced in "several other markets" beyond Malaysia, Indonesia and the Middle East.
"Significant volatility remains, and we recognize sales are some markets are not where we want them to be," said the chief executive, David Gibbs. Reuters
TRANSPORTATION
Uber's Revenue Growth Beats Wall Street Forecast
Uber's second-quarter results on Tuesday beat Wall Street estimates on the back of steady demand for its ride-sharing and food-delivery services.
"Mobility had a standout second quarter ... growth was consistent across use cases and geographic strength was led by LatAm and APAC, in particular Brazil, Australia and India," Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said.
Trips by self-driving vehicles on Uber's platform were six times higher in the quarter, helped by partnerships with companies including Alphabet's Waymo for ride-share and food delivery, as well as start-up Waabi for freight services.
Uber's revenue rose 16 percent to $ 10.70 billion in the second quarter ending June, while gross bookings increased 19 percent to $ 39.95 billion. Analysts had expected $ 10.57 billion and $ 39.68 billion, respectively, according to LSEG data. Reuters

Floyd Layne, 95, City Basketball Player Tarnished by College Gambling Scandal: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He helped City College win two national championships in 1950 before pleading guilty in a point-shaving scheme. He later became City's basketball coach and a mentor.
Floyd Layne, who helped City College win both the N.C.A.A. and N.I.T. basketball championships in March 1950 but who shattered his career in a point-shaving scandal, died on Friday. Layne, who eventually found redemption working with young people in recreation programs and as City College's head basketball coach, was 95.
His death was confirmed by Karina Jorge, an assistant director of athletics at City College, who did not say where he died.
An outstanding ballhandler and defensive player at guard, the 6-foot-3-inch Layne was among four sophomores in the starting lineup for an unheralded City team that won the National Invitation Tournament and the N.C.A.A. tournament at Madison Square Garden in championship games held 10 days apart.
But late in the following season, players from powerful teams like City College, Long Island University, Bradley University and the University of Kentucky were arrested after being accused of taking bribes from professional gamblers to lose games or keep margins of victory within the point spread established to attract bettors.
When three of Layne's teammates were arrested in mid-February 1951, accused of point-shaving, students staged a campus rally to support the squad, and they carried the presumably unsullied Layne on their shoulders.
But Layne was soon arrested as well. He was accused of agreeing to help keep City College from exceeding victory margins set by gamblers in their point spreads for games with Missouri, Arizona and Boston College during the 1950-51 season. Layne led detectives to the bedroom of his Bronx home, where he had hidden $ 2,890 -- all but $ 110 of the bribe money -- in a rolled-up handkerchief embedded in the dirt of a flower pot.
Layne and his teammates Ed Roman, Ed Warner, Irwin Dambrot, Al Roth, Norm Mager and Herb Cohen each pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor conspiracy charge in November 1951. All received suspended sentences except for Warner, who received a six-month jail term. But none were accused of fixing games in the 1950 national tournaments.
The episode became the subject of a 1998 HBO documentary: "City Dump: The Story of the 1951 CCNY Basketball Scandal."
Floyd Layne was born on Jan. 1, 1929, in Brooklyn and moved to the Bronx with his mother when he was 8, after his father left home. He played at DeWitt Clinton High School before transferring to Benjamin Franklin High School in Manhattan, where he was an all-city player.
At City College, he orchestrated the offense and was matched against some of the toughest opposing players on defense. He was also a left-handed pitcher on the baseball team.
The scandal wrecked Layne's hopes for a career in the N.B.A. or Major League Baseball. He was expelled from City College, served in the Army and then played for the Harlem Globetrotters and in the semipro Eastern League. But he was allowed to re-enter City, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in 1957. He went on to receive a master's degree in recreation and education from Teachers College, Columbia University.
Layne worked with young people in recreational programs, most notably mentoring Nate (Tiny) Archibald, who went on to a Hall of Fame career in the N.B.A., and he coached the Queensborough Community College team.
He was named City College's basketball coach in 1974, taking over a program that had been playing at a modest competitive level since the scandal.
"Floyd Layne's rehabilitation is a remarkable success story that holds many valuable lessons for the youth of this city," Robert Marshak, the college president, told The New York Times at the time, alluding to the scandal of the 1950s.
After getting the coaching job, Layne told The Times, "We were kids who made a mistake and we went on to pay a heavy price over the next 20 years." His struggles, he said, "taught me about adversity and led me to dedicate myself to kids so they wouldn't make the same kind of mistake and have to pay the same terrible price."
Layne's teams won the City University of New York Conference tournament championship in four of his first six seasons. He coached the Beavers for 14 seasons before resigning to teach physical education at City College full time. He later coached the women's basketball team at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan and the boys' teams at Prospect Heights High School in Brooklyn and George Washington High School in Manhattan.
He was at Madison Square Garden in December 2009 with his former teammates Dambrot and Ron Nadell when the Garden cited City's double championship as the No. 1 college basketball moment in the game's 75-year history there. (In the 1950s, teams could compete in both national tournaments; today, teams in the N.I.T. are chosen from those not selected for the N.C.A.A. tournament.)
Information about his survivors was not immediately available.
When Layne coached his first game at City College, a 90-79 home victory over Columbia before 2,000 fans, Nat Holman, his former coach, and his former teammates Roman and Warner were on hand to support him.
Junius Kellogg, the former Manhattan College center whose report of a bribe offer had touched off the point-shaving scandal, was also at that game, and he reflected on Layne's work with young people and the burden that the City players involved in the scandal had carried over the years.
"Floyd has salvaged at least a thousand kids' lives that I know of," Kellogg said. "Those guys paid their debt to society a long time ago, and as far as Floyd is concerned, he has done a hell of a lot more for society than most of us."

Costco Set To Raise Fee For 1st Time In 7 Years: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Sanders, Hank

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An increase of more than 8 percent will take effect on Sept. 1. The base membership will go up by $ 5, to $ 65 per year.
Costco is increasing its annual fee for members by more than 8 percent in the United States and Canada, the first increase in seven years, the company announced on Wednesday.
Beginning Sept. 1, the fee for customers who shop at Costco Wholesale stores will increase by $ 5 to $ 65 annually for the basic Gold Star Membership and by $ 10 to $ 130 annually for customers with the Executive Membership.
"The fee increases will impact about 52 million paid memberships, a little over half of which are Executive," a spokesman for Costco, the Washington State-based membership wholesale retail store, said in a statement. "As a reminder, we last raised our membership fees in the U.S. and Canada in June 2017."
The announcement did not specify whether people who purchase annual memberships before Sept. 1 will see a charge for the difference or if they can enjoy the lower price until they pay for a second year in 2025. Costco did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
Costco members present their membership cards at the door to enter its nearly 900 massive warehouse stores, where they can buy products in bulk at an often significantly discounted price. Shoppers leave with carts full of monthslong supplies of necessities like toilet paper and detergent, as well as frozen and fresh groceries, snacks, home furnishings and knickknacks.
With high inflation and gas prices threatening the profit margins of grocery stores around the world, Tim Calkins, a clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, was surprised by how infrequent Costco's fee increases have been.
"It would be very easy for Costco to take up the membership fee every year like so many companies do," said Mr. Calkins in an interview. "But Costco really doesn't do that."
In October 2022, Sam's Club, a competing membership-based warehouse retail store operated by Walmart, announced similar increases of $ 5 and $ 10 for different subscription levels.
Mr. Calkins thinks Costco will continue to keep its price on goods as low as possible and may look to its membership fee to drive profits.
"A single price increase like this is not likely to have a big impact," he said when asked if he thought customers would cancel their memberships. "But over time, if Costco does this with a lot of frequency, then it could become a bigger issue."
Shareholders may have taken note of the news. Costco's share price dropped by about 5 percent from Wednesday morning to Thursday evening. The stock price had reached a record high on Tuesday.
The Business Membership, which is the same price as the Gold Star, will also be increased by $ 5 per year.
Although Costco has avoided raising membership prices, it has recently taken measures to crack down on loopholes used by nonmembers to benefit from the store's deals. In April, Costco's food court, which offers popular deals like $ 1.50 for a hot dog and a drink, began checking membership cards for access. And last month, the company announced it was requiring photographic identification from members at all checkout registers, closing an often-exploited workaround in which nonmembers sometimes avoided identification requirements at self-checkout lanes.
Costco currently operates 882 warehouse stores, including 609 in the United States and Puerto Rico, and 108 in Canada, the company said in its announcement. It is unclear if members in the dozen other countries where Costco has warehouses will be subject to similar price increases.

On Juneteenth, Freedom Came With Strings Attached: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Last week at a Juneteenth concert on the South Lawn of the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris said that on June 19, 1865, after Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, "The enslaved people of Texas learned they were free." On that day, she said, "they claimed their freedom."
With those words, Harris, who stood alongside President Biden when he admirably signed the legislation that made Juneteenth a federal holiday, expressed a common oversimplification, one born of our tendency to conjugate history's complexities: Although it's a mark of progress to commemorate the end of American slavery, it's imperative that we continue to underscore the myriad ways in which Black freedom was restricted long after that first Juneteenth.
To start, there is some debate over whether most of the estimated 250,000 enslaved people in Texas at the time didn't know about the Emancipation Proclamation. As the Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. told me recently, "I have never met a scholar who believes that's true."
But more important, emancipation was not true freedom -- not in Texas and not in most of the American South, where a vast majority of Black people lived. It was quasi freedom. It was an ostensible freedom. It was freedom with more strings attached than a marionette.
Most Black people couldn't claim their freedom on June 19, 1865, because their bodies (and their free will) were still being policed to nearly the same degree and with the same inveterate racism that Southern whites had aimed at them during slavery.
The laws governing the formerly enslaved "were very restrictive in terms of where they could go, what kind of jobs they could have, where they could live in certain communities," said Daina Ramey Berry, the dean of humanities and fine arts at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the author of "The Price for Their Pound of Flesh: The Value of the Enslaved, From Womb to Grave, in the Building of a Nation."
As the Rediscovering Black History blog at the National Archives notes, "Most white Texans desired to keep Blacks as close to their formerly enslaved status as possible; therefore, they fiercely resisted any actions that would potentially elevate Blacks to a competitive social, political and economic status." This was true throughout much of the former Confederacy.
And it was explicit. Upon arrival in Galveston, the Union general Gordon Granger delivered General Order No. 3, which said "the connection heretofore existing" between "former masters and slaves" would become "that between employer and hired labor" and that "freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages."
The order also had a curious stipulation: that freedmen would "not be supported in idleness."
It would, of course, be completely understandable if, after being forced to work entirely for another's gain for your whole life, the exercise of freedom that you might choose first would be a respite, and beyond that, you might decide who in your family should work outside the home and who in it. But that agency was largely denied to Black people.
A notice from Granger published days later in The Galveston Daily News informed the public that "no persons formerly slaves will be permitted to travel on the public thoroughfares without passes or permits from their employers." In other words, white people would still dictate where Black people could be.
The notice went on to say that "idleness is sure to be productive of vice, and humanity dictates that employment be furnished these people, while the interest of the commonwealth imperatively demands it, in order that the present crop may be secured."
In 1866, a Texas state constitutional convention adopted the state's Black Codes, codifying suffocating limits on Black autonomy. As the Texas State Library and Archives Commission describes these laws:
African Americans without jobs often were assigned to white guardians for work without pay. The penalty for quitting often included imprisonment for breach of contract. Other laws prevented freedmen from having free access to public facilities. Stiff fines were levied against African Americans for violating curfews, possessing firearms or displaying objectionable public behavior (harsh speeches or insulting gestures). They were not allowed to testify against whites, serve on juries or in state militias, or to vote.
In this way, the codes "outlined a status for African Americans not too much removed from their earlier condition as slaves."
Beyond this, for Black people in the 1870s, being a convict in Texas essentially meant relegation to enslavement, because that was when the state's convict leasing program took off.
The 13th Amendment, ratified in 1865, outlawed slavery and involuntary servitude, "except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted," an exception Southern states and businesses exploited, making routine the practice of leasing convicts -- usually Black convicts -- out as unpaid labor, generating tremendous profits in the process.
As Douglas Blackmon writes in the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Slavery by Another Name," his marvelous, devastating book about the system of convict leasing: "The concept of reintroducing the forced labor of Blacks as a means of funding government services was viewed by whites as an inherently practical method of eliminating the cost of building prisons and returning Blacks to their appropriate position in society."
And this labor was often brutal. Whereas enslavers had perverse financial incentives to keep the enslaved alive and relatively healthy -- to them, the enslaved were assets to be sold, passed down and borrowed against -- those who exploited convicts for their labor had no such incentives.
The question of labor is at the core of how we must understand emancipation and Reconstruction because American slavery, an entire capitalist system representing billions of dollars in wealth, was built on free Black labor, was brought to its knees and would have to be propped up; newly freed Black people were fed back to the machine to keep it running.
Some vestiges of the convict leasing system remain in place as convicts continue to be forced to perform free or extremely low-paying labor to produce a wide range of products, some of which you might have in your home now.
As an investigative report by The Associated Press published in January found: "The goods these prisoners produce wind up in the supply chains of a dizzying array of products found in most American kitchens, from Frosted Flakes cereal and Ball Park hot dogs to Gold Medal flour, Coca-Cola and Riceland rice."
Yes, some of the constraints placed on Black Americans during the emancipation and Reconstruction eras were addressed by the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, known as the Reconstruction Amendments. But not all of them.
Perhaps the best way to consider Juneteenth is not as the moment Black people attained freedom but as a moment in the long-running struggle to realize freedom. When slavery is replaced by a succession of systems -- Black codes, Jim Crow, mass incarceration -- that, though diminished in their brutality, oppress on the same principles, a true, comprehensive freedom still eludes.
As Corey Walker, the director of the program in African American studies at Wake Forest University, emphasizes, the idea of freedom, particularly for Black people in this country, is continuously being negotiated and contested, so "Juneteenth marks a moment in the ever-evolving and expanding project of American democracy."
"It is," he said, "a project that is never complete. It is never fulfilled, even at the moment of Juneteenth. And it's one that is ever evolving to this day."

Chinese Court Sends Activists To Jail on Subversion Charges: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Huang Xueqin, a journalist, and Wang Jianbing, a labor activist, were convicted of subversion, a vaguely worded charge long seen as a tool for muzzling dissent.
A court in southern China on Friday found a prominent feminist journalist guilty of endangering national security and sentenced her to five years in prison, Beijing's latest blow to civil society. A labor activist convicted of the same charge got a sentence of three years and six months.
The activities that prompted the arrest and conviction of the two, Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing, involved organizing discussions, providing support to other activists and receiving overseas training. The subversion charges and the sentences, handed down by the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court, were confirmed by Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists.
The legal action against Ms. Huang and Mr. Wang, which experts said was harsh even by China's standards, signals the shrinking space for independent discussion of social issues.
"We are seeing an almost zero-tolerance approach to even the mildest forms of civil society activism in China," said Thomas Kellogg, the executive director of the Georgetown Center for Asian Law. "This case is an example of that."
A former independent journalist, Ms. Huang, 35, became a prominent voice in China's #MeToo movement who helped women report cases of sexual harassment. Later, she traveled to Hong Kong and wrote essays about antigovernment protests there. Mr. Wang, 40, was a longtime activist on behalf of workers and people with disabilities. He also helped #MeToo victims to speak out.
Ms. Huang and Mr. Wang were arrested in 2021 and endured an unusually long pretrial detention of two years. The trial last September lasted a day.
The verdict did not come for nine months, even though China's criminal procedure law stipulates a maximum wait of three months, with an additional three-month extension for exceptional cases.
Experts say the charge -- "inciting subversion of the state" -- a national security crime carrying a harsher penalty than other charges typically used against activists, showed a newly aggressive effort to suppress discussion around issues like the rights of women and workers. Forums on such topics were tolerated and even encouraged more than a decade ago, said Yaqiu Wang, the research director for Hong Kong, China and Taiwan at Freedom House, a nonprofit based in Washington.
"Anything the government doesn't like is being characterized as a challenge to the Communist Party and a national security charge," Ms. Wang said.
Details about the case were not made public. But many legal documents pertaining to it have been posted on a GitHub webpage run by supporters and confirmed by Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a coalition of rights organizations. Reached by telephone on Friday, a spokeswoman for the Guangzhou Intermediate Court declined to provide any information.
The case against the two was built on several actions, including hosting social gatherings and participating in overseas online courses about "nonviolent movements," according to an indictment shared by supporters. These gatherings often focused on issues like the#MeToo movement, gay rights and job conditions for workers, friends of the defendants said.
Ms. Huang became a central figure in China's #MeToo movement in early 2018 when she established an online platform for people to post their accounts of sexual harassment. She also organized surveys that found that sexual harassment was widespread and unpunished, both at universities and in the workplace.
The movement has since been pushed underground as state censors moved to silence online discussion and stifle public support. The party has accused feminists of aiding what it called "hostile foreign forces," and officials have warned some activists that if they spoke out they would be seen as traitors.
Mr. Wang focused on providing education and legal support to laborers with occupational diseases and physical disabilities. More recently, he hosted discussions where activists could share their struggles and support one another.
Since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, the party has punished activists, lawyers, intellectuals and even tycoons who called for free speech and political rights. Dozens of activists have faced lengthy pretrial detentions and harsh prison sentences.
But the ruling Friday indicates an expanding notion of what is dangerous to public order.
"In the past, people who were charged with inciting subversion of the state usually said something about democracy or rule of law," said Ms. Wang of Freedom House. "With Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing, they were very much focused on helping victims and fostering a community of marginalized people. They weren't talking about politics."
The authorities detained the two at Mr. Wang's home in Guangzhou one day before Ms. Huang had planned to leave China to begin a master's program on gender studies in Britain. Both were held without access to lawyers for 47 days before any formal arrest notices were shared with family and friends, according to Chinese Human Rights Defenders.
Dozens of Mr. Wang and Ms. Huang's friends were questioned after their arrest, and many were forced to sign testimonies against them, according to Chinese Human Rights Defenders.
Not long after Mr. Wang was taken away, his father made a video appealing to the authorities.
"My son is not a bad guy," Wang Zhixue, his father, said in the video, which supporters of Mr. Wang and Ms. Huang posted online. "He has made so many contributions to society through public welfare work. What harm can he be to society?"
In late 2019, Ms. Huang was detained by the police in Guangzhou on charges of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble," a less serious charge the government has used in the past to silence activists like herself.
She was detained for three months. "This is Xueqin, and I'm back," she wrote in a message to a friend after her release in 2020. "One second of darkness doesn't make people blind."

National Security Trial In Hong Kong Convicts 14 Democracy Activists: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: As part of China's crackdown on even peaceful opposition, a court in Hong Kong convicted 14 people, who now face prison time along with dozens of others.
Fourteen democracy activists in Hong Kong were convicted on Thursday on national security charges, adding to the ranks of dozens of others -- once the vanguard of the city's opposition -- who may now become a generation of political prisoners.
The authorities had accused 47 pro-democracy figures, including Benny Tai, a former law professor, and Joshua Wong, a protest leader and founder of a student group, of conspiracy to commit subversion. Thirty-one of them had earlier pleaded guilty. On Thursday, judges picked by Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader convicted 14 of the remaining activists and acquitted two others. The charge carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
The convictions show how the authorities have used the sweeping powers of a national security law imposed by Beijing to quash dissent across broad swathes of society. Most of the defendants had already spent at least the last three years in detention before the 118-day trial ended.
Some of those accused are former lawmakers who joined politics after Hong Kong was returned to Chinese rule by the British in 1997. Others are activists and legislators who have advocated self-determination for Hong Kong with more confrontational tactics. Several, like Mr. Wong, who rose to fame as a teenage activist, were among the students leading large street occupations in 2014 for the right to vote.
Their offense: holding a primary election to improve their chances in citywide polls.
"The message from the authorities is clear: Any opposition activism, even the moderate kind, will no longer be tolerated," said Ho-fung Hung, an expert on Hong Kong politics at Johns Hopkins University.
The pro-democracy activists have said they were merely defending the rights of Hong Kong residents in the face of Beijing's tightening control over the city. Public alarm over shrinking freedoms in Hong Kong had set off enormous, at times violent, protests in 2019 and early 2020, mounting the greatest challenge to Chinese authority since 1989.
In response, China imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020, handing the authorities a powerful tool to round up critics like the 47 people on trial, including Mr. Tai, the law professor who had been a leading strategist for the pro-democracy camp, and Claudia Mo, a former lawmaker and veteran campaigner.
The authorities charged them with "conspiracy to commit subversion" over their efforts in 2020 to organize or take part in an unofficial primary election ahead of a vote for seats on the Legislative Council.
In the past, pro-democracy activists had held primaries, without issue, to select candidates to run in the election of the city's leader, Professor Hung said.
"The fact that they were arrested and convicted and even put behind bars for so long before the verdict manifests a fundamental change in Hong Kong's political environment: Free election, even the pretension of a free election, is gone," Professor Hung said.
The case the Hong Kong authorities had made against the activists is complicated, and based largely on a scenario that hasn't happened. Prosecutors said the unofficial primary election was problematic because the pro-democracy bloc was using it to win a majority in the legislature, which would then let them attempt to subvert the government. They accuse the activists of plotting to use such a majority to "indiscriminately" veto the government budget and ultimately force the city's leader to resign.
The judges ruled that the plan, if carried out, would have led to a "constitutional crisis," amounting to subversion under the national security law.
The authorities postponed the election, citing the pandemic. By the time the vote was held in late 2021, the activists had been arrested and the electoral rules had been rewritten to effectively disqualify pro-democracy candidates.
The trial of the 47 began in February of last year, after lengthy procedural delays.
Of the defendants, 31 entered guilty pleas, including Mr. Wong, who since 2020 has served prison sentences in other cases related to his activism. Four of them -- Au Nok-hin, a former lawmaker; Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung, former district officials; and Mike Lam, a grocery chain owner with political ambitions -- testified for the prosecution in exchange for a reduced sentence.
The 14 defendants who were convicted on Thursday included Leung Kwok-hung, a veteran activist known as "Long Hair" who pushed for welfare policies for the old and the poor; Lam Cheuk-ting, an anti-corruption investigator turned legislator; and Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist. The two defendants who were acquitted were Lawrence Lau, a lawyer, and Lee Yue-shun, a social worker. (Prosecutors said they intended to appeal the acquittals.)
After the verdict was handed down, family members of some of the defendants embraced each other and cried outside the courtroom. Johnson Yeung, a rights activist who attended the hearing, said that he was pained by the verdict, even though it was one that he and many others had expected.
"I thought about the face of each of the defendants and the friends remaining in jail. That made me sad. That made me want to hug them," he said.
Since the activists were arrested en masse, the city has all but eliminated opposition voices in its political institutions. Only approved "patriots" were allowed to run for election to the city's legislature in 2021. In March, Hong Kong passed its own national security law with extraordinary speed, at the behest of Beijing.
On Tuesday, the city used the new homegrown security law for the first time, detaining six people, including the activist Chow Hang Tung, for allegedly publishing "seditious materials" online. (Ms. Chow is already in prison over separate charges.)
Observers say that the political cases are testing the city's much-vaunted judicial independence. A trial against Jimmy Lai, a media tycoon and an outspoken critic of Beijing, is underway. Weeks ago, a court granted a government request to ban a popular protest song, raising concerns about speech.
The drawn-out legal process in the trial of the 47 democrats and lengthy detention have come at a heavy personal cost for the defendants. One former legislator, Wu Chi-wai, lost both parents while behind bars. Many of the defendants are parents of young children.
"Almost all of them are seeing their own lives being put on hold -- these are some of the best and brightest of Hong Kong, all of whom have seen their careers cut short as they endure month after month behind bars," said Thomas Kellogg, the executive director of the Georgetown Center for Asian Law. "A truly sad story."
Some activists have sought to highlight what they see as the resilience of the defendants over the past years. Owen Chow, a 27-year-old activist who was among those convicted, had studied Buddhist scriptures and the writings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese monk and peace activist, while in jail, according to his friends, who posted updates about him on social media on his behalf. And Mr. Lee, the social worker who was acquitted, wrote on Facebook that he had earned a law degree while on bail.
"This shows that whether you are in prison or outside prison, no matter what situation you are in, you can find something meaningful to do, even when there are a lot of restrictions," said Mr. Yeung, the activist who attended the hearing.
During sentencing, which will take place at a later date, the defendants are expected to be sorted into tiers, legal scholars have said. Those considered "principal offenders" could be sentenced to between 10 years and life imprisonment. "Active participants," between three and 10 years in prison. Others who are found guilty could be imprisoned or subject to unspecified "restrictions" for up to three years.

HONG KONG — Fourteen democracy activists in Hong Kong were convicted Thursday on national security charges, adding to the ranks of dozens of others — once the vanguard of the city’s opposition — who may now become a generation of political prisoners.
Authorities had accused 47 pro-democracy figures, including Benny Tai, a former law professor, and Joshua Wong, a protest leader and founder of a student group, of conspiracy to commit subversion. Thirty-one of them had earlier pleaded guilty. On Thursday, judges picked by Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed leader convicted 14 of the remaining activists and acquitted two others. The charge carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
The convictions show how authorities have used the sweeping powers of a national security law imposed by Beijing to quash dissent across broad swaths of society. Most of the defendants had already spent at least the last three years in detention before the 118-day trial ended.
Some of those accused are former lawmakers who joined politics after Hong Kong was returned to Chinese rule by the British in 1997. Others are activists and legislators who have advocated self-determination for Hong Kong with more confrontational tactics. Several, including Wong, who rose to fame as a teenage activist, were among the students leading large street occupations in 2014 for the right to vote.
Their offense: holding a primary election to improve their chances in citywide polls.
“The message from the authorities is clear: Any opposition activism, even the moderate kind, will no longer be tolerated,” said Ho-fung Hung, an expert on Hong Kong politics at Johns Hopkins University.
The pro-democracy activists have said they were merely defending the rights of Hong Kong residents in the face of Beijing’s tightening control over the city. Public alarm over shrinking freedoms in Hong Kong had set off enormous, at times violent, protests in 2019 and early 2020, mounting the greatest challenge to Chinese authority since 1989.
In response, China imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020, handing authorities a powerful tool to round up critics like the 47 people on trial, including Tai, the law professor who had been a leading strategist for the pro-democracy camp, and Claudia Mo, a former lawmaker and veteran campaigner.
Authorities charged them with “conspiracy to commit subversion” over their efforts in 2020 to organize or take part in an unofficial primary election before a vote for seats on the Legislative Council.
In the past, pro-democracy activists had held primaries, without issue, to select candidates to run in the election of the city’s leader, Hung said.
“The fact that they were arrested and convicted and even put behind bars for so long before the verdict manifests a fundamental change in Hong Kong’s political environment: Free election, even the pretension of a free election, is gone,” Hung said.
The case the Hong Kong authorities had made against the activists is complicated, and based largely on a scenario that hasn’t happened. Prosecutors said the unofficial primary election was problematic because the pro-democracy bloc was using it to win a majority in the legislature, which would then let them attempt to subvert the government. They accuse the activists of plotting to use such a majority to “indiscriminately” veto the government budget, and ultimately force the city’s leader to resign.
The judges ruled that the plan, if carried out, would have led to a “constitutional crisis,” amounting to subversion under the national security law.
Authorities postponed the election, citing the pandemic. By the time the vote was held in late 2021, the activists had been arrested and the electoral rules had been rewritten to effectively disqualify pro-democracy candidates.
The trial of the 47 began in February of last year, after lengthy procedural delays.
Of the defendants, 31 entered guilty pleas, including Wong, who since 2020 has served prison sentences in other cases related to his activism. Four of them — Au Nok-hin, a former lawmaker; Andrew Chiu and Ben Chung, former district officials; and Mike Lam, a grocery chain owner with political ambitions — testified for the prosecution in exchange for a reduced sentence.
The 14 defendants who were convicted Thursday included Leung Kwok-hung, a veteran activist known as “Long Hair” who pushed for welfare policies for the old and the poor; Lam Cheuk-ting, an anti-corruption investigator turned legislator; and Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist. The two defendants who were acquitted were Lawrence Lau, a lawyer, and Lee Yue-shun, a social worker. (Prosecutors said they intended to appeal the acquittals.)
After the verdict was handed down, family members of some of the defendants embraced each other and cried outside the courtroom. Johnson Yeung, a rights activist who attended the hearing, said he was pained by the verdict, even though it was one that he and many others had expected.
“I thought about the face of each of the defendants and the friends remaining in jail. That made me sad. That made me want to hug them,” he said.
Since the activists were arrested en masse, the city has all but eliminated opposition voices in its political institutions. Only approved “patriots” were allowed to run for election to the city’s legislature in 2021. In March, Hong Kong passed its own national security law with extraordinary speed, at the behest of Beijing.
On Tuesday, the city used the new homegrown security law for the first time, detaining six people, including activist Chow Hang Tung, for allegedly publishing “seditious materials” online. (Chow is already in prison over separate charges.)
Observers say that the political cases are testing the city’s much-vaunted judicial independence. A trial against Jimmy Lai, a media tycoon and an outspoken critic of Beijing, is underway. Weeks ago, a court granted a government request to ban a popular protest song, raising concerns about speech.
The drawn-out legal process in the trial of the 47 democrats and lengthy detention have come at a heavy personal cost for the defendants. One former legislator, Wu Chi-wai, lost both parents while behind bars. Many of the defendants are parents of young children.
“Almost all of them are seeing their own lives being put on hold — these are some of the best and brightest of Hong Kong, all of whom have seen their careers cut short as they endure month after month behind bars,” said Thomas Kellogg , the executive director of the Georgetown Center for Asian Law. “A truly sad story.”
Some activists have sought to highlight what they see as the resilience of the defendants over the past years. Owen Chow, a 27-year-old activist who was among those convicted, had studied Buddhist scriptures and the writings of Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese monk and peace activist, while in jail, according to his friends, who posted updates about him on social media on his behalf. And Lee, the social worker who was acquitted, wrote on Facebook that he had earned a law degree while on bail.
“This shows that whether you are in prison or outside prison, no matter what situation you are in, you can find something meaningful to do, even when there are a lot of restrictions,” said Yeung, the activist who attended the hearing.
During sentencing, which will take place at a later date, the defendants are expected to be sorted into tiers, legal scholars have said. Those considered “principal offenders” could be sentenced to between 10 years and life imprisonment. “Active participants,” between three and 10 years in prison. Others who are found guilty could be imprisoned or subject to unspecified “restrictions” for up to three years.

Fear a Trump Foreign Policy That's Effective: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Donald Trump may be regularly depicted as an impetuous toddler in chief, but he appears to possess genuine convictions about international relations. Ever since he gave an interview to Playboy magazine in 1990 decrying Mikhail Gorbachev for failing to hold the Soviet empire together ("not a firm enough hand") and praising the Chinese Communist leadership for crushing the student uprising at Tiananmen Square ("they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength"), Mr. Trump has extolled authoritarian leaders as possessing the right stuff, while he has dismissed democratic ones as weak and feckless.
This impulse is not a new phenomenon for the United States; it dates back to World War I and World War II, when leading American conservatives praised foreign autocrats such as Kaiser Wilhelm II, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Francisco Franco as their ideological comrades in arms. Until now, however, no modern president has lauded autocracy as a model for America.
During his four years in office, Mr. Trump blustered about alliances and praised foreign dictators but never actually upended America's foreign policy. That could change in a second Trump administration. The former president is poised to adopt a radical program centered on constructive engagement with foreign strongmen and hostility toward democratic allies; it would include abandoning NATO. It would convert America from a dominant economic and military power into what Mr. Trump purports to abhor -- a global loser.
To understand why Mr. Trump's approach might well differ from the one he took in his initial term, it's helpful to look at the foreign policy advisers who are being talked about as potential members of a new Trump administration. They can be divided into two camps, which might be called restorationists and revisionists.
Restorationists are establishment Republicans, such as the former secretary of state Mike Pompeo and the former national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien, who want to go back in time -- specifically, to Ronald Reagan's foreign policy hawkishness and staunch internationalism, which they believe led straight to the fall of the Berlin Wall and victory in the Cold War. During the Trump presidency, they worked overtime to maneuver Mr. Trump in this direction, pushing him to adopt tough stances toward Iran, Russia and China while maintaining ties to traditional allies in Asia and Europe.
Now, in a variety of interviews, speeches and books, they have been sketching out their vision for a second Trump term -- one that would shore up America's alliances, pursue peace through strength and confront Iran, Russia and China -- while camouflaging their crusading Reaganite views in a veneer of Trumpian nationalism.
Revisionists, by contrast, are "America First" advocates who espouse a much harder-edged approach and, more often than not, want to go it alone.
Organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the America First Policy Institute, the two main think tanks vying to staff the next Trump administration, have been vetting potential appointees to establish a government in waiting. As Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general and former Trump national security official, observed in his 2021 memoir, "War by Other Means," "Our problem was that we did not always know who our enemies were; in some cases, they were our own political appointees." Mr. Trump himself has loudly complained about many of the advisers he appointed, such as John Bolton.
The conservative activists around him wish to install purists who will preach "America First" precepts, not least the dogma that America's security isn't tied to Europe's because, as Mr. Trump recently put it, "an ocean" separates the territories.
The revisionists don't place as much value on our membership in NATO and are generally ardent proponents of a longstanding dream on the right of a Fortress America that can strike unilaterally whenever and wherever it pleases, unencumbered by nettlesome international alliances and organizations.
Take Mr. Trump's former ambassador to Germany and acting national intelligence director, Richard Grenell. He has opposed Sweden's and Finland's joining NATO while supporting far-right populists in Serbia, Guatemala and elsewhere. Then there is Russ Vought. A former Trump budget director who might serve as the White House chief of staff, Mr. Vought has decried American aid to Ukraine and stated that he would reassess "the old idea of NATO's collective defense."
Mr. Kellogg, who might serve as defense secretary under Mr. Trump, is not a staunch opponent of sending aid to Ukraine, but even he has suggested that we should be prepared to use the threat of cutting it off to push the country into peace talks with Moscow -- a recipe for pre-emptive surrender.
Elbridge Colby, a former Trump Defense Department official who is widely seen as a top contender to become national security adviser if Mr. Trump wins re-election, typifies the radicalism of the revisionist camp. Mr. Colby has insisted that confronting China requires slashing support to Ukraine, and he recently criticized Britain's foreign secretary, David Cameron, for "lecturing" Republican politicians about the imperative to assist Kyiv, deeming it "foreign interference."
Mr. Trump's hostility to sending aid to Ukraine suggests that he would most likely be receptive to a deal with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, allowing him to operate freely in Central and Eastern Europe -- in the name of stability and peace. By the same token, for all his bluff and bombast about the China threat, Mr. Trump, unlike President Biden, has never indicated that he would stand by Taiwan were China to invade.
He appears to view American alliances with South Korea and Japan with skepticism, if not outright hostility. Less than a year after the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, met with Mr. Biden in April to announce new security agreements, Mr. Trump could simply decide that he had no intention of honoring America's commitments abroad.
Rupturing America's alliances would lead to arms races and nuclear proliferation in Asia and Europe. Nationalists like Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, and Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, who is known as a "little Putin," would be emboldened to strengthen their ties with the Kremlin and undermine European security.
And the domestic consequences could be severe. Many of Mr. Trump's economic advisers, including the former trade chief Robert Lighthizer (a leading candidate to be the Treasury secretary under Mr. Trump), are apparently intent on pursuing the Great Depression redux -- waging trade wars with Europe and Asia. They're floating a host of other risky measures, including curbing the independence of the Federal Reserve, weakening the dollar to try to increase exports and imposing high tariffs on goods from China and Europe.
While Mr. Biden's new tariffs on China aggressively target the solar industry and electric cars, Mr. Trump wants to decouple the world's two largest economies from each other. These measures would weaken the confidence of foreign investors and fuel higher inflation.
With Ukraine and Russia at war, China threatening its neighbors and the Middle East aflame, warnings of a new world war already abound. Add in Mr. Trump's strongman predilections -- purging the State Department, the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. as redoubts of the "deep state," cozying up to Mr. Putin, threatening China and reportedly planning to send assassination squads into Mexico to target drug kingpins -- and the odds of a calamity rise.
Would the damage be irreversible? Chancellor Otto von Bismarck of Germany supposedly remarked that "God has a special providence for fools, drunkards and the United States of America." But Mr. Trump's return might test even the Almighty's patience.
Mr. Trump's economic and foreign policy nationalism would subvert the preponderance of power that America has enjoyed since 1945 and that he has promised to bolster. It has been threatened from without but never from within. As he vows to upend America's relations with the rest of the globe, the danger is not that Mr. Trump would fail to live up to his principles. It's that he would.

Modernism That Sits Lightly in Nature: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An architectural firm waited years to design for clients who wanted a modern look in the Hamptons -- it uses the sky, the ocean and dunes as muses.
In 1980s Sagaponack, a village in the Hamptons, new houses were awash in shingles and classical columns, to the dismay of the architect Fred Stelle.
"It was raging postmodernism," he said, still sounding bewildered. He took modest architectural jobs expanding old houses with contemporary extensions and bided his time. Finally in 2001, he said, a Manhattan creative director requested a fully modern 2,500-square-foot new house.
Then came one client after another. Some are famous like Calvin Klein, Aerin Lauder and Michael Kors, sprinkling stardust on a firm that is housed in a converted potato barn in Bridgehampton.
As the business expanded, Mr. Stelle added three partners, Viola Rouhani, Michael Lomont and Eleanor Donnelly. Their firm, Stelle Lomont Rouhani Architects, quietly became known for a brand of beach modernism that sits lightly in nature, with million-dollar water views of sea grass and open skies.
The houses grew, along with the business. "Sometimes they got big," said Mr. Stelle, 77, recalling one with 30,000 square feet.
Up and down the Eastern Seaboard, where the pleasures of a sunny day can dissolve into a roiling superstorm in the course of an afternoon, a confluence of laws and constraints point away from traditional architecture. Flood maps from the Federal Emergency Management Agency dictate construction, low-lying structures must sit atop steel posts to let rushing water surge safely underneath, and local height restrictions leave scant room for an attic, let alone a sloped roof.
A flat roof maximizes living space below and can host a 13-kilowatt solar array, planters thick with sedum or a mahogany sun deck. Atop a 4,900-square-foot house on Mecox Bay -- with interiors by the designer Shawn Henderson -- the partners gave a Manhattan real estate executive and his wife all three.
On a spit of land between the ocean and a pond, gossamer floor-to-ceiling white curtains by the interior designer Julie Hillman billow at open Fleetwood sliding doors, in high-performance glass crystalline rather than tinted "like very dark sunglasses," Mr. Lomont, 58, said.
"My houses are all glass, with water vistas to feed your soul," said Deborra-Lee Furness Jackman, the Australian actress.
She worked with the firm for more than six years to completely replace an unremarkable two-story tear-down in the East Hampton woods. She also acquired and remade a modest midcentury house next door. That house is now stained black, its lot folded into her waterfront compound. She requested cozy elegance, whimsy, and the feeling of a museum gallery in tune with her artistic aspirations. "I walk into any space, and I start creating," she said. Her estranged husband, Hugh Jackman, attended the design meetings, but "this was my passion piece," she said.
Ms. Furness Jackman admits that she is not good at compromise, but she listened whenever the architects and the designers said "That won't work." An early version of the layout had two stories, but one day Mr. Stelle lopped off the top to produce an unexpectedly elegant single-story pavilion at ground level, above a tall walkout basement with a screening room, an art studio and the garage.
Ms. Rouhani, 54, said she developed the plan "to incorporate this idea of drama" casual enough for family life.
A visitor might nominate the 15-foot asymmetrical pedestal dining table that Ms. Donnelly modeled to scale in Plasticine, and then carved full-size in blue foam.
After 18 months of development, the massive bleached walnut table, with a steel interior structure reinforcing its 11-foot cantilever, arrived by crane at one end of the sprawling great room, on the main level, and got welded into the floor beams. "Design is my passion," Ms. Furness Jackman said, and "cantilever is my favorite word."
At a property in Water Mill, Ms. Rouhani started from scratch and fortified a new design with disastrous weather in mind. Concerned that a beach cottage that once belonged to Christie Brinkley would not survive another storm like Hurricane Sandy, the architects shifted the replacement house back from the ocean as a further precaution, and LaGuardia Design Group restored the dunes.
When new owners bought the property for $ 11.7 million in 2017, they also tapped Stelle Lomont Rouhani and got a free-standing garage topped with a pool house. In charge of the interiors, Ms. Donnelly, 51, oversaw the painting of the walls. They are white, though the décor pops with pink and orange accessories. "There's no rainbow of fruit flavors in our architectural palette," Ms. Donnelly said, though she quickly added that color was possible at request. A cedar house in Amagansett for George Yabu and Glenn Pushelberg, the Canadian interior designers, added exterior zinc-wall panels that are nontoxic, recyclable and reflect heat from the sun.
The couple owns homes in other places, but Mr. Yabu said they considered this one their "effortless" primary residence from late spring through October. "The beach is really us, and this time of year we yearn for it," he said.
The upper level thrusts daringly toward the dunes while maintaining a respectful distance of five feet. The men wanted to step out of the lower level directly onto sand, so Mr. Stelle advised them to move fast and get grandfathered by the building department to keep the new structure "off stilts."
They designed their own interiors, in a creative conversation with the architects that Mr. Yabu termed a "love fest."
Now, a dozen years on, Mr. Stelle still brings colorful eggs freshly laid by his Araucana hens as a thank you when he arrives to show the house to prospective new clients. "Architects can be prickly, but he is supernice," Mr. Pushelberg said.
For a Manhattan real estate executive and his wife, the firm designed a 4,900-square-foot house on Mecox Bay with a roof big enough to contain a solar array and a sun deck.

Breakfast, However Sweet, Was Never This Exciting: [Review]

Full text: Starring Jerry Seinfeld in his feature directing debut, "Unfrosted: The Pop-Tarts Story" is the only corporate saga whose main ingredient is high-fructose sarcasm.
Pop-Tarts were invented over four hectic months in 1964. Jerry Seinfeld has been developing jokes about them for over 10 years, first in his stand-up act, and now as a full-fledged, fully ridiculous feature comedy targeted to the audience's sweet-and-salty dopamine receptors. "Unfrosted," directed by Seinfeld with a script by him and longtime collaborators Spike Feresten, Andy Robin and Barry Marder, gives the comic his first-ever live action leading film role as Bob Cabana, a fictional cereal flack who revolutionizes the breakfast industry. (William Post, the real-life person who helped create Pop-Tarts, died in February at the age of 96.) Cinema has endured branded biopics on everything from Air Jordans to the BlackBerry to Flamin' Hot Cheetos. This is the only corporate saga whose main ingredient is high-fructose sarcasm.
Should we care about the history of the Pop-Tart? Seinfeld postures that the Kellogg's launch of a mylar-wrapped, shelf-stable, heatable pastry is a technological innovation on the scale of the space race and the Manhattan Project. One pivotal move comes when Cabana hires Donna Stankowski (Melissa McCarthy) away from NASA's beakers of Tang. As the launch date nears, the cinematographer William Pope shoots close-ups of scorching toaster springs with the drama of a roiling booster rocket.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The film is as estranged from the facts as Pop-Tarts are from genuine fruit. Still, it's true that Battle Creek, Mich. -- "cereal's Silicon Valley," Seinfeld once cracked -- was ground zero of a Cold War rivalry between Kellogg's and General Foods to sell a breakfast that broke free from the need for a bowl and spoon. Here, the General Foods' owner Marjorie Post (Amy Schumer), once the richest woman in America, swans about in jewel-toned turbans and jets off to Moscow to enlist Nikita Khrushchev (Dean Norris) in her cause. At the same time, the dimwitted head of Kellogg's (Jim Gaffigan) allows his company to align with President John F. Kennedy (Bill Burr), Chef Boy Ardee (Bobby Moynihan), the celebrity fitness guru Jack LaLanne (James Marsden), and the early computer Univac who acts up in ways that recall Bing's sexually charged A.I. chatbot. Things take an even darker turn with the entrance of a vengeful milkman (Christian Slater) and a threatening figure named El Sucre (Felix Solis) who's aware that millions of dollars hinge on access to his addictive white powder.
As junk food goes, "Unfrosted" is delightful with a sprinkle of morbidity. Building on last December's publicity stunt where an anthropomorphic Pop-Tart cooked and served itself to the Kansas State Wildcats, we're here treated to a funeral where the deceased is given Full Cereal Honors. I will spoil nothing except to say Snap, Crackle and Pop have a ceremonial duty.
The jokes spill forth so fast that there's no time for the shtick to get soggy. Yet, the film also crams its running time with goofy detours, like a subplot where the voice of Tony the Tiger (Hugh Grant, once again seizing any opportunity to wear a fatuous cravat) leads his fellow mascots in a rebellion. Despite all these famous faces splashing into the frame, the scene stealer is the child actor Eleanor Sweeney making her debut as an opinionated taste tester. She's g-r-r-reat.

Tesla's Board Stands Firm With Musk On Pay Plan: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company's directors are asking shareholders to again approve the multibillion-dollar compensation plan and to move the company's registration to Texas, from Delaware.
Facing criticism that it is overly beholden to Elon Musk, Tesla's board of directors said on Wednesday that it would essentially give him everything he wanted, including the biggest pay package in corporate history.
If setbacks in court and the car market have induced any soul searching among Tesla's board, there was no sign of it in the latest announcement. If anything, the board doubled down on backing Mr. Musk, Tesla's chief executive, risking riling up activist investors and more litigation.
The board's decision to ask shareholders to endorse a compensation plan for Mr. Musk that is worth about $ 47 billion came less than three months after a Delaware judge voided the same 10-year pay package. The judge said that it was excessive and that the company had failed to properly disclose details about it to shareholders who approved it in 2018.
Tesla will now provide shareholders more information about how the plan was devised and ask them to approve it again. That vote will take place as investors are increasingly worried about the electric car company because its sales are declining, and its stock has fallen more than one-third this year. In addition, Mr. Musk has not presented much of a plan to restore the company's momentum.
Greg Varallo, a lawyer who represented shareholders in the Delaware case, declined to comment Wednesday on steps his team might take. But the board's action is likely to prompt more lawsuits against the company, which is under legal pressure from regulators, customers and people who say they have been victims of faults in Tesla's driver-assistance system.
Two days before the move to restore Mr. Musk's status as one of the world's richest people, Tesla told employees that it would lay off 10 percent of its work force, or about 14,000 people.
"The optics certainly don't look good," said Jason Schloetzer, an associate professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business who studies corporate governance.
There is no sign that Tesla's board is trying to exert tighter control over Mr. Musk, whose endorsement of right-wing conspiracy theories has alienated many potential customers. On the contrary, in documents filed Wednesday for a shareholders meeting in June, the board signaled that it stood firmly behind Mr. Musk.
The board asked shareholders to approve moving Tesla's corporate domicile to Texas from Delaware, a change Mr. Musk called for on the day the Delaware court struck down his pay package in January. And the board asked shareholders to reappoint two directors with close ties to Mr. Musk: the media executive James Murdoch, who has vacationed with Mr. Musk, and Kimbal Musk, his brother.
The company's moves effectively amounted to a rebuke of the judge who struck down Mr. Musk's 2018 pay plan, Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery. In her ruling, the judge chided the board for lax oversight of Mr. Musk.
"The board and the shareholders were controlled by Musk," Lynne Vincent, associate professor at Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management, said of the court decision. "The people who were advocating for this deal were not active protectors of shareholder interests. They were embedded in his personal lives and financial lives."
By asking shareholders to reinstate Mr. Musk's compensation, Tesla's board is trying to render Chancellor McCormick's decision moot.
"We do not agree with what the Delaware Court decided, and we do not think that what the Delaware Court said is how corporate law should or does work," Robyn Denholm, the chair of Tesla's board, said in a message to shareholders Wednesday. The company has separately said it plans to appeal the judge's decision.
Ms. Denholm said it would be "fundamentally unfair" to deny Mr. Musk compensation that he had been promised. She noted that Tesla had not paid Mr. Musk anything for the past six years besides the compensation plan that was struck down.
But Mr. Musk has earned billions from his Tesla shares. Brian Dunn, a former compensation consultant and visiting lecturer at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said pay plans were supposed to provide incentives for executives to perform in the future, not reward them for work in the past.
"There is nothing in the plan that requires him to focus on Tesla," Mr. Dunn said, noting Mr. Musk's ownership of X, the social media platform, and ventures like SpaceX. "It's evidence of the board still being very complacent," he added.
Some investors found the fairness argument jarring given Tesla's recent troubles.
"Asking for people to approve one of the largest pay packages of all time, when the company is failing to meet current targets and terminating 10 percent of employees, it's terrible timing," said Antoine Argouges, chief executive of Tulipshare, an activist investor group.
Tulipshare has proposed a shareholder vote on whether executive compensation at Tesla should be contingent on meeting standards on carbon emissions and worker rights. Tesla's board opposes the proposal.
Ms. Denholm framed the decision to leave Delaware as a logical step for a company with a growing presence in Texas, rather than an attempt to escape the state's justice system. "We have a significant number of manufacturing, operations and engineering employees in Texas, and our executives are based there," she told shareholders.
She insisted that the board is independent. The board member who assessed Mr. Musk's compensation plan, Ms. Denholm said, was Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, a former human resources executive at Kellogg and Walgreens who does not appear to have any personal ties to him.
Tesla's board members are listening to shareholders, the board said in a proxy statement filed on Wednesday. "The board maintains an active, year-round dialogue with our largest stockholders to ensure that Tesla's board and management understand and consider the issues that matter most to our stockholders," the statement said.
Ms. Denholm and the board did not respond to statements Mr. Musk made in January that if he wasn't given control of over 25 percent of the company's stock he would pursue certain ventures outside Tesla. He currently owns about 13 percent of Tesla's shares, down from 22 percent after he sold billions of dollars of stock to finance the acquisition of Twitter, now known as X.
Ms. Vincent of Syracuse University said Tesla had offered little information on how decisions on layoffs and compensation were made. "I don't think any of this has been transparent," she said.
Tesla's board did not address concerns that the company was losing its grip on the market for electric cars. Ms. Denholm presented a rosy view of Tesla's future.
"Tesla is a nimble organization with an unmatched pace of innovation that has resulted in products and services that surpass all expectations driven by visionary leadership and, most importantly, the best and most dedicated employees in the world," she said in her message to shareholders.
The decision to fire 10 percent of those employees, she added, was needed to reduce costs, increase productivity and "prepare us for our next phase of growth."

University Exits a Stormy Past to Find Athletic Success: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It wasn't just a gold Pontiac Trans Am with a painted bird on the hood. It was the car that Texas A&M gave to Eric Dickerson in 1979, when he was a top high school running back prospect, in the hope that he would become an Aggie. Instead, he drove from his hometown, Sealy, Texas, to Dallas and Southern Methodist University.
At the time, Mr. Dickerson's cars (S.M.U. gave him one, too) were a symbol of the wretched excess of big-time college sports. It was a time when boosters in the Southwest Conference doled out " $ 100 handshakes" and the S.M.U. faithful winked as they talked about how they had the best football team money could buy.
The S.M.U. Mustangs went 34-11-1 over Mr. Dickerson's four years -- the team's vaunted Pony Express era. It gave the oilmen and real estate developers and business titans across Texas who funneled cash to their alma mater bragging rights at the Petroleum Club of Houston and country clubs in Dallas.
And it drove the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which governs college sports, nuts. The organization had rules to stop those kinds of pay-for-play shenanigans and investigators to chase down overeager boosters, who mostly eluded their grasp. Mr. Dickerson remembers that one N.C.A.A. investigator visited his home so frequently, the guy would sit at his kitchen table and eat dinner with his family.
The N.C.A.A. eventually caught up to S.M.U. (Mr. Dickerson was long gone by then, well into a Hall of Fame career in the National Football League.) In 1987, the organization handed the football team the so-called death penalty, the severest punishment it has ever imposed on a Division I school for rules violations. The program was shut down for two seasons, and the university's reputation was tarnished.
Ever since, S.M.U. has wandered the college sports landscape looking for a home, and a way to share in the ever-increasing riches associated with top-level amateur athletics.
It took nearly four decades, $ 354 million in major construction and facilities upgrades, and a U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized S.M.U.'s original sin -- allowing players to profit financially from their athletic skill -- but the university has found its way back. Last summer, S.M.U. was invited to join the Atlantic Coast Conference this July.
It wasn't cheap. S.M.U. was admitted to the A.C.C. only after agreeing to forgo nine years of conference broadcast revenues, or $ 270 million, to avoid diluting the pot for incumbent members.
For those wanting to trace the evolution of big-time college sports over the past half-century, there may be no better example of the shifting views on the role of money -- and whether student-athletes should get any -- than S.M.U.
The N.C.A.A. has lost much of its authority now that players can be compensated through name-image-likeness rules, or N.I.L., which effectively allow athletes to be paid by sponsors or donor groups known as collectives. It is staring down a number of lawsuits and challenges to its longstanding amateur model. In a bid to maintain some relevance, the organization has called for a series of changes that would pave the way for the top moneymaking schools to form a new division that would more closely resemble professional sports.
In the meantime, universities' search for television money has changed the map of athletic conferences. The Big Ten, for instance, was once concentrated in the Midwest; now it has 18 teams and stretches from Oregon and California to New Jersey. By that measure, expanding the Atlantic Coast Conference into Texas isn't much of a leap.
"What started more than 150 years ago with football being considered an extracurricular activity that benefited student-athletes and offered a glue for a school community to come back to campus -- 'Boola Boola' and all that -- has morphed into a tremendous industry," said Oliver Luck, a longtime college sports administrator who was a star collegiate quarterback himself and is now a consultant. "And you got to call it an industry. There's lots of money and lots of interest."
Mr. Dickerson was back on campus recently, marveling at the sun sparkling off the new buildings and the six-figure income that some of the current Mustang football players are earning. And these days football is far from the only sport where athletes share in the spoils of economic success. One S.M.U. volleyball player, Alex Glover, makes well into six figures as a social media influencer.
Looked at a certain way, Mr. Dickerson thought, S.M.U. had been less a rogue program than one ahead of its time. He and his teammates had merely been on the ground floor of what has become a $ 17 billion ecosystem of big-time college sports. The money being reaped by current college athletes, he said, was long overdue.
"Those jerseys that schools sell don't run around the field by themselves," he said.
'Amateur is out the door'
S.M.U.'s new era is personified by Ms. Glover, who merged her two passions -- volleyball and social media -- into a side hustle as a social influencer.
"I wanted to take people on a deep dive of how a Division I student-athlete operates from day to day," Ms. Glover said. "There's a lot more going on than showing up for practice and games."
Ms. Glover scripts and shoots witty, fast-paced Instagram videos for a series called "Day in the Life of a D-1 Volleyballer." She takes her followers to the gym, to the classroom and on walks with her dogs, as well as offering fashion and beauty tips. She also was a captain on a team that won an American Athletic Conference championship, and she completed undergraduate degrees in engineering and data science. She will complete a master's in management science in May.
Ms. Glover is not paid by a collective, but Kellogg's Frosted Flakes and Ulta Beauty are among her more than 40 sponsors.
"For me, beyond the money, N.I.L. has given me a sense of freedom and pushed me to learn these different skills as far as content creation and running a business" said Ms. Glover, who has written an e-book called "An Athlete's Strategy to Scoring NIL Deals."
For athletes in marquee sports like football and men's basketball, however, the experience has been more unsettling. Jake Bailey, a receiver on the football team who graduated in December with a degree in sports management, wrote a paper on the effects of N.I.L. on student-athletes. Along with the money, he wrote, came more unfamiliar responsibilities like managing your finances.
"The lump sums of money being thrown around is life changing for many players and their families," Mr. Bailey said, adding: "Amateur is out the door. We're pros."
Six years ago, when he was coming out of high school in San Clemente, Calif., there was no money for colleges to dangle beyond the value of a scholarship. Instead, recruiters pitched their facilities and academics and treated him as a superstar on campus visits.
"It was about the glitz and glamour," Mr. Bailey said.
He chose Rice University in Houston and led the Owls in all-purpose yards -- yards gained on runs, receptions and returns -- as a sophomore and in receiving as a junior. Mr. Bailey believed he was ready for a bigger stage and entered the transfer portal. Now schools could woo him with the promise of cash.
"I never brought money up," Mr. Bailey said, "but the coaches would tell you where you fit on the scale of who was making this and what they were paying."
Mr. Bailey chose S.M.U. but said he was not one of those making six figures. He does make enough to have set up a limited liability company to manage his taxes. In the locker room, he said, his teammates never discuss money. Just as it did in the Pony Express era, however, the parking lot tells all. Mr. Bailey can see who are at the top of the pay scale by the Dodge Chargers and Ford Mustangs they drive.
Last fall, Mr. Bailey was a captain and a leading receiver on a Mustang team that won the American Athletic Conference championship. With a season of eligibility left, he will pursue a graduate degree and play for S.M.U. in the A.C.C. this year.
Mr. Bailey also got a raise.
'Back where we belong'
Gerald Turner, 78, is a native Texan with a honeysuckle drawl who offers cleareyed opinions delivered in full paragraphs. (He asks reporters to tape him to keep up.) By the nature of his position as S.M.U.'s president, they usually end with an ask. He understands what is important to Texans. He skinned-and-grinned with political heavyweights, business titans and federal officials for a decade to land the George W. Bush Presidential Center on campus.
He came to S.M.U. in 1995 with a mandate to make the university a national destination for academics and rebuild a reputation badly scarred by the football scandal. He has raised nearly $ 3 billion for 44 development projects, among them engineering and education buildings, five residential halls and a $ 140 million renovation and expansion of the highly regarded Cox School of Business.
S.M.U.'s professional schools climbed in rankings, undergraduate acceptance rates shrank as incoming freshmen's test scores rose, and the university attracted more students from out of state.
Last summer, Dr. Turner called members of the board of trustees and donors to his conference room in the Perkins Administration Building to tell them that S.M.U. finally had the pieces in place to land a seat at the adults' table of college athletics.
Dr. Turner understood the hold that athletics, particularly football, could have on a university. He was previously the chancellor at the University of Mississippi and an administrator at the University of Oklahoma. Shortly after arriving on campus, Dr. Turner set about rehabbing S.M.U.'s athletic facilities. In 2000, the 32,000-seat Gerald J. Ford Stadium opened on campus with a subtle design and an emphasis on community.
The football stadium was sunk into the southern edge of the campus near the Boulevard, a grassy, tree-lined parkway that welcomes visitors to the heart of campus. The Boulevard would be S.M.U.'s answer to the Grove at Ole Miss, an upscale tailgate space where anyone who was anyone had to be seen and that everyone could enjoy.
"If you're not having winning seasons, there's got to be something bigger than football to get fans there," Dr. Turner said.
The Boulevard was an immediate hit. The reinvigorated football program not so much. S.M.U. did not return to a bowl game until 2009, and, since returning to the field in 1989, the Mustangs have managed just 10 winning seasons as they moved through three midtier conferences.
Still, over the past decade, the university renovated its basketball arena and built a field house, an aquatics center and a soccer stadium. All were improvements necessary to attract the attention of a Power Five conference.
The A.C.C. made the most sense. Beyond athletics, the conference offered an opportunity to stand academically alongside powerhouse state universities like Virginia and North Carolina as well as smaller, elite private schools such as Duke and Wake Forest.
Still, it was going to be a heavy lift, and Dr. Turner made sure his board members knew S.M.U. would have to give the A.C.C. an offer it could not refuse.
"Here's what we want to offer, but, you know, I can't do it unless you guys tell me to," Dr. Turner recalled telling the board. "We'll tell them that we will give up roughly the $ 30 million it would get from ESPN for adding us for up to nine years. They could use it for an incentive pool or whatever they wanted."
Then came the ask. Dr. Turner believed the people in the boardroom as well as other deep-pocketed alums would make up the difference to help the university's athletic department add coaching and support staff and increase salaries that would help every Mustang program compete at the top level of Division I.
"It's going to cost each of you probably a million a year for the first five years," Dr. Turner said.
In September, seven days after the A.C.C. officially invited S.M.U. to become a member, the university raised more than $ 100 million from 30 key donors and trustees.
"This is a core group who lived through the resentment and hurt feelings of the death penalty and understood this was a healing moment," Dr. Turner said. "It puts us back where we belong."
Still, S.M.U. paid a steep price for an uncertain future. One mainstay of the A.C.C., Florida State, wants out of the conference badly enough that it recently sued the league and claimed that it mismanaged its members' media rights and imposed "draconian" exit fees of $ 572 million for the Seminoles to leave.
On the Hilltop, as the S.M.U. campus is known, there are no regrets. The football stadium's $ 100 million Garry Weber End Zone Complex is loud and dusty, but its locker rooms, weight room, meeting rooms, and full kitchen and training table will be ready for S.M.U.'s 484 student-athletes come August.
"We understand that the ground is still shifting, and no one really knows where this is going to end up," David B. Miller, the chairman of S.M.U.'s board, said. "But it's still better to be inside that process instead of on the outside looking in."
A game of liar's poker
While gaining entrance to the A.C.C. was a negotiation between well-endowed universities and big donors, the brave new world of name, image and likeness is murky at best. How else to explain the N.I.L. valuation of $ 3.2 million for Arch Manning, a backup quarterback at the University of Texas, three times last year's salary for San Francisco's Super Bowl quarterback, Brock Purdy?
No one in college athletics disputes that the current economy of unregulated name, image and likeness is essentially play-for-pay. Alongside the transfer portal, which allows student-athletes to shop their skills for a potential starting position and more money, the best-funded institutions land the best athletes at the highest prices.
Chris Schoemann, executive director of S.M.U.'s Boulevard Collective, which doles out the university's athlete payments, likens the current marketplace to a game of liar's poker.
"Everyone wants to seem bigger than they are," he said.
To that end, Mr. Schoemann is vague on numbers, allowing that a healthy collective -- which he says S.M.U.'s is -- requires $ 5 million to $ 8 million annually for the football and men's and women's basketball teams. There are benchmarks that players and their representatives either already know or Mr. Schoemann will tell them if they inquire. A top quarterback in a Power Five conference, for example, averages about $ 550,000 a year.
How many Mustang football players earn more than six figures?
"More than a handful," he said.
For now, what drive the marketplace are talent and the financial wherewithal to take big risks for even bigger rewards. Rick Hart, S.M.U.'s athletic director, said it was difficult to isolate what it really cost to operate a competitive athletic program because N.I.L., the transfer portal and conference affiliation were all intertwined.
"All those things play together to create this free-agency environment that we're in, which is challenged even further by the fact that there aren't really any rules," Mr. Hart said. "How much money do we need? A lot."
'They made us outlaws'
Mr. Dickerson was back on campus with his former S.M.U. teammate Harvey Armstrong. Both remain hurt over the blame their team shouldered for decades after the program was shut down.
"We felt abandoned," Mr. Armstrong said. "They not only didn't invite us back for homecoming, they made us outlaws. I could not even get an interview for a coaching job that was open."
Mr. Armstrong's awkward gait is a reminder of the 15 surgical procedures he has had on his knees and back. He forgets things, gets aggravated easily and wonders if he is showing early signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.), the degenerative brain disease that has been found in more than 100 former N.F.L players after their deaths.
Mr. Dickerson has had regenerative stem cell therapy for nearly a decade for a bad back that often immobilizes him. Neither man regrets the toll that the game he loved took on his body. Both do regret the toll it took on their souls.
"We were indentured servants," Mr. Dickerson said. "I call paying these kids out in the open doing the right thing. Finally."

Young, and Finding a Way to Indulge C.E.O. Dreams: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Fresh business school graduates are raising "search funds" from willing investors to buy companies they can lead.
Edward Silva grew up wanting to be a chief executive.
In 2018, Mr. Silva enrolled at the Stanford Graduate School of Business with the goal of starting his own company. "I was going to live the Stanford dream," he said. "I was going to find an engineer -- we were going to find a venture capital firm and found a technology start-up."
Then a classmate told him about another path for budding entrepreneurs. Instead of starting a company from scratch -- Mr. Silva had co-founded one before business school and even been its chief executive -- he could buy one and run it. To do so, he'd have to raise a "search fund," a pool of money from investors willing to bet that an ambitious young person with no track record will make them money.
Mr. Silva, 34, was intrigued. "I realized you don't have to deal with V.C.s who have unreasonable expectations," he said. After raising a search fund of more than $ 30 million from a small group of investors, Mr. Silva bought MásLabor, a Virginia consulting firm specializing in employment visas, in July 2021. It was the perfect target company: The owners, a couple in their 70s, were ready to retire and had no children -- just 15 dogs.
Search funds started out as a business school experiment four decades ago, but have gained popularity in recent years as persuasive newbies armed with M.B.A. degrees entice investors to make these niche bets with the promise of high returns. Across 2020 and 2021, nearly $ 800 million was invested in search funds, about one-third of the total amount raised for such funds since the idea emerged, according to data from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.
"At first, it was just a sprinkle of interested students," said H. Irving Grousbeck, an adjunct professor at Stanford. Mr. Grousbeck is credited with coming up with the search-fund idea in 1984 when he was a lecturer at Harvard Business School and helped Jim Southern, a student in his entrepreneurship class, raise money to acquire Uniform Printing, a printer of specialty insurance documents.
"Jim was an early success story," Mr. Grousbeck said. In 1994, after 10 years as chief executive, Mr. Southern sold Uniform Printing for a return of 24 times on the investment, according to a 2016 study on entrepreneurship by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
After seeding the idea at Harvard, Mr. Grousbeck joined Stanford, where he introduced the search fund model to generations of business school students. "Eventually, the talent, capital and opportunity came together to form a true search fund community," he said.
Today, search fund courses are taught in nearly every major M.B.A. program, including at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and the Yale School of Management, although Stanford remains one of the biggest proponents and is the only institution that has consistently tracked data charting the growth of the industry. In the last decade, the number of funds started has grown five times, rising to 105 in 2023 from 20 in 2013.
While venture capital funding is down, tech hiring has cooled and salaries on Wall Street have stagnated, search funds have proved to be an attractive -- if small -- way to invest. The so-called average internal rate of return -- the most common way for investors to gauge the potential of an investment opportunity -- for all search fund investments from 1986 to 2021 was 35 percent, far above the 15 percent that private equity funds have returned over the past two decades.
In the early days, investors were mostly wealthy individuals who backed young entrepreneurs -- giving anywhere from hundreds of thousands of dollars to a couple of million -- but big investors, including private equity firms, have recently started investing in search funds.
The typical search fund strategy goes like this: The entrepreneur raises an initial funding round to cover his or her salary and travel expenses while looking for a company to buy. While there is no recipe for a successful acquisition, most share a few key ingredients: The company is profitable and in a fragmented industry (think HVAC, home health care or waste management), and its owners are approaching retirement with no apparent heir.
If the would-be chief executive finds a target, he or she will go back to the investors to try to raise a second round of funding to buy the company. Investors and entrepreneurs make a return if the acquired company is sold or goes public for more than it was purchased.
Entrepreneurial M.B.A.s from major business schools have long been able to raise millions of dollars from venture capitalists to fund their start-ups, and search funds have become another way for some of them to raise large sums right after their degree. Still, they have to convince wary investors.
"Searchers are often approaching a small business from a fancy school without a ton of experience," said G.J. King, a search fund investor.
Mr. King looks for entrepreneurs who are humble and collaborative and have a good sales pitch -- three qualities he believes are essential for overcoming skepticism from potential sellers and their employees. Only when convinced of those attributes does he decide to invest. "People are going to be rightfully skeptical of you," he added.
Mr. Silva, who became the chief executive of MásLabor, said he had written over 1,000 personalized emails and placed about 800 phone calls before finding the right target -- a company in good financial health, with owners willing to sell.
"I looked at their finances and was like, wow, there's something really special here," he said of MásLabor. Mr. Silva wouldn't disclose how much he paid, except to say it was more than two times the median 2021 search fund purchase price of $ 16.5 million -- which works out to more than $ 33 million.
The deal took more than five months to close and involved uprooting his eight-months-pregnant wife and their toddler from California and moving everyone to Virginia. (Mr. Silva shut down his previous company, Henlight, after struggling to expand the business.)
As a part of the deal, he also acquired AgWorks H2, a MásLabor partner company. Mr. Silva intends to do more acquisitions to build the business.
An acquisition-based growth strategy is gaining popularity, driven partly by increasing competition among both investors and searchers. "You make a land grab and buy as many of these companies as you can and put them together," said Peter Kelly, a search fund investor and lecturer at Stanford's business school, of the industry's emerging mergers-and-acquisitions strategy.
Kelsey Holland, a 2023 Harvard Business School graduate who raised a search fund last year, said she was well aware of the growing competition. "Search has been found out," said Ms. Holland, who had worked as a product manager at companies like Equinox before business school.
Like Mr. Silva, Ms. Holland always wanted to be the chief executive of a company and assumed she would achieve her goal by founding a start-up. Then, in her first year of business school, she learned about search funds -- a model she said she and her peers were especially attracted to in the current economic climate.
"If you're plugged in, you read about all these start-ups that you thought were doing well and are now raising down rounds, struggling and doing layoffs," she said.
In September, Ms. Holland, 33, began searching for a health care company to acquire, having raised about half a million dollars from individuals and investment firms as she searches for a company to buy. She has sent hundreds of personalized emails to business owners and met with more than 20 potential sellers.
Many of the owners she has met receive frequent emails from other searchers and private equity firms that are also interested in acquiring their company, Ms. Holland said. If she finds a company, she plans to go back to her investors to ask for anywhere from $ 10 million to $ 100 million, depending on the size of the target.
Ms. Holland doesn't think search funds are a surefire path to the corner office, given the increasingly competitive market, but said she was confident she would find the right company. "It just takes more creativity these days."

Campaigns for Senate Worth Watching in '24: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With Democrats holding a one-seat majority and defending seats from Maryland to Arizona, control of the Senate could easily flip to the G.O.P.
The fight for Senate control is playing out almost entirely in Democratically held seats this year as President Biden's party defends a slim 51-49 seat majority.
The retirement of Senator Joe Manchin III, a Democrat, in deep-red West Virginia has all but ceded one seat to the Republicans, who are targeting a number of vulnerable Democratic incumbents in red or swing states. And if former President Donald J. Trump wins the White House, one seat is all the G.O.P. needs to flip the chamber. Should the Senate come down to a 50-50 split, the vice president plays tiebreaker.
For Democrats to hold the Senate, the party would most likely need all their incumbents to win; for their candidates to prevail in open seats in Arizona, Michigan and Maryland; and for Mr. Biden to be re-elected so Vice President Kamala Harris would play the tiebreaker in an evenly split chamber. The party is targeting two Republican-held seats, but those are considered more difficult terrain.
Here are the Senate races to watch in 2024.
Montana: Farmer vs. former Navy SEAL
Senator Jon Tester, the flat-topped farmer from Big Sandy, Mont., has defied the odds before in his increasingly Republican state, but his Senate victories in 2006, 2012 and 2018 all came in strong Democratic years nationally. His fight for a fourth term will be considerably tougher with Mr. Biden at the top of the ticket in a state that Mr. Trump won by 16 percentage points in 2020. And Mr. Tester will most likely be battling the Republican Party's selected candidate, Tim Sheehy, a decorated former Navy SEAL and businessman with the wealth to self-finance his campaign, as well as Mr. Trump's backing.
Mr. Tester has the power of incumbency, and the authenticity of a third-generation Montanan. In 2012, President Barack Obama received 41.7 percent of the vote. Mr. Tester earned 48.6 percent. He may need even more ticket-splitters -- people who will vote for Mr. Trump for president and him for Senate -- this November.
Cook Political Report rating: A toss-up
Ohio: Sherrod Brown faces the fight of his political life
Besides Mr. Tester, Senator Sherrod Brown is the only other Democrat defending a seat in a solidly Republican state. He too has had the advantage of winning in strong Democratic years -- 2006, 2012 and 2018 -- and like Mr. Tester, he has established an image as a stalwart supporter of the working-class voters who will decide the election. As a powerful member of the Senate -- he is the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee -- Mr. Brown has amassed a considerable war chest for his re-election campaign.
Unlike Mr. Tester, he will be running against a Republican who was not the Ohio G.O.P. establishment's choice. Bernie Moreno, instead, was the candidate of Mr. Trump. The Republican's sizable fortune will seed fund-raising and undergird his campaign against the incumbent, but Democrats boosted Mr. Moreno's candidacy during the primary because they believe his business background will make him vulnerable to attack.
Cook Political Report rating: A toss-up
Arizona: Kari Lake, a prominent election denier, tries again
The retirement of Senator Kyrsten Sinema, the Democrat-turned-independent iconoclast, has set up a stark Senate race between Representative Ruben Gallego, a progressive, and Kari Lake, a former television news anchor and a favorite of Mr. Trump's Make America Great Again movement who lost her race for governor in 2022. The primary in Arizona is July 30, but Mr. Gallego and Ms. Lake have established themselves as the odds-on favorites to represent their parties in the open Senate contest.
President Biden narrowly won Arizona in 2020, and unlike Ohio and Montana, the state promises to be a presidential battleground, potentially warping the Senate race. Ms. Lake made a name for herself by falsely claiming that Democrats stole the Arizona election for Mr. Biden in 2020, then falsely claiming that her Democratic opponent in the governor's race, Katie Hobbs, stole her election. Mr. Gallego is less well-known outside of his Phoenix House district, but as a Latino with a Harvard pedigree and combat experience in Iraq with the Marine Corps, he has a compelling biography.
Cook Political Report rating: A toss-up
Michigan: Trump looms large
The full range of Republican Party factions will fight it out for the right to contend for the Senate seat of Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat who is retiring. There's Peter Meijer, who voted to impeach Mr. Trump just after being sworn into the House, then lost in the 2022 Republican primary to a Trump-backed challenger. Mr. Meijer has now said he will vote for Mr. Trump in November. There's Justin Amash, the libertarian-minded former congressman who denounced Mr. Trump, faced a fierce backlash that chased him from his party, tried to run for his House seat as an independent, lost and is now running for the Senate again as an anti-Trump Republican. Then there's Mike Rogers, the mainstream Republican who said the party needed to move on from Mr. Trump, then wooed and won Mr. Trump's endorsement for Senate and embraced him.
Mr. Rogers has to be considered the favorite in the Aug. 6 primary, but past and present views of the former president will loom over this race all summer. The primary winner will almost certainly face Representative Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat who has used her national security credentials to win over swing voters in Central Michigan since 2018. Her trick will be to keep those centrist voters and energize more liberal voters in and around Detroit. And looming above it all is the presidential contest.
Cook Political Report rating: Leaning toward Democrats
Nevada: Low-key incumbent vs. political newcomer
In recent years, Nevada Democrats have profited off Republican voters' penchant for nominating candidates from the G.O.P.'s extremes, but this year, party leaders are rallying around Sam Brown, a political neophyte with an extraordinary story. The West Point graduate nearly died in Kandahar, Afghanistan, when a roadside bomb burned him badly and left him permanently scarred. His thin political résumé could be a plus, since it will make him difficult to label.
Senator Jacky Rosen, the incumbent Democrat, isn't flashy, but the power of incumbency matters, unless Mr. Biden's support in the state craters.
Cook Political Report rating: Leaning toward Democrats
Wisconsin: A wealthy Republican candidate faces questions over his ties to the state
Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, has been a low-key fixture in Wisconsin politics since her election to the State Assembly in 1992. With her comes little drama, but Wisconsin, a state that just re-elected its famously quiet governor, Tony Evers, in 2022, seems to like Democrats who speak softly.
Republicans have recruited Eric Hovde, a banker and businessman who, if nothing else, can finance his own campaign. But his connections to Southern California in a state full of Badger pride have helped keep this race leaning toward the incumbent.
Cook Political Report rating: Leaning toward Democrats
Pennsylvania: David McCormick tries again
The Keystone State may be a key battleground in the presidential election this year, but Senator Bob Casey, the Democratic incumbent, is an institution. His expected Republican opponent is David McCormick, the former chief executive of Bridgewater Associates, one of the largest hedge funds in the world. Mr. McCormick lost the Republican Senate primary in 2022 to Mehmet Oz, and the lines of attack honed two years ago on his wealth and his mansion in Connecticut are sure to be recycled.
Cook Political Report rating: Leaning toward Democrats
Maryland: Larry Hogan makes things interesting
Reliably blue Maryland should not be in play, but Larry Hogan, the moderate former Republican governor, has decided to run for the Senate seat of Ben Cardin, the retiring Democrat, making the race one to watch.
Democrats had figured they could count on the three-term Representative David Trone, the wealthy founder of Total Wine & More, a large retailer of wine and spirits. Then Mr. Trone used a racial slur at a House hearing, for which he has apologized and said was inadvertent. But several Black Democrats endorsed Angela Alsobrooks, the Prince George's County executive, ahead of the May 14 primary, as did Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the powerful House Oversight Committee.
Cook Political Report rating: Likely Democratic
Texas and Florida: Democrats try to flip seats in reliably red states
Democrats have only two races to play offense in: Senator Ted Cruz's campaign in Texas and Senator Rick Scott's in Florida. Both men have never been personally popular in their states, but those states have been reliably Republican of late. Democrats like their candidates, Representative Colin Allred in Texas and former Representative Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in Florida, but it would most likely take severe erosion of Mr. Trump's support to put those Senate seats in play.
Cook Political Report ratings: Likely Republican
Bonus races to watch: Long shots
Utah is nobody's idea of a swing state, and the retirement of Senator Mitt Romney at the end of his term has drawn in nearly a dozen Republicans ahead of the June 25 primary, including Representative John Curtis; Brent Orrin Hatch, the son of Senator Orrin G. Hatch; and Brad Wilson, the former speaker of the State House. But one Democrat made waves with a unique announcement video: Caroline Gleich, a professional ski mountaineer.
Nebraska is almost as red as Utah, with an incumbent Republican, Deb Fischer, running for re-election. Her main opponent is not a Democrat but an independent, Dan Osborn, who led a strike at the Kellogg's plant in Omaha in 2021 and is testing whether his pro-labor, working-class message can resonate at a time when the union movement is resurgent.

Heeding Beijing, Hong Kong Passes Anti-Dissent Bill: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The legislation targets "external interference" and the theft of state secrets, with implications for businesses, journalists, civil servants and others.
Hong Kong on Tuesday passed national security laws at the behest of Beijing, thwarting decades of public resistance in a move that critics say will strike a lasting blow to the partial autonomy the city had been promised by China.
The new legislation, which was passed with extraordinary speed, grants the authorities even more powers to crack down on opposition to Beijing and the Hong Kong government, establishing penalties -- including life imprisonment -- for political crimes like treason and insurrection, which are vaguely defined. It also targets offenses like "external interference" and the theft of state secrets, creating potential risks for multinational companies and international groups operating in the Asian financial center.
Analysts say the legislation, which will take effect on March 23, could have a chilling effect on a wide range of people, including entrepreneurs, civil servants, lawyers, diplomats, journalists and academics, raising questions about Hong Kong's status as an international city.
An earlier attempt to pass such legislation, in 2003, set off mass protests involving hundreds of thousands of people.
But this time many of the opposition figures who might have challenged the legislation have either been jailed or have gone into exile since China's ruling Communist Party, under Xi Jinping, its most powerful leader in decades, imposed the first national security law, in 2020. That law gave the authorities a powerful tool to quash dissent after months of antigovernment demonstrations engulfed the city in 2019.
Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader, John Lee, has said the package of new laws is needed to root out unrest and to fight what he described as Western spying. Once the laws are passed, he has said, the government can focus on the economy.
In a speech at the legislature, Mr. Lee said that the new laws would "allow Hong Kong to effectively prevent and put a stop to espionage activities, the conspiracies and traps of intelligence units and the infiltration and damage of enemy forces."
As the bill was passed unanimously on Tuesday, lawmakers and officials called it a "historic moment." Chris Tang, Hong Kong's secretary for security, who oversaw the bill, likened its passage to the birth of his own son after multiple "miscarriages."
Lawmakers had put the legislation on the fast track, holding marathon sessions over a week and working through a weekend.
"A rapid passage is meant to show people in Hong Kong the government's resolve and ability to enforce it," said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London. "The new national security bill is as much about intimidation as it is about enforcement."
For Mr. Lee, the Hong Kong leader, "the first concern is not how people in Hong Kong or in the rest of the world see this," Professor Tsang said. "He is performing for the audience of one -- Xi himself."
And in the eyes of Beijing, these laws are long overdue.
When Hong Kong, a former British colony, was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, it was given a mini-constitution designed to protect civil liberties unknown in mainland China, such as freedom of expression, assembly and the media. But China also insisted on a provision called Article 23, which required Hong Kong to draft a package of internal security laws to replace colonial-era sedition laws.
Hong Kong's 2003 effort to pass internal security legislation not only triggered large protests. Top officials also resigned, and in the years that followed, city leaders were reluctant to raise the matter again, for fear of public backlash.
But in recent months, the Chinese Communist Party again urged the Hong Kong government to enact Article 23 laws.
There was little chance that China's will would not be heeded; Hong Kong's legislature has been overwhelmingly stacked with pro-Beijing lawmakers since China overhauled the electoral system to exclude candidates who aren't considered "patriots."
The new laws take aim at five types of offenses: treason, insurrection, theft of state secrets, sabotage and external interference. They also introduce key changes to due process. In some instances, the police may now seek permission from magistrates to prevent suspects from consulting with the lawyers of their choice, if that is deemed a threat to national security.
Human rights groups said that in swiftly passing the legislation, the authorities had reversed course on the freedoms once promised to the city.
Maya Wang, the acting China director at Human Rights Watch, said on Tuesday that the new security legislation would "usher Hong Kong into a new era of authoritarianism." The government has criticized rights advocacy groups based overseas as "anti-China" and "anti-government" organizations.
The vague wording of some of the legislation has raised questions among legal scholars. For example, an act of espionage, under the new laws, could include the passing of any information or document that is considered "useful to an external force." Such a broad definition could discourage legitimate exchanges with diplomats, Simon Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, wrote in a submission to the government last month.
Professor Young also objected to the legislation's sweeping definition of "sedition," which includes an intent to "bring disaffection" against the state or its institutions. Disaffection is "an emotional state of too low a threshold to be the subject of a crime," he wrote.
"It is not a crime to simply feel this way," he added.
The legislation also empowers the city's leader, known as the chief executive, to make new, related laws, which can carry penalties of up to seven years in prison, without going through the legislature. The leader would consult the cabinet before enacting any such law; the legislative council, known as the LegCo, would be able to amend or reject the law later.
Such a mechanism would not be new to Hong Kong, but it raises the potential for abuse, given how broadly written the new legislation is, said Thomas E. Kellogg, the executive director of the Center for Asian Law at Georgetown University.
"This is deeply disturbing," Professor Kellogg wrote in an email. "The LegCo is handing the chief executive the power to expand the law even further, in ways that could further infringe on basic rights."
Hong Kong, known just a few years ago for its boisterous political opposition, now more closely resembles mainland China, where dissent can carry a high cost. During the recent sessions over the new security legislation, lawmakers mostly suggested changes that would make it even tougher.
"They seem to be looking for ways to signal their fealty to the government's national security agenda, and to ensure that they are demonstrating no daylight between themselves and the government," Professor Kellogg said.
Discussion of the bill illustrated the city's new political landscape and the murkiness of the new boundaries around speech.
Lawmakers asked if possession of old copies of Apple Daily, a now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper, would be an offense. (A security official said it would depend on whether there was "seditious intent.") A government adviser said that priests who heard confessions about national security offenses like treason could themselves be charged under the new laws if they did not report what they heard. (The Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong said the church recognized that citizens had an obligation to ensure national security, but that confessions would remain confidential.)
The legislation's vague wording -- for example, in how it defines offenses like the theft of state secrets -- is comparable to language found in security legislation in mainland China. And someone who shares "information that appears to be confidential matter," even if it is not classified as a state secret, could be punished if that person intended to endanger national security, in the eyes of the authorities.
Business leaders in Hong Kong say such changes could raise the cost of operating in the city by requiring companies to scrutinize documents and other information shared by employees, to ensure that they do not inadvertently violate the new legislation.
One risk is that Hong Kong's comparative business advantage over the mainland could be eroded, said Johannes Hack, the president of the German Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.
"Part of the unique value Hong Kong has for Western (German) stakeholders is the openness of the city, and we feel the balance between openness and the desire for security needs to be well calibrated," he wrote in a message on WhatsApp.

Max Hardy, 40, Chef Who Went Home To Detroit to Cook and to Give Back: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With his unique blend of Lowcountry and Caribbean influences, he ranked among the best of a new generation of Black culinary wizards.
Max Hardy, who helped bring a new level of chef-driven yet accessible cuisine to his native Detroit, and who was widely considered among the most promising of a young generation of Black culinary stars, died on Monday. He was 40.
His publicist, David E. Rudolph, announced the death but did not provide a cause or location. He said Mr. Hardy had been in good health as recently as the weekend.
Though he was born in Detroit, Mr. Hardy moved with his family to South Florida when he was young. As a budding chef, he drew on the region's Latin American influences, as well as his mother's Bahamian heritage, mastering dishes like jerk pork ribs, fried plantains and ackee and salt fish, the national dish of Jamaica. He married those influences with a deep love for South Carolina Lowcountry cuisine like shrimp and grits, fried fish and hoppin' John.
After more than a decade as the private chef for the basketball star Amar'e Stoudemire, followed by a few years working in New York City kitchens, he returned to Detroit in 2017 to open a string of high-profile restaurants, including River Bistro, Coop Caribbean Fusion and Jed's Detroit, a pizza-and-wings shop.
He worked constantly and with an entrepreneur's energy. He had his own lines of chef clothing and dry spices. He partnered with Kellogg's to bring plant-based items from the company's Morningstar Farms brand to restaurants like his. And he appeared regularly on Food Network programs like "Chopped" and "BBQ Brawl."
Until recently, Detroit was a fine-dining desert, with few options beyond fast food and chains. But in the 2010s a wave of young chefs like Mr. Hardy began to alter the city's image.
"He had kind of a reputation as a personal chef for a very prominent N.B.A. player, but I found that he came to back to the city with very little ego," said Kiki Bokungu Louya, a chef and the executive director of the nonprofit Detroit Food Academy. "He was really willing to learn who was already doing the work on the ground."
He founded his own nonprofit, One Chef Can 86 Hunger, which spreads awareness about food insecurity and healthy eating, especially among young people. During the 2019 government shutdown, he offered free lunches to furloughed federal workers; during the pandemic, he opened pop-up food kitchens to feed at-risk Detroit residents.
"When I can go into a kitchen and create meals for 500 or 1,000 people, it fuels me and gets me outside of the day-to-day restaurant grind," he told The Detroit Free Press in 2021. "It's actually peace for me to cook for a couple hundred people and give back. And it feeds the soul. It feels really good to do it."
In 2017 The New York Times named Mr. Hardy one of "16 Black Chefs Changing Food in America" (Ms. Louya was one of the others), not just for his skill in the kitchen but also for his willingness to push the boundaries of what defines a successful fine-dining chef.
"Growing up in Detroit, you didn't see chefs and restaurants elevated like that," he told The Times. "It was Motor City, not Food City. Now I can invent a dinner based on the recipes of Hercules, a slave who was George Washington's personal chef, and I can have my restaurant, and I can teach kids in the community. There are so many more ways to strive for greatness as a chef."
Maxcel Hardy III was born on Dec. 5, 1983, in Detroit and moved to Tampa, Fla., as a child. His first love was basketball, but an injury in high school ended his dreams of a serious career.
His high school had recently opened a culinary arts program, and he soon found himself under the mentorship of its director. He worked at Ruby Tuesday after school and won a scholarship in his senior year to continue his training at Johnson & Wales University in North Miami.
By 21 he was the executive chef at a Miami-area country club, and within a few years he had his own luxury catering company. From 2009 to 2014 he was the full-time personal chef for Mr. Stoudemire, who played mostly for the Knicks in those years. The two published a cookbook, "Cooking With Amar'e," in 2014.
Survivors include his mother and two daughters.
Mr. Hardy's first restaurant in Detroit, River Bistro, closed after a few years, but by then he had opened two more. He was working on a third, specializing in fish, when he died.
"My goal is to always open restaurants in the inner city to help employ the community while providing great food," Mr. Hardy told the website Eater Detroit in 2022. "I find that though it may be easier to open in a larger suburban area, it's typical and would only serve myself.
"Food is at the center of everything," he continued, "and I want to create restaurants that help sustain communities in need. I also try to show you can open successful restaurants in your hometown."

The Grotesque Rise of Mark Robinson: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ah, the double edge of a Donald Trump endorsement. On the one hand, the MAGA chieftain has commanded his tribe to vote for you, and that can be enough to propel a candidate into the winner's circle. On the other hand, you're stuck with whatever loopy language and loopier logic he used.
In endorsing Mark Robinson for governor of my home state, North Carolina, Trump called him "Martin Luther King on steroids." Trump didn't leave it at that. "I think you're better than Martin Luther King," he told Robinson at a rally in Greensboro, N.C., last weekend. "I think you are Martin Luther King times two."
I think that there are better mathematicians and more trustworthy historians of the civil rights movement than Trump, but I also think that his remarks are kind of perfect. They exemplify how far the MAGA brigade travels from reality into gaudy, even grotesque, hyperbole.
This is one riveting and profoundly consequential governor's race. The Tuesday primaries in North Carolina made it official: Robinson, the lieutenant governor of North Carolina, is the Republican nominee and would be the state's first Black governor, while the Democratic nominee is the state attorney general, Josh Stein, who would be the state's first Jewish governor.
But the contest isn't really about milestones, nor will it hinge on them. It will instead be a moment-defining referendum on the virtues of theatrically (and sometimes hypocritically) mouthing off against the system (Robinson) versus dutifully working within it (Stein), on seat-of-the-pants amateurishness versus extensive government experience, on sensationalism versus seriousness, on dark conspiratorial fantasies versus unentertaining realities.
Does that sound like any other race you know, and does Robinson sound like any other populist you've met? He's Trump on steroids, Trump times two. If you're an arsonist, Robinson is your guy. If you're an institutionalist, you're a Stein stan.
Robinson had no real public profile when, at a meeting of the Greensboro City Council in 2018, he made an impassioned speech in favor of gun rights that went viral and made him an instant darling of the right. In 2020 he ran for lieutenant governor and won. Ever since, concerned Democrats and even many aghast Republicans have taken a more careful look at him.
And they have found florid homophobia, shocking antisemitism and an alarming contempt for science -- all of which I described in this newsletter early last year. But that's just his ideological bent, which also extends to a stated desire to outlaw abortion or at least get as close to that as possible.
His life outside politics contradicts his rants against what he sees as excessive government charity and his styling of himself as a poster boy for gumption and resilience. As a devastating article by Jeffrey Billman in the North Carolina publication The Assembly detailed in January, Robinson has been delinquent on taxes and repeatedly filed for bankruptcy, and his wife, Yolanda Hill, has prospered from the acquisition -- and then forgiveness -- of Covid-era Paycheck Protection Program loans from the federal government.
Those loans were first reported by The Daily Haymaker, a conservative website, with information provided by Don Carrington. The editor of The Haymaker, Brant Clifton, asked Billman rhetorically: "How do you go around claiming to be Mr. Conservative, or the King of Conservatism, when your family business is solely based on keeping the trains running on the welfare state?"
How, indeed? But that's what makes Robinson, a fiery orator who's all smoke and mirrors, such an apt emblem of the MAGA movement. He's not about accountability. He's about ire. He's not selling something sensible. He's an instrument for inchoate rage.
He's gratuitously cruel and divisive, as when he suggested last month that the best bathroom option for people who "are confused" about their gender was to "find a corner outside somewhere to go." He's proudly inept, as when, two years ago, he shrugged off his tax woes -- he had failed to pay many years of vehicle taxes and federal taxes -- by saying: "When you start talking about taxes, if I'm the guy doing them, somebody's going to jail. I'm not very good at math."
He excels instead at provocation, at grievance, at promoting himself as a dauntless warrior against all those lefties out to wreck civilization. He's a far, far cry from King. But he's all MAGA king.
For the Love of Sentences
Jennifer Lopez was the previous newsletter's prose muse. "Dune: Part Two" is this week's.
In The New Yorker, Justin Chang reflected on how quickly and quizzically the movie gets going. "It's off before we've even glimpsed the Warner Bros. logo, whose famous water tower is a helpful reminder to hydrate: We've got a long, dust-choked ride ahead," he wrote. "While the screen is black, a heavily distorted voice hisses something that we recognize as words only by the grace of subtitles: 'Power over spice is power over all.' The rare newbie to the Dune-iverse may be confused: Is this a story of cumin bondage?" (Thanks to Amy Howard of Granby, Colo., and Carlisle Landel of Santa Cruz, Calif., among others, for nominating this.)
And in The Washington Post, Ann Hornaday weighed in: "Imagine a world devoid of color or warmth, foundering amid environmental catastrophe and tribal factions that threaten to bring humanity to the edge of fatal fanaticism. But enough about election-year politics. Let's talk about 'Dune: Part Two."' (Terry Burridge, Arlington, Va., and Janice Esser, Kenosha, Wis.)
Also in The Washington Post, Philip Bump commented on the mendacious and misleading nature of social media posts that the House Oversight Committee published in advance of Hunter Biden's scheduled appearance before it: "They were little slices of Foxnewsium presented to Biden-haters like a charcuterie tray." (Laurie Higgins, Brewster, Mass., and Judy Gitlin, Branford, Conn., among others)
In The Atlantic, Quinta Jurecic analyzed the Supreme Court's decision that Colorado can't take Trump off the ballot: "The court has an interest in maintaining its own reputation, however weakened, as a lofty arbiter of high-minded legal disputes. That concern might make some sense in normal times. But with the authoritarianism of a second Trump term within view, it seems a bit like making sure that the living room rug is properly vacuumed while the house is burning down." (Scott Campbell, Washington)
In The Guardian, Marina Hyde observed that Christian Horner, the boss of Formula One's Red Bull racing team, is enmeshed in a tawdry scandal: "It's all very Keeping Up With the Carkrashians." (Debbie Landis, Garrison, N.Y.)
I occasionally use this section of the newsletter to showcase an especially deft or witty headline, and Britain's Daily Star recently had one, pertinent to an article about the top Kellogg's executive advising financially struggling people to have cereal for dinner: "Let Them Eat Flakes." (Alex Johnson, Santa Monica, Calif.)
In The Times, Pete Wells used his review of the restaurant Noksu to note the absurdity of many diners' timidity and fealty: "Each course was served with precise instructions on how to transport it from plate to mouth. Not that I blame the servers. When diners at restaurants like this aren't given any instructions, they become so confused they'll ask what 'chef recommends.' Seeing a restaurant full of grown adults waiting for permission to eat with a spoon really makes you wonder how it is that humans haven't died out yet." (Pat Olski, River Edge, N.J., and Ellen Chuse, Brooklyn, among others)
Also in The Times, Jason Zinoman described the particular physicality in the stand-up comedy performances of Richard Lewis, who died last week: "To say he talked with his hands seems insufficient. His whole body never shut up." (Jack O'Brien, East Islip, N.Y.)
Jonah Weiner noted the emergence of "a late-period portrait of Miles Davis" that recently spread across the internet and showed him to be ahead of his time regarding a current fashion trend: "The focal point is Davis's enormous pants. They are tan, with deep pleats and a towering rise, and they pool behind the tongues of his white loafers like tidal waves converging on a couple of dinghies. They are large but not structureless -- they echo and expand on his stance with a graceful excess, the way a sail echoes and expands on the wind. They look tremendously, gorgeously, inspiringly stupid." (Karen O'Kain, Vancouver, British Columbia, and Harry Newman, Austin, Texas, among others)
And David Grossman imagined a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict emerging from the carnage of the past five months: "How tragic that this will occur -- if indeed it does -- not from hope and enthusiasm but from exhaustion and despair. Then again, that is the state of mind that often leads enemies to reconcile, and today it is all we can hope for. And so we shall make do with it. It seems we had to go through hell itself in order to get to the place from which one can see, on an exceptionally bright day, the distant edge of heaven." (David Tebaldi, Worthington, Mass.)

Bonus Regan Picture!
It really concerns me -- how tense Regan always is, how guarded, how afraid to make herself fully at home, claim territory, spread out on it, unwind. With time, with hope, with luck, I'll get her to relax one of these days. The dream lives.
What I'm Writing and Reading
"If you're trying to impress a broad range of voters, including those who aren't predisposed to like you, you're best served not by joining the culture wars or indulging in political gamesmanship but by addressing tangible, measurable problems." That's what I concluded and wrote in this recently published essay about Democrats (such as Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Roy Cooper of North Carolina and Laura Kelly of Kansas) who win in places where they are by no means guaranteed to. That same lesson applies to Republicans interested in winning where their victories aren't foregone conclusions.
Is Biden versus Trump 100 percent certain? And how can Biden best use his State of the Union remarks to improve his standing and increase his odds of a second term? I'm not a swami, but maybe the political writers Olivia Nuzzi and Joe Klein have crystal balls. I consulted them for this recent round table in Times Opinion.
The film buff in me has been geeking out with the 2023 book "Night Mother: A Personal and Cultural History of 'The Exorcist"' by Marlena Williams. I've long found "The Exorcist" a peculiarly fascinating movie -- at once excessively crude and lavishly artful, lousy with stupid tricks and rich with sublime acting, a poignant portrait of illness in horror-flick drag. Williams does justice to all that while laying out a buffet of irresistible "Exorcist" trivia.
On a Personal Note
I don't know if the phrase "sleep hygiene" is testimony to our evolution or our devolution. It says that we've aced enough about existence -- the eating, the sheltering, the clothing -- that we can fret about and fuss over whether we've attained peak snoozing. But it also says that we've created lives so addled and overstimulated that we need a recipe and a regimen for a bodily function that's essentially autonomic.
What I do know is this: My sleep hygiene stinks. Or at least my sleep does. One time last week I woke at 2:45 a.m. Another it was 3:15 a.m. My 4 a.m. wake-up constituted sleeping in and meant that I had gotten more than six hours, a rarity. I usually nod off around 9:45 p.m.
But this isn't a complaint. I've been a silver-linings man these past few years, at least outside the political realm, and I'm here to report that there's a peculiar delight to being awake, on your computer and busily and efficiently at work hours before the rest of the world is. There's a sense of stillness and solitude that isn't replicable once, say, 6 a.m. arrives. You're making an unchallenged claim to an uncrowded patch of real estate, which you can sprawl across in a manner that feels indulgent and transgressive and is terrifically productive.
And when others make their presence known? Suddenly you belong to a covert society with clandestine rituals. Phil responds at 4:15 a.m. to an email I sent at 3:45 a.m., and it's like some kind of secret handshake. Bill texts at 4:45 a.m. on the correct wager that I'm awake, and it's like some telepathy between psychic twins. We're fellow travelers on a moonlit road through the night country, where there's never any rush hour.

After 20-Year Delay, Hong Kong Pushes Security Law With Great Haste: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The proposed law targets political offenses like treason and insurrection with penalties as harsh as life imprisonment, giving officials more power to curb dissent.
Under pressure from Beijing, officials in Hong Kong are scrambling to pass a long-shelved national security law that could impose life imprisonment for political crimes like treason, a move expected to further muzzle dissent in the Asian financial center.
The law, known as Article 23 legislation, has long been a source of public discontent in Hong Kong, a former British colony that had been promised certain freedoms when it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Now, it is expected to be enacted with unusual speed in the coming weeks.
China's Communist Party officials, who have pressed the city to push through this law, appeared in recent days to make their urgency clear. After meeting with a senior Chinese official in charge of Hong Kong, the city's top leader, John Lee, reportedly cut short his visit to Beijing to return to the city, vowing to get the law "enacted as soon as possible." The Hong Kong legislature and Mr. Lee's cabinet, the Executive Council, hastily called meetings to discuss the law.
The full draft of the legislation was only made public for the first time on Friday, as lawmakers began to review it. It targets five offenses: treason, insurrection, sabotage, external interference, and theft of state secrets and espionage.
Mr. Lee said the law is necessary to close gaps in an existing national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 that was used to quash pro-democracy protests and jail opposition lawmakers and activists. Mr. Lee has depicted Hong Kong as a city under mounting national security threats, including from American and British spy agencies.
China has sought to tighten its grip over Hong Kong after massive antigovernment protests in 2019 engulfed the city, posing the greatest challenge to Beijing's rule in years. Many protesters had taken to the streets to push back against Beijing's encroachment over the city and its erosion of Hong Kong's civil liberties, but Chinese officials said the demonstrations were instigated by Western forces seeking to destabilize the territory and China.
Critics say the new security law will stifle more freedoms in the city of 7.5 million people by curbing their right to speech and protest, while also further diminishing the autonomy Hong Kong is granted under a "one country, two systems" formula with China.
Legal experts say criticism of the government can now be interpreted as sedition, a crime that carries a prison sentence of up to seven years, which can be increased to 10 years if it involves collusion with an "external force."
"This law will have far-reaching impacts on human rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong," said Thomas Kellogg, the executive director of the Georgetown Center for Asian Law. "It's clear that the government is continuing to expand its national security tool kit to crack down on its political opponents."
The government has sought to show that the legislation is widely accepted, pointing to a one-month period of public consultation -- based on a document that described only in broad terms the scope of the law -- that officials said drew mostly supportive comments.
But the Hong Kong Journalists Association has expressed concerns about the law over the potential new limitations on press freedom. And the Bar Association of Hong Kong had recommended that the law's definition of sedition include the intention to incite violence, to narrow the scope of the offense. But the draft of the law did not include such language.
The bill unveiled on Friday also proposed extending the time a person suspected of endangering national security can be detained, without charge, to as many as 16 days, from a previous limit of two days. The law would also empower the police to seek permission to block a suspect from consulting a lawyer if access to legal advice were deemed detrimental to national security.
Mr. Kellogg said the speed in which the government was moving to enact the law suggested that concerns raised in the consultation period were not likely to have been taken seriously.
"This does indeed suggest that the government did not really plan to seriously engage with public submissions, and that they were likely going to execute on their planned legislation from the get go," Mr. Kellogg said.
Andrew Leung, the president of the Legislative Council, defended the move to speed up the passage of Article 23 legislation. "I also fully agree that there is a genuine and urgent need for the legislation," he said at a news conference on Friday.
Hong Kong officials have invoked national security legislation in Western countries such as the United States, Britain and Canada to justify the need for Article 23. Legal experts, however, argue against such a comparison, noting that Hong Kong, unlike democratic societies, does not maintain a system of checks and balances to counter abuse.
In a speech at the legislative session on Friday, Chris Tang, the Hong Kong security secretary, said the proposed legislation had safeguards and struck a balance between national security and human rights.
"Innocent people will not be caught by the law inadvertently," Mr. Tang said.
Foreign business officials say the legislation will make it harder to explain to investors the differences between Hong Kong and mainland China. Foreign diplomats also worry Article 23 could discourage local organizations from having regular interactions with consular staff because of the law's broad emphasis on external interference.
The bill is expected to pass in the coming weeks without opposition in a legislature overwhelmingly stacked with pro-establishment lawmakers. In 2021, Beijing imposed a drastic overhaul of the electoral system that effectively disqualified opposition candidates by allowing only candidates considered "patriots" to run.
The government first tried to enact Article 23 in 2003, but retreated after hundreds of thousands of residents who were concerned that it would limit civil liberties held major protests.

HONG KONG — Under pressure from Beijing, officials in Hong Kong are scrambling to pass a long-shelved national security law that could impose life imprisonment for political crimes like treason, a move expected to further muzzle dissent in the Asian financial center.

Full text: Dan Osborn led a strike in 2021 against the Kellogg's plant in Omaha. Now he is challenging Senator Deb Fischer as an independent in deep-red Nebraska.
In 2021, as the first Halloween decorations were coming out in Omaha, Neb., a mechanic named Dan Osborn led 500 of his fellow union members out of the Kellogg's cereal plant on F Street and onto the picket lines.
The strike, which involved over 1,400 workers across multiple plants, would last for a difficult 77 days, through brutal storms and imported strikebreakers and the threat of summary dismissals, which drew the attention of President Biden. A first contract was soundly rejected by the union, then a second finally ended the walkout, just before Christmas.
Now Mr. Osborn, 48, is trying to do something considerably harder: win a United States Senate seat as an independent in the deep-red state of Nebraska.
Mr. Osborn's long-shot bid to defeat Deb Fischer, Nebraska's Republican senior senator, in November, or even come close, will test whether the rising power of an energized union movement can translate to high elective office during an election year when working class voters will likely decide the next president, and the direction of the country.
The rail unions of western Nebraska first approached him last year to mount a bid, and a December survey from a left-leaning group called Change Research put Mr. Osborn up on Ms. Fischer, at 40 percent over her 38 percent. It is a questionable result, as even Mr. Osborn's supporters concede, but enough to capture imaginations in a one-party state that has long receded from the national political conversation.
With no Democrat in the race, the Nebraska Democratic Party is likely to endorse Mr. Osborn at a meeting on March 2, the party chairwoman, Jane Kleeb, said, though Mr. Osborn said he was not sure he wants that. The state A.F.L.-C.I.O. will back him at a gathering in late March, and national unions are taking a close look.
But can a union leader with no political experience find an agenda that transcends the two political parties and appeals narrowly to blue-collar wallets? And can that leader find the money to put that message out farther west, beyond the urban centers of Omaha and Lincoln?
"I've gone up against a major American corporation," Mr. Osborn said as he cut into a steak Tuesday night. "I stood up for what I thought was right, and I won."
The Fischer campaign appears to be treating Mr. Osborn as a nuisance, not as a serious threat to her bid for a third term.
"Deb Fischer has actual, strong and deep support all across the state, including 93 bipartisan county chairs and over 1,000 endorsements," Derek Oden, her campaign manager, said. "She is proud of her longstanding support from members of Nebraska labor unions and is willing to work with any Nebraskan to make life easier for working families across our state." The campaign cited three firefighters' unions as well as the carpenters and electricians who backed her six years ago.
Mr. Osborn's attempt to leap from leader of his local to member of the U.S. Senate has little precedent, almost akin to the five failed presidential bids of the celebrated labor leader Eugene V. Debs early last century.
Union members in other states have made the jump to elective office, like Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, and Brandon Johnson, the mayor of Chicago. The New Jersey A.F.L.-C.I.O. has trained 1,300 members to run for office over the past 27 years, with a success rate of 76 percent.
Those seeking office receive instruction in campaigning, opposition research, election law, campaign finance, public speaking and handling the press, said Charles Wowkanech, the president of the New Jersey A.F.L.-C.I.O. In a heavily unionized, Democratic state, the program identifies and contacts every union member in a given district, and, often, they account for more than enough votes to win.
That is not the situation in lightly unionized Nebraska, where 9.4 percent of workers are represented. But even in New Jersey, where 17.3 percent are, the highest office sought has been the U.S. House of Representatives, where a union electrician who went through the program, Donald Norcross, holds the First Congressional District.
"We modeled the labor candidate program after apprenticeship programs," Mr. Wowkanech said. "You don't start as a journeyman earning top rate. You work your way up."
In 2018, Randy Bryce, who is known as "Iron Stache," captured liberal imaginations and a lot of money as an iron worker (and the secretary of the Racine County Labor Council) running for the house seat of retiring Speaker Paul D. Ryan in Wisconsin. He lost by more than 12 percentage points.
"There definitely are ways to reach across the aisle, but it's getting rougher every year, that civil divide," Mr. Bryce said. "We've got to find reasons to talk to each other again, and working people running for office is a start."
Soft-spoken and earnest, Mr. Osborn is not exactly Norma Rae, the brash protagonist of the 1979 film that dramatized the plight of workers and the struggle to organize in the South. Kellogg's management fired him a year ago, accusing him of watching Netflix while on the job, a charge he and his friends called trumped up. He is now an apprentice with the steamfitters' union, still working on heating and air conditioning systems as he gets his campaign in gear. He's also a father of three children between the ages of 16 and 21. His wife is the general manager of a bar and grill in Omaha.
"He's not pounding his fist on the table," said Danny Begley, an Omaha City Council member and vice president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1483. "He's measured. He's calculated."
Mr. Osborn, who said he was a Democrat until 2016, wants to run on a narrow platform with what he hopes is extremely broad appeal: legalize marijuana (at least for medical use), raise the minimum wage nationally, secure abortion rights, protect gun rights and expand laws to facilitate union organizing. He condemns the inflation of the Biden era, but blames corporate greed and price gouging. He speaks of the U.S. border in distinctly Republican ways.
"Without borders you don't have a country," he said, though he added that once the border is closed, Congress should explore ways to legalize some undocumented workers already in the U.S.
Early in Israel's war in Gaza, campaign advisers told him to put out a statement staking a position. He refused, saying that it was not an issue he wants associated with his campaign.
"Dan has to get a message out that transcends political lines and goes to their pocketbooks," said Josh Josoff, an ally with the International Union of Elevator Constructors. "Don't let the wedge issues pull you away."
On the one issue he most certainly will not be able to escape, the presidential campaign, he seemed genuinely befuddled. Nebraska is overwhelmingly behind Donald J. Trump, as is Ms. Fischer. Mr. Osborn is not, a potential campaign killer this November. But he is not backing President Biden either.
"I think they're both too old; I think they're both incompetent," he said, finally settling on a position. "There's a good chance I won't vote for president."
Bob Kerrey -- a once-popular Democratic governor and senator in Nebraska who, in 2012, tried and failed at a comeback against Ms. Fischer in her first run for the Senate -- is a fan of Mr. Osborn, but is also a skeptic.
"He's got a hard-core economic agenda, and he has a really unique profile," Mr. Kerrey said. "You can't say, 'Well, what do you know about what we're going through?' because he does. He knows that the rules don't work for working people."
But Nebraska is stacked against Mr. Osborn. West of Lincoln are some of the largest rail yards in the country, but the freight rail companies, backed by Nebraska Republicans, have manhandled the rail unions, which were the first to ask Mr. Osborn to run after a new contract failed to grant their demand of seven paid sick days a year. Such unions may have limited power to deliver North Platte and points west.
The state's junior senator and former Republican governor, Pete Ricketts, is the other obstacle to Mr. Osborn's bid. He comes from a family of financiers worth billions of dollars, and he is more than willing to spend it.
Just ask Crista Eggers, who has been trying to legalize medical marijuana since 2019 to treat her son, Colton, who suffers daily epileptic seizures that his physicians believe are treatable with cannabis. Only three states still prohibit medical marijuana, though polls suggest 70 percent to 80 percent of Nebraskans support it. One of those people opposed is Mr. Ricketts, who declared as governor, "If you legalize marijuana, you're going to kill your kids."
In 2020, Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana got 197,000 signatures, in more than enough counties to get a legalization referendum on the ballot. But the Nebraska Supreme Court struck it from consideration on a technicality. Supporters tried again in 2022 but came up short of signatures. Ms. Eggers and her group are now at it again, hoping for some synergy with a ballot drive to protect abortion rights and with Mr. Osborn's campaign, though the group is prohibited from endorsing him.
A problem for Ms. Eggers, and for Mr. Osborn, is money. Signature drives are costly, and 90 of Nebraska's 93 counties are rural, adding to the challenge. Mr. Osborn himself has little name recognition statewide, and would require an introduction in the form of television ads and a robust campaign schedule, both expensive endeavors. Union supporters are optimistic that Mr. Osborn's message resonates against Ms. Fischer, if he has the cash to get it out.
"We just need to push past the Republican and Democrat thing, these teams we're on," said Josh Dredla, a friend of Mr. Osborn's who was on the Kellogg's picket lines.
Mr. Osborn said at a minimum the campaign needs to raise $ 2 million. So far, he's raised just over $ 200,000.
Ms. Fischer ended 2023 sitting on a war chest of close to $ 3.3 million.

Biden's Antitrust Enforcer Talks Wins and Losses: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Doha Mekki, one of President Biden's key antitrust enforcers, talks about the Justice Department's big wins and losses, and what could be in store if President Biden gets another four years.
Big deals are waiting on the tarmac as Wall Street and the business world anticipate how the presidential election will change antitrust enforcement.
President Biden has taken an aggressive approach to policing deals that some have called overreaching and others have lauded as a necessary return to scrutiny on the power wielded by big business. Dealmakers say they are holding some deals back in hope of a more lenient approach in the next administration.
Doha Mekki is on the ground executing the strategy. She's worked at the Justice Department under three administrations: as a trial attorney during the Obama presidency, in the front office during the Trump presidency and now as the principal deputy assistant attorney general under Jonathan Kanter.
In a recent interview at the Penn Carey Law Antitrust Association's annual symposium, DealBook talked with Mekki about the department's big wins and losses, and what could be in store if Biden gets another four years. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.
You led the lawsuit that successfully blocked JetBlue's acquisition of Spirit Airlines (the decision is under appeal). In a case like that, how do you weigh the risk that a company will fail because it's too weak on its own against the risk of a more consolidated industry?
There's a whole doctrine in antitrust that deals specifically with firms that are financially not viable. And it bears noting -- and certainly the court noted -- that the company did not make that argument. In fact, what Spirit, I think, projected to its shareholders for a long time was that they still intended to grow.
But a company probably does not want to make the case in court that a deal is life or death, because it likely doesn't want to signal that to shareholders.
I am probably contractually obligated to say you should always be honest.
Several firms, including JPMorgan Chase, dropped out of the Climate Action 100 + this week, citing antitrust concerns among other reasons. Some regulators abroad have protected green initiatives from antitrust enforcement. Should the United States do the same?
We have a 130-year-old first antitrust law, and a Clayton Act that's about 110 years old, and nowhere in that statute are we permitted to take into account noneconomic considerations. And that is a good thing, because we as an agency are not really set up to make those judgments.
Would a deal promising a more diverse board or management be looked at more favorably?
We are pretty clear that we have no capacity to take into account those kinds of considerations. To the extent that there's any suspicion about the agencies elevating or being less scrutinizing of these kinds of deals, it is, in fact, the opposite. It is actually the companies putting forward these social values that they intend to promote through their deals. And we're often saying: "Thank you, but no thank you. We can't consider that."
If President Biden is re-elected, what will be at the top of the agenda?
This year will be business as usual. We have investigations that we're really excited about. We have potential enforcement actions that we're really excited about.
How are you assessing the success of the past four years?
We've re-engaged with the actual law, as written by Congress and interpreted by the Supreme Court and the courts of appeals. We've had concerns that the law has really been disintermediated by policy goals and preferences that really can't be justified by textual reading of the statutes and the case law.
Is the fact there are fewer deals a sign of success?
Overall, I would be curious how much of it is antitrust enforcement versus the macro-environment.
Anecdotally, the number of deals with antitrust hair is also down -- and that's good for everyone. And it's also allowed us to pursue a heftier conduct docket, which is a really important part of the agency's mission.
You've also had some high-profile losses. Will that change your willingness to litigate?
It's important how we are losing. I'm not aware of a time when we have lost squarely on the law, even in cases like UnitedHealth Group-Change, where we had not previously pursued a competitively sensitive information theory of harm. The theory stood, right? We've tended to lose on how persuasive we are on our facts.
We take that feedback in stride and internalize it and try to make better arguments in the future. I think you see it in Penguin Random House-Simon and Schuster, where we leaned into stories about how mergers hurt authors and threaten to harm whose ideas get published. You see it in JetBlue-Spirit.
We prefer to win -- no doubt. But those hard lessons have really made us better, and we're going to continue to be better storytellers because that's our obligation to the public. -- Lauren Hirsch
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Nvidia leapfrogged Alphabet and Amazon, making it the third-largest U.S. listed company with a market capitalization of roughly $ 1.8 trillion. Its shares have climbed nearly 50 percent this year, adding roughly $ 560 billion to its market valuation since Jan. 2, as investors bet it will reap huge profits from building the chips that power artificial intelligence services.
Elon Musk continued his flight from Delaware. The billionaire moved the incorporation of the privately held SpaceX to Texas after a judge in Delaware voided his nearly $ 56 billion payday at Tesla. It remains unclear whether Tesla itself will be able to make the same journey.
OpenAI unveiled a new video tool called Sora, which generates high-quality videos from text prompts. Investors remain eager to pour money into generative A.I. companies. On Friday, The New York Times reported that OpenAI had completed a deal with Thrive Capital that values it at $ 80 billion or more, nearly tripling its valuation in less than 10 months.
Why you're still talking about that Dunkin' ad
A week after the Super Bowl, the marketing industry is still raving about the ad Dunkin' ran during the game and its many spin offs. (In case you've been living under a rock: Ben Affleck tries to impress Jennifer Lopez with a cringe-y song and the help of his sidekicks, Matt Damon and Tom Brady.)
Dunkin' has peppered the internet with bonus content, like footage of Affleck failing to catch a pass from Brady (Dunkin' told DealBook that was unscripted) and a collaboration with the social media influencer Charli D'Amelio. The brand is selling pink-and-orange tracksuits inspired by the one Affleck wore and has released the full song, "Don't Dunk Away at My Heart." All told, the campaign has amassed more than 12 million YouTube views.
"We believe this widespread buzz highlights the ad's ability to not only capture but sustain the audience's attention," Jill Nelson, Dunkin's chief marketing officer, told DealBook in an email, adding that the company sold more doughnuts on Valentine's Day this year than on any other day in its history.
The campaign demonstrates how marketing around the big game has changed.
"There's an immense power in using the Super Bowl as a nucleus," Derek Rucker, a professor at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management who studies effective advertising, told DealBook. With the average 30-second Super Bowl ad slot running $ 7 million, brands are looking to seed campaigns on other channels like social media, in-store promotions and other ads.
It's easier to start selling a branded Dunkin' tracksuit if millions are already in on the Ben-Jennifer plot. "You have a large base of people who understand 'Phase A' of the campaign," Rucker said.
Talent increasingly has skin in the game. Artists Equity, the production company Affleck and Damon founded, handled just about every aspect of the campaign. (Affleck and Gerry Cardinale, the founder of RedBird Capital, spoke at DealBook's conference in 2022 just after they announced the company.) When Artists Equity started, the actors said they intended to give talent a cut of the profits.
The concept behind the Dunkin' ad was initially pitched as part of a commercial to run during the Grammys. Dunkin' liked the idea so much "it inspired us to turn the narrative into two distinct chapters and make a Super Bowl ad," Nelson said. (In the Grammys ad, Affleck reveals his aspiration to become a pop star.)
"Some of the most compelling content didn't even make the final commercials because we reserved it for social media," Nelson added.
Four things we learned from "Supercommunicators"
What is it that makes some masters at delivering feedback, problem solving or communicating strategy? In "Supercommunicators," which releases on Tuesday, Charles Duhigg answers that question, drawing on decades of research.
"Supercommunicators aren't born with special abilities -- but they have thought harder about how conversations unfold," he writes. Here are four lessons from the book:
The right question can demonstrate that you're listening. A key to developing an emotional connection are "deep questions that delve into values, beliefs, judgment or experiences," Duhigg writes. (Think "what's the best part of your job?" instead of "where do you work?").
You can also demonstrate your understanding by asking questions, summarizing what you've heard and asking if you got it right, a technique called "looping."
The aim of conflict conversations is to understand, not win. It helps to demonstrate understanding through "looping"; acknowledge points of agreement; and talk in specifics rather than sweeping statements.
Effective online discourse requires a new approach. The discourse in letters and phone conversations has evolved. "We've developed norms and nearly unconscious behaviors -- the lilt in our voice when we answer a phone; the sign-off in a letter signaling our fondness for the reader -- that make communication easier," Duhigg writes.
He's hopeful that online communication will develop similar norms, like being extra polite and avoiding sarcasm and criticism.
Difficult conversations need structure. Duhigg suggests establishing guidelines; sharing your goals for the conversation, and asking others to share theirs; and acknowledging discomfort is expected, and OK.

William Post, 96, Dies; Led the Bakery Plant That Created Pop-Tarts: [Biography]

Full text: William Post, a businessman who was credited with a significant role in inventing Pop-Tarts, a classic American snack and cultural touchstone with an enticing sweetness and simplicity, died on Saturday in Grand Rapids, Mich. He was 96.
He died of heart failure in a senior living community, his son, Dan, said.
Mr. Post led the bakery plant that developed the first Pop-Tarts for Kellogg's in 1964, his son said. The snack quickly became a popular treat for many people in the United States, including Mr. Post's children, who were among the first taste testers.
Today, according to Kellogg's, billions of Pop-Tarts are sold each year. They have also been depicted on murals, showcased in museums and parodied by "Saturday Night Live." Later this year, they will star in "Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story," a farcical chronicle of the race in the 1960s to win the breakfast-pastry wars, directed by and starring the comedian (and Pop-Tarts enthusiast) Jerry Seinfeld.
Over the past 60 years, Pop-Tarts have expanded from four flavors to more than 30. But they have also maintained the classic form that has made them an American institution: two thin layers of dry, rectangular pastry with a sweet filling and frosting.
William Post was born on June 27, 1927, in Grand Rapids. He was one of seven children born to Henry Post and Johanna Jongsta, Dutch immigrants. His father, who was self-employed, drove a truck that hauled away the ashes from residential coal furnaces.
William attended Grand Rapids Christian High School while working part time washing trucks at the Hekman Biscuit Company. A year after his graduation in 1945, he was drafted into the Army Air Corps and served in occupied Japan.
After completing his military service, he returned to his part-time job, began studying at Calvin College and married Florence Schut, who died in 2020 after 72 years of marriage. Mr. Post left college in 1950 and became a full-time personnel manager at Hekman, which later became part of the Keebler Company.
When Kellogg's approached Mr. Post in 1964, he was managing Hekman's plant in Grand Rapids. At the time, Kellogg's competitor, Post, was creating a toaster pastry called Country Squares, later named Toast'em Pop Ups. Executives from Kellogg's, which sold cereal, asked Mr. Post if his plant would have the capacity to create a similar product.
"Being the absolutely positive person that he was," his son, Dan, recalled, "he said, 'Absolutely, give me two weeks."'
There were "many naysayers," and some of his friends said Pop-Tarts were "not such a good idea," Mr. Post told the West Michigan television station WWMT in 2021. He ignored them, and put together a team to create what Kellogg's wanted.
During those two weeks, his son said, he offered prototypes to his children at various stages of the product's development.
"They went from cardboard to a pastry," Dan Post said. "He would bring samples home almost daily and say, 'Kids, try these."' He added: "We'd say, 'This isn't so great.' After two weeks, we said, 'Hey, these are pretty good."'
After Mr. Post took the recipe to Kellogg's, the company sold its first shipment in Cleveland.
Kellogg's had originally considered calling Pop-Tarts "fruit scones." But their final name, coined by a Kellogg's executive, William LaMothe, was inspired by the pop culture movement of the day: Pop Art.
The earliest Pop-Tarts were not frosted. The icing was added a few years later, when Mr. Post came up with the idea.
"I said to our superintendent, 'Hey, why don't you take some Pop Tarts and run them under that icer?"' Mr. Post said in a video posted this year by Kellanova, the corporate name currently used by Kellogg's. He faced skeptics, who believed that the icing would melt in the toaster, but it did not. "The decision to make all four flavors iced took one day," he said.
As Pop-Tarts became an increasingly important part of his work, Mr. Post moved to Illinois in 1967 to begin working at the corporate offices of Keebler, where he became senior vice president.
He retired at 56, but he continued working as a consultant for Kellogg's until he was 76. He was also involved in his church and served as a board member for schools, churches and a local Y.M.C.A.
In addition to his son, Mr. Post is survived by his daughter, Rachel DeYoung; four grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.
Kellogg's history of the Pop-Tart on its website cites Mr. LaMothe, the chairman, for coming up with the idea for a "toaster-ready rectangle" and asking Joe Thompson to create it. It does not mention Mr. Post.
But after Mr. Post's death, the company said in a statement, "He played an important role in co-creating the iconic Pop-Tarts brand."
Mr. Post told his Pop-Tarts story to students into his 80s, his son said. He often talked about being the son of immigrants who could barely speak English, and he challenged students to do their best and work hard. He would also bring them samples from his unlimited supply of Pop-Tarts.
Every time he went into a classroom, his son recalled, he would tell the students, "'If you want to be noticed, always do more than is expected."'

Full text: Defending Donald Trump or deflecting his statements, some top G.O.P. officials reflected the trajectory of a party that the former president has largely bent to his will.
After Donald J. Trump suggested he had threatened to encourage Russia to attack "delinquent" NATO allies, the response among many Republican officials has struck three themes -- expressions of support, gaze aversion or even cheerful indifference.
Republican Party elites have become so practiced at deflecting even Mr. Trump's most outrageous statements that they quickly batted this one away. Mr. Trump, the party's likely presidential nominee, had claimed at a Saturday rally in South Carolina that he once threatened a NATO government to meet its financial commitments -- or else he would encourage Russia to "do whatever the hell they want" to that country.
In a phone interview on Sunday, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina seemed surprised to even be asked about Mr. Trump's remark.
"Give me a break -- I mean, it's Trump," Mr. Graham said. "All I can say is while Trump was president nobody invaded anybody. I think the point here is to, in his way, to get people to pay."
Senator Marco Rubio, the Republican Party's top-ranking official on the Senate Intelligence Committee, struck a matter-of-fact tone as he explained on CNN on Sunday why he was not bothered in the least.
"He told the story about how he used leverage to get people to step up to the plate and become more active in NATO," Mr. Rubio said on "State of the Union," rationalizing and sanitizing Mr. Trump's comments as just a more colorful version of what other U.S. presidents have done in urging NATO members to spend more on their own defense. "I have zero concern, because he's been president before. I know exactly what he has done and will do with the NATO alliance. But there has to be an alliance. It's not America's defense with a bunch of small junior partners."
Mr. Trump's comments from the rally stage were not part of his teleprompter remarks, according to a person close to him who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. But the remark -- a new version of a story he has been telling for years -- quickly inflamed in Europe what were already severe doubts about Mr. Trump's commitment to NATO's collective-defense provision. That provision, known as Article 5, states that an armed attack on any member "shall be considered an attack against them all."
Mr. Trump has been using his power over the G.O.P. to try to kill recent bipartisan efforts on Capitol Hill to send Ukraine more weapons and vital resources for its fight against Russia. Ukraine is not a NATO member, but helping Ukraine preserve its independence has become the alliance's defining mission since President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia began his military invasion in February 2022. And where Mr. Trump might land on a commitment to Ukraine has, for the international community and foreign-policy experts, become something of a stand-in for how he will approach NATO, America's most important military alliance, in any potential second term.
Officials from smaller and more vulnerable NATO countries are especially worried because Mr. Trump has already suggested that it's not in America's national interest to get in a war with Russia to defend a tiny nation like, say, Montenegro.
The international reaction to Mr. Trump's Saturday remarks included a rare public rebuke from Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general. Mr. Stoltenberg said that "any suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the U.S., and puts American and European soldiers at increased risk."
The defense of Mr. Trump by several Republican officials such as Mr. Graham reflected the trajectory of a party that the former president has largely bent to his will.
Eight years ago, when Mr. Trump was in the thick of his first campaign for president, Mr. Graham would have given a very different response. In that campaign, Mr. Graham -- initially one of Mr. Trump's competitors in the primary, whom Mr. Trump quickly vanquished -- saw himself as a defender of the Republican Party's internationalist values against what he perceived as the acute threat of Mr. Trump's isolationism.
As a wingman of the late Republican hawk and war hero Senator John McCain of Arizona, Mr. Graham traveled the country warning anyone who would listen about the dangers of Mr. Trump. But after Mr. Trump won the presidency, Mr. Graham set about becoming a friend and close adviser and was welcomed into Mr. Trump's inner circle. Many others followed a similar path.
In 2016, Mr. Rubio, another foreign policy hawk who competed against Mr. Trump for the party's nomination, called Mr. Trump a "con man" and warned how dangerous he would be if entrusted with the nation's nuclear codes. But after Mr. Trump won, he put those feelings aside, became friendly with Mr. Trump and is now among a handful of Republicans in contention to be his running mate.
Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, among the most hawkish Republicans on national defense, suggested European nations in the alliance needed to do more to sustain their own defenses against Russian incursions.
"NATO countries that don't spend enough on defense, like Germany, are already encouraging Russian aggression and President Trump is simply ringing the warning bell," Mr. Cotton said in an interview. "Strength, not weakness, deters aggression. Russia invaded Ukraine twice under Barack Obama and Joe Biden, but not under Donald Trump."
Several former national security and foreign policy officials in the Trump administration declined to speak about the anecdote that Mr. Trump told about threatening a NATO member nation's head of state with encouraging Russian aggression. But they said they recalled no such meeting actually taking place.
Mr. Trump is fond of outright falsehoods in relaying stories to make himself look like a tough negotiator. His former national security adviser John Bolton, who has warned that Mr. Trump would withdraw the U.S. from NATO in a second term, said he had never heard Mr. Trump threaten another country's leader that he would encourage a Russian invasion.
Another former official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid inflaming Mr. Trump, delicately described the tale as "hyperbole." Still another former official -- H.R. McMaster, Mr. Trump's second national security adviser and a retired Army lieutenant general -- gave a one-word assessment of Mr. Trump's comments: "Irresponsible."
Mr. Trump often praises Mr. Putin -- he has described the invasion of Ukraine as the work of a "genius" -- and has long admired him as a "strong" leader.
During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump called on Russia to "find" emails that Hillary Clinton, then the Democratic nominee for president and a target of Mr. Putin, had deleted from her private email server. He has suggested Mr. Putin is no different, morally, from American leaders. When Bill O'Reilly, a former Fox News host, pressed Mr. Trump shortly after he took office on his admiration for Mr. Putin, saying that the Russian leader "is a killer," Mr. Trump replied, "What, you think our country's so innocent?"
But as president, Mr. Trump's policies toward Russia were sometimes tougher than his predecessor's -- a point that Mr. Trump's allies highlight when they dismiss statements such as Saturday's as rhetorical flourishes. Mr. Trump's allies, who claim he would not undermine NATO in a second term, point out that in his first term he approved sending antitank weapons to Ukraine, which President Obama had not done after Russia seized Crimea in 2014.
As he runs to take back the White House -- and as polls suggest he has a good chance of doing so -- Mr. Trump has been coy about his intentions for NATO. His campaign website contains a single cryptic sentence: "We have to finish the process we began under my administration of fundamentally re-evaluating NATO's purpose and NATO's mission."
When pressed on what that means, Mr. Trump and his team have refused to elaborate.
Mr. Trump has been focused in private conversations about treating foreign aid as loans, something he has posted about on social media, as Senate Republicans tried again on Sunday to pass an aid package, after Mr. Trump helped tank their earlier efforts. But the Russia comment appeared to catch most on his team by surprise.
Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump's campaign, when asked to explain the former president's statements -- including whether it was an invitation for new aggression from Russia -- did not directly address the question.
"Democrat and media pearl-clutchers seem to have forgotten that we had four years of peace and prosperity under President Trump, but Europe saw death and destruction under Obama-Biden and now more death and destruction under Biden," Mr. Miller said. "President Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by demanding they pay up, but Joe Biden went back to letting them take advantage of the American taxpayer. When you don't pay your defense spending, you can't be surprised that you get more war."
NATO countries' spending on their own defense grew during the Trump administration, but it has expanded by an even larger amount during the Biden administration, after Russia invaded Ukraine.
Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general who worked in the Trump administration, has remained close to Mr. Trump and who has also been outspoken on the need to defend Ukraine, spoke at the request of the Trump campaign, saying that he did not believe Mr. Trump was opening the door to fresh aggression.
Mr. Trump, Mr. Kellogg said, has a "track record of deterrence."
He added, "I really do think he's onto something," saying that he believes Mr. Trump's goal is to get NATO members to focus on Article 3 of NATO's founding treaty, which calls on nations to build their individual and collective abilities to stave off an armed attack.
"I don't think it's encouragement at all," Mr. Kellogg said, because "we know what he means when he says it."

In Dating, Ambition Might Matter More Than Politics: [Op-Ed]

Author: Grose, Jessica

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I read through all 274 responses to a questionnaire I put out about how politics affects the dating lives of Americans under 30, and I took note of the fact that quite a few respondents used economic terminology when describing their romantic experiences. The term "scarcity," in particular, came up more than once as a factor in dating experiences.
A very liberal man in New York who said he doesn't even consider dating people who put "moderate" in their dating profiles said, "It's probably unfair, but with such a deep left-leaning dating pool, there's no scarcity mind-set forcing us to interact and test that assessment." A very liberal woman in Denver had the opposite perspective because she felt that liberal men were scarce: "I was in a pretty bad relationship, but I stayed in it so long in part because I worried I wouldn't find another man who is a Democrat," she said.
I started thinking that when it comes to politics, people tend to be rational daters within their romantic markets and that when it comes to dating, the total number of liberals and conservatives in the country doesn't matter as much as where they are distributed and whether there is a mismatch in smaller areas.
Which is to say: If you live in a big city that has lots of people who are politically like-minded, you can afford to filter out the people who don't align with you very closely. If you live in a smaller or more politically mixed environment, you can't afford to be very choosy without severely restricting your dating pool. In Brooklyn, for example, registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans about eight to one. So for liberal daters in my bubble, it doesn't matter nearly as much that in the country overall, men are more likely to be conservative; a New Yorker is unlikely to be dating someone who lives in Alabama or Wyoming.
(It's worth noting here that some political scientists have pushed back on the notion that the political divide between young men and women is growing in the first place. There is evidence that both men and women under 30 have become more liberal over time.)
I ran my theory by a few academics who have studied politics and dating to see if there was any research that might explain or give more weight to my observations, with the understanding that the Times readers who replied to my questionnaire aren't a demographically representative sample. The long and short of it is that in general, when people are looking for serious relationships, they want partners who are similar to them in a variety of dimensions. It's called homophily.
But politics is just one potential area of homophily. Education level, religion, attractiveness (however you define that) and race are among the factors that people consider when looking for a mate. It's possible that if you're dating in a market where political sameness is tough to find or if you just don't care very much about politics in the first place, you might put greater weight on other factors.
Neil Malhotra, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business who has published research on political homophily and online dating, said that he and his co-author, Gregory Huber, found that while shared politics make someone more likely to engage with someone else on an online dating platform, the importance of politics is "much, much smaller compared to things like age and religion and things like that. And it's smaller than education," he said. With the important caveats that Malhotra and Huber were using data from people who were active online daters in 2010 -- a pretty long time ago for the political and online dating landscapes -- and narrowed their scope to those seeking opposite-sex partners, they found that politics are "not clearly dominating all the normal things people select on," he said.
There's also a way in which online dating specifically may influence people's ideas of the political leanings of their particular dating market. Casey Klofstad, the chair of political science at the University of Miami, described politics as "plumage" for online daters. "Choosing to display that connotes that you value it and that you are seeking to attract like-minded folks," Klofstad said. "And the folks that do that are the ones that are more politically engaged, on average."
If you meet someone in real life, unless he signals his politics via a T-shirt slogan or a bumper sticker, you probably won't know his beliefs until you go on a couple of dates, at which point you may be willing to overlook some political differences, as long as they don't conflict with your most deeply held values. For example, many liberals and liberal-leaning people who responded to my questionnaire said they would date a conservative as long as he or she wasn't a Trump voter. Likewise, a few conservatives said they would be open to dating a liberal as long as he or she wasn't anti-Israel.
More than partisan politics, I'd argue that the more profound change we see today is increased sorting for education and earnings.
Using data from Denmark (they noted that analogous data wasn't available for the United States), researchers from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, Aarhus University and the University of Michigan found that Danes were more deliberately sorting themselves for education and ambition, which they defined as choosing careers associated with high wage growth over time. "The researchers established that self-sorting into equal-ambition couples increased by about 25 percent between 1980 and 2018," according to Katie Gilbert, who summarized the study's findings for the Kellogg website.
There are comparable dynamics in the United States. Ryan Burge, an associate professor of political science at Eastern Illinois University, analyzed data from the General Social Survey and shared it with me over email. He found that in the 1970s, among people who took the survey and had a graduate degree, "39 percent of them married someone with a high school diploma or less. Fifty-seven percent married someone with at least a four-year degree. In the 2020s, among people with a graduate degree, just 19 percent married someone with a high school diploma or less, and 78 percent married someone with a college degree." In a paper published in 2012, Klofstad and Rindy Anderson found that "individuals of both sexes seek mates with an income similar to their own, regardless of local resource pressures."
Gen Z has become known for its general distrust of societal institutions, but it's a generation still coming of age. I often wonder if the ugliness of our polarized landscape is having a moderating effect on younger daters, who see the rancor and division and largely want no part of it.
Though there is evidence of a liberal tilt among millennials and Gen Z-ers, a new report from the Public Religion Research Institute found a marked difference between Gen Z adults and Gen Z teens: Gen Z teens are more moderate than Gen Z adults, and they're also more likely to have no political affiliation. And the political gender gap among Gen Z teens is smaller than the political gender gap among Gen Z adults, with 27 percent of teenage girls and 21 percent of teenage boys identifying as liberal.
Maybe I'm an old romantic, but after spending a few weeks talking to 20-somethings who are dating around, I believe they're going to find their people, as much as the generations before them ever did. All the people I talked to said they wanted to be in a serious, enduring relationship someday, even if they didn't pine for permanent partnership in the near term. The process of being young and out there is always a messy one, and it's easy to have rose-colored glasses in retrospect.

Williamsburg. What Happened?: [Style Desk]

Full text: A four-decade timeline of total transformation.
A car is moving down Kent Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. A passenger captures the scene on video -- abandoned factory buildings, vacant lots and a crumbling warehouse beneath grim skies. Twenty-five years later, that same stretch is lined with glassy apartment towers, boutique hotels and a Trader Joe's.
For those who remember the Williamsburg of long ago, or even a decade ago, walking its streets can be disorienting, like running into an old friend who has had extensive plastic surgery. In a dramatic transformation, more than 500 condominium buildings have sprung up there since 2005, and much of the north side has become an upscale shopping district.
The neighborhood seemed to cross a Rubicon in 2023, when Hermès opened a pop-up shop on North Sixth Street and announced plans for a permanent outpost nearby. Then Chanel -- Chanel! -- opened a boutique on the same street.
There have been many Williamsburgs over time. It was a place of tenements in Betty Smith's "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"; a haven for Jews escaping persecution in Europe; a stronghold for Puerto Rican, Dominican, Polish and Ukrainian immigrants.
This story concerns more recent history, when a neighborhood of mills, foundries and meatpacking plants became a cheap-rent paradise for artists and, finally, a prime destination for developers and international luxury brands. This timeline charts that remarkable evolution in words and images, year by year.
'Pure Bohemia'
1988
The Lizard's Tail, shown here in its early years, hosts poets, rock bands and one-act plays in a makeshift space under the Williamsburg Bridge, in a neighborhood of mainly Hispanic and Hasidic residents. The New York Times calls the club "pure bohemia, reminiscent of the Lower East Side in the early 1980s."
1989
Kerry Smith, a former firefighter, opens the Right Bank Cafe on Kent Avenue. An early customer, the writer Ando Arike, describes it as a place for "the lost, the confused, the drunks, the drug-addled, the drinkers, the poets," as well as "the old-timers, the Latinos, the Russians, the Poles, the Hasidic Jews, the bridge workers, the bikers," and other types. Local bands play on its modest courtyard stage, shown above.
The artist Phyllis Yampolsky founds Independent Friends of McCarren Park with the aim of restoring McCarren Park Pool, a lake-size pool built on the Willamsburg-Greenpoint border in the 1930s. It has fallen into disrepair since it closed in 1983.
1990
It's an art show. It's a concert. It's a party. It's Cat's Head, an all-night event featuring local artists and musicians. It takes place on Bastille Day at the vacant Old Dutch Mustard factory on Metropolitan Avenue, drawing 750 revelers.
1991
Waterfront Week, a zine for the neighborhood's growing community of writers, artists and musicians, starts regular publication.
In a former auto repair shop on North First Street, Annie Herron opens Herron Test-Site, one of the neighborhood's first commercial art galleries.
Keep Refrigerated, a club that hosts wee-hours raves, punk shows and art installations, opens in a former meatpacking plant on North Sixth Street. Roughly 300 people squeeze into its three floors.
1992
Williamsburg makes the cover of New York magazine. The story reports that an estimated 2,000 artists are living in this "working-class neighborhood." Medea de Vyse, a performance artist, provides the money quote: "In the 70s, it was Soho. In the 80s, the East Village. In the 90s, it will be Williamsburg."
Mugs Ale House, on Bedford Avenue, becomes a saloon of choice for artists and musicians priced out of Lower Manhattan. The old-school barroom, shown above, is "dark and dingy," the Daily News reports. Newcomers smoke cigarettes, drink craft beers and eat burgers and chops alongside Polish and Ukrainian locals.
'Where It's At'
1993
Oznot's Dish, a Mediterranean-style bistro, opens on Berry Street. It becomes a first-date spot and a place where recent arrivals take visiting family members.
1994
A former Polish luncheonette on Bedford Avenue is revamped as Planet Thailand. A Times critic notes that Williamsburg, as a dining destination, "is slowly becoming visible against the Milky Way of Manhattan restaurants."
1995
Located in a former mayonnaise factory, and famous for its sunken reflecting pool, Galapagos Art Space attracts crowds who might encounter a poetry slam or a musician blowing into a didgeridoo. The aroma of nearby meat-processing plants lends a certain ambience.
1996
Two decades after the closing of the Schaefer and Rheingold breweries in Brooklyn, beer-making returns to the borough with the opening of Brooklyn Brewery in a former matzo factory on North 11th Street. Its signature brand is Brooklyn Lager. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani serves as brewmaster on opening day.
1997
Utne Reader names Williamsburg the third hippest place in the nation, behind the Lower Garden District in New Orleans and the Inner Mission in San Francisco.
1998
Andrew Tarlow and Mark Firth open Diner, a restaurant in a dining-car-like structure beneath the Williamsburg Bridge. With its focus on local ingredients, casual-hip service and a considered take on familiar dishes, Diner embodies the artisanal Brooklyn aesthetic that will soon be everywhere.
1999
New York City's Board of Standards and Appeals grants a variance in zoning laws that have long favored manufacturing along the waterfront, allowing for the construction of some 220 apartments in the Austin, Nichols Warehouse, a grand structure on Kent Avenue. Designed in Egyptian Revival style by Cass Gilbert, the architect of the Woolworth Building, it has sat vacant for decades.
The site of Pete's Candy Store, on Lorimer Avenue, was once a general store, a luncheonette and a gambling den. Now it opens as a bar and music venue. The British singer-songwriter Beth Orton plays the first show.
It was once the Real Form Girdle Factory. Now this Bedford Avenue building is a mini mall, with an internet cafe, a cheese shop and a record store. For those in search of art books or Jonathan Lethem's latest, there's Spoonbill & Sugartown Booksellers.
2000
Kokie's Place, on the corner of Berry and North Third, is in a transitional phase. Once an after-hours haunt for some of the area's longtime Puerto Rican residents, it begins to draw a different crowd. The author Robert Anasi describes the regulars as a mix of factory workers, immigrants and "a couple of artist types with their sideburns and thick-framed glasses." It will soon attract a new creature on the scene: the Williamsburg hipster, who is identified by a trucker hat, tattoos and a fondness for indie rock. Reports suggest the establishment's name was literal: patrons could buy cocaine in the back.
An old-school stainless steel diner -- formerly the Wythe Diner, on Wythe Avenue -- is sold by the Ukrainian family who owned it to the proprietor of a West Village burrito joint. After a renovation, it will open as Relish and become a symbol of the new Williamsburg (and a popular film-shoot location).
The neighborhood is changing fast but Peter Luger Steak House stays the same, serving porterhouse steaks, fried potatoes and spinach to city officials and other meat lovers in the shadow of the Williamsburg Bridge. This year, it is one of only two Brooklyn establishments listed in the annual Zagat Survey of New York City's top restaurants.
2001
Northsix, a rock club, opens in the same former factory building as Galapagos. The club presents Moldy Peaches, the Walkmen and Calla, among other acts. Luxx opens the same year on Grand Street and hosts DJ Larry Tee's weekly "Berliniamsburg" electroclash party. "It's official," The New York Post declares. "Brooklyn is where it's at."
Well past its days as an alternative paper in Montreal, Vice Media moves its headquarters from a building in Manhattan to a Williamsburg warehouse. Its writers, editors and videographers will help turn the neighborhood into a media phenomenon.
'New Life'
2002
In his inaugural address, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg pledges: "We will bring new life to our waterfront and stimulate new investment in housing."
The Gen Xers who arrived in the '90s are having babies. Sam & Seb, shown above, begins serving them from a former arts supply store on Bedford Avenue. Its stock will include tiny Levi's, tiny Dries Van Noten tops, and tiny Che Guevara T-shirts. Sean Kennerly, a local writer, grumbles to The Times: "You always figure there are places for people who want to have kids. Like over in Park Slope."
2003
The Gretsch building, a former guitar factory erected in 1916, undergoes a $ 75 million renovation and becomes luxury lofts. A studio is priced at $ 500,000; a two-bedroom with river views asks a then-staggering $ 999,000. Busta Rhymes buys three units; Josh Hartnett nabs the penthouse.

Robert Lanham, who arrived in the neighborhood from Virginia about five years earlier, publishes "The Hipster Handbook," a cheeky guide to Williamsburg's signature creature. The hipster, he writes, "shuns or reduces to kitsch anything held dear by the mainstream" and "ideally possesses no more than 2 percent body fat."
2004
After more than a century, the Domino Sugar Refinery all but ceases operations. "I learned this past week that I'm a dinosaur," says Richard Rednour, a foreman who is laid off.

2005

In an interview with The Brooklyn Paper, Mr. Lanham, the hipster chronicler, notes a change in the local scene: "What gets on my nerves, though, are the Wall Streeters who have come into the area to 'get dirty with the artists' and have brought their condominiums with them."
Rick and Michael Mast, bearded brothers from Iowa City, Iowa, "are giving Willy Wonka a run for his money," Time magazine reports, by selling their own "bean-to-bar" artisanal chocolate out of their Williamsburg apartment. They will soon open a shop on North Third Street and a factory nearby.

2024

In 2023, that figure had more than doubled, to $ 111,748.
"You have a combination of age, demographics and wealth that are all concentrated in that area," said Kael Goodman, the head of Marketproof, an analytics company that specializes in New York real estate. Williamsburg now has 135 active and recently completed development projects greater than 25,000-square-feet, according to Marketproof, the most of any neighborhood in the city.

NEW YORK — A car is moving down Kent Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. A passenger captures the scene on video — abandoned factory buildings, vacant lots and a crumbling warehouse beneath grim skies. Twenty-five years later, that same stretch is lined with glassy apartment towers, boutique hotels and a Trader Joe’s.
For those who remember the Williamsburg of long ago, or even a decade ago, walking its streets can be disorienting, like running into an old friend who has had extensive plastic surgery. In a dramatic transformation, more than 500 condominium buildings have sprung up there since 2005, and much of the north side has become an upscale shopping district.
The neighborhood seemed to cross a Rubicon in 2023, when Hermès opened a pop-up shop on North Sixth Street and announced plans for a permanent outpost nearby. Then Chanel — Chanel! — opened a boutique on the same street.
There have been many Williamsburgs over time. It was a place of tenements in Betty Smith’s “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn”; a haven for Jews escaping persecution in Europe; a stronghold for Puerto Rican, Dominican, Polish and Ukrainian immigrants.
This story concerns more recent history, when a neighborhood of mills, foundries and meatpacking plants became a cheap-rent paradise for artists and, finally, a prime destination for developers and international luxury brands. This timeline charts that remarkable evolution, year by year.
‘PURE BOHEMIA’
— 1988
The Lizard’s Tail hosts poets, rock bands and one-act plays in a makeshift space under the Williamsburg Bridge, in a neighborhood of mainly Hispanic and Hasidic residents. The New York Times calls the club “pure bohemia, reminiscent of the Lower East Side in the early 1980s.”
— 1989
Kerry Smith, a former firefighter, opens the Right Bank Cafe on Kent Avenue. An early customer, writer Ando Arike, describes it as a place for “the lost, the confused, the drunks, the drug-addled, the drinkers, the poets,” as well as “the old-timers, the Latinos, the Russians, the Poles, the Hasidic Jews, the bridge workers, the bikers,” and other types. Local bands play on its modest courtyard stage.
Artist Phyllis Yampolsky founds Independent Friends of McCarren Park with the aim of restoring McCarren Park Pool , a lake-size pool built on the Willamsburg-Greenpoint border in the 1930s. It has fallen into disrepair since it closed in 1983.
— 1990
It’s an art show. It’s a concert. It’s a party. It’s Cat’s Head , an all-night event featuring local artists and musicians. It takes place on Bastille Day at the vacant Old Dutch Mustard factory on Metropolitan Avenue, drawing 750 revelers.
— 1991
Waterfront Week , a zine for the neighborhood’s growing community of writers, artists and musicians, starts regular publication.
In a former auto repair shop on North First Street, Annie Herron opens Herron Test-Site , one of the neighborhood’s first commercial art galleries.
Keep Refrigerated , a club that hosts wee-hours raves, punk shows and art installations, opens in a former meatpacking plant on North Sixth Street. Roughly 300 people squeeze into its three floors.
— 1992
Williamsburg makes the cover of New York magazine. The story reports that an estimated 2,000 artists are living in this “working-class neighborhood.” Medea de Vyse, a performance artist, provides the money quote: “In the ’70s, it was Soho. In the ’80s, the East Village. In the ’90s, it will be Williamsburg.”
Mugs Ale House , on Bedford Avenue, becomes a saloon of choice for artists and musicians priced out of lower Manhattan. The old-school barroom is “dark and dingy,” the Daily News reports. Newcomers smoke cigarettes, drink craft beers, and eat burgers and chops alongside Polish and Ukrainian locals.
‘WHERE IT’S AT’
— 1993
Oznot’s Dish , a Mediterranean-style bistro, opens on Berry Street. It becomes a first-date spot and a place where recent arrivals take visiting family members.
— 1994
A former Polish luncheonette on Bedford Avenue is revamped as Planet Thailand . A Times critic notes that Williamsburg, as a dining destination, “is slowly becoming visible against the Milky Way of Manhattan restaurants.”
— 1995
Located in a former mayonnaise factory, and famous for its sunken reflecting pool, Galapagos Art Space attracts crowds who might encounter a poetry slam or a musician blowing into a didgeridoo. The aroma of nearby meat-processing plants lends a certain ambience.
— 1996
Two decades after the closing of the Schaefer and Rheingold breweries in Brooklyn, beer-making returns to the borough with the opening of Brooklyn Brewery in a former matzo factory on North 11th Street. Its signature brand is Brooklyn Lager. Mayor Rudy Giuliani serves as brewmaster on opening day.

— 1999
New York City’s Board of Standards and Appeals grants a variance in zoning laws that have long favored manufacturing along the waterfront, allowing for the construction of some 220 apartments in the Austin, Nichols Warehouse , a grand structure on Kent Avenue. Designed in Egyptian Revival style by Cass Gilbert, the architect of the Woolworth Building, it has sat vacant for decades.
The site of Pete’s Candy Store , on Lorimer Avenue, was once a general store, a luncheonette and a gambling den. Now it opens as a bar and music venue. British singer-songwriter Beth Orton plays the first show.
It was once the Real Form Girdle Factory. Now the Bedford Avenue building is a mini mall, with an internet cafe, a cheese shop and a record store. For those in search of art books or Jonathan Lethem’s latest, there’s Spoonbill & Sugartown Booksellers .
— 2000
Kokie’s Place , on the corner of Berry and North Third, is in a transitional phase. Once an after-hours haunt for some of the area’s longtime Puerto Rican residents, it begins to draw a different crowd. Author Robert Anasi describes the regulars as a mix of factory workers, immigrants and “a couple of artist types with their sideburns and thick-framed glasses.” It will soon attract a new creature on the scene: the Williamsburg hipster, who is identified by a trucker hat, tattoos and a fondness for indie rock. Reports suggest the establishment’s name was literal: Patrons could buy cocaine in the back.
An old-school stainless steel diner — formerly the Wythe Diner, on Wythe Avenue — is sold by the Ukrainian family who owned it to the proprietor of a West Village burrito joint. After a renovation, it will open as Relish and become a symbol of the new Williamsburg (and a popular film-shoot location).
The neighborhood is changing fast, but Peter Luger Steak House stays the same, serving porterhouse steaks, fried potatoes and spinach to city officials and other meat lovers in the shadow of the Williamsburg Bridge. This year, it is one of only two Brooklyn establishments to make the annual Zagat Survey’s list of the 50 most popular New York City restaurants.
— 2001
Northsix , a rock club, opens in the same former factory building as Galapagos. The club presents Moldy Peaches, the Walkmen and Calla, among other acts. Luxx opens the same year on Grand Street and hosts DJ Larry Tee’s weekly “Berliniamsburg” electroclash party. “It’s official,” The New York Post declares. “Brooklyn is where it’s at.”
Well past its days as an alternative paper in Montreal, Vice Media moves its headquarters from a building in Manhattan to a Williamsburg warehouse. Its writers, editors and videographers will help turn the neighborhood into a media phenomenon.
‘NEW LIFE’
— 2002
In his inaugural address, Mayor Michael Bloomberg pledges: “We will bring new life to our waterfront and stimulate new investment in housing.”
The Gen Xers who arrived in the ’90s are having babies. Sam & Seb begins serving them from a former arts supply store on Bedford Avenue. Its stock will include tiny Levi’s, tiny Dries Van Noten tops and tiny Che Guevara T-shirts. Sean Kennerly, a local writer, grumbles to the Times: “You always figure there are places for people who want to have kids. Like over in Park Slope.”
— 2003
The Gretsch building , a former guitar factory erected in 1916, undergoes a $75 million renovation and becomes luxury lofts. A studio is priced at $500,000; a two-bedroom with river views asks a then-staggering $999,000. Busta Rhymes buys three units; Josh Hartnett nabs the penthouse.
You can’t furnish your luxury condo from secondhand shops. Thus opens Future Perfect , which sells contemporary design by Piet Hein Eek, a Dutch designer, and Lindsey Adelman, whose chandeliers become hanging status symbols.
The Bloomberg administration announces a plan to rezone a 1.6-mile stretch along the East River in Williamsburg and Greenpoint. The change would open the area to residential buildings as high as 350 feet.
Robert Lanham, who arrived in the neighborhood from Virginia about five years earlier, publishes “The Hipster Handbook,” a cheeky guide to Williamsburg’s signature creature. The hipster, he writes, “shuns or reduces to kitsch anything held dear by the mainstream” and “ideally possesses no more than 2 percent body fat.”
— 2004
After more than a century, the Domino Sugar Refinery all but ceases operations. “I learned this past week that I’m a dinosaur,” says Richard Rednour, a foreman who is laid off. Six months later, developer Community Preservation Corporation Resources buys the facility and wins city approval to build glassy apartment towers on the 11-acre site.
— 2005
Clothes-shopping in the area once meant a trip to thrift stores like Domsey’s Warehouse Outlet, Beacon’s Closet or Buffalo Exchange. The arrival of Wendy Mullin of Built by Wendy — known for outfitting Beastie Boys and Parker Posey — brings designer fashion to the neighborhood.
In a May 12 dispatch, the Times reports on a victory for the Bloomberg administration : “The City Council overwhelmingly approved plans yesterday to rezone 175 waterfront blocks in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Greenpoint, removing the last major hurdle to the city’s most ambitious redevelopment effort in decades.”
Concert promoter Ron Delsener Presents donates money to clean up McCarren Park Pool, the long-neglected, 55,400-square-foot swimming pool, so that an experimental dance performance can be staged there, with plans for 10 more events the next summer.
The City Council revokes the landmark status of the Austin , Nichols Warehouse. The decision, which comes amid protests from preservationists, allows the developer to alter the exterior while adding six floors for condo units.
— 2006
Toll Brothers, a homebuilding company known for suburban McMansions, announces North8 , a 6-story residential complex. An ad conveys the vibe: “Williamsburg. All grown up.”
A music scene coalesces around illegal or semi-legal performance spaces, including Glasslands , which leases a warehouse on Kent Avenue to host Vampire Weekend, MGMT, Dirty Projectors and other indie acts.
Developer Steiner Equities buys the Old Dutch Mustard Factory , where condiments were produced from 1941 until roughly 1980 and underground parties took place in the years after that. Demolition soon clears the way for town houses and more than 100 apartments.
— 2007
McCarren Park Pool is reborn as a concert venue, with an indie-rock-heavy roster of performers this summer and next. Acts include Band of Horses, Beastie Boys, Blonde Redhead, Cat Power, Deerhoof, Deerhunter, Deer Tick, Feist, Grizzly Bear, MGMT, M.I.A., Modest Mouse, TV on the Radio and Wilco.
Amid rent hikes, rock club Northsix is sold to Bowery Presents, the company behind Manhattan’s Bowery Ballroom. After a multimillion-dollar renovation, it reopens as Music Hall of Williamsburg . Fiery Furnaces and Patti Smith take the stage.
— 2008
In an interview with The Brooklyn Paper, Lanham, the hipster chronicler, notes a change in the local scene: “What gets on my nerves, though, are the Wall Streeters who have come into the area to ‘get dirty with the artists’ and have brought their condominiums with them.”
Rick and Michael Mast , bearded brothers from Iowa City, Iowa, “are giving Willy Wonka a run for his money,” Time magazine reports, by selling their own “bean-to-bar” artisanal chocolate out of their Williamsburg apartment. They will soon open a shop on North Third Street and a factory nearby.
‘YUPPIFICATION TRAIN’
— 2009
A desolate waterfront stretch, long the site of low-budget music videos and illegal parties, is now The Edge : two residential towers, with underground parking, fitness centers, an indoor pool, spa treatment rooms, virtual golf and a full-time support staff.
A Duane Reade pharmacy opens on Kent Avenue, heralding the arrival of chain stores.

While many of Williamsburg’s historic residents remain, the neighborhood has transformed around them, becoming significantly wealthier and more white. In 1990, the median household income for Williamsburg and Greenpoint (converted to 2022 dollars) was $45,640, according to the New York University Furman Center. In 2023, that figure had more than doubled, to $111,748.
“You have a combination of age, demographics and wealth that are all concentrated in that area,” said Kael Goodman, the head of Marketproof, an analytics company that specializes in New York real estate. Williamsburg now has 135 active and recently completed development projects greater than 25,000 square feet, according to Marketproof, the most of any neighborhood in the city.

Full text: Once a necessity, fireplaces are now an indulgence in New York City.
New Yorkers know all too well the familiar, grating sounds of winter: the hiss, clank and gurgle of radiators.
In elite corners of the city of 8.5 million people, a privileged few are soothed by something else: the crackle.
A working fireplace -- from a wood-burning hearth to a gas-powered pit -- is as rare as Central Park's Hot Duck. In 2015, the city banned wood-burning fireplaces in new construction. But fire once powered New York, where many buildings predate electricity, said Kirsten Ring Murray, an architect and owner at Olson Kundig.
"It's easy to forget about how necessary and fundamental fire was," she said. "We've removed something so essential and beautiful from our everyday experience with modern technology. As designers, we are bringing back its primordial pleasures."
Fire is now a luxury.
Fires Everywhere
As a boy in Belgium, Jean-Michel Gathy, a luxury resort designer, was charged with adding logs and shoveling ashes to keep his family's enormous walk-in fireplace burning six months a year.
With that inspiration, Mr. Gathy placed more than 100 gas fireplaces within Aman New York, a hotel conversion of a 1921 office building at 57th Street and Fifth Avenue. Mr. Gathy's design uses fire lavishly, as multiple gas fires ring the indoor swimming pool and more burn in the lobby. The adjoining outdoor roof terrace hosts a modern sort of gas bonfire on a tidy round island centered in a reflecting pool.
In a suite upstairs, wood panels that retract surround a bathtub so bathers can view an impressive free-standing glass fireplace at the foot of the bed. Whenever he sleeps at the Aman, the designer said in an email, he keeps his "fire going even when I switch off all the lights, until the very last moment."
Crank It
Sawmills, foundries and warehouses once filled West Chelsea, so Kirsten Ring Murray, the architect, said she wanted to "touch the industrial memory of the neighborhood" for the new interiors of the Cortland apartments, a riverfront brick tower by Robert A.M. Stern Architects.
The centerpiece of the lobby is a rugged lobby fireplace that she said telegraphs "light and life." The fire, which is gas, burns sealed behind glass. Children may safely take a turn at the playfully oversized crank and exposed chain, which raise and lower the decorative sepia bronze fire screen mechanically. "Adults love it too," she said, noting the "sense of wonder from seeing how things work."
'Jump Around'
A downtown couple, Alana Frankfort, 38, and Dovid Spector, 45, headed to the Upper West Side after their daughter, Sienna, was born in 2018. They settled on a penthouse in a newly built tower with brown oak parquetry and beige limestone, though Tori Golub, the couple's interior designer, found it "hard to imagine a fun young family there."
Ms. Golub looked for ways to adapt the apartment to the tastes of Ms. Frankfort -- a founding member of the digital retailer Gilt City and a daughter of Lew Frankfort, the former chief executive of Coach -- and Mr. Spector, a real estate executive. "We don't take ourselves too seriously," Ms. Frankfort said.
So the couple trusted Ms. Golub when she advised demolishing a humdrum mantelpiece and reimagined the hearth by taking inspiration from the 1960s sculpted fireplaces of the French artist Valentine Schlegel. "It was like, 'How do I interpret her work without copying?"' Ms. Golub said. The finished white lime plaster surface is by Art in Construction.
The fireplace withstands family life, though children were not its sole intended audience. "They run and jump around, but we also entertain adults," Mr. Spector said.
Smoke Free
"We don't have a country house, so this is where we need to be cozy," said Carol Holt, a retired real estate agent.
She had admired the contemporary lines of a Manhattan neighbor's bio-ethanol hearth, and asked its architect, Rawlins Design, for something similar in her high-rise living room with no chimney.
The alcohol fuel, which is colorless and fermented from plants, does not produce soot or carbon monoxide that would need venting outdoors, said Christopher Rawlins, the firm's principal. He alerted building management, but did not need special approval from the New York City Department of Buildings.
The wide new 78-inch custom burner from the Polish manufacturer Planika has a white powder-coated finish to match the custom polished Calacatta Michelangelo marble firebox. The fire serves as the focal point for Ms. Holt's living room, with a TV above. "There's an altar to the television in every New York apartment, so we covered it up," she said.
Surprisingly heavy robotic doors, plastered by Kamp Studios, slide open automatically with a smartphone app. Ms. Holt decided not to link the fire itself to the app. "The grandkids love to grab our phones," she said. "We hide the fireplace remote in a high cabinet so they can't just start pushing buttons."
The Cub Scout
When Zack Moy was searching for an apartment to buy, he spotted an East Village one-bedroom -- photos showed a large, unlit wood-burning fireplace. "Does that work?" he asked a real estate agent, hopefully.
It did, and Mr. Moy, who founded Afterword.com, a supplier of funeral planning software, was sold on the "small but mighty" apartment.
Mr. Moy, 35, didn't actually know how to use a fireplace. Knowledge of making fire came from his Cub Scout days so he watched several YouTube tutorials to learn to build one "without burning the building down." Once a month, he bought wood from a bodega to mark special occasions or to roast s'mores. Then he learned about more convenient pressed-sawdust logs.
He ordered three boxes of Duraflame logs and estimates that the logs cost a dollar an hour to burn. "I'll come back from visiting a funeral home in Chicago, light a fire, sink into the couch, and I'm home," he said.
How Many Fireplaces Are Enough?
Underneath the deteriorating 1970s décor of a West Village townhouse were multiple grand 19th Century rooms, said Alan Barlis, an architect. "America has a bulldozer culture," he said, and he has a passion for sustainability.
The house, once owned by Robert De Niro, had 14 fireplaces, though only six actually worked by they time Mr. Barlis got his hands on it a decade ago on behalf of a client.
The facade of the building has official landmark status, but the interiors can be changed as an owner sees fit. Mr. Barlis embarked on detailed restoration, with an eye toward ecology. They went from 14 fireplaces to two -- one is in the basement kitchen and the other, with an original Brocatello marble mantelpiece in the rear parlor, is the star of the show.
Its mantelpiece too fragile to move, the fireplace was remade gingerly. A four-inch supply pipe got nested within the old chimney shaft, to duct fresh outdoor air down from the roof (supplying the oxygen needed for combustion, outdoor air that never mixes with the room air). Can heavy, dirty firewood -- typically chopped miles away -- be considered more sustainable than, say, a gas log?
"Well, wood is not a fossil fuel," said Jessie Goldvarg, an associate at Barlis Wedlick.
It's So Ralph
Fireplaces and Ralph Lauren go together like corduroy and cashmere. Two of the Ralph Lauren boutiques on the Upper East Side have traditional fireplaces that burn gas.
But upstairs from Ralph's Coffee on Madison Avenue, one of the seasonal furniture salons features a bold, unapologetically faux fire nothing short of master stagecraft.
Dramatically magnified footage of flames, like a seasonal yule log video on the Jumbotron, licks across frameless LED screens. Indeed, the 22-second loop is broadcast from a mini PC running digital-signage software. To complete the illusion, the store's visual team sheathed a boxy faux hood using painted wallboard, adding an oversized framed abstract by the Chicago-based artist Michael McGuire.
In the Bath
"I love sculpting things," said Bill Sofield, the jet-set architectural designer.
He sculpted a plaster bas-relief for the chimney breast of an indulgent primary bathroom of a home in the West Village for two New York friends Mr. Sofield has known since their days at Princeton. The floor is travertine, the P.E. Guerin taps use rock crystal, and the free-standing Waterworks tub is burnished cast-iron.
The Island Diversified workshop in Calverton, N.Y., enlarged Mr. Sofield's handmade scale model for the enchanted forest inset, then walked it up the stairs in a single piece. Rather than fake logs, however, the gas fire here dances across a collection of futuristic ceramic spheres and cones.

Outsider vs. Insider: Does It Matter?: [Review]

Full text: "Looking Back," the nonprofit gallery's group show, brings together self-taught and highly trained artists. It isn't obvious who's who.
It's pleasantly disorienting to enter the White Columns Annual in New York in 2024 and see so much work that could have been, and was, made any time in the last half century. There's not a screen, QR code or 3-D print in sight. But since its inauguration in 2006, the nonprofit gallery's "Looking Back" series has made an old-school proposition: to curate a group show around one person's (or collective's) taste, shorn of commercial or institutional impulses to either move product or capture a zeitgeist.
The Annual has one constraint. The curator must have seen the included work in New York City in the previous year. In this grass-roots way, the show offers a (very subjective, and therefore narrow) group portrait of an increasingly unwieldy scene. Those who see a lot of art might recognize a few pieces. But not everything.
The curator tapped for the 14th edition is Randy Kennedy, the director of special projects for the international art gallery Hauser & Wirth, and a former staff reporter at The New York Times who occasionally contributes to the obituaries desk. The pieces he picked here, by 35 artists, tend toward so-called outsider art, particularly abstract painting and assemblage that appears more felt than thought.
There are outsider staples, like two seductively muted paintings on board from the 1980s by the prolific Alabaman folk artist Mose Tolliver; and contemporary discoveries, particularly the self-taught Moroccan-American sculptor Manal Kara, whose "Unidentified Mathematical Objects (lottery picker 2)," a random-number generator made from a fur-lined fruit crate, screwdriver handles and multisided dice, debuted at Deli Gallery in TriBeCa in 2023. Its deft scrappy aesthetic, applied to a modern symptom like the Powerball, winks at the stereotype of the outsider artist as visionary naïf.
Sharing space with diamonds-in-the-rough are accomplished figures known for rough-hewed work, such as an undated wall-mounted junk assemblage by Noah Purifoy and one of Beverly Buchanan's chunky scrap wood maquettes of her shacklike studio.
Kennedy's Annual muddies the already murky boundary between inside and outside. Whatever superficial cues might distinguish one from the other don't hold here. They shouldn't elsewhere, either -- curators and critics have worked against this hierarchy for decades. These approachable works are an encouraging sign of a leveling playing field for artists, who may or may not have lived in a big city, gone to art school, had a gallery, or shared their art with a soul.
Yet the ongoing interest in deskilled, intuitive artmaking also speaks to the present sense of stagnation, even conservatism, as anxious artists and dealers retread safe ground, no matter how "meta" they're being. When the world feels chaotic, culture takes an inward turn.
Kennedy made several selections from last year's Outsider Art Fair, including the jaunty, arrowlike rows of "White and Yellow Carrots," by the self-taught artist Evelyn Reyes, who worked in a studio for adults with disabilities until 2017. A composition by an unknown painter named Richard E. Treubel titled "Egg in Reverse," from around 1965 -- squidges of golden impasto in a sea of yolk-yellow, cradling a white blob -- cuts its cosmic symbolism with a gonzo sense of humor.
One wall features several swirling mandalas pristinely plotted with a rainbow of ballpoint pens. They could be dazzling examples of process-based conceptual drawings from the 1970s -- but in fact were the retirement pastime of Harold Granucci, an accountant and furniture salesman, circa 1992. If the outsider can be meticulous, the insider can let loose: a gloopy white sculpture based on a ready Kleenex is the latest from Jennifer Bolande, a postmodern artist known for crisp and heady photographs and installations.
Some artists revel in the art world's margins. "Smoker Choice," a strip of wooden siding painted with bands of red, white and tan, resembles a glowing cigarette. It's a playful 2023 piece by Tyree Guyton, the artist behind the Heidelberg Project in Detroit, a junkyard fantasia of weathered toys, scrap metal and household discards assembled in a string of once-vacant lots. Guyton started Heidelberg in 1986, and gradually gained acceptance -- first from his neighbors, then from the art world. This work, which appeared at Martos Gallery in New York last year, would be funny anywhere, but in the context of a proper gallery in Manhattan shows Guyton gleefully mixing highbrow and lowbrow aesthetics, hard-edge abstraction from the Neo-Geo movement, with the beret-and-palette caricature of the chain-smoking artist, all through his signature urban materials.
Another demi-outsider, Sarah Rapson, attended the Whitney Independent Study Program in 1989, then worked for the blue-chip artist Richard Prince. About 20 years ago -- like Purifoy relocating to Joshua Tree, Calif.; or Buchanan to Macon, Ga. -- she moved to coastal England and abandoned the mainstream. But she kept tabs on it. Her collages made from what look like old gallery advertisements, wrapped around the ends of long sticks, are among the first works in the show, setting the scene for artists with a foot in both worlds.
A few pieces feel like the curator's inside jokes. A sequined tapestry by Larry Krone, Kennedy's brother-in-law, shares a wall with a pulsing, flame-colored abstraction drawn by Rhoda Kellogg, an early-childhood educator, from Kennedy's own collection. And one incongruous assemblage, a wooden cane fitted with a rifle scope hung above a postcard of the city hall in Cisco, Texas, is by the artist Will Boone -- which makes sense if you know that Kennedy and Boone, who are both from Texas, are writing a play about a dramatic 1927 bank robbery in that same town. It was an outside job.

WASHINGTON — The United Auto Workers union endorsed President Joe Biden on Wednesday, delivering an influential boost as he faces a battle against former President Donald Trump to win the support of labor groups.
Biden, who calls himself the “most pro-union president in history,” delighted striking UAW workers but angered auto industry executives when he appeared on a picket line with workers in the fall. On Wednesday, he appeared in front of a national conference of autoworkers to tell them that he had been proud to do it.
“Let me tell you something I learned a long time ago,” Biden said. “If I’m going to be in a fight, I want to be in the fight with you, the UAW.”
In earlier remarks, UAW President Shawn Fain told the crowd that Biden had the track record to help working-class people organize for higher wages, better retirement benefits and health care.
“This election is about who will stand up with us and who will stand in our way,” Fain said after comparing Biden’s past pro-union speeches with Trump’s lack of support and appearances at nonunion facilities. He called Trump a “scab” — shorthand for someone who undercuts the power of a union, such as by replacing a striking worker.
“If our endorsement must be earned, Joe Biden has earned it,” Fain said.
The value of the endorsement, which the UAW put off last year over concerns about Biden’s commitment to promoting union jobs in electric vehicle manufacturing, may be less about persuading members to back Biden than in motivating them to vote. The union has estimated that only about 30% of its members supported Trump in 2016. But without the union’s formal backing and investments in turnout, Biden could suffer a drop-off in members who show up to vote in critical swing states like Michigan.
“Elections aren’t about just picking your best friend for the job or the candidate who makes you feel good,” Fain said. “Elections are about power.”
With Trump all but locking up the nomination after his performance in New Hampshire’s primary Tuesday, officials with the Biden campaign said that the race between the two candidates had all but begun.
While onstage, Biden focused on highlighting economic bright spots, including a strong job market, lower gas prices and increased consumer optimism. He also compared his track record with his predecessor’s, saying that Trump is “the only president other than Herbert Hoover who lost jobs when he was president.”
Fain, a vocal critic of Trump, did not mince words. He recalled the 2008 financial crisis, highlighting Trump’s anti-union rhetoric then and as a presidential candidate in 2015. Then he recalled Biden’s comments, as vice president, that the “nation bet on American autoworkers and won.”
At this, attendees yelled out obscenities about Trump. “Love the energy,” Fain replied.
After the event, Fain told reporters that the UAW’s board had unanimously approved the endorsement. He said that Biden’s economic message was breaking through to rank-and-file members, but added that the union would “have to do better” to combat what he said was misinformation about Biden’s achievements.
Still, Fain had made the president work for the endorsement.
Biden appeared at several UAW events to prove his bona fides with the group’s leadership and rank and file. In September, Biden grabbed a bullhorn and joined striking autoworkers in Michigan, becoming the first sitting president to join a picket line in an extraordinary show of support for workers demanding better wages. When the contract was won, Biden wore a red T-shirt and appeared before celebrating workers in Illinois.
Union officials often say that Biden has been more vocal than any president in decades in backing organized labor. He appeared in a video as Amazon workers in Alabama sought to unionize, warning that “there should be no intimidation, no coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda.” He also called out Kellogg for its plans to permanently replace striking workers. (The strike was resolved before the company took that step.)
The UAW was early to support Biden’s green energy policies but became frustrated by the lack of support for unionized auto industry jobs in the Inflation Reduction Act, the major climate bill that the president signed in 2022.
Fain had also expressed frustration that the Biden administration had given Ford Motor a $9 billion government loan to build three electric vehicle battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky without any commitment by the company to create high-wage union jobs there.
It takes fewer workers to assemble an electric vehicle than it does to build one with an internal combustion engine. To make up for those lost assembly jobs, the UAW wants to organize the plants that make batteries and other electric vehicle parts that are being built to take advantage of the tax incentives included in Biden’s climate legislation. It is also pushing to extend union organizing to electric vehicle makers that have long resisted it.
Biden’s decision to appear on the picket line in Michigan raised the ire of auto industry executives, according to officials in his administration, who said that the president was nonetheless determined to make clear where he stood in the labor conflict.
Seeing an opening with the UAW’s rank and file, if not its leadership, Trump then made a play for the endorsement, campaigning against Biden’s “ridiculous Green New Deal crusade.” A day after Biden joined the UAW picket line, Trump rallied at a nonunion auto parts factory in Michigan, vying for the support of blue-collar workers.
Fain had long made it clear that his leadership would never endorse the former president, but endorsing Biden was still politically complicated. In addition to the substantial portion of his membership that is likely to favor Trump, the UAW also includes a vocal liberal bloc that is skeptical of Biden. Many of the liberal members are graduate students and university researchers who have been critical of the president over his support for Israel during its war in the Gaza Strip. The union itself has called for a cease-fire.
During the event, several protesters waving Palestinian flags were dragged out by security officials as the president kept speaking, the second time in as many days that a Biden campaign event has been interrupted by people protesting Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. Workers chanted “UAW” to drown out their cries.

Full text: The group, which endorsed President Biden in the 2020 election, made the self-described most "pro-union president in history" work for its official approval.
The United Automobile Workers union endorsed President Biden on Wednesday, delivering an influential boost as he faces a battle against former President Donald J. Trump to win the support of labor groups.
Mr. Biden, who calls himself the "most pro-union president in history," delighted striking U.A.W. workers but angered auto industry executives when he appeared on a picket line with workers last fall.

Food Marketers Seek A Cravings Workaround: [Correction]

Full text: One day about 60 years ago, the comedian Bert Lahr put on a devil suit, held up a potato chip and uttered a phrase that would become a food-marketing milestone: "Betcha can't eat just one."
Positioning food as deliciously addictive, as Lay's did in its sly TV commercial, became advertising gold. In the decades that followed, Oreos and freezer waffles ("L'eggo my Eggo!") were portrayed as so irresistible that people fought over them. A popular stoner movie, "Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle," chronicled two friends' obsessions with fast-food sliders.
Craveability became such a selling point that Kellogg's went all in and named a chocolate-filled cereal Krave. High-end chefs weren't immune. Christina Tosi, known for the hyper-sweet desserts at her Milk Bar shops, named one of them Crack Pie.
But we're now in the Ozempic era. A class of new drugs that eliminate food cravings, as well as a fresh body of scientific studies, have focused attention on the connection between addiction and food. Ultra-processed foods, made with cheap industrial ingredients and potentially as addictive as tobacco or gambling, are emerging as a national concern.
What's a food marketer to do? Some who work in or study the nation's $ 1 trillion food industry describe the moment as not much more than a speed bump. Food companies are nimble at surfing the cultural waves and finding new ways to keep customers reaching for another helping.
Others say it's a watershed moment in how Americans eat, and will change how companies sell food.
"It's an existential threat to the food industry and certainly an existential threat to the processed food industry," said Marion Nestle, an emeritus professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University who has written extensively on food policy and science. "You've got all these things coming together in a way they've never come together before."
Back in the 1960s, when Lay's dared the nation to resist, "it didn't even occur to anybody that wanting more chips could be bad," said Steve Siegelman, a marketing creative director who has worked with the beef industry, Kikkoman and Häagen-Dazs.
Casting food as irresistible or craveable has already begun to fall out of favor, he said, but it remains perfectly acceptable as a business-to-business tactic. Hidden Valley Ranch, for example, uses the slogan "Give them the cup they crave" in its ads in restaurant trade publications.
Sheer overuse has started to sap the marketing power of craveability, said Mike Kostyo, a vice president of the food industry consulting company Menu Matters, whose clients include brands like Dunkin' and Del Monte Foods. But as an underlying concept, he said, it's not going away.
"It's so central to how we market so many foods," he said. "All that imagery of oozing cheese and the sound of the crunch."
Mr. Kostyo said several clients have asked him how worried they should be about the runaway popularity of drugs like semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (in Mounjaro), which people credit with silencing what they describe as "food noise," or constant thoughts about eating. He tells them it's too early to say.
If selling the addictive nature of a snack stops working, he said, the industry will find something else that will.
Food companies ran into a similar challenge in the early 1990s, when fat was cast as the dietary demon. They responded with products like SnackWell's, a line of fat- and cholesterol-free cookies that was so popular it was often in short supply. Baked Lay's, with fewer calories and less fat than the original, mounted a $ 50 million ad campaign showing supermodels fishing or playing poker. The slogan: "You can eat like one of the boys, but still look like one of the girls." The commercials ended, of course, with Lay's time-tested tagline.
Michael Moss, a former New York Times reporter who has written two books explaining how some food companies use science, marketing and political influence to get consumers hooked on their products, doesn't expect drugs like Ozempic to make any difference.
"Getting us to lose control is part of their business plan," he said of the processed food industry. "I was chatting with an industry lobbyist who said Vitamin O scares us about as much as Michelle Obama's 'Let's Move' campaign" to get children to eat better and exercise more.
In its recent annual report on the food and beverage industry, the market research company Mintel posited that consumer demand for minimally processed food will grow, and suggested that manufacturers focus on the benefits of food processing, like extending freshness or promoting food safety.
The report also offered a strategy for selling products with no redeeming nutritional value: "Brands that produce highly, overly or ultra-processed food and drink products will need to remind consumers of the joy and comfort they get from these products."
But instead of telling consumers what a product can do for them, many marketers pore through social media to find out what they want, said Caitlin Reynolds, an executive vice president at the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi.
"It's like an unprompted focus group that runs 24/7," she said.
In 2021, Ms. Reynolds led a team that in created an award-winning ad campaign for Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers inspired by the shutdown phase of the pandemic, when people posted that they ate the snacks by the handful while working from home. The multiplatform campaign featured Boban Marjanovic, the N.B.A. player with the largest hands, holding as many of the crackers as he could.
Although Goldfish are a mainstay in homes with young children, the snack has become a top seller with teenagers who grew up eating them. "Gen Z loves nostalgia," Ms. Reynolds said.
And although brand integrity matters to members of Generation Z, according to Mr. Kostyo of Menu Matters, they don't have the same health focus as the Millennial generation, with its grain bowls and nut milks.
"With Gen Z we see a movement away from that," he said. "They love candy and Taco Bell and TikTok-y foods."
Strategies for selling food to Generation Z and it successor, Alpha, the oldest members of which are 14, rely less on one message repeated in traditional advertising and more on deft use of social media. They also include fun, outrageous collaborations between brands, like the Nacho Cheese Dorito-flavored liquor that the snack giant recently created with Empirical, a company started by alumni of the elite Copenhagen restaurant Noma.
Still, some companies are sticking with the old get-'em-hooked approach. In 2022, Taco Bell pioneered a subscription offer, in which $ 10 bought a taco a day for a month. In November, it added a subscription for nacho fries.
And last week -- because sometimes sheer irresistibility still works -- the company introduced a Cravings Value Menu.

Back in the 1960s, when Lay’s dared the nation to resist, “it didn’t even occur to anybody that wanting more chips could be bad,” said Steve Siegelman, an executive creative director at the marketing firm Ketchum who has worked with the beef industry, Kikkoman and Häagen-Dazs.
Casting food as irresistible or craveable has already begun to fall out of favor, he said, but it remains perfectly acceptable as a business-to-business tactic. Hidden Valley Ranch, for example, uses the slogan “Give them the cup they crave” in its ads in restaurant trade publications.
Sheer overuse has started to sap the marketing power of craveability, said Mike Kostyo, a vice president of the food industry consulting company Menu Matters, whose clients include brands like Dunkin’ and Del Monte Foods. But as an underlying concept, he said, it’s not going away.
“It’s so central to how we market so many foods,” he said. “All that imagery of oozing cheese and the sound of the crunch.”
Kostyo said several clients have asked him how worried they should be about the runaway popularity of drugs like semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (in Mounjaro), which people credit with silencing what they describe as “food noise,” or constant thoughts about eating. He tells them it’s too early to say.
If selling the addictive nature of a snack stops working, he said, the industry will find something else that will.
Food companies ran into a similar challenge in the early 1990s, when fat was cast as the dietary demon. They responded with products like SnackWell’s, a line of fat- and cholesterol-free cookies that was so popular it was often in short supply. Baked Lay’s, with fewer calories and less fat than the original, mounted a $50 million ad campaign showing supermodels fishing or playing poker. The slogan: “You can eat like one of the boys, but still look like one of the girls.” The commercials ended, of course, with Lay’s time-tested tagline.
Michael Moss, a former New York Times reporter who has written two books explaining how some food companies use science, marketing and political influence to get consumers hooked on their products, doesn’t expect drugs like Ozempic to make any difference.
“Getting us to lose control is part of their business plan,” he said of the processed food industry. “I was chatting with an industry lobbyist who said Vitamin O scares us about as much as Michelle Obama’s ‘Let’s Move’ campaign” to get children to eat better and exercise more.
In its recent annual report on the food and beverage industry, market research company Mintel posited that consumer demand for minimally processed food will grow, and suggested that manufacturers focus on the benefits of food processing, like extending freshness or promoting food safety.
The report also offered a strategy for selling products with no redeeming nutritional value: “Brands that produce highly, overly or ultra-processed food and drink products will need to remind consumers of the joy and comfort they get from these products.”
But instead of telling consumers what a product can do for them, many marketers pore through social media to find out what they want, said Caitlin Reynolds, an executive vice president at the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi.
“It’s like an unprompted focus group that runs 24/7,” she said.
In 2021, Reynolds led a team that created an award-winning ad campaign for Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers inspired by the shutdown phase of the pandemic, when people posted that they ate the snacks by the handful while working from home. The multiplatform campaign featured Boban Marjanovic, the NBA player with the largest hands, holding as many of the crackers as he could.
Although Goldfish are a mainstay in homes with young children, the snack has become a top seller with teenagers who grew up eating them. “Gen Z loves nostalgia,” Reynolds said.
And although brand integrity matters to members of Generation Z, according to Kostyo of Menu Matters, they don’t have the same health focus as the millennial generation, with its grain bowls and nut milks.
“With Gen Z we see a movement away from that,” he said. “They love candy and Taco Bell and TikTok-y foods.”
Strategies for selling food to Gen Z and it successor, Alpha, the oldest members of which are 14, rely less on one message repeated in traditional advertising and more on deft use of social media. They also include fun, outrageous collaborations between brands, like the Nacho Cheese Dorito-flavored liquor that the snack giant recently created with Empirical, a company started by alumni of the elite Copenhagen restaurant Noma.
Still, some companies are sticking with the old get-’em-hooked approach. In 2022, Taco Bell pioneered a subscription offer, in which $10 bought a taco a day for a month. In November, it added a subscription for nacho fries.
And last week — because sometimes sheer irresistibility still works — the company introduced a Cravings Value Menu.

2nd Hong Kong Activist Flees Pressure by Police: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The activist, Tony Chung, was imprisoned after advocating for the territory's independence. Even after his release, he said, his situation remained oppressive.
A political activist in Hong Kong previously imprisoned under its sweeping national security law said he had fled to Britain and would apply for asylum there, becoming the second high-profile dissident this month to announce going into exile from the territory.
The activist, Tony Chung, revealed on Thursday that he had arrived in Britain, and, in several social media posts, said that he had decided to leave Hong Kong after enduring oppressive restrictions, pressure to act as informant and severe stress after his release from prison in June.
Mr. Chung, 22, was sentenced to three years and seven months in prison in 2021 after becoming an outspoken proponent of independence for Hong Kong -- an idea that is anathema to Communist Party leaders in China, which rules the territory.
He was released early, but police officers continued to monitor him closely, he wrote in his account on Instagram. He won their approval to take a brief vacation in Okinawa, Japan, and while there bought a ticket to Britain, he wrote.
"This also means that for the foreseeable future, it will be impossible for me to return to my home, Hong Kong," Mr. Chung wrote. "Although I had previously anticipated that this day would come, my heart still sank at the moment I made up my mind. Ever since I joined social movements from the age of 14, I have always believed that Hong Kong is the only home for the nation of Hong Kong, and we should never be the ones who must leave it."
Mr. Chung's departure from Hong Kong was earlier reported by The Washington Post.
Mr. Chung joins a growing number of Hong Kong activists and pro-democracy organizers who have left since the territory imposed a national security law in June 2020 in response to huge pro-democracy protests there for much of 2019, which sometimes flared into violent clashes between demonstrators and police officers.
The law established the judicial and police machinery to drastically constrict political freedoms in Hong Kong, a British colony until 1997 that after its handover to China retained its own system of laws and limited democratic competition for a share of seats in the city's legislature.
In early December, Agnes Chow, a former pro-democracy student activist in Hong Kong who had served time on some charges connected to her political activities and was still under investigation for others, announced that she had gone to Canada and was defying instructions to report to the Hong Kong police, a condition of her bail.
She said that after her release, the police had taken her on an indoctrination tour in mainland China, seeking to convince her that Communist Party rule was all for the better.
"Perhaps I will never go back again in my lifetime," she wrote of Hong Kong.
Mr. Chung described similar efforts by the Hong Kong officers who monitored him.
Mr. Chung became the third person sentenced under the security law after prosecutors accused him of secession by promoting independence for Hong Kong, on social media and through a now-disbanded group, Studentlocalism. He was also sentenced on a money laundering charge related to donations that he received in support of the group.
After his release from prison, he tried to regain his economic footing with a temporary job, but police officers ordered him not to take it, without explaining why. Officers offered to pay Mr. Chung to act as an informant, and at meetings pressed him for details about places he had gone and people he had met, including his elementary school classmates, he wrote.
The expansion of informal oversight over ex-prisoners showed how Hong Kong's security police have at least partly replicated the methods of the mainland Chinese authorities, said Thomas Kellogg, the executive director of the Georgetown Center for Asian Law, who has studied how Hong Kong's national security legislation has been enforced.
"What we're seeing with Agnes, Tony and others is the importation into Hong Kong of some of these elements of the police state," Mr. Kellogg said in a telephone interview.
In an emailed response to questions about Mr. Chung, the public relations section of the Hong Kong Police Force seemed to be critical of him, but it stopped short of directly identifying him.
"Recently some individuals who have committed crimes endangering national security openly violated supervision orders or bail conditions and fled Hong Kong," the police force said in the email.
"Not only have they failed to reflect on the harms they have caused to Hong Kong," the police force response said, "but they have also shamefully begged for assistance from foreign anti-China forces under the guise of being victims."
The Hong Kong Democracy Council has estimated that over 1,700 people in the territory have been imprisoned for protest activities, organized political opposition and related charges, including property damage, under the national security crackdown. How many have been released, and how many have left the territory, is less clear, experts say.
"You're seeing a little boomlet of people who have decided to leave," Mr. Kellogg said. "There's a lot of different permutations, but the end result is the same in quite a lot of these cases: People are running for the exits, if they can."
Abroad, Hong Kong activists may still face intimidation. In July, the territory's government announced bounties of 1 million Hong Kong dollars, or around $ 128,000, for information leading to the apprehension and prosecution of eight activists who had fled abroad.
Such tactics mean that some activists who leave Hong Kong may choose to live under the radar, rather than exposing their families back home to police questioning and pressure, said Patrick Poon, a visiting researcher at the University of Tokyo who monitors human rights in Hong Kong.
"But some others think, 'Well, I don't have any contact with my family in Hong Kong any longer,"' Mr. Poon said. "Especially some of the younger ones defy such threats."
Mr. Chung said that he planned to study in Britain, and suggested that he might remain politically active. "I believe that as long as the Hong Kong people never give up, the seeds of freedom and democracy will sprout alive again," he wrote.

Testing the Limits Of Price Increases: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Alexander MacKay coleads the Pricing Lab at Harvard Business School, a research center devoted to studying how companies set prices. Since the pandemic, he has watched how businesses have become more willing to experiment with what they charge their customers.
Big companies that had previously pushed through one standard price increase per year are now raising prices more frequently. Retailers increasingly use digital price displays, which they can change with the touch of a button. Across the economy, executives trying to maximize profits are effectively running tests to see what prices consumers will bear before they stop buying.
Huge disruptions to supply chains pushed up corporate costs during the pandemic and forced many companies to think more creatively about their pricing strategies, Mr. MacKay said. That supercharged a trend toward more rigorous pricing, and showed many companies that they could more boldly play with prices without chasing shoppers away. The experimentation continues even as costs ease.
"We may have prices changing more quickly than they have before," he said. That could mean up or down, though companies are generally more eager to raise prices than cut them.
Firms are trying to figure out how to protect the profits they have built since the pandemic. For big companies in the S&P 500 index, the average profit margin -- the percentage of profit relative to revenue -- soared in late 2020 and into 2021, as government stimulus and the Federal Reserve's emergency interventions stoked consumer demand. At the same time, companies raised their prices so much that they more than covered higher costs for energy, transportation, labor and other inputs, which have recently started to come down.
Corporations as varied as Apple and Williams-Sonoma recently reported their highest-ever margins for the third quarter, while Delta Air Lines said its international routes generated record profitability over the summer.
Margins eased somewhat last year, but have recently recovered to levels that would have set records before the pandemic. Average margins in nearly every sector in the S&P 500 are running near or above 10-year highs, according to Goldman Sachs.
"Companies are maintaining or even expanding margins because they are not passing these cost cuts onto consumers," said Albert Edwards, a strategist at Société Générale, who called recent moves in margins "obscene."
Now, companies are trying to figure out how to set prices to protect profits at what could prove to be a turning point. High interest rates and waning savings are making some -- though by no means all -- shoppers more price sensitive.
Many companies may be able to protect profits just by holding prices steady as their own costs come down. But some are still thinking about whether they can push prices up further as demand cools and overall inflation abates.
"I don't think companies have the monopoly power to just willy-nilly raise prices," said Ed Yardeni, president of the research firm Yardeni Research.
There's a focus on margins over market share.
Many corporations are talking on earnings calls about how they are prioritizing profit margins -- even when that translates into less growth.
Take Sysco, the food wholesaler. Its local market business has turned slower recently, Kevin Hourican, the company's chief executive, said on an October earnings call.
But "Sysco is not reacting by leading with price to win share," he said, referring to the tactic of cutting prices to gain more customers, which is commonly used during downturns. "Instead, we are focused on profitable growth."
Lennox, a heating and air-conditioning company, is working to perfect its pricing strategy based on years of data, Alok Maskara, the firm's chief executive, said at an investor event this summer.
People in the industry are "margin-dollar focused versus revenue-dollar focused," he said, implying that fewer, more-profitable sales are preferred to many, less-profitable ones.
That's a shift from post-2009 practice.
The focus on higher margins -- even if it means selling less -- is in some cases a shift away from the conventional wisdom in the years during and after the 2009 recession. Back then, some executives felt compelled to compete on price for cost-sensitive shoppers. For hotels, that meant a focus on filling every room.
"If you remember back in the Great Recession, there was this view of let's just drop rates until we get people to heads in beds," Leeny Oberg, Marriott's chief financial officer, said in a September meeting with investors. She added that "it wasn't necessarily the right strategy all the time."
Now "the industry has clearly learned some lessons," she said. Over the past few years, the company has aimed for more of a balance between maximizing revenue and profit, she noted.
Retailers, which have been caught out by shifting consumer tastes in recent years, are talking more lately about "inventory discipline," or keeping less product in stock, so that they can avoid selling things at clearance prices. The logic is that it's better to sacrifice a few sales by running out of products than being forced to slash prices in a way that hits the bottom line.
The clothing chain American Eagle Outfitters has been expanding its margins by "maintaining tight inventory and promotional discipline," Jay Schottenstein, the company's chief executive, said on a November earnings call.
Companies learned they can charge more than they thought.
While consumers are pulling back from some purchases as prices rise, that is not universally true -- hence the value of experimentation. Robert J. Gamgort, the chief executive of Keurig Dr Pepper, said recently that consumers have shown little reaction to higher costs for carbonated drinks.
That suggests "it was too good of a value at the start at this," he said at an investor conference in September, referring to the recent inflationary period. "It was underpriced."
The company, which raised prices at its U.S. beverage unit by 7 percent last quarter, highlighted "strong gross margin expansion" at the top of its latest earnings report.
Some executives also find that they can charge more by branding something as a luxury product or experience.
"Despite the current economic environment, we continue to see consumers trade up to premium amenities," Melissa Thomas, chief financial officer at the movie theater chain Cinemark, said on a November earnings call.
But price sensitivity may return.
Kellogg, the cereal company, had been passing through substantial price increases without losing customers -- a situation economists call low price elasticity. It's like if you snap a rubber band (raise prices) but it doesn't react (shoppers keep buying).
But recently, consumers are beginning to pull back in response to sticker shock.
"Price elasticity has hit the market pretty meaningfully," Gary Pilnick, Kellogg's chief executive, said on a call with analysts last month. "You might recall that there's been about 35 percent of price increases over the last couple of years for us, and the elasticities were fairly benign for quite some time."
Price sensitivity is also showing up at brands that cater to lower-income consumers, like Walmart and McDonald's, which have seen business expand as wealthier people look for deals.
"We continue to gain share with both the middle- and higher-income consumers," Ian Borden, chief financial officer of McDonald's, said on an October earnings call, although he noted that the company was seeing its lower-income customers struggle.
The ability to raise prices -- or keep them high -- may not last.
Even as companies are getting creative to protect their margins, the economy has also held up better than many expected. Overall growth has remained rapid, consumer spending has expanded, and a long-warned-about recession has remained at bay.
The question is whether companies will be able to protect profits in an environment where that momentum slows.
"Customers are rebelling," said Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management. "We have reached that point of resistance."

Full text: Industry leaders at the conference were asked about what's next for artificial intelligence, the economy, health care and more.
This article is part of our special section on the DealBook Summit that included business and policy leaders from around the world.
For last week's DealBook Summit in New York City, The New York Times invited leaders in an array of disciplines to gather together to talk about some of the most pressing challenges they see in their areas of expertise. The Times asked them similar questions in advance. Their answers have been edited and condensed.
Artificial Intelligence
On balance, do you believe humanity would be better off with or without A.I.? How do you navigate any doubt?
Rohit Prasad: Senior vice president and head scientist, artificial general intelligence, Amazon
Humanity always benefits from technological leaps forward and A.I. will be no different. Every day, different teams across Amazon are thinking about how to innovate with A.I. responsibly on behalf of our customers. Responsible deployment of rapidly improving A.I. for human interest and safety is paramount to get this right.
Michael Abramowitz: President, Freedom House
Advances in A.I. are supercharging censorship, surveillance and disinformation -- but that doesn't have to be the case. When designed and deployed safely and fairly, A.I. can help streamline democratic processes and support democracy's defenders. We must ensure A.I. is a tool for democracy, not a weapon against it.
Annie Dorsen: Playwright
Tech companies present A.I. as a boon to innovation, but the reality is quite the opposite. Because A.I. works with statistical prediction, its outputs inevitably revert to mediocrity. When we outsource our thinking and imaginations to A.I., we are left with an impoverished culture: We lose out on the idiosyncratic, the unpredictable, the never-before-seen.
If you could turn the clock back (or forward) on A.I., would you? If so, where would you go?
Brando Benifei: Member, European Parliament
I would want to go forward in time to see if we will manage to develop a significant amount of international law and agreements around A.I.: As the technology advances, the risk of dangerous and even uncontrollable weaponization exists, and this cannot be tackled without global cooperation.
Lila Ibrahim: Chief operating officer, Google DeepMind
I'd go forward, to see how A.I. is helping tackle some of society's most fundamental unsolved challenges, like disease and climate change. A.I. is an incredibly powerful tool that's helping humanity unlock our understanding of the way the world works, to achieve breakthroughs that today we can only dream of.
Francesca Rossi: Fellow and A.I. ethics global leader, IBM; president, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence
I would not turn the clock back or forward on A.I. because I believe our current time and reality is the most important to learn from A.I. and continue advancing it responsibly. We should all focus today on ensuring this technology continues to serve everyone safely and equally.
John Roese: President and global chief technology officer, Dell Technologies
I would turn time back a few years to reshape the data management ecosystem to focus on enabling GenAI [generative A.I., which includes chatbots such as ChatGPT] as the North Star. GenAI requires data that is organized and accessible to A.I. systems. That would have created focus and mobilized enterprises to move faster, with clarity today.
The Creator Economy
Do creators, brands or consumers hold the greatest power in the creator economy? Why?
Myisha Moore: Vice president, influencer marketing, Edelman
Creators are an authentic voice directly connected to consumers, which the brands want access to. Consumers determine the trends and the top products. Meanwhile, brands aim to seamlessly integrate into the chat without being overbearing or unnatural. Hence, they need the creator, which puts them at the top of the funnel.
Stephen J. Dubner: Co-author of "Freakonomics"; host, "Freakonomics Radio"
All of the above are winners, but I'd say brands (or, often, platforms) easily have the most power. Consumers get choice and value, but are subject to manipulation. Creators get access to an audience, but are easily co-opted. Brands and platforms write the rules, and if things go sideways, they get to rewrite them.
Eva Serrano: Global brand president, Calvin Klein
In the creator economy, each -- creators, brands and consumers -- yields influential power. Creators drive trends and engagement, brands wield resources and marketing prowess, while consumers steer demand and market shifts. Their interplay and mutual reliance define the ecosystem's strength.
Sima Gandhi: Co-founder and chief executive, Creative Juice
Creators are disrupting the traditional commerce model by bypassing brand and advertiser conduits to get straight to consumers. However, creators still rely on brand spend to earn a living -- advertising dollars make up about 80 percent of the creator economy. That means brands still hold power. As creators shift reliance on brand advertising to direct consumer dollars, the balance of power will also shift.
Dara Treseder: Chief marketing officer, Autodesk
While strong partnerships between creators and brands can guide the creator economy, it's ultimately consumers who hold the greatest power. Their dollars define the outcomes for businesses and for the creators who partner with them. Any brand or creator that ignores or misjudges their audience will ultimately pay the price.
Marc D'Amelio: Co-founder and chief executive, D'Amelio Brands
Ultimately, consumers have the greatest power. Brands and creators have to do the work to best control their own destiny, but ultimately it's the consumer that decides to support the brand, follow the creator or purchase the product.
The U.S. Economy
If you could change one thing about how the economy works, what would it be?
Glenn Hubbard: Professor, economics and finance, Columbia Business School
We need renewed emphasis on opportunity and economic participation for more Americans. With it can come mass flourishing. Without it comes greater social unrest and political dysfunction, threatening prosperity and democracy. Ingredients include support for work preparation and work's wages, thoughtful consideration of technology's effects on work's future, realigning government budget priorities.
Isabella Weber: Associate professor, economics, University of Massachusetts Amherst
We need a new economic stabilization paradigm for our age of overlapping emergencies. More shocks are likely to come. It is neither feasible nor desirable to react to sectoral disruptions by macroeconomic tightening. Instead, we need disaster preparedness for systemically important areas like energy and food to increase economic resilience.
Bethany McLean: Contributing editor, Vanity Fair; co-author of "The Big Fail"
Free markets demand morality. Because markets move faster than laws, laws can only do so much. There are some things, such as the sale of destructive subprime mortgages or the looting of hospitals and nursing homes by private equity, to which society needs to say no.
Joe Nocera: Columnist, The Free Press; Co-author of "The Big Fail"
Nothing has damaged the economy more than the phrase "maximizing shareholder value." It has given us scandals (Valeant) and disasters (Boeing 737 Max); exacerbated income inequality and caused too many C.E.O.s to obsess about their paycheck. We would be far better served if companies cared less about shareholders and more about customers and employees.
Martin Whittaker: Founding chief executive, JUST Capital
We need more people to believe American capitalism is working for them, not against them. With politics bereft of long-term vision and serving only to divide, the private sector must lead. An economy in which companies compete by creating value for all their stakeholders is a powerful uniting force.
Entrepreneurship
What's the hardest thing about working with entrepreneurs? What's the most rewarding?
Rebecca Lynn: Co-founder and general partner, Canvas Ventures
[The hardest thing is] teaching them to say "no" to things. Sometimes founders have to hear "no" more as "not now." They have a huge vision and they want to do it all -- immediately. But the fastest way to kill a company is to do everything all at once. You have to walk before you can run. We are along for the whole ride, and we see the struggles and failures. So, when you see someone start from nothing and then make it big, it's huge. You see all their hard work pay off and their family's life change for the better. There's nothing more rewarding.
Pegah Ebrahimi: Co-founder and managing partner, FPV Ventures
Getting to work with founders who have 100-year plans is incredibly rewarding, and our expertise lies in helping others understand their genius when it's too early to grasp. When they succeed it's like watching your kids grow up -- it's quite the journey.
As an entrepreneur, how do you handle fear of failure?
Dylan Field: Co-founder and chief executive, Figma
I learned early on in my career to not look at things in finite terms like "failure" or "success." It's far more productive, I've found, to approach things like products and companies as works in progress. It lowers the stakes and reframes setbacks as opportunities to learn and get better.
Kwame Onwuachi: Chef and owner, Tatiana
I handle the fear of failure at this stage by using fear as fuel. I actually have a tattoo based on that; literally, "fear is fuel" in an artistic expression! Fear is a natural emotion, and courage stands for pushing forward through something that is fearful, scary or intimidating. At this point in my career, if something isn't scary, it's not worth doing.
Health
What's the biggest challenge in public health, and how would you tackle it?
Tom Oxley: Founder and chief executive, Synchron
Providing equitable access to transformative innovations like brain computer interface technology. These advancements offer hope for millions of patients with severe paralysis who can't communicate. The development of a simple, scalable device remains pivotal. Bridging this gap requires cross-industry collaboration, ethical considerations and clear regulatory frameworks sensitive to patients' needs.
Newsha Ghaeli: Co-founder and president, Biobot Analytics
The biggest challenge is a lack of consistent government support and investment, especially during "peacetime" when there is no immediate crisis. To be better prepared for the next pandemic, governments around the world should treat public health with the same urgency and importance as national security.
Karen Nelson: Chief scientific officer, Thermo Fisher Scientific
There are several big challenges on a global scale including cancer, Alzheimer's and chronic disease. The lack of health equity is a critical issue that compounds these other challenges. To address this, leveraging new, advanced and emerging technologies; fostering awareness; and increasing diverse representation in clinical studies is imperative. Diverse population involvement will unlock valuable insights for the development of more effective treatments and equitable health solutions.
Kris Brown: President, Brady
Gun violence is now the leading cause of death for children in the United States, and eight children a day die from unsecured firearms. By changing America's culture around guns, we can turn the tide on this uniquely American epidemic.
Eriona Hysolli: Head of biological sciences, Colossal Biosciences
The highest mortality rates come from diseases acquired as people age. There is an accumulation of somatic mutations and dysregulation of epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation in aged cells and tissues. Deploying genome editing tools that precisely edit both somatic mutations that modulate DNA methylation in a multiplexible fashion could potentially aid aged cells and tissues to regain vitality. These technologies that are currently being used to target monogenic diseases can in the future be leveraged to prevent or delay age-associated diseases.
Labor
As a worker, what is the single most important thing you expect from an employer? What do you offer in return?
Will Coleman: Co-founder and chief executive, Alto
I am not a "worker" but an "owner." Ownership means I am incentivized to create value and am accountable to results. My team at Alto are owners, too, and should expect that we win together and fail together. No one is ever punished for failing as long as actions have positive intent.
Porter Braswell: Founder and chief executive, 2045 Studio
My formative professional experiences made me realize how important it is for employers to foster a sense of belonging to encourage upward mobility and retention, especially for employees of color.
Erica Smiley: Executive director, Jobs With Justice; co-author, "The Future We Need"
I expect employers to provide safe environments, where worker insights are valued as essential contributions. With mechanisms to genuinely listen to worker voices, this is how management truly works alongside workers -- fostering not only a greater, more productive workplace, but a society that values everyone's dignity, rights and contributions.
News and the Election
As another highly charged election approaches, what is your strategy for remaining objective -- is that even a goal?
Ben Smith: Co-founder and editor in chief, Semafor
To not get too caught up in grand theories about the media's world-historic role, and cover the story accurately and to include multiple perspectives.
Lesley Stahl: Correspondent, CBS News
Having a "strategy for remaining objective" implies I can't rely on a natural inclination to be fair after all these years of practice. But there is a new treachery: that (in our politics) we can no longer rely on a shared reality. It seems that truth is no longer necessarily truth. I will have to be ever conscious (and respectful) of that.
Dana Canedy: Managing editor, Guardian US
It's hard not to have strong views on the topics that will be top of mind for most Americans in the next election, such as abortion, the economy, immigration and foreign policy. But the job of every journalist is timeless: report and present the news accurately, fairly and without fear or favor. That will always be my focus.
Anna Wolfe: Reporter, Mississippi Today
I will write stories that help readers understand the world better, not simply those that elicit strong emotions. My goal is to provide answers to hard questions -- the "why" behind what communities are experiencing. When politics enter my reporting, it will be in the context of accountability and solutions, not personalities.
V Spehar: News creator, Under the Desk News
Objectivity is reserved for the primaries, providing facts and letting the people choose. After that it's respect for humanity and democracy versus authoritarianism. You can't "both sides" that.
William Kristol: Editor at large, The Bulwark
I'm not sure what "remaining objective" really means in these circumstances, and in any case it's not something I think I can do. I'm just going to try to tell the truth as I see it.
Philanthropy
What makes you hopeful about the impact of your work? What discourages you?
Dustin Yellin: Founder and director, Pioneer Works
The transformative potential of accessible, multidisciplinary cultural experiences inspires hope. By breaking down silos and making culture universally accessible, we can foster diverse perspectives while transcending our differences. I am discouraged by the slow rate of progress. How can we forge a common understanding of our world to become a more harmonious, connected and open-minded species within our lifetime?
Jake Wood: Founder and chief executive, Groundswell
I'm hopeful about the pace of technological innovation combined with its rapidly declining price to drive social change across continents and usher in a new era of opportunity -- but discouraged by the prospects of poor government and toxic politics.
La June Montgomery Tabron: President and chief executive, W.K. Kellogg Foundation
Courageous leaders committed to working in solidarity across differences give me hope. The transformation of the systems and structures we need to ensure all children can thrive must be rooted in a DNA-level understanding of solidarity.
Ken Oliver: Executive director, Checkr Foundation
What gives me hope is having business leaders calling me every week wanting to learn about fair-chance hiring -- every conversation a pathway to life-changing possibilities for people. The bubbling narrative against D.E.I. [diversity, equity and inclusion] is discouraging -- that we have to continue to fight for a more inclusive society inside corporate America that reflects the social fabric of America.
Transportation
What mobility challenge keeps you up at night and why?
David Risher: Chief executive, Lyft
Getting people out of their houses and together with one another. Technology makes it almost too easy to stay at home. As the surgeon general has said, "social connection is a fundamental human need, as essential to survival as food, water and shelter." So, what can we do to bring people together more?
Cynthia Williams: Global director of sustainability, homologation and compliance, Ford
Transitioning to zero-emissions solutions, quickly. It will take all sectors participating. We need governments to harmonize environmental requirements; we need one framework to drive a resilient grid faster; we need to grow the infrastructure and educate the consumers on the benefits of zero-emissions vehicles.
U.S.-China Relations
What advice would you give President Biden on the United States' relationship with China?
Jing Tsu: Professor, East Asia studies, Yale; 2023 Pulitzer finalist
China is still evolving and experimenting, and its future is its people. The U.S. should build on long-term expertise beyond the national security lens to gain a wider context for gauging how the Chinese think and the diverse ways in which they feel and relate to the world.
Rana Mitter: Professor and S.T. Lee chair, U.S.-Asia relations, Harvard
The U.S. needs to improve its knowledge base on China. One of the best ways to do this is to get more students to study in China -- learn the language, understand the politics and history, and become an expert on the challenges that are emerging from the world's newest superpower.
Dan Wang: Visiting scholar, Paul Tsai China Center, Yale
The U.S. is in a protracted and multidimensional contest with China. Headlines today are focused on China's overwhelming challenges, but this sentiment has flipped before and can again. What will not change is that China is a manufacturing superpower that still has plenty of growth potential it can tap into. To meet this challenge, President Biden has to strengthen America's ability to build the future, from basic infrastructure to advanced technologies.
Wendy Cutler: Vice president and managing director, Asia Society Policy Institute
We must recognize that we are in the long haul in relationship with China, requiring Washington to be strategic in its approach. We need to "pick our battles" with China. While we have disagreements with China across a wide range of security, economic, ideological and human rights issues, it's important to prioritize those matters that have the greatest impact on the U.S., China, the region and the world, and those where our actions and words can influence outcomes.
Desmond Shum: Investor and author, "Red Roulette: An Insider's Story of Wealth, Power, Corruption and Vengeance in Today's China"
While it's not possible to change the adversary nature of the relationship, the U.S. can look to extract concessions from Xi [Jinping, the Chinese leader]. I would suggest Biden to demand immediate market access to China for exports in swing states and cooperation on U.S. initiatives regarding Ukraine and Israel. In exchange, the U.S. would stand still on new economic sanctions and tech control measures in the coming year. This would be a moratorium on the intensive rivalry of the past years for political expediency.

SZA, Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, indie supergroup boygenius and eclectic bandleader Jon Batiste are among the top nominees for the 66th annual Grammy Awards, leading a class of contenders dominated by young women.
SZA, the R&B singer and songwriter born Solána Rowe, has nine nods — more than any other artist this year — for her album “SOS,” which led the Billboard chart for 10 weeks and spawned an in-demand arena tour. “Kill Bill,” its standout hit, is up for both record and song of the year at the next ceremony, set for Feb. 4 in Los Angeles.
Swift and Rodrigo will face off against SZA in all three top categories, with Swift’s “Midnights” — the studio LP she released last year, in between a slew of rerecordings — and Rodrigo’s “Guts” up for best album, and Swift’s “Anti-Hero” and Rodrigo’s “Vampire” each competing for both record and song.
The awards were announced in an online stream Friday morning by the Recording Academy, the nonprofit organization behind the Grammys.
Miley Cyrus and Batiste are also contenders in each of the most prestigious categories. Cyrus’ mellow, disco-inflected hit “Flowers” is up for record and song of the year, and “Endless Summer Vacation” for album. Batiste, the surprise album of the year victor in 2022 for “We Are” — a rootsy, uplifting collection that had barely made a dent on the charts — earned a string of nominations, including best album for “World Music Radio,” a high-concept amalgam of global pop that was also far from a hit. Its track “Worship” is up for record, and “Butterfly” for song. (Record of the year recognizes a single recording; song of the year is a songwriter’s award.)
Boygenius, the project of three of indie-rock’s leading young women — Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus, all in their late 20s — will compete for record of the year with “Not Strong Enough,” and best album with “The Record.”
Swift, Rodrigo, Cyrus, boygenius, Batiste and Americana singer-songwriter Brandy Clark have six nods apiece, as does Billie Eilish, another Grammy favorite; Victoria Monét, an R&B singer and songwriter, has seven. Bridgers, of boygenius, also nabbed a seventh, through a collaboration with SZA.
The “Barbie” soundtrack, curated by producer Mark Ronson and filled with female artists — Eilish, Dua Lipa and Nicki Minaj among them — has a total of 11 nominations in seven categories. In best song written for visual media, for example, “Barbie” tracks occupy four of the five slots.
The contenders for best new artist include Monét; banjo-playing pop-folkie Noah Kahan; Jelly Roll, who started as a rapper before finding fame in Nashville; British dance producer Fred again..; R&B singer and actor Coco Jones; husband-and-wife soul duo the War and Treaty; and two artists who have gotten a boost from their associations with Swift — singer Gracie Abrams and drill-meets-pop Bronx rapper Ice Spice.
In past years, the Grammys have been criticized for failing to adequately reward female artists, and this year’s woman-heavy nominations will likely be welcomed in the industry as a sign of progress. Still, the key will be who ultimately wins.
As always, the nominations included some surprises in the top tier, particularly when it came to country artists.
Luke Combs, who had a cross-generational smash with a reverently faithful version of Tracy Chapman’s 1988 song “Fast Car,” got a nod for country solo performance, but not record of the year, which many in the industry had expected. (“Fast Car” was not, however, eligible for song of the year, since it had already been nominated for that award in the ’80s.)
Zach Bryan, an admired songwriter who found chart success this year with a self-titled album, was recognized only in country categories, for that LP and for “I Remember Everything,” a duet with Kacey Musgraves. And Morgan Wallen, a streaming titan whose album “One Thing at a Time” was a blockbuster this year, is absent completely — a sign, perhaps, that the coastal industry mainstream has not forgiven Wallen for his use of a racial slur two years ago, as establishment Nashville seemingly has. (Wallen’s hit “Last Night” is up for best country song, though Wallen was not among its four writers.)
Harvey Mason Jr., the CEO of the Recording Academy, said in an interview that the nominations simply reflect the musical judgment of the academy’s 11,000 or so voting members.
“There’s really no other explanation or calculus here,” Mason said. “The voters come in, they listen to the music, and the stuff they like the best, and feel is the most excellent, they vote for.”
The nominations arrived two days after Neil Portnow, a former academy chief, was sued in a New York court by an anonymous female musician who accused him of drugging and raping her five years ago. The suit also accused the academy of negligence.
Portnow has denied the accusation, and the academy on Wednesday called the woman’s claims “without merit.” Mason declined to comment about the case.
The major Grammy nominations this year largely hew to popular hits, and they notably over-index with female artists, though country and hip-hop are scarce in the top categories.
In addition to LPs by SZA, Swift, Rodrigo, Cyrus, boygenius and Batiste, the album of the year slate includes Lana Del Rey’s “Did You Know That There’s a Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd” and Janelle Monáe’s “The Age of Pleasure.”
Record of the year also includes Monét’s “On My Mama” and Eilish’s “What Was I Made For?,” from “Barbie.” Del Rey’s “A&W,” “What Was I Made For?” and another “Barbie” number, Lipa’s “Dance the Night,” round out song of the year.
The number of slots on the ballot for the four top Grammy categories has been a moving target for years. This year, the academy set it to eight, after two years at 10. It was the third such change in five years.
Among other rule changes this year, the academy moved the producer and songwriter of the year categories to the general field, which allows all voting members to vote on those awards.
Nominees for producer of the year, nonclassical, include Jack Antonoff, known for his work with Swift and Del Rey; Daniel Nigro (Rodrigo); Hit-Boy (Nas, Don Toliver); Dernst Emile II, known as D’Mile (Monét); and Metro Boomin (Travis Scott; Drake & 21 Savage). Songwriter of the year, meant to recognize writers who largely work behind the scenes, has nods for Edgar Barrera, Jessie Jo Dillon, Shane McAnally, Theron Thomas and Justin Tranter.
For best pop vocal album, Swift’s “Midnights,” Rodrigo’s “Guts” and Cyrus’ “Endless Summer Vacation” are up against Kelly Clarkson’s “Chemistry” and Ed Sheeran’s “-” (called “Subtract”).
In the rap album category, Drake & 21 Savage’s collaboration “Her Loss” and Travis Scott’s “Utopia” will contend with Killer Mike’s “Michael,” Nas’ “King’s Disease III” and Metro Boomin’s “Heroes & Villains.”
For country album, Bryan’s LP is up along with Kelsea Ballerini’s “Rolling Up the Welcome Mat,” Lainey Wilson’s “Bell Bottom Country,” Tyler Childers’ “Rustin’ in the Rain” and the self-titled album by Brothers Osborne.
The contenders for best rock album are Foo Fighters’ “But Here We Are,” Greta Van Fleet’s “Starcatcher,” Metallica’s “72 Seasons,” Paramore’s “This Is Why” and “In Times New Roman …” by Queens of the Stone Age.
For best African music performance, a new category, the nominees are Asake & Olamide’s “Amapiano,” Burna Boy’s “City Boys,” Ayra Starr’s “Rush,” Tyla’s “Water,” and Davido’s “Unavailable,” which features Musa Keys.
In the audiobook category, Michelle Obama and Sen. Bernie Sanders will compete with Meryl Streep, William Shatner and music producer Rick Rubin.
At the ceremony in February, the academy will give out prizes in 94 categories — the most in 13 years. The organization slashed many awards in 2011, but since then the number has gradually crept back up.
The 66th Grammys will recognize recordings released from Oct. 1, 2022, to Sept. 15, 2023 — an unusual eligibility window of 11 1/2 months. This year, nearly 16,000 entries were submitted for consideration, down slightly from last year.

Adidas May Write Off Unsold Yeezy Shoes
Adidas said it might have to write off the remaining 300 million euros ( $ 320 million) worth of Yeezy shoes left unsold after it cut ties with the rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West. The company will decide in the coming weeks whether or not to do a third release of the shoes next year to generate more donations to groups fighting antisemitism.
The shoe and sports clothing company, which cut ties with Ye in October 2022 after he made antisemitic remarks online, has sold 750 million euros worth of the shoes in two stages this year through Adidas smartphone apps and its website.
The company included the possible write-off of the remaining Yeezy inventory in its outlook Wednesday for its earnings this year, narrowing its expected loss to 100 million euros from an earlier prediction of 450 million euros, thanks in part to the earlier two releases of Yeezy shoes.

High Snack Prices Lift Sales for Kellanova
Kellanova, formerly Kellogg, and its newly spun-off North America cereal business, WK Kellogg, beat third-quarter sales estimates on Wednesday, supported by higher prices for their ready-to-eat breakfast cereals and snacks.
Packaged food companies like Kraft Heinz and Campbell Soup have increased their margins through repeated price increases over the last two years. But Kellanova and WK Kellogg warned that persistent inflation had made consumers sensitive to such increases.
Kellanova, whose brands include Cheez-It crackers and Pringles, recorded a 7.4 percent decline in overall volumes for the quarter, while WK Kellogg posted a 13.4 percent fall.
Kellanova posted quarterly net sales of $ 3.94 billion, beating expectations of $ 3.62 billion, according to LSEG data. WK Kellogg reported better-than-expected sales of $ 692 million. REUTERS

G.M. and StellantisInvest in Magnet Maker
The venture capital arms of General Motors and Stellantis are among investors sinking $ 33 million into a Minnesota company with technology to make magnets for electric vehicle motors without using expensive rare-earth metals.
Niron Magnetics of Minneapolis says it can build permanent magnets by using iron nitride, which is abundant and inexpensive compared with rare-earth minerals.
The investment announced Wednesday comes as electric vehicle sales growth slowing and G.M. and Ford have started to pull back on their spending.
Neither G.M. nor Stellantis would say how much they are investing in Niron, has 60 employees and plans to double that number by the end of the year.
The magnets can be used in consumer electronics, industrial motors, pumps, compressors, wind turbines and other products, Niron said. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Full text: Retailers are expanding their own private-label food and beverage offerings, attracting customers looking for less expensive options.
The snack chips had become pretty pricey.
For years, customers stopping at Casey's General Stores, a convenience store chain in the Midwest, hadn't thought twice about snagging a soda and a bag of Lay's or Doritos chips. But over the past year, as the price of a bag of chips soared and some customers felt squeezed by the high cost of gas and other expenses, they began picking up Casey's less-expensive store brand.
So Casey's began stocking more of its own chips, in a variety of new flavors. This summer, Casey's brand made up a quarter of all bags of chips sold, eating into the sales of big brands like Frito-Lay, which is owned by PepsiCo.
"As inflation continues to ratchet up, more people are open to trying alternatives," said Darren Rebelez, the chief executive of Casey's, which has 350 private-label products and plans to add 45 this year. "If you put the alternative right on the shelf, right next to the expensive option, people may say, 'What the heck,' and give it a try."
Large food companies gobbled up market share during the pandemic. With supply chain issues affecting what was on the shelves, people were buying basically whatever they could find. And they kept buying even as prices soared when the food and beverage brands raised prices to maintain their profit levels while still covering rising ingredient and labor costs.
But with retailers now expanding their store-owned food and beverage offerings, consumers are slowly shifting their spending. Overall, private-label foods and beverages have crept up to a 20.6 percent share of grocery dollars from 18.7 percent before the pandemic, according to the market research firm Circana.
But a deeper look at some categories reveals private-label goods are gaining significant ground on national brands. Private labels snagged 38 percent of canned vegetable sales in the three months that ended June 30, according to Numerator, another market research firm. Numerator's data also shows private-label cheese held 45 percent of the market and coffee nearly 15 percent.
The shift in spending reflects a customer base that is nearing or at its tipping point. Inflation, which climbed to 3.7 percent in September, is running at a less-rapid pace than a year ago, but millions of shoppers still face increasingly high prices in grocery stores.
The trend is having a greater effect among those with lower incomes, who spend a greater share of their paycheck on food, even as a pandemic-era policy that increased the amount of money that food-stamp recipients received over the last three years has ended. This month, payments on federal student loans, which had been on pause for the pandemic, also resumed. Adding to the financial burden, rates on credit cards and mortgages are rising.
Two-thirds of consumers said in July that they bought less-expensive groceries at retailers, an increase of four percentage points from a year earlier, according to the consulting firm McKinsey. The shift, the firm said, was particularly pronounced among those with incomes less than $ 100,000 in categories such as meat, dairy and staples.
"Consumers are trading down," said Rupesh D. Parikh, an equity analyst at Oppenheimer & Company who covers food, grocery and consumer products. He recently bought a box of Kellogg's Mini Wheats cereal at Walmart along with the Walmart version. "The Kellogg's cereal was 75 percent more expensive, and I couldn't tell the difference between them," he said.
Big brands, in response, are already starting to offer small sale prices on certain foods, like salty snacks. "The question is how deep they are willing to go in promotions," Mr. Parikh said.
The expansion in private-label goods is also a response to a changing grocery landscape. Competition is revving up because of consolidation, led by Kroger's proposed $ 24.6 billion merger with Albertsons, and the push into the United States by entrants like the German discount chain Aldi, which stocks 90 percent of its shelves with private-label goods. In August, Aldi agreed to acquire 400 Winn Dixie and Harveys Supermarket stores, giving it a significant presence in the Southeast.
Retailers say they need the private-label goods to give consumers a broader array of choices. The store brands are also typically more profitable for the retailers than products from big food companies.
But perhaps the biggest factor is a seismic shift in consumer attitudes. Older generations that grew up with "generic" ketchup or soup recall them as bland, tasteless versions of the name brands. Retailers, which have dumped the term "generic," insist that the quality of the private-label foods and beverages has improved substantially. Social media platforms like TikTok and Reddit are filled with young people hyping their favorite store brand foods at Aldi and Trader Joe's.
"If the food is not good quality, our reputation is at risk," said Scott Patton, the vice president of national buying for Aldi, who said the chain was seeing increased traffic in all income levels. "If you're going to sell a store-branded apple cinnamon ice cream, it had better be the best apple cinnamon ice cream you've ever had."
Retailers are offering customers "belly fillers," basic foods at low prices that are virtual clones of national brands, but they are also hunting for ways to differentiate themselves, said Jordan Bouey, the owner of Silver State Baking, a Las Vegas-based manufacturer that makes cookies, bars and breads for grocery chains and retailers.
"If there's a category that doesn't have a big national brand, retailers are looking to be unique and give the shoppers what they're looking for, like a protein cookie," Mr. Bouey said.
At a Wegmans in Hanover, N.J., the dried pasta aisle was stocked with fettuccine, shells and spaghetti from well-known brands like Barilla and De Cecco. But the vast majority of the pasta on the shelves was Wegmans' own brand, one line priced at 99 cents a box and another, Amore, that is imported from Italy and $ 4.99 a box, about $ 2 more than some of the national brands.
"We want our brand to serve the value customer who is on a budget," said Nicole Wegman, who was named president of Wegmans Brand in 2021. Wegmans has expanded its private-label business in recent years to more than 17,000 products, including deli and prepared meals, frozen vegetables and healthy snacks.
"But we also want products, like our cheese and our breads, that are fun for the food enthusiast," Ms. Wegman said. "They're specialty items and more expensive to make, so we have to charge more for them."
Indeed, executives at Casey's, which started dabbling in private-label goods three years ago, said they were trying not to compete with the national brands but rather expand what's available for customers. In some cases, that means offering flavors the national brands do not.
Sales of limited-edition Casey's chips in flavors like sweet corn, barbecue brisket and jalapeño Cheddar sold well this summer. "Those are the kind of products that a Frito-Lay is not going to make because it is not a national flavor profile that is going to work for their business," Mr. Rebelez said.
But he also acknowledged that some Casey's customers were simply looking for deals.
Take candy bars. For years, retailers would not compete against behemoths like Hershey and Mars because customers remained loyal to the brands they had grown up eating. But as the price of candy bars rose in recent years, some customers stopped buying.
So Casey's created four of its own lower-priced candy bars, including a chocolate with mint and a chocolate caramel.
"I was skeptical going in, but those candy bars have performed really well," Mr. Rebelez said, adding that Casey's was working on more iterations. "There is a breaking point for consumers, and in certain products and categories we'll provide an alternative."

Ban on Red Food Dye Hasn't Halted Its Use In Cookies and Candy: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The dye was banned in cosmetics after a study suggested it might be a carcinogen. Yet federal regulations still permit its use in foods, stoking concerns that helped build support for the new state law.
Thirty-three years after the Food and Drug Administration banned the use of Red Dye No. 3 in red lipstick and other cosmetics by linking it to cancer, California has become the first state to ban the chemical in food.
Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed a law this month that outlawed the red dye and three other chemicals. Red No. 3 is used in Halloween treats and other foods, including private-label candy, cookies and frostings sold at national chains such as Walmart and Target.
The California law increases public pressure on the F.D.A. to examine similar questions surrounding artificial colors and other ingredients. But the agency itself is in a state of flux after the infant formula scandal raised concerns about food oversight. Dr. Robert Califf, the F.D.A. commissioner, has begun a reorganization of its beleaguered food division, marked by the departure of two top officials and the appointment of a deputy commissioner with significant experience in food safety.
Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat who represents a district near Los Angeles, said the federal agency's inaction along with loopholes in food safety regulations had contributed to the state lawmakers' reasoning in supporting the measure.
"The primary purpose of this bill was to protect kids and families and consumers in the state of California," he said. "But a secondary purpose here was to send a message to Washington that the F.D.A. process is broken, and hopefully to spur momentum in Washington D.C. for real, significant change."
The F.D.A. said in a statement that it "evaluates and regulates ingredients added to food to ensure that the authorized use of these ingredients is safe. This includes the four ingredients included in the California bill."
The California law applies to food chemicals that are also banned in the European Union and in some other nations. The red dye is still permitted for use in maraschino cherries.
First approved for use in food in 1907, Red Dye No. 3 was banned in cosmetics by U.S. regulators in 1990. At the time, the F.D.A. cited an industry-conducted study that found that the chemical caused thyroid cancer in male rats (but not mice) but estimated that it might cause cancer in fewer than 1 in 100,000 people. Along with prohibiting the dye in cosmetics, the agency pledged to do the same with food.
"We're stuck in this regulatory quandary where you're not allowed to apply it to your skin, but you can ingest it in food -- so it's completely illogical," said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, which signed the petition and supported the California bill.
In the ensuing decades, though, the red dye became a common coloring agent in candies and frosting. Last year, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, along with other advocacy groups, petitioned the F.D.A. to take action against it. The F.D.A. said it is reviewing the petition and has examined the safety of the dye, including the rat studies, which it said are "not relevant to human cancer."
The petition also cited a California study in 2021 that linked Red Dye No. 3 and other dyes to behavioral problems in some children.
At a grocery store in northern New Jersey, examples could be found of foods that included Red Dye No. 3; Nestle's strawberry Nesquik drink and the strawberry-flavored Funfetti Mermaid frosting, made by General Mills's Pillsbury. The synthetic coloring agent is also found in cookies, fruit cocktail cups and sprinkles for treats sold under private labels at Target and Walmart, according to a food database maintained by the U.S. Agriculture Department. Nestle, General Mills, and Walmart did not respond to emails seeking comment. Target said in a statement that it requires its vendors to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws.
Some companies said they were working to remove Red Dye No. 3 from their products. Just Born, which makes Peeps, the squishy marshmallow candy, said only two colors -- pink and lavender Peeps -- would be made using the dye in 2024. After next spring, the dye would be phased out of all of its products, the company said.
"We have worked hard to develop new formulations," Keith Domalewski, director of marketing at Just Born, said in an email.
He added that another popular treat, Hot Tamales, was no longer made with Red Dye No. 3 and that updated ingredient lists should soon be on store shelves nationwide.
The California legislation also banned brominated vegetable oil, which is mostly used in store-brand sodas to keep citrus flavoring from floating to the top. An F.D.A. study in 2022 found that the ingredient may disrupt hormones in rats. The agency has said it plans to ban the ingredient.
The state law, which takes effect in 2027, also outlaws potassium bromate, used in baked goods and tortillas. It has been deemed a possible human carcinogen by international experts, also based on animal studies. Propylparaben, also banned under the law, is a preservative in packaged baked goods that is believed to disrupt hormones and affect reproductive health.
The back story of chemicals like propylparaben propelled the bill forward, according to Susan Little, a California-based lobbyist for the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that supported the legislation. The chemical, in F.D.A. parlance, was "generally recognized as safe," or GRAS, a designation that was initially assigned to ingredients like salt and vinegar, which were deemed permissible foods and chemicals with no in-depth review.
Acknowledging a cumbersome review process, the F.D.A. in 1997 allowed food companies to convene experts internally to certify some ingredients as safe. Companies could add them to food without any special notice to the public or the F.D.A., according to Jensen N. Jose, a lawyer with the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
"Many people were astounded to learn that the F.D.A. is not actively regulating the chemicals we put in our food," Ms. Little said. "That piece of information came as a surprise to many people and was a reason the bill had the legs it had."
Opposition to the California legislation was fierce for many months, but diminished when the sponsors dropped the part of the proposal that would have banned titanium dioxide, a chemical used to color food white or add a shiny appearance. The European Union banned the ingredient last year, saying it was uncertain whether the ingredient's minuscule nanoparticles damaged DNA. The F.D.A. is reviewing a second petition seeking to remove that ingredient from food.
In California, the National Confectioners Association was among the food industry groups opposed to the bill, saying it would generate "a patchwork of inconsistent state requirements."
"We should be relying on the scientific rigor of the F.D.A. in terms of evaluating the safety of food ingredients and additives," Christopher Gindlesperger, an association vice president, said.
Frank Yiannas, a former top F.D.A. food official, said after his resignation early this year that he had since consulted for groups that "directly or indirectly have an interest in this topic." He wrote an opinion article opposing the bill in September. On Thursday, he said that the California law "sets a dangerous precedent" in taking on a food-oversight role better performed by federal experts.
"I don't think it adequately considered the longer-term, unintended consequences it could have on the U.S. food system," said Mr. Yiannas, who was a Walmart food safety executive before joining the F.D.A. in 2018.
As the California bill and a pending measure in New York State aimed at eliminating titanium dioxide drew attention, Dr. Califf addressed the F.D.A.'s moves on food safety in May: "The F.D.A. is embarking on a more modernized, systematic reassessment of chemicals with a focus on post-market review."
He also appealed to Congress for more funding and oversight powers to accomplish those goals. Since then, the F.D.A. has named James Jones to lead its food division, noting his experience as a pesticide regulator at the Environmental Protection Agency.
Nearly 10 years ago, Mars, Kellogg's and General Mills pledged to remove synthetic colors from popular snacks and cereals, many of which are geared toward children.
But within a couple of years, many of the companies had reversed their decisions. General Mills said sales of its Trix cereal, appearing in more muted colors thanks to vegetable and fruit juices and other ingredients, initially exceeded expectations. But the company soon backpedaled, saying loyal customers were split, with some preferring brightly colored cereal made with artificial colors. WK Kellogg, a spinoff of Kellogg's cereal business, did not respond to queries seeking comment.
In a statement, Mars said after research it had found that, "consumer expectations regarding colors in food differ widely across markets and categories."
In grocery store aisles, a vast majority of red-hued beverages and treats, including Skittles, cherry Pop-Tarts, Fruity Pebbles cereal and strawberry Pedialyte, are made with Red Dye No. 40, another synthetic coloring.
The dye, also known as Allura Red, has also drawn scrutiny over the years. Some studies and researchers have linked the dye to hyperactivity in children, but a committee convened by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2011 found no "causal link." Late last year, another study in mice raised concerns that Allura Red dye could increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease.
Supporters of the California measure said they hoped the F.D.A. and others would focus more on such additives and on overall food chemical oversight in the coming months.
"This regulatory system couldn't get any better for the food industry and companies that sell chemicals to the food industry," said Scott Faber, director of the Environmental Working Group.

Full text: International law offers a framework for how to analyze what is happening.
It can be difficult to hold onto reason through the fog of grief that is the natural response to what has occurred in recent days in Israel and Gaza.
But international law offers a framework for how to analyze what is happening, even while atrocities and deaths from the Hamas incursion are still being documented, and the consequences of Israel's siege and airstrikes on the crowded Gaza Strip, home to millions of civilians, continue to unfold. New information is coming out every day. Details will take time to verify, misinformation is already widespread, and it can be easy to get bogged down in debates over unconfirmed allegations. The laws of war offer a guide to what matters most, and to what should happen next.
Two principles are particularly helpful. The first is that the "why" and the "how" of war are separate legal questions. The justice or injustice of a cause of war does not change the obligation to fight it according to the rules of humanitarian law.
The second, related principle, from which much of humanitarian law derives, is that civilians are entitled to protection. Armies and other armed groups cannot target them directly. Nor can they disproportionately harm them in the course of pursuing legitimate military goals. And those obligations still apply even if the other side violates them by targeting civilians themselves.
'Protections for human beings'
The origins of the law of war go back centuries. But its modern form was a reaction to the world wars of the 20th century. In 1928, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, an international treaty, outlawed most forms of war. It was followed by the U.N. Charter of 1945, which clarified the ban on aggressive war, the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and 1977, and the further development of international criminal law in the second half of the 20th century, leading to the establishment of the International Criminal Court in 2002.
The law governing when states can use military force is known as "jus ad bellum," a Latin term that refers to the law regulating the use of force internationally.
Today, this law is very strict, essentially forbidding states to use force against each other except in self-defense, said Oona Hathaway, a professor at Yale Law School and co-author of "The Internationalists: How a Radical Plan to Outlaw War Remade the World."
"It used to be the case that states could go to war for pretty much any reason," Hathaway said. "They could go to war for debt collection. They could go to war, you know, to respond to wife stealing. They could go to war because other side is interfering with their trade relations. But that is no longer true."
But regardless of whether there are legitimate grounds to use force, she said, all parties to the conflict are still expected to follow the humanitarian laws governing the conduct of the war itself, known as "jus in bello" -- law regulating the conduct of hostilities.
Anyone who has spent much time on social media recently will have seen people conflate the justness of the conflict itself with the justness of the way it is being conducted. Some have appeared to excuse the killing of Israeli civilians on the basis that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories is wrong, while others appeared to dismiss the killing of Palestinian civilians in airstrikes on the grounds that Israel is right to defend itself from attack.
Treating causes and conduct as two separate questions, as the law does, is a way to hold the complexity of war and the political questions that underlie it in clear focus, without losing sight of the shared humanity on all sides.
That same goal guided the development of the laws of war. "International law has traditionally separated the two in an effort to protect people in warfare, no matter the justification for the initial use of force," said Monica Hakimi, a Columbia Law School professor. "They wanted to make sure that both sides were equally protected in war, so as to make war as humane as possible."
The core principle of jus in bello is that civilians cannot be targeted for military purposes, or disproportionately harmed as a means to a military end. That's true regardless of the legality of the underlying conflict, and regardless of whether the opposing side has itself violated humanitarian law.
"The most straightforward way to think about that is just that the protections are protections for human beings," said Tom Dannenbaum, a professor at the Fletcher School at Tufts University who is an expert on humanitarian law.
"Many of those human beings have nothing to do with violations by the state or nonstate armed groups with which they're somehow connected," he said. It would not make sense, he said, to reduce or eliminate civilians' rights in reaction to the behavior of armed groups they do not control.
Civilians under fire
Hamas has killed more than 1,200 Israelis, of whom 222 were soldiers, according to the Israeli government. The civilians killed included young people attending a music festival, babies, children and the elderly.
"There is no question," Dannenbaum said, that the Hamas assault "involved multiple war crimes and crimes against humanity, some of which are ongoing. Those are not close calls."
The attackers also took approximately 150 people hostage. Volker Turk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement on Tuesday that the taking of hostages is prohibited by international law, and called on Palestinian armed groups to immediately and unconditionally release all captured civilians.
"Hamas is bound by, but has a practice of violating, the basic provisions of international humanitarian law," Hakimi said. Acts such as systematic murder and hostage-taking are grave violations of the Geneva Conventions, as well as crimes under international criminal law.
Hamas could not be reached for comment, but Moussa Abu Marzouk, a senior Hamas political official, said that the group "obeys all international and moral laws" in an interview with The Economist on Oct. 10, three days after the attack on Israel.
In the same statement that decried hostage-taking, Turk, the U.N. official, raised grave concerns about Israel's actions in Gaza. On Monday, Israel's defense minister Yoav Gallant had announced a complete siege of the territory, saying that "no electricity, no food, no water, no fuel" would be allowed into the 25 mile-long strip of land that is home to more than two million people, approximately half of whom are under 18.
"The imposition of sieges that endanger the lives of civilians by depriving them of goods essential for their survival is prohibited under international humanitarian law," Turk said.
Dannenbaum, an expert on siege law, said that the defense minister's statement appeared to be an unusually clear-cut example of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, which is considered a violation of international humanitarian law, a crime against humanity and a war crime. (Though, he noted, jurisdiction over some war crimes would depend on whether the conflict is considered inter-state.)
"When you have a blanket, unequivocal, total cutoff of food, water, electricity and fuel, it's just straightforward," he said. "Gallant's statement, explicit, without caveat, and from the top, stands out."
Ophir Falk, a foreign policy adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, told The New York Times on Thursday: "Israel is acting in complete compliance with international law, and always has."
Israel has been heavily bombarding Gaza in recent days, part of a campaign against Hamas that a military spokesman said would be "bigger and more severe" than previous actions in the territory.
Under international law, even attacks on legitimate military targets are illegal if they disproportionately harm civilians, Hakimi said.
According to a Thursday statement from Gaza's health ministry, 1,354 people have been killed by airstrikes since Saturday and 6,049 had been wounded. The previous day, the ministry said that about 60 percent of those injured are women and children. Attacks have targeted hospitals and schools where Israel has claimed that Hamas members were hiding.
Falk, the adviser to Netanyahu, said that questions of the proportionality of harm to civilians were "tactical and operational" matters that he would not discuss, but that Israel was bombing military targets, and always warned civilians that attacks were imminent. However, on Tuesday, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, said that the Israeli Air Force was too stretched to fire the warning strikes -- known as "roof knocks" -- that it has fired in previous Gaza conflicts to encourage Palestinian civilians to leave an area before it is hit with larger missiles. Gazans say that few warnings have been given.
And because Gaza is under siege and heavy bombardment, civilians have few avenues of escape, even if warned.
"You can have disagreements about whether something is or is not proportional, because you can have disagreements about the value of the military targets," Hakimi said. However, there are limits to those arguments, she said, saying that it would not be permissible to justify mass civilian casualties by saying that their deaths would shorten the overall conflict, for example.
The question of what is proportional is a balancing test that has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, she said.

Confessions of a Pop-Tarts Critic: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When my family was enlisted nearly 60 years ago, little did we suspect that the pastry would become a pop-culture phenomenon and inspire a Seinfeld movie.
Almost every family has a secret they never discuss. Ours is this: We were taste testers for Pop-Tarts.
It was not long after Kellogg's introduced the toaster pastry in 1964. But for several months one year (none of us can pinpoint the exact date), brown cardboard boxes arrived on our doorstep with an assortment of Pop-Tarts tucked inside. Strawberry. Raspberry. Brown-Sugar Cinnamon. We ate them all. After dinner. Sometimes hot, usually cold. With frosting and without.
Neither I nor any of my seven siblings can recall how we came to be Pop-Tart critics, and my parents aren't alive to tell us. But I have a theory: My mother was resourceful and, with eight children to feed, she probably saw an appeal for tasters somewhere and thought: "Oh, boy. Free dessert."
Whatever the reason, we were witnesses to food history. Today, as Kellogg's prepares to celebrate the 60th birthday of Pop-Tarts next year, they remain a cultural touchstone. Last year, more than two billion were sold, according to the company. They've been depicted on art murals, exhibited in museums and parodied on "Saturday Night Live."
And like Barbie, they even have their own movie: Next year, Jerry Seinfeld plans to release "Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story," a farcical chronicle of the race to win the breakfast-pastry wars, which Post began with its own toaster pastry, Country Squares, six months before Kellogg's introduced Pop-Tarts.
Mr. Seinfeld, who directs and stars in the Netflix film, based his script on a joke in his stand-up routine, and invited a baker's dozen of his friends to join him onscreen, including Amy Schumer, Melissa McCarthy and Hugh Grant.
In an interview, he recalled a boyhood trip with his mother to the supermarket, where, upon seeing a box of Pop-Tarts, "I just grabbed it."
They were a revelation for a kid who ate dry toast. "They seemed very futuristic," Mr. Seinfeld said.
Even the name -- Kellogg's considered calling them "fruit scones" -- was changed to reflect the sensibilities of the '60s, when Pop Art was ascendant. And they transformed the lowly toaster into more than just an appliance for browning bread.
To me and my siblings, Pop-Tarts were exotic. We were raised in a small agricultural community in the shadow of California's Santa Cruz Mountains and got most of our food from the farms and dairies that dotted the outskirts of town. Processed food was rare in our house, and store-bought sweets rarer still, as it was cheaper to bake dozens of homemade cookies on a Sunday to be divvied up during the week.
The Pop-Tarts were delivered to our door in a cardboard box about the size of a footstool, with nothing on the outside to indicate flavor, frosting or even that it was from Kellogg's. The individual packages inside were marked with only a number.
I was barely in kindergarten, as I recall. But I was captivated, like one of the hominids in "2001: A Space Odyssey" -- only, instead of staring at a black alien monolith, I was transfixed by a cardboard box. (In his 2020 Netflix special, Mr. Seinfeld echoed a similar sentiment about seeing Pop-Tarts for the first time: "We were just chimps in the dirt playing with sticks.")
When our family food experiment began, Pop-Tarts were already in stores, but we got unreleased flavors our neighbors and classmates couldn't buy. And that made us special.
One sister recalls that our father locked the Pop-Tarts in the basement for safekeeping. This makes sense. Food left unattended in a big family tends to disappear quickly, and my parents guarded the Pop-Tarts the way Harry Winston watches over its diamonds on Oscar night.
We didn't eat Pop-Tarts for breakfast; our mother continued to serve the oatmeal that, if it sat too long, congealed into beige goo. And if you ate one too quickly out of the toaster, you were likely to burn your tongue.
On tasting nights, we would gather around the kitchen table after dinner. Then my father would appear with the box of Pop-Tarts and place it gently on the counter with the same care he laid baby Jesus in the crèche on Christmas Eve. My mother would tear open the bags and dole out one Pop-Tart apiece. She did not toast them (which is kind of the point, isn't it?), and the flavor was kept secret until the big reveal.
Some of us sniffed and nibbled. Others took sizable bites. My mother would sometimes ask us questions. But mostly, we remember filling out forms and grading the Pop-Tarts for taste and texture. Then the box, and the filled-out forms, would be whisked away and the leftovers rationed until another box arrived with new flavors and frostings to try.
We were good students and took our job seriously, considering our appraisals with the same thoughtfulness as a "Top Chef" judge. In our minds, at least, this was important work. I may be exaggerating here, but if you like Frosted Strawberry or Frosted Brown Sugar Cinnamon -- two of Kellogg's best-selling flavors -- you may have our family to thank.
But as revolutionary as Pop-Tarts were, few of us remember being wowed. Our great-grandmother, who had emigrated from Czechoslovakia, regularly turned out trays of homemade apricot kolache and fresh apple strudel. Pop-Tarts paled in comparison.
"I did not like them," said my sister Mary. They didn't appeal either to my sister Gondie, but gave her bargaining power on the school playground. "You could eat one Pop-Tart and trade the other for a candy bar," she said of the two-pack. For my part, I would eat them only if my mother cut the edges off, leaving a ravioli-size square of frosted raspberry jam.
Maybe it's not surprising that none of us eat them now. "But it was a great memory," said my brother Michael.
I called Kellogg's, which on Oct. 2 split off Pop-Tarts and other brands into a new company called Kellanova, to see if it had a record in its archives of my family, or others like ours. A spokeswoman said the company did not keep historical data. I scoured websites that referenced Pop-Tarts and the 1960s, and read the account of a man (whom I couldn't locate) who said he had worked with Kellogg's to develop the Pop-Tart and brought them home to his children.
This made me wonder: Would our experience be an anachronism today, in a digital world where everyone seems to be an online food connoisseur?
Now, there are Pop-Tart reviews by the Food Network, blind taste tests on YouTube, communities that rate them on Reddit, online rankings and taste challenges for children. Joey Chestnut, the perennial winner of Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, ate 100 Pop-Tarts in about 30 minutes a few years ago. (His favorite flavor was S'Mores.)
I asked Mr. Seinfeld why he thought people would be interested in a comedy about the dawn of Pop-Tarts.
"Ninety-five percent of it is complete insanity," he said of the movie. But he noted that the Pop-Tart holds great nostalgic appeal. "It was a great graphic, and a great name and a great product."
Indeed Mr. Seinfeld said he still liked to eat two Brown Sugar Cinnamon Pop-Tarts with a glass of milk.
"There is nothing better," he said.

Chinese Activist Camps Out at Taiwan Airport in Bid for Asylum in West: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Chen Siming fled China and awaits refugee assistance in Taiwan, which is wary of raising tensions with Beijing by being seen as a haven for China critics.
Chen Siming, an activist who fled China, has been camped out at an airport in Taiwan for nearly a week, hoping to gain asylum in the West. He is willing to wait for much longer, as long as he is not forced to board a plane back to China.
Mr. Chen, 60, is among a wave of activists and human rights defenders who have recently attempted bold and hazardous escapes from the country as a crackdown on civil society has widened. In July, a Chinese human rights lawyer fled to Laos. Last month, a critic of China's ruling Communist Party fled to South Korea, apparently by jet ski.
Mr. Chen's predicament in Taiwan is unusual. While the self-ruled island is an attractive refuge for people fleeing Chinese state oppression, it is also wary of raising tensions with Beijing by accepting too many critics of its Communist Party.
Mr. Chen was reluctant to leave the mainland, eager to continue his activism there.
"I believe that people have to put in the work in order for society to improve," Mr. Chen said in an interview on Thursday. "That's why I always wanted to stay in China and fight."
A taxi and truck driver from the southern city of Zhuzhou in Hunan Province, Mr. Chen said his interest in activism grew after he befriended a leading human rights lawyer online in 2016.
He joined a network of about a dozen loosely organized activists in the region and began commemorating the deadly 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy students at Tiananmen Square every year. He also sought to raise awareness of the plight of a woman in the province who had filmed herself splashing ink on a poster of Xi Jinping in 2021 and was later reportedly forced to enter a psychiatric facility.
Zhou Fengsuo, the executive director of Human Rights in China, a group based in New York, said that he had been in communication with Mr. Chen for more than five years and that the type of activism he engaged in was becoming increasingly rare in the mainland. The police have conducted mass raids on civil society organizations, Mr. Zhou said, and Mr. Chen's fellow activists in Zhuzhou have gone missing.
Over the years, Mr. Chen had become accustomed to living in fear of the authorities. Since 2018 or 2019, the police often visited him, sometimes detaining him for days at a time, most recently around this year's June 4 anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests. The turning point came weeks later, when on July 21, national security agents threatened to send him to a psychiatric facility, he said.
Mr. Chen said he escaped China on July 22, first traveling to Laos and then making his way to Thailand. Even outside of China, he did not feel safe, especially after learning that Lu Siwei, a human rights lawyer, was detained by the authorities in Laos and forcibly deported to China in September, where experts said he was likely to be tortured.
Under Mr. Xi, China's most iron-fisted leader in decades, the authorities have offered bounties for critics who have fled overseas, and secured the detention or deportation of exiles passing through neighboring countries.
Mr. Chen wanted to avoid a similar fate. But lacking visas to travel elsewhere, Mr. Chen booked a plane ticket to a city in mainland China, with a strategically chosen layover at Taoyuan International Airport. He turned himself in to Taiwanese immigration officials as a candidate for temporary asylum last week.
In a video filmed at the airport, he called on the Taiwan authorities not to deport him to China and to allow him to stay as he applied for asylum in the United States and Canada.
Speaking from an area assigned to him in the airport, Mr. Chen said that he was instructed to stay within the airport.
Chan Chi-hung, a spokesman of the Mainland Affairs Council of Taiwan, said that Mr. Chen remained at the airport because he did not have permission to enter Taiwan, and that the authorities were handling his case.
Mr. Chen said he was prepared to wait. In the meantime, he had access to shower facilities and was given meals like rice, noodles and bento boxes.
Chien-Yuan Tseng, the chairman of the New School for Democracy, a group that supports human rights activists, said that dissidents like Mr. Chen live in a state of limbo because Taiwan does not have refugee and political asylum laws. The government must deal with asylum applications on a case-by-case basis, Mr. Tseng said.
Taiwan is also wary of further inflaming tensions with China.
"They're trying to balance a lot of complicated factors. They don't want to raise tensions with the mainland if more and more activists are trying to make it to Taiwan," said Thomas E. Kellogg, the executive director of the Center for Asian Law at Georgetown University.

From Hungry and Broke in the East Village: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: Living in the neighborhood in the 1980s and '90s, I was always hungry and always broke. I got pretty far on that combination.
Hi, it's Pete Wells, restaurant critic of The Times and longtime pierogi appreciator.
It would be an exaggeration to say that I moved to the East Village for the pierogies. This was 1988, and rents were still low east of the Bowery.
Still, the pierogies did whisper in my ear. Before my move to New York City I'd made a lot of weekend visits to friends who lived in the East Village. After scratching the cue ball at Julian's or dancing at the Pyramid Club, we'd end the night at one of the Eastern European restaurants that used to be thick on the ground. (The best scene was at the Kiev, on Second Avenue, where you might spot Allen Ginsberg or Quentin Crisp or Jonas Mekas.) Dragging one corner of a pierogi through mounds of fried onions and sour cream, I thought: This would be an interesting place to live.
I was right. The East Village was my home for most of the next 12 years. I was always ready to eat something new, and I was always broke. You could go pretty far on that combination in the '80s and '90s. I found Egyptian grilled chicken, Filipino chicken adobo, Sicilian spleen sandwiches on palm-size seeded buns, Awadhi stews steamed under a lid of pastry, and a hundred other things.
I thought I was getting dinner, but I was getting an education. Many of the places I loved then are gone, but not all. Here are some of the survivors, the restaurants where I used to go on my own dime before I turned pro.
Little Poland
The old Polish and Ukrainian coffee shops weren't always known for nuance. Little Poland's cooking, though, has a subtlety that sets it apart, even from two other survivors that I love, Veselka and the Ukrainian East Village Restaurant. The challah at Little Poland, unbraided and only slightly sweet, is springier and moister than some others. You could almost call its cold borscht, swimming with chopped cucumbers and eggs and beets, a Polish gazpacho. The potato pancakes crackle under your fork and the blintzes, which stretch from one end of the plate to the other, are as evenly browned as if they had spent the summer on the Algarve, lying on a reflective blanket.
Curry Ya x Rai Rai Ken x Otafuku
In the '80s and '90s, the neighborhood started to attract young Japanese bohemians. While Midtown had staid Japanese restaurants for men in suits, the East Village got street food and noodle counters. The first time I saw balls of takoyaki with leaves of shaved bonito fluttering miraculously on top was at Otafuku, on East 9th Street. And while I had left the neighborhood by the time Curry Ya opened on East 10th Street, it's where I ate my first katsu curry. Both restaurants are gone now but their menus, and many of their fans, have been transferred to Rai Rai Ken, on East 10th, where I had my first bowl of ramen that didn't come out of a packet. All three places are owned by T.I.C. Restaurant Group, which brought at least a dozen genres of Japanese dining and drinking to the East Village starting in the 1980s.
Sunny & Annie's Deli
How many sandwiches has Sunny & Annie's invented? I know there were already more than 100 when I lived across the street, because my favorite was the 101, a mutant Reuben with bacon. Early on almost everything was assembled from deli staples. Now there are many variations on the banh mi, sandwiches that resemble Mexican cemitas and a few that are unclassifiable.
Casa Adela
One of the hubs of the old Loisaida neighborhood is now its most impressive survivor, carrying on in spite of an eroding Hispanic presence, a rent dispute and the death of its founder, Adela Fargas. And so, against the odds, Casa Adela is still there from morning to night with hand-wrapped pasteles, sancocho, roast pork, soupy pots of beans, fried plaintains mashed into mofongo, unaccountably good rotisserie chickens, and fresh orange juice that goes into Adela's marvelous morir soñando.
B & H Dairy Kosher Restaurant
The counter at B & H was where I sat when I was overstimulated. I'd come back down to earth after a whitefish salad on soft fat slices of challah and a bowl of pea soup as thick as pudding.
Stromboli Pizza
It does everything a slice shop should, including staying open an hour after the bars close.
John's of 12th Street
I could rarely afford John's, but when I had the money I would come just to stare at the burning candles emerging from encrustations of wax so long in the making they look positively medieval.
What I'm reading
In The Baffler, Chris Crowley has a cleareyed explanation of why the no-tipping movement fell apart.
Americans don't love their morning bowls of cereal the way they used to. As Aaron Back reports in The Wall Street Journal, cereal sales have been shrinking for years, motivating Kellogg to sell off its North American cereal division as WK Kellogg.
I knew people in Kansas City had strong opinions on barbecue, but I didn't know where Missouri's two United States senators stood on the question until I read Daniel Desrocher's column in the Kansas City Star.

The Many Costs of Shoplifting: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Few shopping experiences are more intimate than a visit to the pharmacy. The contents of your basket may disclose waxy ears, hemorrhoids, insomnia, constipation, a messy rash or the compulsion to try all permutations of the Reese's product line. The pharmacy is a place where people like to slip in and out unnoticed, hoping the cashier doesn't linger over each item at checkout.
But privacy is harder to preserve now that drugstores, to thwart shoplifters, increasingly lock their stock behind cabinet doors, with buttons to push in order to get an employee's attention. A pimply boy has to hail an employee to free his benzoyl peroxide and a 14-year-old girl needs to be watched as she selects a tampon that suits her cycle. Even for adults, it's hard not to be self-conscious about having a store employee trail you through the drugstore like a personal shopper as you ponder which dental floss to buy.
I thought about this sad atmosphere of surveillance during one of my recent visits to San Francisco, where the broader downtown retail environment has been left tattered by store closures. Walking from aisle to aisle pushing a series of buttons, I felt like an imposition on a pharmacy's meager staff. After a string of these requests, I left before securing everything I'd planned to buy. The whole experience felt bad: I was sorry for the shopkeeper, sorry for the employees, sorry for being there, sorry for not buying enough. I made no impulse purchases.
There's good reason for the added security. The material costs of shoplifting are considerable. In 2021, an estimated $ 94.5 billion nationwide was lost to shoplifting and other forms of "retail shrink" (which includes damaged or lost goods and employee theft). According to a survey conducted by the National Retail Federation in June, 53 percent of consumers believe that retail crimes such as shoplifting and looting have increased in their communities since the pandemic.
The social and economic causes of shoplifting have become a source of debate, as has the extent of the problem. There are complicated questions around criminal enforcement, policing and punishment.
But leaving those issues aside, there is also an undeniable quality-of-life impact from the real or perceived increase in shoplifting. It is felt by shoppers, store employees, security personnel, store owners and our communities -- and in ways more serious than awkward encounters over tampon purchases.
The most obvious effect is a sense of increased danger. Stores simply feel less safe. For a variety of reasons, police now seem less inclined to arrest shoplifters. In Chicago, for example, overall arrests for reported thefts dropped from a rate of about 10 percent in 2019 to less than 4 percent in 2022, according to Wirepoints, a right-leaning watchdog group. Of the nearly 9,000 reported retail thefts in Chicago in 2022, only about 17 percent resulted in arrests, Wirepoints said. This apparent shift in policing priorities can put increased pressure on store security personnel and frontline workers to police their own stores, even when they are inadequately prepared to do so.
Most people who work in stores expect to fold shirts, restock shelves and handle customer requests -- not to confront brazen and sometimes hostile shoplifters or organized theft rings. Working in an environment in which shoplifting is prevalent is stressful and can be traumatizing. Some workers are even punished for trying to help. In Rincon, Ga., a 68-year-old Lowe's employee was fired this year after leaving the store to try to stop suspected shoplifters, one of whom punched her. She had worked for Lowe's for 13 years, but her actions in pursuing the thieves who had left the store were apparently against policy. (She was subsequently rehired.)
The situation can also be demoralizing. "They're there every day," an anonymous Old Navy employee told a CBS News affiliate in the Bay Area, speaking of shoplifters in the store. "When I'm on the floor walking around I would say at least 12, 14 during the day." In one two-day stretch, the employee said, the store was robbed 22 times.
In a recent study, a team of marketing professors looked at how service employees perceive "customer deviant behaviors," which include minor infractions like incivility and aggression, as well as more serious offenses like shoplifting and fraudulent returns. The researchers found that shoplifting was "by far" the most prevalent and detrimental form of deviant behavior. According to the study, in the presence of a suspected thief the burden of policing often falls to frontline employees, who, depending on company policy, may be expected to guard the store, stand by passively or even assist the thieves as if they were paying customers. These behaviors leave employees feeling frustrated, angry, helpless, targeted, unmotivated and uncomfortable. Allowing shoplifting to continue unimpeded, the authors found, undermines the sense of pride they might otherwise find in their work and the workplace.
Policies that require employees to remain passive in the face of shoplifting can be frustrating. As one employee quoted in the study put it: "You want me to prevent loss, but at the end of the day, if I can't physically stop someone that I know is stealing, essentially, I'm not loss prevention. I'm just, I'm here to just watch it." Another employee said policies preventing action make shoplifting too easy: "It is not fair. They have restrained our powers. They have tied our hands. The criminals have all the rights, and we don't."
City officials are increasingly aware that shoplifting discourages workers and worsens labor conditions. In May, Mayor Eric Adams announced a program to fight retail theft in New York City, reports of which have increased by 77 percent in recent years, up 45 percent between 2021 and 2022 alone. Among the proposals is an "employee support program" meant to train retail workers in "de-escalation tactics, anti-theft tools and security best practices" to help ensure their own safety.
Shoplifting adds pressure to retailers still reeling from Covid-19 and the ongoing pressures of online alternatives. For small shopkeepers, bodegas and mom-and-pops, losses from theft can be devastating to the bottom line. Even large chains like Walmart, Whole Foods, REI and Walgreens have closed or are planning to close major retail locations in cities like Portland, Ore., and San Francisco. While multiple factors are behind the closures, shoplifting is frequently cited as one of them.
In May, Brian Cornell, the chief executive of Target, called theft "a worsening trend that emerged last year," warning of a projected loss from retail shrink, including theft, of $ 500 million more than the previous year. "The problem affects all of us, limiting product availability, creating a less convenient shopping experience and putting our team and guests in harm's way," Cornell said. It can also lead to higher prices for everyone else.
The reason retailers traditionally invest in training store personnel is that they believe employees are critical to creating a positive shopping experience. A store that signals that it expects shoppers to steal the merchandise has the opposite effect.
"From the consumer's perspective, the feeling that everyone is watching you, suspecting you of shoplifting, creates a negative atmosphere," says Angela Y. Lee, a consumer psychologist and professor of marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern. Lee compares the feeling to the way in which many people have long felt racially profiled while shopping. "If you're treated like a potential thief," she says, "you're going to have a bad experience, which will then make you less likely to shop there."
Because retailers continue to struggle with underemployment and employee retention, stores are often more sparsely staffed than they once were, and all the more grim. On a recent shopping excursion in Manhattan, I saw something I'd never seen before: a handwritten sign in the window of a major clothing chain, apologizing for closing for an hour midday because of understaffing.
It's hard not to notice a shift everywhere. Returning to New York City recently by train after an out-of-town trip, I emerged from Penn Station to pick up a few things in a nearby drugstore. When I walked in, the store was nearly empty, the shelves were mostly locked; no one responded when I pressed a button. It was a dispiriting welcome home and an unfortunate way to imagine first-time visitors encountering New York.
Store owners are not the only ones who bear the cost of retail theft. Shoplifting isn't just their problem. We are all paying a price.

Weight Loss Drug Cuts Patients' Risk of Heart Problems, Maker Says: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A clinical trial was the first to demonstrate that a new obesity drug could also improve patients' heart health.
A new obesity drug, Wegovy, slashed the risk of serious heart problems by 20 percent in a large trial, the drug's maker said on Tuesday, a finding that could challenge the perception of weight loss drugs as nothing more than cosmetic medicines and put pressure on insurers to cover them.
The trial was the first to demonstrate that the new class of obesity drugs could bring lasting benefits to heart health for people who were overweight but did not have diabetes.
With obesity affecting 100 million adults in the United States and accounting for nearly $ 150 billion in annual health care spending, the new treatments could help address some of the most significant and costly afflictions in American medicine.
The results "demonstrate the urgent need for patients living with obesity to be offered this effective and safe drug to prevent future disease," said Simon Cork, an obesity expert at Anglia Ruskin University in England who has no ties to the drug.
Many details were missing from the announcement on Tuesday by Wegovy's maker, Novo Nordisk. The company said that the drug reduced the overall risk of heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular deaths by 20 percent. But it did not break out the effects of the drug on each of those outcomes individually.
The company also did not describe how much weight patients lost or provide details on side effects of the drug and how many patients decided to stop taking it. The data has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal; the company said it would present more detailed results at a scientific conference later this year.
Still, the trial included nearly 18,000 adults with previous cardiovascular disease and tracked them for up to five years. It bolstered the idea that obesity drugs can deliver long-term health benefits in addition to helping patients lose weight, experts said, undermining the argument that they are merely vanity drugs with little bearing on patients' underlying health.
That could prompt more insurers to pay for the drug, at least for patients who, like the trial participants, already had evidence of heart disease.
"It's going to make it much harder to deny coverage and not pay for these products for a non-diabetic population," said Craig Garthwaite, a health economist at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. "It's going to make it very difficult to make the argument that this isn't part of an essential health benefit when there are cardiovascular benefits."
Medicare does not cover weight loss medications and some employer insurance plans have refused to pay for them, owing to the view that the drugs are not essential medical remedies. The drug's high list price of $ 1,349 a month puts it out of reach for most whose insurance will not cover it.
Reducing the risk of heart attacks or strokes could not only spare many Americans years of suffering and medical complications but also bring other economic benefits, restoring productivity losses from heart disease and reducing spending on less effective obesity treatments, Dr. Garthwaite said.
Even so, he said, the benefits for patients' heart health are far enough down the road that insurers themselves may not see direct cost savings. If other drugs from the new class of obesity treatment also prove able to reduce cardiovascular disease, he said, that could create competition between products that eventually drives down their prices.
Wegovy is currently approved for chronic weight management in the United States. Novo Nordisk said it would ask regulators in the United States and Europe to clear the drug for additional medical indications as well, but did not say which ones.
Another version of the same drug made by Novo Nordisk, Ozempic, is approved for lowering blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes. A smaller trial found that Ozempic also reduced the risk of heart complications in diabetes patients.
Martin Holst Lange, the company's executive vice president for development, said that the latest trial demonstrated the drug "has the potential to change how obesity is regarded and treated."
Scientists said that it was not clear precisely how the drug cut people's risk of heart complications.
The new class of obesity drugs has been shown to have some direct effects on blood vessels and the heart, including in studies finding that animals given the drugs are better able to survive heart attacks, said Dr. Daniel Drucker, a senior scientist at the Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Toronto who helped identify the hormone that gave rise to the new drugs and been paid consulting or speaking fees by Novo Nordisk.
But they may also indirectly lower the risk of heart disease by reducing body weight, blood pressure or inflammation.
The new class of obesity drugs "has two shots on goal to improve cardiovascular health," he said.
Further details from the new trial will allow researchers to study the relationship between how much weight patients lost and their cardiovascular benefits, potentially making clearer how Wegovy was improving people's heart health.
"It's really the beginning of a new chapter in improving the health of people with obesity," Dr. Drucker said.
Even so, he said that the trial would also help researchers understand the incidence of side effects, especially given the size and duration of the study. Patients have reported nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation and stomach pain, and some have stopped taking the medication because of these effects.
Experts said the trial could also change an approach to obesity that has long emphasized the responsibility of patients for fighting their own weight gains.
"Obesity's not a personal choice -- it's not behavioral, it's not something that people choose," said Dr. Ania Jastreboff, an endocrinologist and obesity-medicine specialist at Yale University who was an investigator on the Wegovy trial and consults for makers of obesity drugs. "Medications like this, we believe, are potentially treating that underlying biology."
The latest results, she said, "underscore the need to treat obesity as we treat any other disease."

For Many of 4,000 Beagles Rescued From Research Facility, Life Is Good: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: When a 2-year-old beagle named Fin was carried out in September from the Envigo breeding and research facility in Cumberland, Va., his exit marked the end of a nearly 60-day operation to rescue almost 4,000 dogs that had been living in highly distressful conditions.
Beagles that were among those kept there were underfed, had fallen ill or were injured, inspections of the research facility found, and some had been euthanized.
Nearly a year later, many of the beagles are thriving in new homes, their new housemates said. They roll on the grass, enjoy long walks and lick birthday cake to celebrate the anniversary of their rescue.
"He was the last one. I can't imagine what that must've felt like for him," said Suzanne Brown-Pelletier, who adopted Fin within weeks of his rescue. To make up for the lost years of love, "I give him all kinds of kisses on his nose and tell him I'm playing the beagle bugle," she said.
Fin, whom Ms. Brown-Pelletier renamed Sir Biscuit of Barkingham (or Biscuit), and thousands of other dogs were released over two months to shelters, rescue organizations, foster owners and adoptive families after federal officials found that the breeding facility had safety violations. The beagles there were hungry, sick, mistreated and, in some cases, had died, and the survivors were headed to testing labs.
After a federal judge approved a plan to remove the dogs in July 2022, several rescue groups and volunteers stepped up to find them homes in an effort that drew attention nationwide. The news even inspired Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry to adopt a beagle named Momma Mia. Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey adopted a dog, Morty, from the facility.
Many others volunteered to open their homes to the rescues as well.
After Alli and Tyler Trent adopted a beagle named Maple, the dog shook uncontrollably in their backyard in Christiansburg, Va. Having lived in a cage, Maple hadn't seen grass or eaten a treat before.
"The grass was very scary for her," Ms. Trent recalled.
Maple also cowered whenever someone approached.
"Nothing was easy," Ms. Trent recalled, "but she just needed some extra patience and time."
'Learning to trust'
Maple found her footing with the Trents "and has learned so much and come so far," said Ms. Trent, 29. The beagle, who is 4, loves sunbathing and belly rubs, munching on crushed ice and, most of all, lounging in her bed.
"She's learning to trust, and she's learning that the only people in her life now are good people that love her so much!" Ms. Trent said.
The Trents' other beagle, Lola, has also provided emotional support for Maple.
Last month, the couple attended a gathering in Wake Forest, N.C., to mark the anniversary of the beagles' rescues. There, Maple reunited with some of her puppies, which had also been adopted. A photo Ms. Trent posted on Facebook showed Maple and the puppies -- which are bigger than their mother now -- and their new owners, camping out together on the grass. Maple wore a bandanna that read, "Envigo survivor."
A few hundred miles up north, in Alexandria, Va., Lauren and Trevor Kellogg have settled in with their 3-year-old beagle, whom they named Nellie because "she was a nervous Nellie," Ms. Kellogg said. The Kelloggs, who had engaged in activism against animal testing and Envigo, adopted her within 24 hours of taking her home to foster last year.
"We wanted to take the dog that needed the most help," Ms. Kellogg said.
Envigo, which was acquired in 2021 by Inotiv and worked with the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, said in a statement last year that it had agreed to the transfer of the beagles. The company said on its website that it was breeding "healthy, well-socialized animals" that were sold for research. The company also said that it closed the site in Cumberland last year.
Adapting to their new lives
Ms. Kellogg said it was "a very hard transition" for their new companion. Nellie did not like to leave her crate, had her tail pointed downward and spooked easily in their Washington, D.C., condo.
"The first couple of months was teaching her that not everything was scary," Ms. Kellogg said.
Gradually, Nellie warmed up to her new family and sat with them on the couch. After the couple moved into a house with a backyard, "we saw her really improve," Ms. Kellogg said.
These days, when Nellie walks with the couple's other beagle rescue, Beesly, Nellie's tail points up, and she happily wags it.
Nellie is a "very sweet, very loving dog. You hear a lot of similar stories with these dogs, coming into their own their own way," Ms. Kellogg said.
In North Yarmouth, Maine, Sir Biscuit adjusted to his new life outside a cage with the help of Ms. Brown-Pelletier's other dogs, Albert and Winston, both spaniels.
When the family first met Biscuit, he was drooling from anxiety and "pancaking," or lying flat on the ground, out of fear. Ms. Brown-Pelletier, 60, noticed how Biscuit lifted his feet up with curiosity as he touched new textures around the house. "His little paws had never touched anything other than a metal cage," she said, and "he didn't know what a toy was."
Albert, a 5-year-old English springer spaniel, modeled bravery for Biscuit and showed him how to play. Now, anything Albert does, Biscuit wants to do, Ms. Brown-Pelletier said.
"He has a best friend," she said of the two, who share toys.
At 26 pounds, having gained at least five since he was in the facility, Biscuit has the stamina for long walks, while being small enough to be a lap dog. "His favorite place is my lap, and I love that," Ms. Brown-Pelletier said.
Biscuit is the first dog Ms. Brown-Pelletier has ever rescued, and she swears he thanks her daily with his big, expressive brown eyes. "I am telling you it is the way to go," she said.
Becoming a rescue parent
As Adam Parascandola, vice president of the animal rescue team for the Humane Society of the United States, worked on helping place the beagles that were rescued from the Envigo facility, he realized: "It just felt right to take one of them in."
Mr. Parascandola and his wife, Stephanie Prete, adopted a 12-week-old male puppy that they named Enzo. The dog now lives in Winlock, Wash., and while he's still working on navigating how to get on the couch, Enzo has blossomed into being very social and happy-go-lucky.
Every dog and its circumstances are different, said Mr. Parascandola, and dogs that come from rescue situations will bring varying degrees of ability and comfort.
"People need to be aware of their ability and tolerance to deal with socializing dogs," he said, particularly dogs that have had little contact with humans or other animals.
Shelters and rescue organizations are experienced in placing animals with the appropriate new family, Mr. Parascandola said. He recommends that prospective owners share their expectations for the new pet with adoption centers, so they can help facilitate the best lifestyle fit.
Puppies may be more unpredictable and require additional flexibility, whereas adult dogs will demonstrate their basic personality and needs. New owners can look forward to seeing transitions and growth, Mr. Parascandola said.
Above all, patience is key. "Let the dog take the lead," he said, "on what they're ready for."

When a 2-year-old beagle named Fin was carried out in September from the Envigo breeding and research facility in Cumberland, Virginia, his exit marked the end of a nearly 60-day operation to rescue almost 4,000 dogs that had been living in highly distressful conditions.
Beagles that were among those kept there were underfed, had fallen ill or were injured, inspections of the research facility found, and some had been euthanized.
Nearly a year later, many of the beagles are thriving in new homes, their new housemates said. They roll on the grass, enjoy long walks and lick birthday cake to celebrate the anniversary of their rescue.
“He was the last one. I can’t imagine what that must’ve felt like for him,” said Suzanne Brown-Pelletier, who adopted Fin within weeks of his rescue. To make up for the lost years of love, “I give him all kinds of kisses on his nose and tell him I’m playing the beagle bugle,” she said.
Fin, whom Brown-Pelletier renamed Sir Biscuit of Barkingham (or Biscuit), and thousands of other dogs were released over two months to shelters, rescue organizations, foster owners and adoptive families after federal officials found that the breeding facility had safety violations. The beagles there were hungry, sick, mistreated and, in some cases, had died, and the survivors were headed to testing labs.
After a federal judge approved a plan to remove the dogs in July 2022, several rescue groups and volunteers stepped up to find them homes in an effort that drew attention nationwide. The news even inspired Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry to adopt a beagle named Momma Mia. Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey adopted a dog, Morty, from the facility.
Many others volunteered to open their homes to the rescues as well.
After Alli and Tyler Trent adopted a beagle named Maple, the dog shook uncontrollably in their backyard in Christiansburg, Virginia. Having lived in a cage, Maple hadn’t seen grass or eaten a treat before.
“The grass was very scary for her,” Alli Trent recalled.
Maple also cowered whenever someone approached.
“Nothing was easy,” she recalled, “but she just needed some extra patience and time.”
‘Learning to Trust’
Maple found her footing with the Trents “and has learned so much and come so far,” said Alli Trent, 29. The beagle, who is 4, loves sunbathing and belly rubs, munching on crushed ice and, most of all, lounging in her bed.
“She’s learning to trust, and she’s learning that the only people in her life now are good people that love her so much!” she said.
The Trents’ other beagle, Lola, has also provided emotional support for Maple.
Last month, the couple attended a gathering in Wake Forest, North Carolina, to mark the anniversary of the beagles’ rescues. There, Maple reunited with some of her puppies, which had also been adopted. A photo Alli Trent posted on Facebook showed Maple and the puppies — which are bigger than their mother now — and their new owners, camping out together on the grass. Maple wore a bandanna that read, “Envigo survivor.”
A few hundred miles up north, in Alexandria, Virginia, Lauren and Trevor Kellogg have settled in with their 3-year-old beagle, whom they named Nellie because “she was a nervous Nellie,” Lauren Kellogg said. The Kelloggs, who had engaged in activism against animal testing and Envigo, adopted her within 24 hours of taking her home to foster last year.
“We wanted to take the dog that needed the most help,” she said.
Envigo, which was acquired in 2021 by Inotiv and worked with the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, said in a statement last year that it had agreed to the transfer of the beagles. The company said on its website that it was breeding “healthy, well-socialized animals” that were sold for research. The company also said that it closed the site in Cumberland last year.
Adapting to Their New Lives
Lauren Kellogg said it was “a very hard transition” for their new companion. Nellie did not like to leave her crate, had her tail pointed downward and spooked easily in their Washington, D.C., condo.
“The first couple of months was teaching her that not everything was scary,” Kellogg said.
Gradually, Nellie warmed up to her new family and sat with them on the couch. After the couple moved into a house with a backyard, “we saw her really improve,” Kellogg said.
These days, when Nellie walks with the couple’s other beagle rescue, Beesly, Nellie’s tail points up, and she happily wags it.
Nellie is a “very sweet, very loving dog. You hear a lot of similar stories with these dogs, coming into their own their own way,” Kellogg said.
In North Yarmouth, Maine, Sir Biscuit adjusted to his new life outside a cage with the help of Brown-Pelletier’s other dogs, Albert and Winston, both spaniels.
When the family first met Biscuit, he was drooling from anxiety and “pancaking,” or lying flat on the ground, out of fear. Brown-Pelletier, 60, noticed how Biscuit lifted his feet up with curiosity as he touched new textures around the house. “His little paws had never touched anything other than a metal cage,” she said, and “he didn’t know what a toy was.”
Albert, a 5-year-old English springer spaniel, modeled bravery for Biscuit and showed him how to play. Now, anything Albert does, Biscuit wants to do, Brown-Pelletier said.
“He has a best friend,” she said of the two, who share toys.
At 26 pounds, having gained at least 5 since he was in the facility, Biscuit has the stamina for long walks, while being small enough to be a lap dog. “His favorite place is my lap, and I love that,” Brown-Pelletier said.
Biscuit is the first dog Brown-Pelletier has ever rescued, and she swears he thanks her daily with his big, expressive brown eyes. “I am telling you it is the way to go,” she said.
Becoming a Rescue Parent
As Adam Parascandola, vice president of the animal rescue team for the Humane Society of the United States, worked on helping place the beagles rescued from the Envigo facility, he realized: “It just felt right to take one of them in.”
Parascandola and his wife, Stephanie Prete, adopted a 12-week-old male puppy at that they named Enzo. The dog now lives in Winlock, Washington, and while he’s still working on navigating how to get on the couch, Enzo has blossomed into being very social and happy-go-lucky.
Every dog and its circumstances are different, said Parascandola, and dogs that come from rescue situations will bring varying degrees of ability and comfort.
“People need to be aware of their ability and tolerance to deal with socializing dogs,” he said, particularly dogs that have had little contact with humans or other animals.
Shelters and rescue organizations are experienced in placing animals with the appropriate new family, Parascandola said. He recommends that prospective owners share their expectations for the new pet with adoption centers, so they can help facilitate the best lifestyle fit.
Puppies may be more unpredictable and require additional flexibility, whereas adult dogs will demonstrate their basic personality and needs. New owners can look forward to seeing transitions and growth, Parascandola said.
Above all, patience is key. “Let the dog take the lead,” he said, “on what they’re ready for.”

Analyst Who Was 1st to Slash U.S. Long-Term Credit Rating Feels Vindicated: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Nikola Swann played a key role at S&P when the agency became the first to strip America of its top ranking in 2011.
When Nikola Swann heard that Fitch Ratings had removed the United States from its list of risk-free borrowers this week, he felt a sense of satisfaction.
"It was vindicating," he says.
More than a decade ago, Swann played a key role in a similar decision: He was Standard & Poor's primary analyst for its sovereign credit rating on the United States when the agency became the first ever to downgrade the nation's long-term credit rating amid a debt ceiling standoff in 2011.
At the time, the move was controversial, in part because the Treasury Department pointed out that S&P had overstated the federal debt by about $ 2 trillion. Bloomberg called the reasons for the downgrade "fundamentally political" in 2011, while others argued that it appropriately reflected a worsening debt crisis.
Both a decade ago and this week, partisan politics were cited as one reason for the downgrade. S&P cited "the gulf between the political parties." Fitch, which made the call two months after the United States narrowly avoided defaulting on its debt, cited "the repeated debt-limit political standoffs and last-minute resolutions."
DealBook asked Swann over email about what had changed since S&P's downgrade, and what had not. The interview has been edited and condensed.
What did you make of the timing? Would it have been better to cut the U.S. credit rating during the debt ceiling debate?
The recurring debt-ceiling brinkmanship highlights the structural weaknesses in U.S. fiscal governance -- so the more acrimonious they are and the closer they come to the cash-flow precipice. The credit rating agency's job is to analyze all relevant information, with the two aforementioned variables among the more important indicators of the seriousness with which Washington treats U.S. federal payment obligations. It is natural to update your assessment soon after the latest debt-ceiling data point.
Does it make sense to downgrade the United States if you don't downgrade all the other AAA rated countries? After all, if the United States sneezes, so do all these other countries, right?
Many countries that were rated AAA in 2011 have since been downgraded by one or more credit rating agencies; examples include the U.K., France and Canada. The U.S. remains the world's most influential economy, but the strength of a country's economy, while important, is only part of a sovereign rating assessment. Fundamentally, a sovereign credit rating is not an opinion on the country's economy, per se, but on the likelihood that holders of the government's debt will be paid on time, in full, and unconditionally.
A strong economy helps enormously, but dysfunctional fiscal governance can outweigh that strength. The remaining AAA countries have stronger track records than the U.S. when it comes to fiscal governance.
When you downgraded the United States in 2011, were you surprised the other ratings agencies didn't follow suit?
I expected the others to follow, eventually. It took longer than I expected, but it is happening.
S&P's model had a mathematical error, which the U.S. Treasury pointed out. Why didn't you change it?
S&P's unprecedented 2011 downgrade of its U.S. sovereign credit rating was no error. The weaknesses we then pointed to, compared to AAA countries, in terms of Washington's ability to build bipartisan consensus on key policy questions in a timely manner, especially regarding fiscal management, have only worsened since. The same is true of U.S. fiscal outcomes.
Do you see a day when the U.S. rating goes back up?
That will happen when the U.S. significantly shrinks its structural fiscal deficit, putting government debt on a multiyear downward trajectory in terms of G.D.P., and more generally develops a track record for credible, medium-term fiscal discipline underpinned by multiparty political consensus -- inasmuch as, by then, the U.S. economy remains strong and the U.S. dollar remains among the world's most important currencies. -- Sarah Kessler
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Donald Trump was indicted -- again. The former president was charged in connection with trying to overturn the 2020 election, adding to a growing list of legal charges against him. Trump pleaded not guilty in a Washington court appearance on Thursday and remains the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination next year.
Disney's Robert Iger taps former lieutenants for advice. The C.E.O. of the media giant brought back two former executives once touted as potential successors: Kevin Mayer, the former head of M.&A., and Tom Staggs, the ex-financial chief, will advise Disney on what the company should do with its legacy TV businesses.
Tom Brady becomes the latest North American star to invest in the other football. The N.F.L. legend took a minority stake in Birmingham City, the English soccer team, joining the likes of the Hollywood actors Ryan Reynolds, Rob McElhenney and Michael B. Jordan, and the basketball player LeBron James to invest in the sport.
Lessons from C.E.O. Swift
Taylor Swift's Eras Tour is expected to soon pass $ 1 billion in revenue, a milestone that often signifies a company's transition from start-up to global competitor. Ms. Swift is undoubtedly, if not quite literally, the C.E.O. of that tour, in addition to a powerful enterprise that includes high streaming numbers and huge merchandise sales.
"She's the C.E.O. of one of the biggest direct-to-consumer brands on the planet," said Nathan Hubbard, the former C.E.O. of Ticketmaster and current chief of the music company Firebird. (By comparison, the direct-to-consumer brand Warby Parker reported about $ 600 million in revenue this year.)
Mr. Hubbard called Ms. Swift "Steve Jobs-ian" in her focus on detail and end-user customer experience. Here's what else she may have in common with corporate titans.
She has full control over her brand. Beyond writing, singing and performing her own songs, she has a sharp understanding of her customers, said Manisha Thakor, a financial wellness expert.
Thakor likened Ms. Swift to Home Depot's founders, Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank. "They were walking the aisles of the stores, they were talking to customers," she said, indicating that Ms. Swift had responded to feedback in a similar way when she dropped a new version of the song "Snow on the Beach," after fans had complained that the song's guest artist, Lana Del Rey, wasn't featured enough.
The remake's title: "Snow on the Beach (featuring more Lana Del Rey)."
She understands the importance of employee recognition. Ms. Swift recently reportedly gifted "life changing" $ 100,000 bonuses to truck drivers who worked on her tour, which is about 10 times the norm. She's also included truck drivers' names in the credits of her Netflix documentary on the last tour.
"Recognition, like money, like power, is not evenly distributed," said Loran Nordgren, a management professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. "Most people in any company know it only fleetingly and are hungry for it."
Her leadership style may also come with risks. Ms. Swift has created such a powerful brand for herself that she risks being called inauthentic if her actions stray from that mirage. One example of the pitfall: the backlash that Salesforce's Marc Benioff received when he laid off employees after espousing the company's familial "Ohana" culture.
There's also potential for overexposure, a challenge Ms. Thakor said was exemplified by Jack Welch. "We all hung on every single word during his G.E. years," she said. But when he left, and created concepts like the Jack Welch Management Institute, "we got fatigued by them, like we just didn't want to hear from him anymore," Ms. Thakor said.
We will definitely be hearing from Ms. Swift, at least until 2024. She announced new concert dates this week.
How an unexpected blockbuster hacked the box office
"Barbenheimer" isn't the only surprise hit at the box office: One of the biggest movies of the summer is a small-budget thriller about anti-child trafficking heroics that has been praised by both mainstream conservatives and the far-right.
"Sound of Freedom" has grossed more than $ 155 million domestically, beating rivals with much bigger budgets, like "Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One." Controversy about the film's content, which critics say appeals to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory about a global cabal of pedophiles, very likely helped stir interest. But a novel promotion system has also played a role.
The movie's distributor, Angel Studios, took "word of mouth" marketing to a new level. It deployed a system called Pay It Forward to help bolster awareness. Here's how it works: At the end of the movie, audiences are urged by its star, Jim Caviezel, to tell others to see the movie to spread its message.
They're also shown a QR code that leads to a website where audiences can buy additional tickets for strangers -- and, the hope goes, continue the cycle.
Angel has used Pay It Forward before, including for the hit Jesus-focused streaming series "The Chosen." The distributor first tested the model for theatrical releases this year with the overtly religious movie, "His Only Son," which grossed $ 12.2 million worldwide.
But the system hit new levels of success with "Sound of Freedom," according to Brandon Purdie, Angel's head of theatrical distribution. (He declined to specify how many tickets were sold via Pay It Forward, saying only that it was "significant.")
The success of Pay It Forward came into doubt after reports on social media claimed that there were empty seats in supposedly sold-out showings of "Sound of Freedom." But Pay It Forward doesn't buy tickets before someone has claimed them. Instead, someone who wants to see the movie visits the Angel website and requests a coupon code that they can use when buying a ticket for a specific showing from a booking site like Fandango.
Brock Bagby, the executive vice president and chief content and development officer of B&B Theaters, which has 55 theaters, mostly in the Midwest, says the movie has drawn crowds.
He said that B&B audited its showings and couldn't find any instances of phantom tickets, and that it hadn't seen any drop in concession sales per ticket sold -- an important metric, given that cinemas collect more profit from selling popcorn and drinks than from seats alone. "There are actual humans in the seats," Mr. Bagby said.
It's unclear whether other movies can adopt this model. Paul Dergarabedian, a senior Comscore analyst, said that more studios could seek to adopt the marketing strategy, since it both gets the word out about a movie and can lead to more ticket sales.
But according to Mr. Bagby, such a system requires the right kind of movie and message: "Pay It Forward needs a message that people feel strongly about," he said.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.

'Mild-Mannered' but Firm, Jurist Allays Early Doubts: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Judge Aileen M. Cannon, a previously obscure Trump judicial appointee, has been viewed with incredulity by much of the legal establishment ever since she issued a ruling temporarily halting the federal investigation into the former president's handling of classified documents. After a conservative appeals court slapped her down, Democrats said she was either incompetent or some kind of black-robed Trojan horse for the MAGA movement.
On Friday morning, that view began to change.
In a ruling that set a start date for the documents trial on May 20, 2024 -- splitting the difference between prosecutors who wanted the trial to begin in December and a Trump team that pushed for a date after next year's election -- Judge Cannon showed, for now, that she is the jurist her defenders have described: a level-headed and mostly ordinary conservative judge not beholden to the man who appointed her.
"The notion that she's inexperienced is misplaced and ignores her exceptional résumé before taking the bench," said Jesse Panuccio, a prominent Florida defense lawyer who served in the Trump administration as acting associate attorney general. "It also penalizes her for being a mild-mannered woman. They wouldn't be saying this if she was a big-personality male."
There were hints of that jurist earlier in the week when Judge Cannon conducted a brisk pretrial conference at the federal courthouse in Fort Pierce, Fla., to hear arguments about the timing of the trial. Over two hours, she left little doubt as to whose courtroom it was.
"That's not my question," she snapped at one of the lawyers for former President Donald J. Trump for offering a rambling rejoinder to one of her queries. Attentive to the point of reminding each side what the other had said earlier, she frequently pushed for more specifics, asking the Trump team at one point, "Can you put more meat on the bones to that?" At another moment she asked the Trump side to "articulate precisely" the "novel questions" they had said should delay the trial.
Judge Cannon appeared sympathetic to the Trump team's argument that the classified documents presented complex issues that might require more preparation time, but she also nodded when prosecutors argued that Mr. Trump should not be treated differently from any other citizen.
Most of all, Judge Cannon made clear her preference that the trial be put on the docket sooner rather than later. "I don't want to have delays," she warned the defense team, then concluded by promising to issue a ruling "promptly." Less than 72 hours later, she set the May trial date, which falls two months before the Republican National Convention, when Mr. Trump, the current Republican front-runner, could be at the start of a general election campaign.
The scrutiny is hardly over for Judge Cannon's conduct overseeing the most consequential trial in at least a generation, one in which prosecutors have charged a former president with federal crimes related to the illegal retention of classified documents. But at this point some veterans of the federal bar say that the Democratic hand-wringing over Judge Cannon's initial ruling, soundly rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, will prove to be unwarranted.
"Especially given that Judge Cannon is relatively new to the federal bench, I fully expect that she was chastened by the 11th Circuit's reversal," said J. Michael Luttig, a former judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.
Several in the Florida legal community who know Judge Cannon have taken exception to assertions that she is a dunce, a Trump stealth warrior or both.
One of them, a veteran federal prosecutor, suggested that Judge Cannon was merely being "hyper-cautious" in appointing a special master to review the documents at issue in the Trump case. Another, a longtime defense attorney in the state, insisted that Judge Cannon would have issued the same ruling had the former president been a Democrat.
A close inspection of Judge Cannon's trajectory, including interviews with friends, former classmates and colleagues, reveals a diligent conservative achiever who seemed destined for success but perhaps ill-equipped for the notoriety that has now overtaken her.
"There are some judges who might see the Trump case as a way to make their name," Mr. Panuccio said. "Knowing her, I can't imagine her saying, 'I hope the assignment wheel turns it to me."'
High school in Coconut Grove
In an advertisement that ran in her high school senior class yearbook, the parents of the future judge proudly declared, "Look out world. Here comes Aileen!" For most of her professional life, however, Aileen Mercedes Cannon seemed laboratory-designed to attract as little attention as possible.
At the time of her nomination in May 2020, Ms. Cannon, then 39, was one of hundreds of assistant U.S. attorneys working in Florida's Southern District. She had published no legal essays, given no speeches, worked for no elected officials. Like many federal prosecutors working cases involving drug traffickers and violent criminals, Ms. Cannon avoided social media.
A registered Republican who had contributed $ 100 to the 2018 campaign of Gov. Ron DeSantis, she had otherwise engaged in no known political activity. Apart from a few fanciful essays she had written during her college years for El Nuevo Herald, the independent Spanish-language sister paper to The Miami Herald, Ms. Cannon's interactions with the media had consisted of a single interview she and her husband had given to a wedding website in 2009, when they disclosed that his proposal to her was briefly interrupted by the sighting of a turtle.
During her opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee in an otherwise perfunctory nomination hearing on July 29, 2020, Ms. Cannon volunteered information about a motivating force in her life. She spoke of her mother, Mercedes Cubas, "who at the age of 7 had to flee the oppressive Castro regime in search of freedom and security," and also her mother's parents, who "were forced to leave everything they had worked so hard to build in Cuba to build a life here in the United States."
Those who know Judge Cannon say that her Cuban-exile heritage undergirds her patriotism and conservative values. Still, that origin tale falls somewhat short of hardscrabble.
Judge Cannon's mother arrived in Miami from Havana in 1960, according to Florida records, on a Pan American flight and listed as her new place of residence the stately Miami Colonial Hotel. Her father, Judge Cannon's grandfather, Jose Manuel Cubas, had co-owned with his brother a successful Havana-based advertising firm, Siboney, that they soon re-established in Puerto Rico, with offices to follow throughout Latin America and the U.S. Its client list would include Colgate-Palmolive, Kellogg and Red Lobster.
To the extent that there was tragedy in Ms. Cannon's life, it occurred on the side of her father, Michael Cannon, an Indiana-bred advertising executive who worked at Siboney and married Ms. Cubas in 1978, three years before Ms. Cannon was born in Colombia, where her father was working for Siboney at the time. In 1984, Mr. Cannon's father and Judge Cannon's grandfather, William P. Cannon, a U.S. Navy veteran, was shot and killed in his home by his son-in-law. (Aileen Cannon was 3 at the time.)
Ms. Cannon's parents divorced in 1997, her junior year at Ransom Everglades Upper School, a private college preparatory institution in the lush Miami suburb of Coconut Grove. On a campus that did not disqualify high achievers from cool-kid status, classmates remember Ms. Cannon as being part of the in crowd: studious and prone to taking a seat at the front of the classroom in the manner of a teacher's pet, while also regularly cavorting with the flashiest girls on campus. Still, she was not among the two voted by her graduating class of about 130 as "most likely to succeed," and three classmates told The New York Times in recent weeks that they never expected her to be in national headlines.
In 1999, Ms. Cannon enrolled at Duke University, where she pledged the Delta Delta Delta sorority while maintaining the reputation of a workhorse. From there, she entered the University of Michigan Law School, graduated magna cum laude in 2007, and had a clerkship a year later in Des Moines with Steven M. Colloton, a conservative judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. In 2009, she moved to Washington and spent three years as a litigation associate in the demanding law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.
At Ransom Everglades, Ms. Cannon extolled a Reagan-esque faith in the free market, just as she did at Duke, according to classmates at both schools. She joined the conservative Federalist Society at Michigan Law, a decision that reflected a desire to find community on an otherwise liberal campus rather than a careerist calculation, two people who knew her said. She secured the clerkship with Judge Colloton based on her productivity rather than her conservative bona fides, according to Ryan Koopmans, a lawyer who clerked for the judge the year before Ms. Cannon.
"He wants clerks like her who would do the work and do it well," Mr. Koopmans said. "I met with her the day she interviewed with Judge Colloton, and I don't recall even knowing her politics."
By the time she returned to Florida in 2013 to work as an assistant U.S. attorney in the state's Southern District, Ms. Cannon was widely viewed as a solid if unspectacular litigant. First in the major crimes division and later in the appellate division, colleagues remember her as "bookish," "thorough" and "courteous," capable of handling complicated cases while not attempting to hog credit for the outcome. Ms. Cannon was now married to a restaurant executive, Josh Lorence, a mother to two young children and not regarded as an ambitious climber in South Florida's legal circles.
Still, after a seat became vacant on the U.S. District Court for Florida's Southern District in the summer of 2017, word eventually reached both the office of Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and the Trump White House Counsel's Office -- exactly how, no one seems to remember -- that a certain prospective replacement checked a number of boxes. The lawyer in question was female. She was young. She was of Cuban heritage. She was conservative. She had a top-tier law school pedigree. She possessed unimpeachable legal credentials and no skeletons in her closet, nor even the remotest paper trail.
There was an additional benefit to Ms. Cannon, according to two people familiar with the judicial nominations process during the Trump era: She and her husband lived in Vero Beach, a short commute to the mausoleum-like courthouse in Fort Pierce that had recently been vacated by Judge Robin L. Rosenberg. It was a somewhat scruffy outpost that other potential nominees were reluctant to relocate to.
In June 2019, Mr. Rubio's staff contacted Ms. Cannon and urged her to apply for the vacant seat. She did so that month. On Nov. 12, 2020, five days after The Associated Press declared that Mr. Trump had been defeated by Joseph R. Biden Jr., Judge Cannon was confirmed by a vote of 56 to 21. Fittingly, her ascent received almost no notice.
Her history on the bench
Judge Cannon's ruling in September -- when she decreed that a special master would decide which, if any, of the government documents seized at Mr. Trump's private club could be perused by Justice Department officials -- has prompted the parsing of her history on the bench for portents.
But as is the case with most jurists, her rulings offer a mixed narrative. Last year, she sentenced Paul Hoeffer, who had pleaded guilty after placing threatening phone calls to prominent Democrats to 18 months in prison, less than half of what federal prosecutors had recommended. Mr. Hoeffer's calls had included one to former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom he vowed to behead.
That same year, Judge Cannon also awarded a lighter sentence than requested by prosecutors to a three-time felon who had thrown a chair at a federal officer during a trial while threatening to kill him. In April, Judge Cannon denied a motion by a former Florida Republican congressman, David Rivera, to vacate a $ 456,000 fine he was ordered to pay for violating Federal Election Commission guidelines. Mr. Rivera has appealed her decision to the 11th Circuit.
In interviews, three Florida lawyers who have tried cases before Judge Cannon described her as even-handed, soft-spoken but firm, and well prepared. A different question, they acknowledged, is whether she is up to officiating a first-of-its-kind criminal case that could very well make the O.J. Simpson murder trial resemble a bird-watching convention.
One of the Florida lawyers, Jeffrey Garland, who is based in Fort Pierce, noted that the area's conservative jury pool gives Mr. Trump a decided advantage but that Judge Cannon would still be accorded the leeway to steer them. "In federal court, the judge is going to give them the laws to follow," Mr. Garland said. "And what she gives them is very likely going to strongly influence the outcome of the jury's fact-finding."
To those who have long known her, such as Alejandro Miyar, a Miami-based lawyer and former Obama administration official who graduated with Judge Cannon from Ransom Everglades, being up to the task does not mean that she is likely to relish her moment as the center of attention.
"I can't think of any world in which she would want to make this case about her," he said.

Hong Kong to Rule on Protest Song Ban: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The government wants to prohibit "Glory to Hong Kong," saying it defames China's national anthem, in a case that could force Google to restrict access to the song.
A Hong Kong judge said on Friday that he would rule next week on a government request to ban a popular pro-democracy song from the internet, in a case that could force Google and other companies to restrict access to the song.
At issue is "Glory to Hong Kong," which was the anthem of the 2019 protests that ended with Beijing taking tighter control over Hong Kong. The authorities argue that the song is an insult to China's national anthem and could make people believe that Hong Kong is an independent nation. The government has banned it from schools and lashed out when it was played, apparently by mistake, at sports competitions.
On Friday Judge Anthony Chan, after hearing three hours of legal arguments, said he would issue his decision next Friday. The government is seeking an injunction to prohibit the publication or distribution online of "Glory to Hong Kong." Anyone violating the injunction could face prison for contempt of court.
Tech companies are watching the case closely because it has raised the specter of more government control of online speech in Hong Kong.
"The business community should take notice -- the courts won't be able to protect them as long as the Hong Kong government can plausibly claim that national security interests are in play," said Thomas E. Kellogg, the executive director of the Center for Asian Law at Georgetown University.
Google has resisted the government's public requests that "Glory to Hong Kong" not show up in search results or on its sibling service, YouTube. But that could change if a court ordered it to abide by the request. Like most tech companies, Google has a policy of removing or restricting access to material that is deemed illegal by a court in certain countries or places.
Google, which is owned by Alphabet, said it would not comment on the case, as did Meta, the parent company of Facebook. Google and Facebook established offices in Hong Kong over a decade ago, and today each has up to several hundred employees in the city. Apple did not respond to requests for comment.
The authorities in Hong Kong have increasingly cracked down on what they consider dissent and threats to national security, targeting individuals with arrests, bounties and prosecution.
At the same time, the government is working to pass legislation by early next year that would target what it considered subversive content and close "internet loopholes," a move that could have more far-reaching consequences and codify the ban into law.
Hong Kong has long attracted foreign businesses seeking access and proximity to China, away from its censorship controls. It has been the only Chinese territory with unfettered access to services such as Google and Facebook, which pulled out of China years ago.
When Google refused a request to remove the song in December, Hong Kong's security chief called the company's decision "unthinkable."
In court on Friday, Benjamin Yu, a lawyer for the government arguing why the song should be banned, said it had been used to "stir up emotions." He pointed to the arrest of a harmonica player who had played the song outside the British Consulate when mourning the death of Queen Elizabeth II last year.
Abraham Chan, a lawyer acting as friend of the court to present opposing arguments, said banning the song because of national security could disrupt the free flow of information.
"You can't simply say, 'Don't worry about the chilling effects,"' he said.
The Hong Kong authorities have arrested more than 250 people under an expansive national security law that Beijing imposed on the city in 2020, aimed at stamping out opposition to the ruling Communist Party.
In contrast to "slow-grinding" criminal cases against individuals, an injunction could give the government a quick path to restricting content on online platforms, said Kevin Yam, a legal researcher and former Hong Kong lawyer based in Melbourne.
No company or individual was named as a direct defendant in the government's injunction application, which included 32 links to "Glory to Hong Kong" on YouTube.
But many fear that a court injunction against "Glory to Hong Kong" could be a step toward more official control over the internet in Hong Kong, where the internet remains mostly free of censorship despite Beijing's heavier hand in governing the territory.
American tech companies like Facebook and Twitter were blocked from mainland China in 2009. A year later, Google shut down its China services and rerouted users to its search engine in Hong Kong, then a bastion of political freedom on Chinese soil.
Since the national security law was put in place, requests to tech companies by the Hong Kong authorities to remove content on the internet have soared.

An Untested Judge in the Trump Documents Case

FORT PIERCE, Fla. — Judge Aileen Cannon, a previously obscure Trump judicial appointee, has been viewed with incredulity by much of the legal establishment ever since she issued a ruling temporarily halting the federal investigation into the former president’s handling of classified documents. After a conservative appeals court slapped her down, Democrats said she was either incompetent or some kind of black-robed Trojan horse for the MAGA movement.
On Friday morning, that view began to change.
In a ruling that set a start date for the documents trial on May 20, 2024 — splitting the difference between prosecutors who wanted the trial to begin in December and a Trump team that pushed for a date after next year’s election — Cannon showed, for now, that she is the jurist her defenders have described: a levelheaded and mostly ordinary conservative judge not beholden to the man who appointed her.
“The notion that she’s inexperienced is misplaced and ignores her exceptional resume before taking the bench,” said Jesse Panuccio, a prominent Florida defense lawyer who served in the Trump administration as acting associate attorney general. “It also penalizes her for being a mild-mannered woman. They wouldn’t be saying this if she was a big-personality male.”
There were hints of that jurist earlier in the week when Cannon conducted a brisk pretrial conference at the federal courthouse in Fort Pierce, Florida, to hear arguments about the timing of the trial. Over two hours, she left little doubt as to whose courtroom it was.
“That’s not my question,” she snapped at one of the lawyers for former President Donald Trump for offering a rambling rejoinder to one of her queries. Attentive to the point of reminding each side what the other had said earlier, she frequently pushed for more specifics, asking the Trump team at one point, “Can you put more meat on the bones to that?” At another moment, she asked the Trump side to “articulate precisely” the “novel questions” they had said should delay the trial.
Cannon appeared sympathetic to the Trump team’s argument that the classified documents presented complex issues that might require more preparation time, but she also nodded when prosecutors argued that Trump should not be treated differently from any other citizen.
Most of all, Cannon made clear her preference that the trial be put on the docket sooner rather than later. “I don’t want to have delays,” she warned the defense team, then concluded by promising to issue a ruling “promptly.” Less than 72 hours later, she set the May trial date, which falls two months before the Republican National Convention, when Trump, the current Republican front-runner, could be at the start of a general election campaign.
The scrutiny is hardly over for Cannon’s conduct overseeing the most consequential trial in at least a generation, one in which prosecutors have charged a former president with federal crimes related to the illegal retention of classified documents. But at this point, some veterans of the federal bar say that the Democratic hand-wringing over Cannon’s initial ruling, soundly rejected by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, will prove to be unwarranted.
“Especially given that Judge Cannon is relatively new to the federal bench, I fully expect that she was chastened by the 11th Circuit’s reversal,” said J. Michael Luttig, a former judge for the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Several in the Florida legal community who know Cannon have taken exception to assertions that she is a dunce, a Trump stealth warrior or both.
One of them, a veteran federal prosecutor, suggested that Cannon was merely being “hypercautious” in appointing a special master to review the documents at issue in the Trump case. Another, a longtime defense attorney in the state, insisted that Cannon would have issued the same ruling had the former president been a Democrat.
A close inspection of Cannon’s trajectory, including interviews with friends, former classmates and colleagues, reveals a diligent conservative achiever who seemed destined for success but perhaps ill-equipped for the notoriety that has now overtaken her.
“There are some judges who might see the Trump case as a way to make their name,” Panuccio said. “Knowing her, I can’t imagine her saying, ‘I hope the assignment wheel turns it to me.’”
High School in Coconut Grove
In an advertisement that ran in her high school senior class yearbook, the parents of the future judge proudly declared, “Look out world. Here comes Aileen!” For most of her professional life, however, Aileen Mercedes Cannon seemed laboratory-designed to attract as little attention as possible.
At the time of her nomination in May 2020, Cannon, then 39, was one of hundreds of assistant U.S. attorneys working in Florida’s Southern District. She had published no legal essays, given no speeches, worked for no elected officials. Like many federal prosecutors working cases involving drug traffickers and violent criminals, Cannon avoided social media.
A registered Republican who had contributed $100 to the 2018 campaign of Gov. Ron DeSantis, she had otherwise engaged in no known political activity. Apart from a few fanciful essays she had written during her college years for El Nuevo Herald , the independent Spanish-language sister paper to The Miami Herald, Cannon’s interactions with the media had consisted of a single interview she and her husband had given to a wedding website in 2009, when they disclosed that his proposal to her was briefly interrupted by the sighting of a turtle.
During her opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee in an otherwise perfunctory nomination hearing on July 29, 2020, Cannon volunteered information about a motivating force in her life. She spoke of her mother, Mercedes Cubas, “who at the age of 7 had to flee the oppressive Castro regime in search of freedom and security,” and also her mother’s parents, who “were forced to leave everything they had worked so hard to build in Cuba to build a life here in the United States.”
Those who know Cannon say that her Cuban-exile heritage undergirds her patriotism and conservative values. Still, that origin tale falls somewhat short of hardscrabble.
Cannon’s mother arrived in Miami from Havana in 1960, according to Florida records, on a Pan American flight and listed as her new place of residence the stately Miami Colonial Hotel. Her father, Cannon’s grandfather, Jose Manuel Cubas, had co-owned with his brother a successful Havana-based advertising firm, Siboney, that they soon reestablished in Puerto Rico, with offices to follow throughout Latin America and the U.S. Its client list would include Colgate-Palmolive, Kellogg and Red Lobster.
To the extent that there was tragedy in Cannon’s life, it occurred on the side of her father, Michael Cannon, an Indiana-bred advertising executive who worked at Siboney and married Mercedes Cubas in 1978, three years before Aileen Cannon was born in Colombia, where her father was working for Siboney at the time. In 1984, Aileen Cannon’s grandfather, William P. Cannon, a U.S. Navy veteran, was shot and killed in his home by his son-in-law. (Aileen Cannon was 3 at the time.)
Cannon’s parents divorced in 1997, her junior year at Ransom Everglades Upper School, a private college preparatory institution located in the lush Miami suburb of Coconut Grove. On a campus that did not disqualify high achievers from cool-kid status, classmates remember Cannon as being part of the in crowd: studious and prone to taking a seat at the front of the classroom in the manner of a teacher’s pet, while also regularly cavorting with the flashiest girls on campus. Still, she was not among the two voted by her graduating class of about 130 as “most likely to succeed,” and three classmates told The New York Times in recent weeks they never expected her to be in national headlines.
In 1999, Cannon enrolled at Duke University, where she pledged the Delta Delta Delta sorority while maintaining the reputation of a workhorse. From there, she entered the University of Michigan Law School, graduated magna cum laude in 2007, and had a clerkship a year later in Des Moines, Iowa, with Steven Colloton, a conservative judge on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2009, she moved to Washington and spent three years as a litigation associate in the demanding law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.
At Ransom Everglades, Cannon extolled a Ronald Reagan-esque faith in the free market, just as she did at Duke, according to classmates at both schools. She joined the conservative Federalist Society at Michigan Law, a decision that reflected a desire to find community on an otherwise liberal campus rather than a careerist calculation, two people who knew her said. She secured the clerkship with Colloton based on her productivity rather than her conservative bona fides, according to Ryan Koopmans, a lawyer who clerked for the judge the year before Cannon.
“He wants clerks like her who would do the work and do it well,” Koopmans said. “I met with her the day she interviewed with Judge Colloton, and I don’t recall even knowing her politics.”
By the time she returned to Florida in 2013 to work as an assistant U.S. attorney in the state’s Southern District, Cannon was widely viewed as a solid if unspectacular litigant. First in the major crimes division and later in the appellate division, colleagues remember her as “bookish,” “thorough” and “courteous,” capable of handling complicated cases while not attempting to hog credit for the outcome. Cannon was now married to a restaurant executive, Josh Lorence; was a mother to two young children; and was not regarded as an ambitious climber in South Florida’s legal circles.
Still, after a seat became vacant on the U.S. District Court for Florida’s Southern District in summer 2017, word eventually reached both the office of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and the Trump White House Counsel’s Office — exactly how, no one seems to remember — that a certain prospective replacement checked a number of boxes. The lawyer in question was female. She was young. She was of Cuban heritage. She was conservative. She had a top-tier law school pedigree.

Hong Kong Sets Bounty For Dissidents Overseas: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The rewards of $ 128,000 for information leading to the prosecution of dissidents who have fled Hong Kong reflect stepped-up pressure to intimidate activists beyond the reach of the government.
Hong Kong's top leader said Tuesday that eight dissidents who had fled overseas would be "pursued for life" with large rewards being offered in exchange for information leading to their prosecution.
The rewards of 1 million Hong Kong dollars ( $ 128,000) reflect a stepped-up effort to pressure and intimidate influential activists who left Hong Kong after a stringent new law was imposed in 2020. The so-called national security law has resulted in the arrests of 260 people, the majority of them accused for activities that took place in Hong Kong.
On Monday, the police emphasized the extraterritorial reach of the regulations, which criminalize activities endangering China, even if they had taken place outside Hong Kong and mainland China. They said the accused had violated provisions on foreign collusion and inciting secession.
The eight who were charged by the police are the activists Nathan Law, Anna Kwok and Finn Lau; two former lawmakers, Dennis Kwok and Ted Hui; a lawyer, Kevin Yam; a union leader, Mung Siu-tat, and the businessman and YouTuber Elmer Yuen.
Ms. Kwok, the head of the Hong Kong Democracy Council in Washington, remained defiant. "It's encouraging me to go faster and stronger," she said in a phone interview.
Could the activists be extradited?
The government's announcement that it was seeking to seize the eight raises the question of whether Hong Kong would appeal to Interpol, the international law enforcement clearinghouse, for help in pursuing the dissidents. Ronny Tong, a former lawmaker who serves in the cabinet of John Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, said that the extradition of overseas activists is unlikely.
"Hong Kong law follows very strictly the U.N. model law on extradition, which means that we will not seek extradition of people committing political offenses or defendants who have a political background," he said in a phone interview.
He added, however, that the activists could be detained when passing through "friendly nations." And Hong Kong authorities could still request legal assistance from international bodies, like intelligence on the whereabouts of the eight individuals and their activities, which could be used to prosecute them in Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong police, asked if it would seek Interpol's help, said in a statement Tuesday that it would "take all necessary measures in accordance with the law to stop those absconders."
What's driving the arrest warrants and bounties?
Legal scholars said the charges and bounties were intended to sow division among the exiled activists, isolating and stigmatizing them as they agitated for new laws in the United States, Britain and Australia responding to Hong Kong's crackdown.
"The suggestion is being made that they are dangerous criminals, when in fact they are peaceful critics of the Hong Kong government's authoritarian turn," said Thomas E. Kellogg, the executive director of the Center for Asian Law. He added the moves may backfire and instead put greater pressure on governments to act against Hong Kong.
The bounties were an extension of tactics used by Beijing to target activists overseas, such as Chinese police outposts, said Eric Lai, a visiting researcher at King's College London School of Law. Last March, the U.S. Justice Department charged five people with spying on or intimidating Chinese American dissidents on U.S. soil.
The Hong Kong police acknowledged the difficulty of arresting individuals living abroad in self-imposed exile, but they offered the $ 128,000 bounty in exchange for information that could be used as evidence in local courts for the "successful prosecution" of each individual. One of the primary objectives, the police added, was to ensure that authorities obtained sufficient evidence to charge the individuals should they voluntarily return to Hong Kong.
"If they don't return, we won't be able to arrest them -- that's a fact," Li Kwai-wah, the chief police superintendent, said at a news briefing. "But we won't stop pursuing them."
Hong Kong's leader, John Lee, put it more starkly. "The only way to end their destiny of being an abscondee who will be pursued for life is to surrender," he said on Tuesday.
How have other governments responded?
The charges prompted an outcry from officials in the United States, Britain and Australia, where the eight individuals now live. The State Department called the extraterritorial application of the national security law "a dangerous precedent that threatens the human rights and fundamental freedoms of people all over the world."
Australia's foreign minister, Penny Wong, said the government was "deeply concerned" by the arrest warrants and would continue to speak out on human rights issues. "Freedom of expression and assembly are essential to our democracy and we support those in Australia who exercise those rights," she wrote on Twitter on Monday.
Britain's foreign secretary, James Cleverly, said in a statement on Monday that Britain "will not tolerate any attempts by China to intimidate and silence individuals in the U.K. and overseas."
But a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in London accused British politicians of "open sheltering of wanted fugitives" and in turn meddling in China's internal affairs.

Picturing Ghana's Rise, At Home and Abroad: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The 94-year-old British-Ghanaian photographer James Barnor calls himself "Lucky Jim" -- he's been "at the right place at the right time and met the right people" during a career spanning more than six decades and two continents, he said in a recent telephone interview from his London home.
It's easy to believe him looking at "James Barnor: Accra/London," a major retrospective of his work across genres -- studio and street photography, photojournalism and fashion, images that range from the quietly intimate to the historical and iconic. Shown at the Serpentine Galleries in London in 2021, the exhibition is on view in an expanded form at the Detroit Institute of Arts, through Oct. 15.
Take a modest picture by Barnor from 1952 of Roy Ankrah, a Commonwealth featherweight boxing champion. Barnor decided to tag along when Ankrah and his wife, Rebecca, visited a friend -- none other than the independence leader Kwame Nkrumah, who would go on to transform the Gold Coast from a British colony into the Republic of Ghana, becoming its first prime minister in 1957 and later its president. Barnor posed the three on Nkrumah's couch -- and then jumped into the frame, perching on an armrest, becoming part of a momentous history unfolding.
"This photo is quite revealing of James's opportunism, his ability to make use of a scenario as it presents itself to him in the moment," said Lizzie Carey-Thomas, who co-curated the Serpentine show. "He always seemed to be aware that something really important was happening."
The exhibition's more than 170 pictures chronicle Barnor's crucial role representing an emerging nation and its people's sense of self. He became Ghana's first photojournalist in the 1950s, according to historians. He worked in London in the swinging '60s, capturing the fashion and lives of Ghanaian expats and celebrities. In 1969, he returned to Accra to set up what is considered the country's first color photography lab. (He returned to London permanently in 1994.)
While not yet as well known as some of his contemporaries -- the American photojournalist and activist Kwame Brathwaite, say, or the Malian photographer Malick Sidibé -- Barnor has been hailed in recent years. At a virtual celebration of Barnor in 2021, the photographers Tyler Mitchell and Samuel Fosso, and the artist Tourmaline were among those citing Barnor's pioneering work and profound influence.
Antwaun Sargent, whose exhibition on young Black photographers, "The New Black Vanguard," traveled to the D.I.A. in 2021-2022, said the Barnor retrospective is an important follow-up.
"The audience in Detroit got to see the here and the now -- a younger generation of photographers like Campbell Addy, Awol Erizku, Tyler Mitchell, Ruth Ossai -- and now they get to see who those photographers were looking back to," Sargent said in an interview. "That's not usually what happens -- lots of institutions like to think that Black artists don't have a history. This creates a lineage, and James is firmly in that lineage."
Sargent added that "Barnor was the first to capture from inside the community our beauty and our notions of self-determination, and subsequent generations have had his photography to build on."
Born in 1929, Barnor left school early and apprenticed in photography with a cousin, J.P. Dodoo, before establishing his first studio in Jamestown, Accra, in 1952. He called the space Ever Young, after a Norse myth about a goddess whose grove of apples conferred eternal youth -- and indeed he captured the energies and aspirations of young Ghanaians in the years leading up to independence. Ever Young became a cultural center, and Barnor photographed everyone who gathered there: individuals and families, in both western-style and traditional dress; a female graduate of the police academy, hand raised in a crisp salute; a practitioner of yoga twisted into a series of asanas.
"A James Barnor photograph is instantly recognizable," said Carey-Thomas. "It's got a very particular quality of engagement with his subject. You're really aware of the fact that he's having a conversation with those sitters."
He sometimes arranged his portrait subjects in the open air ("Daylight was free," he laughed). He swapped his unwieldy studio equipment for a smaller camera to capture life on the city streets: young men piled into a roofless car out for a joyride; a man whose shirt reads "The Nigerian Superman" on a precariously balanced bicycle. Images of Ankrah and his family eating breakfast -- a Kellogg's Corn Flakes box displayed prominently on the table -- or listening to records on a shiny new hi-fi hold up a mirror to a growing middle class, as hungry for the products and pleasures as their counterparts in the so-called developed world.
His career developed with the expansion of print journalism in West Africa. When The Daily Graphic, a newspaper owned by The Daily Mirror in London, set up operations in Ghana in 1950, it searched out local photojournalists. "The Mirror photographer looked at my work and said, 'Oh, not quite, but we will train you."'
The images Barnor created for Drum, a highly influential South African magazine with an international audience, along with The Daily Graphic and the U.K.-based Black Star picture agency during these years offer a rare insight into the first nation in Africa to decolonize. His photos at the D.I.A. show the rise of Nkrumah and his Convention People's Party as well as the opposition National Liberation Movement, and British riot police breaking up political gatherings.
Nii Quarcoopome, a specialist in African art, who along with Nancy Barr, in the photography department, curated the D.I.A. show, said that Barnor's political neutrality allowed him to move between factions. "He insisted that he was nonaligned. Nobody saw him as dangerous," Quarcoopome said.
Pictures of the 1957 Independence celebrations in Accra include photos of then-Vice President Richard Nixon during his only visit to Africa, which many Ghanaians assumed was motivated by a desire to gain an economic foothold in the resource-rich region.
Two years after decolonization, Barnor boarded a ship for England on the advice of a friend -- "London is the place for you," the letter said. He did fashion and editorial photography for magazines aimed at West Indian, African and South Asian immigrants, and he pursued a university degree. He eventually got a job at a leading color processing lab.
Examples of his fashion photography are also on view in New York at the Brooklyn Museum's exhibition "Africa Fashion." Barnor recruited his African-origin models on the street and asked them to bring their own clothes to shoots --there was no budget for wardrobe.
One woman who posed, Erlin Ibreck, wrote in the retrospective's exhibition catalog that she never thought of herself as beautiful when compared to the images she saw in other magazines, but working with Barnor "gave me the feeling that we were conspiring together to shatter accepted images of beauty, and to replace them with new and just as valid representations."
In our conversation, Barnor expressed some regret about his decision to return to Ghana in 1969. "I was at the height of my fame and prosperity," he said of London. "But I had the chance to take back to Africa something that wasn't there -- color photography, color printing, which in the 1960s was even new in Europe."
Barnor pointed out a 1971 photograph of a shop assistant outside the newly established Sick-Hagemeyer color-processing laboratory in Accra. She holds brightly colored plastic bottles, with more arrayed at her feet -- a carefully composed study in turquoise, coral and white. "This was my announcement," Barnor explained. "I will take a color picture here in Ghana, develop it here and print it here, so you can see that I can do it."
A few years later in Accra, Barnor opened a new business, Studio X23. But when the Ghanaian economy collapsed in the mid-1980s, he returned to London. Having lost his momentum as a photographer there, Barnor took a steady job as a cleaner at Heathrow Airport -- a change in course that he has described as a typical immigrant story.
Quarcoopome, who grew up in Accra, learned of Barnor's work from one of his elder brothers researching their family lineage. Intrigued, he and Barr traveled to Paris, where Barnor's archive of 32,000 images is stewarded by the Galerie Clémentine de la Féronnière. Barr has been actively expanding the D.I.A.'s collection of African photography, including acquisitions of Barnor's work, so bringing the Serpentine survey over made sense.
The curators were struck by the fact that Barnor "had so many stories -- it was unusual to hear the voice of a living photographer who has such a great mind and retentive memory," Quarcoopome said.
What he was not expecting was that the photographer's stories would touch on his own history: "With every conversation comes a new revelation about my family," Quarcoopome said.
The curator walked me over to a photo in the gallery showing an elegantly dressed woman in a caftan, leaning on a TV console topped by a silver tinsel Christmas tree. This was his uncle's wife; on the wall behind her was a framed photograph -- also by Barnor -- of his uncle. So far, Barnor has discovered more than 75 photographs of Quarcoopome's relations in his archive.
"It makes you feel like, 'Oh my goodness, the only thing that James doesn't know about me is my DNA,"' Quarcoopome said.
But the influence that his own family had on Barnor's career was even more surprising. "My uncle was actually the one who gave him 10 British pounds to buy his first camera," the curator said. "Barnor's Studio X23 was in my grandfather's backyard!"
Barnor, who wasn't able to travel to Detroit for the exhibition, laughed when I recounted Quarcoopome's words. "I'm the last one standing," he said. "All the people I know now are younger than me. I have more stories to tell them than they themselves know."

From Dodger Stadium To Docks, L.A. Workers Are Flexing Union Muscle: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: California union members are pressuring employers over wages in one of the nation's most labor-friendly states.
In the two months since they went on strike, screenwriters have become a fixture outside studios in Southern California, signs aloft as the traffic roars past. In many parts of America, theirs would be a lonely vigil.
Not in Los Angeles.
At the behemoth ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, operations were disrupted for weeks until West Coast dockworkers reached a tentative contract deal in mid-June. Across the city, schools shut down for three days this spring when bus drivers, cafeteria workers and teachers walked out.
Now, the union representing some 15,000 hotel workers in Los Angeles is threatening to strike this Fourth of July weekend, just as the summer tourism season ramps up. And more than 160,000 actors are poised to shut down Hollywood productions if they cannot reach a new contract deal later this month.
Unions have been embattled nationally, but in California they are having a moment.
"We're calling it the 'hot labor summer,"' said Lorena Gonzalez, the chief officer of the California Labor Federation, which represents more than 2.1 million union members statewide. "We have sparks and fires everywhere, and we're not letting it die down in California. We're fanning the flames."
California has long been a labor stronghold, with Democrats in control of state government and most large cities. Despite a string of labor wins in recent years -- including a minimum wage of $ 15.50 an hour, more than double the federal rate -- workers say they are feeling ever more pressure from inflation, housing shortages and technological disruptions.
The unemployment rate remains below 5 percent in California, so workers know they have leverage. And numerous contracts are expiring this year, forcing California employers to negotiate with unions as they watch picket lines form daily in Los Angeles. Roughly half of the large work stoppages in 2023 have taken place in the state.
On Friday, a major contract for the hotel workers ran out, while the actors' union said that it would extend its expiring contract through July 12, buying more time to continue negotiations.
Hotel workers could walk out as soon as this weekend, however. Operators of hotels might be able to muddle through a short-term walkout, but a longer one could deter tourists from visiting Los Angeles in the busy summer months, and erode the convention business that has rebounded since the beginning of the pandemic, said Kevin Klowden, chief global strategist with the Milken Institute, an economic think tank based in Santa Monica, Calif.
Simultaneous strikes of hotel workers, screenwriters and actors would ripple first through Los Angeles businesses that rely on the region's signature tourism and Hollywood industries. And they could have a broader effect beyond Los Angeles; during the 2007 screenwriters strike, the California economy lost $ 2.1 billion, according to one estimate.
The Hotel Association of Los Angeles said in a statement that it had bargained in good faith and would continue to serve tourists during a walkout. Keith Grossman, a spokesman for the coordinated bargaining group consisting of more than 40 Los Angeles and Orange County hotels, said in a statement that it had offered to increase pay for housekeepers currently making $ 25 an hour in Beverly Hills and downtown Los Angeles to more than $ 31 per hour by January 2027.
"If there is a strike, it will occur because the union is determined to have one," Mr. Grossman said. "The hotels want to continue to provide strong wages, affordable quality family health care and a pension."
A recurring theme this year among striking workers has been the unbearable cost of living in Southern California. School employees said in March that they had to take two or three side gigs to afford their bills. Screenwriters have echoed that lament. A University of Southern California survey recently found that 60 percent of local tenants said they were "rent-burdened," spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing.
"How can anyone keep living here?" asked Lucero Ramirez, 37, who has worked as a housekeeper at the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills since 2018.
On Thursday, Ms. Ramirez gathered inside an office space near downtown Los Angeles with dozens of other hotel workers represented by Unite Here Local 11 to decorate poster boards and staple together fliers ahead of a planned strike. Earlier that day, the Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites announced that it had staved off a walkout with a contract deal.
The union has asked that the hourly wage, now $ 20 to $ 25 for housekeepers, immediately increase by $ 5, followed by $ 3 bumps in each subsequent year of a three-year contract. Hotel workers -- and their employers -- are well aware that this deal will set pay levels ahead of the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics, when tourists will flood the region.
Ms. Ramirez, who earns $ 25 an hour, has lived in a rent-controlled, one-bedroom apartment in Hollywood for the past decade, where she pays $ 1,100 a month. The hot water often goes out, and the flooring in her unit is cracked and decaying, she said.
"The landlord wants me to leave so they can boost the rent," she said. "They want me out, but I cannot afford to go anywhere else, I would have to leave the city."
Labor power is a function of the electorate in California, where Democrats have nearly a 2-to-1 edge over Republicans, supermajority control of the state Legislature, a lock on state offices -- and owe a debt to unions, whose members routinely knock on doors and contribute money to liberal candidates.
Next year, voters in California will consider an initiative that would raise the minimum wage to $ 18 an hour. In Los Angeles, members of the City Council are weighing a plan that would raise the minimum wage for tourism workers to $ 25 an hour. Maria Elena Durazo, a Democratic state senator and former head of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, is carrying legislation that would give all health care workers a $ 25 minimum hourly wage.
Tens of thousands of unionized teachers, bus drivers, cafeteria workers and other employees at the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second-largest district, won major raises this year after their high-profile walkout in March.
Smaller labor actions have proliferated as well, including strippers organizing in May at a North Hollywood club, and Amazon drivers walking out in June at a warehouse in Palmdale, Calif. The Los Angeles Dodgers averted a strike by giving ushers, groundskeepers and other workers significant raises.
Across the country, union membership as a percentage of the labor force has dropped to a record low of 10.1 percent of employed wage and salary workers. In California, however, such membership rose last year to 16.1 percent of wage and salary workers, compared with 15.9 percent in 2021.
"This is a tug of war between inflation and wages," said Sung Won Sohn, a finance and economics professor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. "Inflation has been winning and workers are trying to catch up with inflation that's been persistent."
Nancy Hoffman Vanyek, the chief executive of the Greater San Fernando Valley Chamber of Commerce, which represents about 400 businesses from one-person operations to Hollywood studios, said that workers should be able to afford to live in Los Angeles. But she said simply forcing employers to pay more was a Band-Aid for a much deeper problem in California.
"It's business that always has to bear the brunt of fixing these issues, when we're not looking at what's causing them," she said. "What's causing the high cost of living in our state? What's causing the high cost of housing?"
Workers nationally are trying to lock in gains from a job market that has remained tight, as employers brace for a possible recession. Rail workers were on the brink of a strike last year, while employees at manufacturing companies like John Deere and Kellogg went on strike in late 2021.
In California, the activism has been further driven by white-collar workers, whose jobs have been threatened by the rise of artificial intelligence and the gig economy.
"It's remarkable, the degree to which they are getting support from other unions," said Nelson Lichtenstein, who directs the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California, Santa Barbara. "There's a new sense of commonality between the retail clerk who is being told to come in every other day from 3 to 7 p.m. and the screenwriter who is suddenly being offered seven episodes to write and then, goodbye."

Ivan Menezes, 63, Chief Executive Who Made Fusty Johnnie Walker Cool: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As chief executive of Diageo for a decade, he presented alcohol as an attainable luxury and helped brands like Smirnoff and Guinness grow.
Ivan Menezes, who as chief executive of the spirits corporation Diageo used his canny understanding of the drinking public to help the company grow into a global colossus, died on June 7 in London. He was 63.
The cause was complications of emergency surgery for a stomach ulcer, a Diageo spokesman said.
Diageo is omnipresent in the world of alcohol, selling more than 200 brands in more than 180 countries, including Smirnoff vodka, Tanqueray gin, Johnnie Walker Scotch, Captain Morgan rum and Guinness beer. In some spirit categories it has the largest global net sales.
Mr. Menezes (pronounced muh-NAY-zess) was trained in marketing and closely studied consumer sentiment. To him, spirits provided what he called "accessible luxury" to customers -- a dram of the good life even in an unstable economy.
"The example I like to use is, if you are an average New Yorker, it may be tough to spend a night at the Four Seasons," Mr. Menezes said in an interview with The New York Times in 2005, "but you could walk into the Four Seasons bar and enjoy a glass of Johnnie Walker Blue Label on the rocks."
Mr. Menezes, who became chief executive in 2013, was at Diageo from its inception. He was Guinness's strategy director in 1997 when the company merged with Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., which owned Burger King and Pillsbury, creating a conglomerate reportedly worth $ 33 billion.
After the merger, he became global marketing director for the company's beverage division in 1998.
One of his first challenges was making Johnnie Walker appeal to a new generation. It was not so much that young imbibers disliked the taste of blended Scotch, but rather that the drink's traditional tartan image felt fusty, Diageo's market research found.
"We are losing older drinkers by the bucketful, but only gaining new ones by the thimbleful," Mr. Menezes was quoted as saying in 1999 in the Scottish newspaper The Scotsman. "We will all benefit from everyone focusing on building brands and making their brands relevant to younger consumers."
That year Mr. Menezes spent 100 million pounds (about $ 224 million in today's dollars) to revamp Johnnie Walker's image with an international advertising campaign developed by the agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty.
The campaign introduced the slogan "Keep walking" and featured three television advertisements, including one in which the actor Harvey Keitel walked into a coliseum filled with lions as he talked about overcoming stage fright; another showed the French funambulist Ramon Kelvink walking a tightrope between buildings.
"With this campaign, we hope to build an emotional bond with the consumer through the universal territory of inspiring personal progress," Mr. Menezes told Campaign magazine.
A quarter-century later, Johnnie Walker, one of the most popular Scotch brands on the planet, still uses the "Keep walking" tagline. Diageo said that Johnnie Walker's retail sales value had increased from about $ 5.1 billion in 2012 to more than $ 8 billion in 2022.
Under Mr. Menezes, Diageo expanded its tequila offerings, trading its Bushmills Irish whiskey brand to Casa Cuervo in 2014 in exchange for complete control of its Don Julio tequila brand and $ 408 million in cash. The company also bought Casamigos, the tequila brand created by George Clooney and two friends, Rande Gerber and Michael Meldman, in a deal in 2017 worth up to $ 1 billion. Tequila is now the company's second-largest seller, after Scotch.
As chief executive Mr. Menezes removed a layer of regional management, facilitating communication between the global company and country-based businesses and shrinking its employee base from about 36,000 to nearly 28,000. He was credited with reducing Diageo's carbon emissions and pushing for greater work force diversity by adding more women at top levels. He had planned to retire this year; the new chief executive is Debra Crew.
She takes the helm as the company faces a recent lawsuit filed by Sean Combs, the rapper known as Diddy, who has accused the company of racial bias for neglecting the vodka and tequila brands they co-own. Diageo denied Mr. Combs's allegations, saying in a statement that "we are confident the facts will show that he has been treated fairly."
Ivan Manuel Menezes was born on July 10, 1959, in Pune, India, to Nina and Manuel Menezes. His mother taught music and French; his father was chairman of the Indian Railway Board.
After graduating from St. Mary's High School in Mount Abu, India, Mr. Menezes earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1979 from St. Stephen's College, the University of Delhi.
He then studied business policy and marketing at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad and took a job with Nestlé in New Delhi in 1981.
He moved to the United States to study business administration at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, completing his master's degree in 1985. He then took a job as a business and management consultant with Booz Allen Hamilton, based in Chicago and London.
Mr. Menezes was vice president of group marketing for Whirlpool in northern Italy from 1992 until he left for Guinness in 1997.
He held several other positions at Diageo, including chief operating officer and president of the company's North American operations, before succeeding Paul S. Walsh as chief executive.
He is survived by his wife, Shibani, with whom he lived in London; two brothers, Victor, the former chairman and chief executive of Citibank, and Michael; a sister, Marisa; a daughter, Rohini Menezes; and a son, Nikhil.
Mr. Menezes, who was a British and American citizen as well as an overseas citizen of India, was knighted by King Charles III in January for his services to business and equality.
When it came to his own taste in beverages, Mr. Menezes preferred classics like a Johnnie Walker Black and soda, or a pint of Guinness, though, as he said during an appearance on CNBC on St. Patrick's Day in 2007, sometimes one was not enough.
"What I will say about Guinness," he said, "my favorite pint is always my next pint."

GameStop Fires Its Chief After Revenue Slips Again
GameStop fired its chief executive, Matt Furlong, on Wednesday, two years after hiring him, and appointed the billionaire businessman Ryan Cohen as executive chairman, sending the company's shares down 20 percent in extended trading.
A former executive at Amazon, Mr. Furlong joined GameStop in 2021, just months after the company was at the center of a meme-stock trading frenzy in which social media-armed traders talked up the value of the stock.
The video game retailer also said it would not be holding an earnings call.
Mr. Cohen, who co-founded online pet products retailer Chewy, has been serving as chairman of GameStop since 2021 and is also a majority shareholder.
GameStop posted its fourth consecutive fall in quarterly revenue and missed market estimates, as consumers dialed back non-essential spending in an uncertain economy. REUTERS
COMPANIES
Gloomy Investors Send Campbell Shares Lower
Shares in Campbell Soup dropped as much as 9 percent on Wednesday after the company disappointed investors by maintaining its full-year forecasts for sales and profit despite beating quarterly earnings.
Packaged food companies likeCampbell, Kraft Heinz and Kellogg have been raising prices to counter the impact of higher input costs stemming from supply chain snags and the Russia-Ukraine war.
The move helped Campbell Soup post a 5 percent rise in quarterly sales, although its margins slipped to 30 percent from 31.2 percent.
Investors are likely disappointed with the company keeping its forecast unchanged as they were anticipating a raise, said Arun Sundaram, an analyst for CFRA Research, but he added that the decision reflected a "prudent level of conservatism."
Campbell expects annual net sales to grow between 8.5 percent and 10 percent, compared with analysts' estimates for a rise of 9.5 percent, according to Refinitiv IBES data. REUTERS

Maker of Jack Daniel's Tops Sales Estimates
Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniel's whiskey, topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly sales on Wednesday, benefiting from higher prices as well as steady demand for its liquor brands.
Shares of the company, which also produces Woodford Reserve bourbon and el Jimador tequila, rose more than 3 percent by the close of trading.
Spirit makers have raised prices globally as they try to protect their margins from increased costs and a stronger U.S. dollar.
Brown-Forman's revenue rose 5 percent to $ 1.05 billion for the fourth quarter ended April 30, beating analysts' average estimate of $ 990.3 million, according to Refinitiv data.
However, despite multiple price hikes, the company grappled with higher expenses linked to supply chain, raw materials, and packaging, pushing its gross margin to 60.8 percent, from 62.8 percent a year earlier. REUTERS

Amitai Etzioni, 94, Who Envisioned Society Built on Community, Is Dead: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A sociologist, he advised U.S. presidents and other Western leaders while fathering communitarianism, a political middle ground between the left and the right.
Amitai Etzioni, the Israeli-American sociologist who drew wide attention and storms of derision by fathering the Communitarian movement, a vision of society in which people are asked to care less about their own rights than about one another and the common good, died on Wednesday at his home in Washington. He was 94.
The death was confirmed by his son David.
Born to German-Jewish parents who fled from Hitler to Palestine, Mr. Etzioni fought for Israeli independence, moved to the United States in 1957 and became an influential academic and political figure. He wrote prodigiously, taught at George Washington University, testified before Congress and advised presidents, prime ministers and other Western leaders on foreign and national policies.
Barely a decade after landing in America, Mr. Etzioni was famous, writing books and articles far afield from the turgid corners of sociology -- provocative commentaries on the nuclear arms race, European security, the Vietnam War, America's racial and educational problems, energy and inflation policies and popular worries over pornography, student unrest and topics ranging from sex therapy to Hollywood hoopla.
"Sometimes Amitai Etzioni seems to be a one-man profession," Time magazine said.
He was appointed to commissions and advisory panels, invited to join editorial boards and television debates and showered with fellowships, awards and honorary degrees. He argued with Wernher von Braun on the Soviet-American space race, helped Betty Friedan in 1974 start an Economic Think Tank for Women, as it was called, to consider women's "hidden economic power," and was invited to lead a state investigation of a nursing home scandal in New York involving substandard conditions.
But of all Mr. Etzioni's pursuits, none hit home with greater force than "communitarianism," which he named, interpreted and promoted for two decades, starting in the early 1990s. It was not novel -- liberals and conservatives had debated an unnamed middle ground for decades -- but it captured imaginations with its sermonizing, political rhetoric and dashes of old-fashioned needlepoint virtues.
Communitarianism, with its emphasis on community, not the individual, staked out ground between liberal advocates of civil liberties and welfare rights on one hand, and conservative champions of laissez-faire economics and traditional values on the other. It never became a mainstream political movement, but it won significant followings in America and Europe.
Though the idea seemed simple, its implications spread out in all directions. Individual liberty and equality were the foundations, he said, but these depended on the good character of people who willingly embraced the responsibilities of citizenship. These, in turn, depended on healthy communities and institutions like the family, schools, neighborhoods, unions, local governments and religious and ethnic groups.
And its principles could be applied to larger national and international issues -- a "communitarian" view of military and defense postures, federal spending priorities, educational goals, even East-West nuclear arms controls. After all, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet bloc were "communities," and it all came down to people being good citizens.
"Strong rights presume strong responsibilities," Mr. Etzioni told The New York Times in 1992, not long after issuing a "Communitarian Platform" signed by educators, economists, political leaders and feminists. "We hold that law and order can be restored without turning this country of the free into a police state," the platform declared.
It called the family a "moral anchor" of society, and suggested extended child-care and parental leave benefits, flexible working hours and tougher divorce laws. It proposed more self-discipline and checks on misbehavior; national service for young people, wider participation in jury duty and military service; and an emphasis on orderly conduct enforced by the police.
In "The Limits of Privacy" (1999), Mr. Etzioni argued that infants should be tested for H.I.V. because their health was more important than a mother's privacy; that governments should be allowed to break encryption codes to expose terrorists and pedophiles; and that a universal identity system would help catch illegal immigrants, tax evaders and deadbeat dads.
Controversies quickly arose. Communitarians criticized liberals, saying they ignored the importance of personal responsibility and reflexively blamed economic and political forces for poverty, drug abuse, crime and urban blight. Similarly, they criticized conservatives, saying they ignored corrosive economic pressures on families and communities and reflexively exalted free markets and self-interest as remedies for social problems.
Liberal critics called communitarianism a cloak for authoritarianism, and a throwback to ideas espoused by the Moral Majority.
"A lot of communitarian rhetoric appears to emphasize voluntary measures," Nadine Strossen, president of the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Times. "But the rhetoric is very slippery when it involves government in creating legal obstacles to divorce, indoctrinating through public schools or giving police more leeway to search suspects."
Conservatives argued that communitarian ideas undermined individual rights by dictating boundaries of personal behavior and enforcing conformity through churches, public schools, national service and other coercive pressures disguised as campaigns of public spiritedness.
"The suspicion of charlatanism hangs over Etzioni," The New Statesman, a progressive British journal, said in 1997. "It is, perversely, a measure of his extraordinary success. His communitarian movement, founded in 1990 by a handful of academics, has grown into a body of work and attitudes that have inserted themselves everywhere into the policy debates of the U.S., the U.K. and more widely, and it has achieved for Etzioni the status of a modern seer."
Mr. Etzioni wrote for The New York Times, The Washington Post and other publications. He founded the Communitarian Network and its magazine, The Responsive Community. In 1995, he became president of the American Sociological Association.
At the peak of his influence, Mr. Etzioni conferred with President Bill Clinton, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende of the Netherlands. He also met twice with Barack Obama when Mr. Obama was a presidential candidate.
In an essay in The American Scholar in 2014, Mr. Etzioni, referring to Mr. Obama, recalled: "In his book 'The Audacity of Hope,' he emphasized that individual rights must be balanced with social responsibilities. However, since he became president, communitarianism has been the philosophy that dare not speak its name." Mr. Obama "has often drawn on its principles," he said, but "never mentions communitarianism."
He was born Werner Falk in Cologne, Germany, on Jan. 4, 1929, to Willi and Gertrude (Hanauer) Falk. He recalled being beaten by children who learned he was Jewish. When he was 6, the family escaped to Athens, then to Palestine, where he grew up on a kibbutz and changed his name to Amitai Etzioni (Amitai means truth in Hebrew).
He left home as a teenager to join the Palmach, a Jewish underground defense force, and became a brigade commander involved in paramilitary actions before Israeli statehood. In 1948, he fought in Israel's war of independence, and two years later began sociology studies at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1954 and a master's in 1956.
In 1953, he married Eva Horowitz. They had two sons, Ethan and Oren, and were divorced. In 1965, he married Minerva Morales, and had three more sons: Michael, David and Benjamin. His second wife died in a car crash in 1985. In 1992, Mr. Etzioni married Patricia Kellogg.
In addition to David, he is survived by his wife; his sons Ethan, Oren and Benjamin; a stepson, Cliff Kellogg; a stepdaughter, Tamara Kellogg; 11 grandchildren; and two step-granddaughters. His son Michael died in 2006. Mr. Etzioni and his wife lived at the Watergate complex in Washington.
Emigrating to the United States, he earned a doctorate at the University of California at Berkeley in 1958. He began teaching at Columbia University and writing books on social change and international affairs. By 1967 he was a full professor, and from 1969 to 1978 was chairman of Columbia's Institute for War and Peace Studies.
He became a senior adviser to President Jimmy Carter in 1979 and in 1980 joined George Washington University, where he continued to write and teach international affairs for more than 30 years, becoming director of its Institute for Communitarian Policy Studies.
He wrote more than 30 books, including "The Active Society" (1968), "The Spirit of Community: The Reinvention of American Society" (1993), "My Brother's Keeper: A Memoir and a Message" (2003), "How Patriotic is the Patriot Act: Freedom Versus Security in the Age of Terrorism" (2004) and "Reclaiming Patriotism" (2019).
Communitarian ideas have had a modest revival in recent years in some intellectual circles, but even so, in his 2014 article in The American Scholar, Mr. Etzioni expressed concern that the school of thought he founded would be done in less by criticisms than by the fatal condition of being ignored by the wider public.
"Despite my confidence that the message I have hammered out would do the world a lot of good," he wrote, "no one seems to be listening."

Having Fun With a Tragedy Can Be a Cautionary Tale: [Review]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Directed by Hansol Jung and Dustin Wills, this sportive, vividly acted production fails to make a convincing case for its new gags and directorial flights.
"Romeo and Juliet" is at its core a cautionary tale of young love: Kiss a boy at a party one day, marry him the next, inside of a week you're both dead. Of Shakespeare's tragedies it is more propulsive than most, funnier and more modern, too, an amalgam of sex and death and a masquerade ball that requires little improvement. Cast a couple of charismatic leads, wind them up and let the bodies fall.
That doesn't mean that playwrights and directors shouldn't interrogate or adapt the text. Of course they should. But what's puzzling about the "Romeo and Juliet" presented by the National Asian American Theater Company in partnership with Two River Theater is how little any of that adaptation adds.
Directed by Hansol Jung and Dustin Wills, who recently collaborated on "Wolf Play" at Soho Rep, and with what's billed as a "modern verse translation" by Jung, this is a sportive, vividly acted production that fails to make a convincing case for its many directorial flights and vernacular interventions. Jung and Wills have thrown much spaghetti at the "Romeo and Juliet" wall. The result is a lot of noodling around.
At 136 East 13th Street, usually the home of the Classic Stage Company, the set, designed by Junghyun Georgia Lee and lit by Joey Moro, is a wooden circle. This gestures toward the Elizabethan, as do Mariko Ohigashi's costumes, which combine long skirts and slashed doublets with T-shirts and jeans.
Jung's script walks this same line between early modern and contemporary, leaving some tranches of the play intact, but zhuzhing up other parts with new vocabulary and new jokes. In the first scene, for example, the prologue is delivered more or less intact, minus a "doth" here and there. Yet the first line of dialogue is "I swear, man, we can't be no one's suckers," which leads into some very filthy puns. (Are they bad puns? Yes. But so are Shakespeare's.)
Jung's interpolations are perhaps an improvement on the real first lines -- an elaborate play on "collier" and "choler" -- though specificity of acting and direction would have put the language across. And some of the substitutions, like "thrilled" for "proud," are even less necessary. Still, Jung is savvy enough to respect Shakespeare's rhythms and to match his word play, so there's pleasure in seeing her lively mind volley with his.
The acting, from Major Curda's sad boy Romeo to Dorcas Leung's sweetheart Juliet to Mia Katigbak's warm, blunt Nurse, is uniformly strong. (Daniel Liu, playing a servant and Lady Capulet, is an actor to keep an eye on.) As actors of Asian descent don't always get equal opportunities to play classical roles, this alone justifies the production. Jung and Wills's direction doesn't always serve them, though. It's broad and busy, inclined toward clowning and with a habit of brazening out every sex joke. There are Brechtian gestures and live looping and Groucho Marx glasses and plastic fish littering the stage, which rob the story of momentum. Tybalt (Rob Kellogg), at one point, does the worm. Tragedy recedes.
Yet if you are or can remember being young and possessed of big, ungovernable feelings, "Romeo and Juliet" won't seem far away to you. Making the language and the dancing and the streetwear mirror our own time hasn't brought it any closer.

Illuminating A Bud Light Controversy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: After Dylan Mulvaney promoted the beer on Instagram, well-known conservatives tried to start a boycott. Experts say the controversy will not hurt the brand in the long run, and may help.
Some conservative commentators and celebrities have called for a boycott of Bud Light after the beer was featured in a social media promotion by a transgender influencer, Dylan Mulvaney.
Ms. Mulvaney is popular on TikTok, where she has more than 10.8 million followers and has been documenting her transition online. The controversy began on April 1, when she posted a video on her Instagram account, where she has 1.8 million followers, to promote a Bud Light contest.
Ms. Mulvaney, 26, celebrated one full year of her "Days of Girlhood" series in March with a live show at Rockefeller Center called "Dylan Mulvaney's Day 365 Live!"
Her Bud Light promotional post is less than a minute long and is mostly about a $ 15,000 giveaway that the company sponsored during March Madness. She mentions that the company sent her a tallboy can with her face on it to celebrate the 365-day milestone.
Ms. Mulvaney says her newfound fame has made her an 'easy target.'
Ms. Mulvaney has become more popular in the year since she created "Days of Girlhood." In October, she spoke with President Biden at the White House about transgender rights.
This success has met with personal attacks from public figures, including Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, and Caitlyn Jenner, the Republican former Olympian and transgender woman whose politics have made her a target of criticism from members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community.
Ms. Mulvaney has not spoken directly about the Bud Light boycott, but she addressed the hostility she has faced in an interview on the "Onward With Rosie O'Donnell" podcast that was released on Tuesday. She is "an easy target," she said, "because I'm still new to this."
"I think going after a trans woman that's been doing this for like 20 years is a lot more difficult," she said.
She added, "But what is their goal?"
A representative for Ms. Mulvaney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Supporters of a boycott have not said what they hope to gain.
The calls for a boycott have not included a specific demand. And some of the most prominent voices backing it have attacked the transgender community in the past, including the musician Kid Rock, who posted a video of himself shooting a stack of Bud Light cases this month.
The criticism of Bud Light, amid other complaints about brand partnerships with transgender people, comes as Republican state lawmakers are proposing legislation that seeks to regulate the lives of young transgender people, restrict drag shows in a way that could include performances by transgender people, and require schools to out transgender students to their parents.
For brands, social media controversies can be opportunities, experts say.
The investment website Seeking Alpha said that the stock price of Anheuser-Busch InBev, which makes Bud Light, was experiencing some volatility, but predicted that the effects would not be long-term because "news events often have an outsized short-term impact on share prices, and then fade away."
Anna Tuchman, associate professor of marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, has researched boycotts, including the calls for people to stop buying Goya Foods products in 2020 after the company's president praised President Donald J. Trump. Her research and other similar studies have found that such efforts tend to be short-lived and don't have a long-term effect.
Professor Tuchman said that, while people may be willing to change their behavior for a few weeks, it is much harder to convince people to change their long-term behavior.
Another obstacle in boycotts is finding replacement products.
Anheuser-Busch sells more than 100 brands of beer in the United States and is the largest beer brewer in the world.
One supporter of the boycott, Representative Dan Crenshaw, Republican of Texas, posted a video online to show that his fridge did not have Bud Light, but it did have beer from Karbach Brewing Company, which is also owned by Anheuser-Busch.
A "buycott" is when people buy a product to protest a boycott against it. Professor Tuchman found that during the Goya boycott the company's sales rose by 22 percent over two weeks before falling back to the baseline.
After the country musician Travis Tritt said that he would stop including Bud Light in his tour rider, Kevin John Wasserman, the guitarist for the Offspring who goes by Noodles, said that the band would include Anheuser-Busch products in its rider.
What's in it for Bud Light?
Anheuser-Busch said in a statement that it "works with hundreds of influencers across our brands as one of many ways to authentically connect with audiences across various demographics."
"From time to time we produce unique commemorative cans for fans and for brand influencers, like Dylan Mulvaney," the statement said. "This commemorative can was a gift to celebrate a personal milestone and is not for sale to the general public."
L.G.B.T.Q. people in the United States have an estimated $ 1.1 trillion in annual purchasing power, according to a 2019 report by LGBT Capital, a financial services company.
Sarah Kate Ellis, the president and chief executive of the L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy organization GLAAD, said in an emailed statement that marketing featuring L.G.B.T.Q. people would continue. "Companies will not end the standard business practice of including diverse people in ads and marketing because a small number of loud, fringe anti-L.G.B.T.Q. activists make noise on social media," she said.
Americus Reed, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said companies usually weigh the economic and moral effects of brand partnerships that some may see as political.
As part of that calculus, he said, companies recognize that a partnership could cause them to lose some customers, but bet that it is worth attracting new, and potentially more loyal, customers who value the company for taking a stand.
Alissa Heinerscheid, vice president of marketing for Bud Light, said in an interview before the boycott that the brand needed to be more inclusive.
"The brand is in decline," Ms. Heinerscheid said on the "Make Yourself at Home" podcast in March. "It's been in decline for a really long time. And if we do not attract young drinkers to come and drink this brand, there will be no future for Bud Light."

Full text: At a recent meeting, Shannon Bender and Keith Martine tried something new: They stood the entire time.
The two founders of Apostrophe, a New York City start-up that focuses on expanding access to art, knew their meetings had been running long. It didn't seem to matter whom they were talking to -- artists, or investors, or employees -- a lot of meetings took two hours.
"Sometimes that is intentional because we are relationship-building, but other times that is not," Mr. Martine said.
"We have one team member who definitely likes to talk a lot," Ms. Bender added, laughing. "Meetings with him are not efficient at all."
All that time in meetings left little time to do work. At Apostrophe, that meant less time for forming connections with artists and buyers and curating art shows.
U.S. workers spend an average of 31 hours per month in meetings they consider unproductive, according to Zippia, a site that provides job seekers with information about a company's culture.
Ms. Bender and Mr. Martine knew the problem. For them meetings of any kind -- with a potential hire or a longtime collaborator -- tended to run long. What they needed was a solution.
So when they interviewed a candidate to be their new assistant, they didn't offer her a seat, instead asking if she was open to having a standing conversation. Then they skipped small talk and dived right in on her work history, ambitions, strengths and weaknesses, and views on the art industry.
"After 20 minutes, we 100 percent got what we needed," Ms. Bender said. "The conversation was so efficient that I almost felt bad it was so short." They hired her, and it was such a positive experience -- even though Ms. Bender and the interviewee were in heels -- that Apostrophe will encourage standing meetings from now on. (Indeed, at their next staff meeting everyone stood up.)
Meetings are a source of stress for both employees and managers.
"Meetings in and of themselves don't cause problems," said Steven G. Rogelberg, a professor of management at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. "They were not created with a sadistic mind-set."
Their basic premise -- that a leader wants more people informed, or involved in decision-making -- can help workers feel engaged. Meetings elevate more voices, and being invited can feel like an honor, Mr. Rogelberg said.
"Bad meetings are what causes the problems," he explained. "When meetings are poorly run and have too many attendees and run too long and don't have a clear purpose, that is problematic."
It's also a problem when people have too many and can't do their work. In a 2022 study, Mr. Rogelberg found that office employees spent about 18 hours a week on average in meetings, which amounted to roughly $ 25,000 in payroll costs per employee. He also found that employees felt they didn't need to be in 30 percent of meetings they were invited to.
Remote work during the pandemic, which took away opportunities to have spontaneous discussions, led to meeting creep. A Microsoft report from March last year found that the number of meetings per week had increased 153 percent globally since the start of the pandemic.
Many companies are trying to tackle the problem, finding creative ways to make meetings, both in person and virtual, not only more efficient but more scarce.
Sarah Kellogg Neff, the chief executive of the Lactation Network, a 65-person company that connects new mothers with breastfeeding resources and is the nation's largest network of board-certified lactation consultants, wants her employees to feel in control of their workdays.
"We are a high-trust, high-autonomy culture," she said. "This is what high performers want."
That's why it is company policy that employees can opt out of meetings regardless of who invited them. (Even their boss or boss's boss!)
"When they get a meeting invite, every person is empowered to say, 'What is my role here?' Or: 'Hey, I'm working on another thing. Is it OK if I check out of the meeting?"' Ms. Neff said.
People cancel on her sometimes, but she doesn't take offense. "In a weird way it makes me proud," she said.
Sam Kaser, 30, who lives in Chicago and works on the Lactation Network's patient care team, said she exercises this right regularly, especially when a regular check-in on a long-term project is going to be outside her purview that week.
She has had more meetings at this company than in any previous job, she said, but isn't as frustrated by attending. "I am 100 percent confident why I should be in that 'room."' she said.
Many companies, including the Lactation Network, are experimenting with meeting-free days.
Studies show that this type of intervention can work. A study published in the MIT Sloan Management Review found that when companies introduced one no-meeting day per week, autonomy, communication, engagement and satisfaction improved.
In a Microsoft study of 435 of its employees, 73 percent said no-meeting Friday was good for their well-being and 77 percent said it was good for their focus time.
Canva, a design software maker, has 3,500 employees across eight offices worldwide. If someone tries to schedule a meeting on Wednesday, the company's designated no-meeting day, an auto decline comes "with a note that says that we are trying to adopt this policy for mental health and productivity," said Jennie Rogerson, Canva's global head of people, who is based in Sydney, Australia.
The company cherishes this policy so much -- "I use Wednesdays to get through my emails," Ms. Rogerson said, adding that "there is nothing better than inbox zero" -- it is experimenting with entire weeks, called focus weeks, when nonessential meetings are canceled.
It's not easy to carry out something like this, Ms. Rogerson said. For example, employees are in different time zones.
"Having meeting-free Wednesday means one more day that Australia and the U.S. don't get to meet, and with the time zone shifting, the amount of hours people can meet is already minimal," she said. "We're trying to think through this."
Another problem is that other workdays can be busier than they otherwise would. "You know when you have a game of Tetris and things get wild?" Ms. Rogerson asked. "That is what my calendar looks like with the exception of no-meeting Wednesday."
At the beginning of 2023, Shopify, the global commerce company, reinstated its meeting-free Wednesday, which it had tried in the past, and meetings that day dropped 44 percent.
To free up more time, Shopify also automatically deleted recurring meetings with three people or more and asked people to hold off on rescheduling them for two weeks (a cooling-off period) so they could think about what needed to be added back in. The company also created one specific time slot when companywide meetings could be held.
Jacques Krzepkowski, 39, a staff product designer for Shopify in Calgary, Alberta, said he spent 18 hours per week in meetings in 2022. Now his average week has eight hours of meetings.
"The one-on-one meetings are easier to cluster, so I have larger blocks of free time to get deep work completed," he said.
Ms. Neff, from the Lactation Network, cautioned that eliminating large group meetings might make some employees feel excluded. While her company is trying to cut back on meetings, it still allows anyone to join who wants to.
"We have a very open-door policy," she said. "If you see a topic you are interested in or a meeting you are interested in, you can attend, but otherwise we respect your time."
Mr. Rogelberg, who also works as a consultant, said he had clients who made meetings more efficient by rewriting agendas as questions to be answered instead of topics to discuss.
"If you do that, you have to really think about why you are gathering," he said. "If there is no question to be answered, you don't need a meeting."
This also helps determine who needs to be there, he said, because only the people who are essential for answering the questions should be included.
The problem with all of these techniques -- no-meeting Mondays, standing-up staff gatherings, focus weeks with no meetings -- is that even the most meeting averse can find it difficult to enforce them.
"These no-meeting days or half-days can have some success, but it takes a really strong collective commitment to do it," Mr. Rogelberg said. "We have data to suggest that people are scheduling meetings during those meeting-free periods because they know everyone is available."

Full text: Wendy Kaplan takes her daughter for a bicycle ride and then for dinner at her workplace, where there is always a busy kitchen.
Wendy Kaplan is the director of Trinity Place Shelter, which houses up to 10 young people at any given time -- most of them transgender men and women of color -- and steers them toward permanent housing, as well as professional or educational goals they set for themselves. The shelter, an independent nonprofit, was originally a pilot project of Trinity Lutheran Church of Manhattan, and still occupies its basement on the Upper West Side. It lets residents stay up to a year and half and welcomes individuals over the age of 21, a typical age cutoff for many youth shelters.
A social worker, Ms. Kaplan described her job as "the opposite of a 9 to 5" since the shelter's hours of operation are at night and she does at least some work seven days a week. Not that she's complaining. "These are my people," she said of the residents. "This is my heart."
Ms. Kaplan, 51, and Taso Manis, 57, a former chef, are co-parenting their daughter, Micah, 7, with whom they both live, in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn.
FAMILY TIME Now that Micah is in school, I think of Sunday as my day with her. I'm the one more active and outside with her. Taso has health complications and takes medication that makes him feel unwell most days, so he does a lot of the parenting at home.
DEMOGRAPHICS I've lived in our rent-stabilized apartment since the 1990s. I originally moved here thinking Brooklyn was where lesbians hang out. Now the neighborhood is kid central. I live across the street from a toddler park. We are right next to the Brooklyn Museum and Prospect Park.
THE CIRCUIT We just got Micah a bike and she's so excited to go out with it. We've been going to this park called Stroud two and a half blocks away. There's a track she can bike around while I walk. This is my exercise, too.
PATTIES, DADDY Sometimes on the way back, we'll stop at one of the little Caribbean takeout places near us. Micah loves Caribbean patties -- she always gets the curry chicken. Or we come home and Taso makes what we call "daddy noodles," which is basically any kind of noodle in chicken broth.
FUN WITH BOXES When we have people over, they have to walk through the bedroom to get to the living room to get to the kitchen. It's very New York. We are lucky it is big. Right now it is filled with boxes. We got Micah loads of presents but what she really likes is the boxes, which she decorates for her stuffed animals.
SHELTER In the afternoon we often go to the shelter. Micah has been coming with me since she was little. One resident taught her yoga. It's also where she learned about video games.
GROCERY RUN We have a car so we drive in, and sometimes I do a Costco run on the way. I get all the basics: chicken, eggs, hamburgers, pasta, granola bars. People can make requests, too. I try to buy residents what they ask for; it's a way of making them feel seen.
SHARING KITCHEN SKILLS The residents cook for themselves. Some of them don't know how to cook when they arrive, so I am buying cup of noodles and easy, fast things they can make. Others were the cooks in their families and they impart their skills or just share what they cook. It's always touching to see that.
ACTIVITIES Sometimes volunteer groups come on Sundays to do painting, organize donations or help in the kitchen. I'm giving people a tour and Micah gets time on the computer. I plop her at a table in the middle of the room.
DINNER TREATS We stay about three hours -- it's the perfect amount of time. Micah's always excited to have her dinner there. That's where she discovered ramen and sugar cereal. We don't have Frosted Flakes at home. For her, it's a treat.
BEDTIME RUSH Then it's a race to get home, get sorted and settled for the next day of school. Micah usually falls asleep in the car. By the time I get her up the stairs -- we're on the 4th floor of a walk-up -- it's at least 7:30 p.m. and I'm feeling that stress of trying to get her in bed before 9 p.m.
SILLY, FUN TIME In bed, we read a book. The Dog Man series is the favorite. The cartoons are so creative and fun, and they make her laugh. And it's helped her learn to read. She gets so engaged that she tries out words. There's a lot of "Eek! Ack!" It's a silly, fun time with a lot of giggling.
ON CALL A social worker stays overnight at the shelter. Sometimes we check in. Normally we would have a supervisor doing that, but I've been having trouble hiring someone. So I sleep with my phone on and next to me. If there's an emergency -- which is rare -- I need to be 100 percent available, and I am.

Why Is a Reuben Called a Reuben? A Linguist Takes a Look.: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk]

Full text: A new book exploring the origins of common food terms -- from bialy to lima bean to bibimbap -- is a fascinating history of how we eat and cook.
Used judiciously, the snappy tidbits of food etymology in "Romaine Wasn't Built in a Day," a new book by the medieval scholar Judith Tschann, could make you a hit at dinner parties.
Say someone shows up in a seersucker suit. You could inform her that the British took the word seersucker from the Hindi sirsakar, which itself came from a Persian word meaning milk and sugar. The smooth stripes are the milk, the bumpy ones the sugar.
Over the Caesar salad, you could casually mention that the English word romaine comes from the medieval French laitue romaine, or Roman lettuce, which possibly arrived in France along with the popes who moved to Avignon from Rome to escape some nasty politics in the early 1300s.
But here's a pro tip: When sharing food lore at a meal, it's easy to cross the line. Do your friends dipping into a bowl of guacamole need to know that the word avocado started out as ahuacatl, a Nahuatl term that the Aztecs likely used as slang for testicles? Or that soufflé comes the French word for blown, which stems from the same root as the word flatulent?
"Language is just so amusing. It has playfulness built into it, and so does food," said Dr. Tschann, who taught English and linguistics for many years at the University of Redlands, in California.
The etymologies of food words, she said, are a path through the history of how we eat and cook.
Take the word recipe. It's the imperative form of the Latin verb recipere, which means to receive or take. In Western medieval and early modern manuscripts, it was used to instruct people how to take medical prescriptions: "Recipe honey with codfish oil," for example. (Rx is a medieval abbreviation of the word.)
Mushroom first appeared in English at the end of the 14th century, borrowed from the Anglo-French musherum and the Central French moisseron.
"The English lexicon is fat from centuries of sucking up words from other languages," Dr. Tschann said.
Relish came from the Old French relaisser, to release, which came from the Latin relaxare, to relax. The idea is that relish releases flavor, she said.
And that Starbucks mocha you just ordered? Mocha is a toponym -- a word derived from a place. In this case, Mukha, a port city in Yemen that handled coffee shipments in the 18th century.
Other toponyms include vichyssoise, from Vichy, France; Tabasco peppers from the Mexican city; bialy from Bialystok, Poland; and lima beans from Lima, Peru (not Lima, Ohio).
Conversely, some geographic names started with food. Topeka may derive from a Dakota word meaning a place for digging potatoes. Chicago comes from the word for wild leek in Miami-Illinois, another Indigenous language.
Food and drink names also slip into common use through a process Dr. Tschann calls "coining," in which a marketing term becomes a generic name. Granola, which today refers to a crunchy cereal with grains and nuts, started as a proprietary name invented by John Harvey Kellogg in the late 1800s.
Compounding is another way food language grows. Bibimbap comes from the Korean pibim (to mix) and pap (rice). The espressotini is a mix of espresso and vodka.
The martini, by the way, was originally named for Martinez, a town in California where the drink was developed for Gold Rush miners. At some point, the Italian vermouth maker Martini & Rossi elbowed its way in and the "ez" fell away.
Food words are sometimes adopted by pursuits that have nothing to do with food. Consider the world of computing, which uses a menu to navigate selections. The first portable computer, introduced in the late 1980s, was called a lunchbox. Some developers of the 1990s programming language claim they called it Java because of all the coffee they drank while creating it. Cookies, chips, hosts and servers have all settled nicely into computer language and, increasingly, social media.
Ms. Tschann is careful to offer caveats when caveats are due. No one really knows if balls of fried cornmeal batter are called hush puppies because they were tossed to howling hounds to shut them up, or if pie came from cooks who observed magpies filling their nests with a collection of disparate objects.
Was the Reuben sandwich named for Reuben Kulakofsky, a Nebraska grocer in the 1920s and '30s? Or was it based on the Reuben's special, which Arthur Reuben created in 1914 at his New York City delicatessen?
Whatever the case, there are plenty of established facts to hang one's dinner napkin on.
Taco is a 20th-century word from Mexican Spanish that means plug or wad, a reference to part of an explosive used in silver mining.
Ceviche is likely from Quechuan, the language of the Inca Empire, where people used the word siwichi to describe fresh or tender fish.
Barbecue comes from barbacoa, a word in the Arawakan language of the Caribbean that describes a wooden frame for sleeping on and drying food.
Fans of the Broadway musical "Six" might like to know that the Bloody Mary is named after Mary Tudor, the daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. (As Queen Mary I of England, she burned Protestants at the stake in an effort to reverse the Reformation, initiated by her father.) The first recorded use of Bloody Mary to describe a drink was in 1939, when a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune declared it "the new pick-me-up."
The evolution of the word cocktail is one of Dr. Tschann's favorites in the book. It comes from the docking of a horse's tail, which then stood up like a rooster's and was referred to as a cock-tail. Thoroughbred racehorses did not have their tails docked, but if a horse had docking in its lineage, it was considered of mixed breed. By the 19th century, cocktails had come to mean mixed drinks.
She is also fond of junket, like the kind of trip a politician might take. It derives from the French jonquette, a sweet made with boiled milk, which has connections to the medieval Latin joncata, a type of soft cheese. In English, junket came to mean sweetened curds.
She can't pinpoint exactly how cocktail made the leap to a beverage and junket made the leap from food, though. Language is always changing, and accounting for semantic evolution is not always possible.
That can be challenging for Dr. Tschann when she finds herself at a party.
"When you're studying the history of food words, people can pepper you with questions," she said. "They ask me the etymology of a word, and I have to think about it way too long. I feel oddly tongue-tied."

Diana Kellogg is the founder and principal of Diana Kellogg Architects, a firm that specializes in high-end residential projects in New York. Most recently, she has shifted her focus more toward nonprofit work, conceptualizing and designing the GYAAN Center in the Indian state of Rajasthan, home to the Rajkumari Ratnavati Girls School. Approaching the anniversary of its opening in June, the school serves about 120 girls in a region of northern India where their literacy rate is barely 36%.
Kellogg is now designing the GYAAN Center’s next two elements: a women’s community center and a cultural exhibition space. She spoke by phone from Jaisalmer, the city in Rajasthan where the center is located. The interview has been edited and condensed.
Q: How did your work evolve from high-end residential to nonprofit projects?
A: The first 20 years of my practice were spent working in the high-end space for celebrities and wealthy New Yorkers, but I did some community work, as well. Eventually, luxury projects became unrewarding, and I was compelled to look deeper into nonprofit work.
I wanted to use the architectural and design knowledge I had acquired to help communities in need, and began with a project designing a children’s library in the Bronx at St. Ann’s Church of Morrisania.
Once I started, I realized that I wanted to center my practice around design that was focused on social change. The projects I work on now are a reflection of the power architecture holds to impact the people who experience it.
Q: What led to you working on a project in India?
A: The GYAAN Center was commissioned by the Citta Foundation, a nonprofit working on projects in India. They had built a school in Orissa [now Odisha], another impoverished part of India, and asked me if I would design one in Jaisalmer. I was drawn to their commitment to helping underserved communities.
Q: How was Jaisalmer chosen as the location for the GYAAN Center?
A: The site was selected by the Citta Foundation as a way to help improve the literacy rates for girls in the region that are so low as a result of economic disparities, gender and caste discrimination, and technological barriers.
Q: Can you talk about the design of the GYAAN Center?
A: I wanted to create a space where girls felt safe, comfortable and embraced.
Sustainability was key. We worked entirely with local craftspeople — often the fathers of the girls — to build the school using hand-carved local sandstone, a climate-resilient material that’s long been used for buildings in the area. Traditional architectural details and building techniques were combined with Indigenous heritage details so that the structure felt authentic to the region.
Sustainable design elements include recycled ceramic tile for the roof, lime plaster for the classroom interiors and 95% local materials. We also built a solar panel canopy on the roof, which serves multiple purposes: providing all the electricity, creating shade over the courtyard, and serving as a play structure for the girls. I also used local ancient water harvesting techniques to maximize the rainwater and recycled gray water in the school.
Another sustainability effort comes from methods we used to cool the school, in place of air-conditioning. Because temperatures peak close to 120 degrees in the region, we knew that we had to keep the interiors cooler, and utilized both the solar canopy and jallis wall to help create shade and a cooling panel of airflow. Elevated windows also help allow hot air to escape once it rises.
Q: How were the girls who attend the school chosen?
A: Enrollment in the school was open to all families who live below the poverty line in the Thar Desert region. At this time, around 120 girls are enrolled. Citta conducted community outreach to appeal to families in neighboring communities to enroll their girls, and invited them to visit the school.
Q: Can you talk about the roadblocks you are encountering in working on a nonprofit architectural project in India? Are there factors specific to the country that have made construction or anything else particularly difficult?
A: One of the biggest hurdles was executing the project through the pandemic, especially since India has been greatly affected by COVID-19. The timing of the pandemic also came at a very unfortunate moment, because we had to design the most complicated part of the design, the solar panel system, remotely.
Additionally, some of the toughest moments for me are experiencing sexism and misogyny from some of the men I work with outside of my team. This completely blindsided me. I was surprised that a project meant to empower women would present this obstacle, but it further highlights the need for spaces such as the GYAAN Center.
When the women’s co-op opens at the GYAAN Center, the plan is to have artisans teach women local weaving techniques. What takeaway do you want them to have with these skills?
A: The goal is to enhance gender parity and encourage the preservation of local culture and techniques. Unfortunately, many of these concepts are on the verge of being lost. These lessons will also help give women economic independence; our hope is to pair them with contemporary designers who are producing clothes and accessories to sell around the world.
Q: Have you visited the school? How does it hold up to your intent and expectations?
A: I have traveled to Jaisalmer upward of 18 times throughout the process, both pre- and post-completion. The hands-on experience was essential to the vision of the school, as I worked with a group of locally based craftspeople and contractors, and became friends with many people in Jaisalmer. It was immensely helpful to understand the region from the perspective of teachers, textile merchants, and entrepreneurs.
Every time I visit, I see the change in the girls, from being shy to becoming these bright lights who are devouring whatever kind of information you put in front of them.
Q: How can other female architects like yourself find a balance between projects that help their bottom line and ones that give back?
A: Practically speaking, we need money to live, and my goal is to have as many for-profit projects in the works as possible so that I can keep doing nonprofit work. It can be hard to find a balance and the time to do both. However, my aim is to take on one at least every two years. Other women can do the same. In addition, I have a nonnegotiable that every for-profit project that I’m doing has some element of giving back. It could be a high-end hotel, for example, that has a school for the underprivileged in the community or provides help to families of employees. The ways to give back are endless, even if you’re making money. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: The aesthetics are familiar, but the menus go beyond your standard egg plate.
It's no secret that New York City is running low on old-school diners; they were vanishing even before the pandemic. From 2014 to early 2019, 15 diners were sold, a figure that didn't include the many owners who lost their leases during that period. These closures signal, to some, the end of old New York as we knew it.
But that hasn't stopped a new breed of diner from cropping up, ostensibly for the younger set and usually with decent branding and a social media presence.
Diner Aesthetics With Modern Menus
On a recent evening at Golden Diner in the Two Bridges neighborhood of Manhattan, I followed a chile crisp-spiked vegan wedge salad with two massive pancakes and a chicken katsu club. The bill didn't exactly come out to Waffle House prices, but the energy was similar: simple, uncomplicated, tasty. You can't beat pancakes after dark.
When Golden Diner arrived in 2019, it showed that the diner, is still a form that can be made over and made over well. The chef Sam Yoo did so by bringing his professional chef bona fides and his Asian roots to diner staples.
Baby Blues Luncheonette, in East Williamsburg in Brooklyn, on the other hand, is a Greek diner for the 21st century. (For a decidedly 20th century Greek diner, try Tina's Place at Wilson and Flushing Avenues in Bushwick, Brooklyn.) There's the H.L.T. with grilled halloumi, lettuce and heirloom tomatoes on Pullman bread, with the option to add bacon and avocado. But I think the real play is to order the Plato plate with scrambled eggs, bacon, warm pita, half an avocado and grated halloumi. It'll cost you $ 20 before tax and tip -- not bad for an increasingly expensive corner of Brooklyn.
Out on Staten Island in Bulls Head, there's Sandwich and Pickle, which is more great-aunt's living room than linoleum fever dream (see: floral wallpaper and thrift-store décor). But the deli-as-diner ethos that runs deep throughout the menu has really piqued my interest, especially the pastrami and egg bagels and latkes Benedict. And any restaurant with park adjacency -- in this case, the downright bucolic Willowbrook Park -- deserves a visit. Think of the post-meal walks!
Safeguarding the Diners of Yore
There's also a movement of diner preservation. As I wrote while answering reader questions a few months back, restaurants like Kellogg's Diner in Williamsburg and S & P Lunch (formerly Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop) in the Flatiron district have persisted because new, younger owners stepped in to carry on their legacies. The 78-year-old Three Decker Diner at the corner of Manhattan and Norman Avenues in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, is under new management after the previous owners decided to retire. As the Eater journalist Emma Orlow reported, the menu and the prices have remained largely the same, which is to say affordable, though the coffee is now of the third-wave variety.
And even though the year is still quite young, I'm not sure that any preservation project will be met with more enthusiasm than the new, "deluxe" Superiority Burger, which will occupy the East Village space that housed a diner, the Odessa Restaurant, for more than two decades. The food will be decidedly non-Ukrainian, and the restaurant is unlikely to be open for 24 hours as Odessa was. But from what's been shared on Instagram so far, the freshly repainted space looks largely the same, with wide booths and misaligned, newly de-gummed tables. And at least it's not becoming a bank, which we all know is the truest sign of the end.

Hazel McCallion, 101, Forceful Mayor With 36-Year Run, a Canadian Record: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tough, pragmatic and brusque when she had to be, she helped transform Mississauga from a sleepy Toronto suburb into one of the country's largest and most dynamic cities.
Hazel McCallion, who as the longest-serving mayor in Canadian history transformed the sleepy Toronto suburb of Mississauga into a multicultural dynamo and the country's sixth-largest city, died at her home there on Jan. 29, nine years after she ended her 36-year run. She was 101.
Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario and a close friend of Mrs. McCallion's, said she died from pancreatic cancer.
When Mrs. McCallion first won office, in 1978, Mississauga was a sprawling, centerless community of about 250,000 people, little more than an extension of Toronto, its neighbor to the east. Today it has a dense downtown core of skyscrapers, robust arts institutions and 750,000 people.
And while Mississauga in the 1970s was overwhelmingly white, the city is now one of Canada's most diverse, drawing immigrants from East and South Asia.
Mrs. McCallion did not just survive but thrive through 12 terms by blending thrifty pragmatism with open-armed populism.
Though she leaned slightly to the political left, she did not hew to a party platform or ideology. Her singular goal was to bring prosperity to Mississauga, which she did by keeping budgets trim -- the city rarely carried debt or raised property taxes -- and being unafraid to assert her city's interests against its neighbors or in the Ontario provincial government.
"Hazel McCallion does not caution," the magazine Toronto Life wrote in 2003. "She berates. She harangues. She, well, bites off people's heads."
But if politicians and bureaucrats feared her, voters loved her.
After she decided not to run for re-election in 2014, she picked her successor, Bonnie Crombie, who won handily. No one was surprised: Mrs. McCallion left office with an 85 percent approval rating. They called her Hurricane Hazel, a tribute to her brash style more than a reference to the weather disaster that killed 80 people in Toronto in 1954.
Her reputation was cemented just months after she took office, when a train carrying tons of toxic and flammable chemicals overturned near the middle of Mississauga. She immediately ordered most of the town, some 220,000 residents, to evacuate. Over several days she was there alongside the police and firefighters, ushering people to safety, undeterred by an ankle sprained along the way.
And when it was over, she was fierce in her demand for damages.
"It will be an astronomical sum," she told reporters, "and somebody is going to get the bill."
Mrs. McCallion played professional hockey in the 1930s, and she remained the picture of ruddy health through her time as mayor, a fact that endeared her to voters. Even into her 80s she carried a hockey stick in her car trunk, in case she came across a game. She fished, hiked and once, when she was 87, biked five miles to work to promote alternatives to driving.
Mrs. McCallion had come to politics from a career with an engineering company, starting in 1964 as a candidate for a municipal office in Streetsville, a village within Mississauga's borders. After the two entities, along with a few others, combined to create the city of Mississauga, she moved effortlessly into the mayor's office after defeating the incumbent by just 3,000 votes in her 1978 race.
She never faced another serious opponent, and in two of her elections she didn't face one at all, winning by acclamation. She did this without campaigning or fund-raising; she encouraged supporters eager to open their wallets to give to charity instead.
"I don't run a campaign, as you know," she told the Canadian Press news agency in 2010. "I'm there with them four years. I don't wait for an election to come along to campaign."
She was Mississauga's chief booster, promoting it as a dynamic place that welcomed the businesses and the influx of immigrants entering Canada in the 1970s and '80s.
She was not without critics, who considered her imperious and even dictatorial. And she conceded that she kept a tight grip on the Mississauga City Council, allowing little dissent, at least in public.
In 1982 and again in 2009, she was accused of failing to disclose conflicts of interest: first when land she and her husband owned was included in a possible development project, and later when she lobbied for a hotel project in which one of her sons was an investor.
The first instance was not illegal at the time, and the second, which did go to court, was thrown out by a judge in 2013. Taken together, it was a record her defenders considered remarkably clean for a political career that began before most of her voters were born.
Hazel Journeaux was born on Feb. 14, 1921, in Port-Daniel, a small town on the Gaspé Peninsula, in southeast Quebec. Her father, Herbert, ran a fishing and processing company, and her mother, Amanda (Travers) Journeaux, was a nurse.
The family moved to Montreal when Hazel was a child, and after high school she took secretarial and business classes before being hired by M.W. Kellogg, an engineering company.
She spent several years as a professional hockey player in Montreal, cementing a lifelong love for the sport. She played center for a team sponsored by Kik, a cola brand, and made $ 5 a game, the equivalent of about $ 65 in U.S. dollars today. In 1987 the Women's World Hockey Championship named its trophy the Hazel McCallion World Cup.
Her hockey career ended in 1940, when Kellogg opened an office in Toronto and she was sent to manage it.
She married Sam McCallion in 1951. He died in 1997. She is survived by her sons, Peter and Paul; her daughter, Linda Burgess; and a granddaughter.
Mrs. McCallion spent more than two decades as a manager with Kellogg before leaving to work with her husband and his printing business, and to get involved in politics in Streetsville. After three years on the village council, she was elected mayor of Streetsville in 1970.
After the creation of the city of Mississauga, she served on its council for four years before being elected mayor in 1978 at age 57.
Before, during and after her time as mayor, she led a backbreaking workday, rising at 5:30 and starting meetings at 7. She swatted away questions about leaving office, even long after most people her age would have retired.
"Having time on my hands is not acceptable," she told The Toronto Star in 2001, when she was 80. "If I quit, I'd have to find something very challenging to do. And what could be more challenging than being mayor?"
After she finally did end her run as mayor in 2014, at 93, she continued to work. She served as the first chancellor of the Hazel McCallion Campus of Sheridan College, a Toronto-area technical school; she advised Mr. Ford, the Ontario premier; and she oversaw the Greater Toronto Airport Authority, a job that in 2019 took her on a tour of the world's busiest airports.
In a 2022 interview with the newspaper The National Post, she summed up her philosophy by recalling something her mother would ask her when she was young: "What do you want to accomplish in life? Do you want to be a follower or do you want to take advantage of opportunities to be a leader?"

Sprawling Trial Begins For Democracy Leaders: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Forty-seven defendants, including well-known figures like Joshua Wong, are charged with subversion under the national security law that China imposed in 2020.
The political candidates represented the vanguard of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. Numbering in the dozens, they had planned to run for the city's legislature in 2020, after months of turbulent protests calling for greater freedom from China.
By the time the election was held, more than a year later, none of the candidates could run. Most were in jail, where many still languish today, charged with subversion in the largest case yet involving the national security law Beijing imposed on the city in 2020. Their arrests laid bare the lengths to which China's government would go to crush dissent in Hong Kong, which was long accustomed to many of the freedoms of speech and assembly found in the West.
After years of fits and starts, the trial involving the 47 pro-democracy lawmakers, academics and activists began on Monday at a courthouse in Hong Kong amid tight security. Large police vehicles lined the roads nearby as a line of more than 100 people snaked around the courthouse in the early morning, waiting to enter. Because there were so many defendants, the court broadcast the proceedings into several other rooms.
Of the 47 defendants, only 16 are contesting the charges. The rest entered guilty pleas, including Joshua Wong, one of the most globally recognized Hong Kong pro-democracy figures, and Benny Tai, a former law professor. As one of the defendants, Ng Kin-wai, a former district official, took the stand, he declared, sarcastically: "I tried to commit subversion against the totalitarian regime, but failed. I plead guilty."
Most of the defendants, if not all, are expected to receive prison sentences, which could range from less than three years to life.
"The trial of the 47 represents a turning point in the crackdown because it reveals the true purpose of the national security law," said Victoria Hui, an associate professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame who studies Hong Kong.
"They're not targeting a small minority of people throwing petrol bombs," Professor Hui said. "Those people have already been arrested. Instead, they're targeting the legitimate opposition, people who believed there was still a little bit left to defend of Hong Kong's autonomy and freedom."
Already, the defendants' arrests and lengthy detention have dealt a blow to the remaining vestiges of civil society. The 47 defendants, who comprise 42 opposition candidates and five election organizers, come from a cross-section of Hong Kong -- politicians, academics, union organizers and journalists.
They include Claudia Mo, 66, a veteran journalist-turned-politician known to many as "Auntie Mo"; Eddie Chu, 45, a former legislator and early champion of the city's "localist" movement, which aimed to preserve Hong Kong's identity; Carol Ng, 52, an ex-flight attendant and labor activist; and Gwyneth Ho, 32, a former journalist, who famously reported from the scene of a mob attack on antigovernment demonstrators trapped in a subway station.
To take stock of the group's plight is to recognize how much Hong Kong has been transformed since pro-democracy protests erupted in 2019.
China's subsequent crackdown brought changes that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago: an ideological makeover of the public education system; the demise of one of Asia's most staunchly independent media industries; the arrest of Hong Kong's highest-ranking Roman Catholic cleric, the nonagenarian Cardinal Joseph Zen; and the erasure of political opposition in Hong Kong's legislature, paving the way for passage of pro-Beijing laws like a "patriots only" litmus test for political candidates. The high degree of autonomy Hong Kong was promised for 50 years after Britain returned the former colony to China in 1997 has all but eroded.
No change, however, has been more dramatic than those taking place in Hong Kong's legal system, which has been superseded by the national security law -- a harsh reality being felt acutely by the 47 democrats.
They are charged with trying to subvert state power for their roles in an unofficial "primary election." The poll was an attempt by the opposition to select its best candidates, as part of a last-ditch effort to win enough seats in the legislature to block the government's budget. The budget maneuver, sanctioned under Hong Kong law, could have dissolved the legislature and forced Carrie Lam, then the city's top official, to step down.
Nearly three-quarters of the 47 democrats are currently in jail -- and, in most cases, have been since they were formally charged nearly two years ago, on Feb. 28, 2021. Such long detention is unusual for Hong Kong, where defendants in other types of cases are often able to get bail. The national security law's sweeping provisions, however, include a high threshold for bail, which in effect lets the authorities hold defendants for months or even years before trial. Critics say that amounts to a presumption that defendants are guilty.
Supporters of the activists say their detention has caused enormous mental strain, particularly for those held in solitary confinement. Some of them are already in prison, serving sentences on other charges. Sam Cheung, a 27-year-old elected official representing a small district, missed the birth of his first child. Tiffany Yuen, 29, another district official, was not permitted to leave prison for the funeral of her grandmother.
Mr. Tai, the former law professor, is expected to receive the harshest sentence at the end of the 90-day trial because of his role devising the plan to hold the primary election.
The security law requires judges to impose minimum sentences anywhere from three to 10 years, but defendants can receive lighter punishments if they testify against others. Prosecutors have already indicated that three of the 47 democrats who helped organize the primary had agreed to provide testimony.
Activists and legal experts say the strategy is designed to sow mistrust among the defendants and, combined with the grueling detentions, break their morale, to make them more willing to cooperate with prosecutors. The coercive tactic, scholars say, highlights another way that Hong Kong is adopting norms from mainland China.
"So far as you get a guilty plea, that gives the regime the opportunity to make the point that these wrongdoers have known the error in their ways," said Eva Pils, a law scholar at Kings College London who studies China.
By pressuring the defendants individually, the authorities also undermine the democracy movement overall, said Ted Hui, a former lawmaker who fled Hong Kong a month before the 47 were arrested.
While acknowledging the emotional distress the group was under, Mr. Hui said that for any defendant to provide evidence that could implicate another would amount to a betrayal.
"I understand the circumstances, but I'm still angry and heartbroken," Mr. Hui said by telephone from Adelaide, Australia. "I also cannot say it's entirely their fault, because the circumstances are created by the pressures of the regime. This has hurt the democracy movement. That is one of the goals achieved by the regime -- to divide us."
The trial has stirred difficult and complicated emotions within the small community of lawmakers and activists who were able to flee Hong Kong before they could be arrested.
Nathan Law, a prominent pro-democracy advocate and candidate in the primary election who escaped days before the passage of the national security law, said it was painful to read about close friends and fellow activists such as Mr. Wong facing long prison terms.
"They were just participating in a primary election," Mr. Law said from London. "None of us would think of that as something that would be named as subversion that could lead to years of imprisonment."
"Through these cases, you also understand that the Hong Kong we used to know is gone," he said.
The trial of the 47 is one of several national security cases winding their way through Hong Kong's courts. Few have attracted more attention than that of Jimmy Lai, the 75-year-old founder of the tabloid newspaper Apple Daily, which was forced to close down in 2021. Mr. Lai, a longtime critic of China's ruling Communist Party, has been serving a five-year, nine-month sentence on what human rights groups say are trumped-up charges of fraud. He is also facing trial on the national security offense of colluding with foreign forces.
The ratcheting-up of prosecutions marks the beginning of a new, more authoritarian era in Hong Kong, observers say, one in which political persecution will be used to strike fear in people so that few will consider protesting or challenging Beijing's authority again.
"What they're trying to do is to redraw the lines of acceptable, peaceful political activity," said Thomas Kellogg, the executive director of the Center for Asian Law.

HONG KONG — The political candidates represented the vanguard of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement. Numbering in the dozens, they had planned to run for the city’s legislature in 2020, after months of turbulent protests calling for greater freedom from China.
By the time the election was held, more than a year later, none of the candidates could run. Most were in jail, where many still languish today, charged with subversion in the largest case yet involving the national security law Beijing imposed on the city in 2020. Their arrests laid bare the lengths to which China’s government would go to crush dissent in Hong Kong, which was long accustomed to many of the freedoms of speech and assembly found in the West.
After years of fits and starts, the trial involving the 47 pro-democracy lawmakers, academics and activists began Monday at a courthouse in Hong Kong amid tight security. Large police vehicles lined the roads nearby as a line of more than 100 people snaked around the courthouse in the early morning, waiting to enter. Because there were so many defendants, the court broadcast the proceedings into several other rooms.
Of the 47 defendants, only 16 are contesting the charges. The rest entered guilty pleas, including Joshua Wong, one of the most globally recognized Hong Kong pro-democracy figures, and Benny Tai, a former law professor. As one of the defendants, Ng Kin-wai, a former district official, took the stand, he declared, sarcastically: “I tried to commit subversion against the totalitarian regime but failed. I plead guilty.”
Most of the defendants, if not all, are expected to receive prison sentences, which could range from less than three years to life.
“The trial of the 47 represents a turning point in the crackdown because it reveals the true purpose of the national security law,” said Victoria Hui, an associate professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame who studies Hong Kong.
“They’re not targeting a small minority of people throwing petrol bombs,” Hui said. “Those people have already been arrested. Instead, they’re targeting the legitimate opposition, people who believed there was still a little bit left to defend of Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedom.”
Already, the defendants’ arrests and lengthy detention have dealt a blow to the remaining vestiges of civil society. The 47 defendants, who comprise 42 opposition candidates and five election organizers, come from a cross section of Hong Kong — politicians, academics, union organizers and journalists.
They include Claudia Mo, 66, a veteran journalist-turned-politician known to many as “Auntie Mo”; Eddie Chu, 45, a former legislator and early champion of the city’s “localist” movement, which aimed to preserve Hong Kong’s identity; Carol Ng, 52, an ex-flight attendant and labor activist; and Gwyneth Ho, 32, a former journalist, who famously reported from the scene of a mob attack on anti-government demonstrators trapped in a subway station.
To take stock of the group’s plight is to recognize how much Hong Kong has been transformed since pro-democracy protests erupted in 2019.
China’s subsequent crackdown brought changes that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago: an ideological makeover of the public education system; the demise of one of Asia’s most staunchly independent media industries; the arrest of Hong Kong’s highest-ranking Roman Catholic cleric, nonagenarian Cardinal Joseph Zen; and the erasure of political opposition in Hong Kong’s legislature, paving the way for passage of pro-Beijing laws such as a “patriots only” litmus test for political candidates. The high degree of autonomy Hong Kong was promised for 50 years after Britain returned the former colony to China in 1997 has all but eroded.
No change, however, has been more dramatic than those taking place in Hong Kong’s legal system, which has been superseded by the national security law — a harsh reality being felt acutely by the 47 democrats.
They are charged with trying to subvert state power for their roles in an unofficial “primary election.” The poll was an attempt by the opposition to select its best candidates, as part of a last-ditch effort to win enough seats in the legislature to block the government’s budget.

What to Know About the ‘Hong Kong 47’ and the National Security Law

Vaguely worded and broad in scope, the law was crafted and enacted from Beijing. It quickly transformed life in Hong Kong.
Boisterous demonstrations all but disappeared. Newsrooms were raided and shuttered. Labor unions, pro-democracy coalitions and other civil society groups disbanded, one after another.
Chinese officials have used the national security law, as it is called, to crack down on dissent in Hong Kong, essentially discarding the “one country, two systems” pledge that guaranteed the city a high degree of autonomy after Britain gave it back to China. In the past two years, more than 200 people have been arrested under the law, and more than 3,000 have been prosecuted on other charges over their roles in anti-government protests.
Virtually all of Hong Kong’s opposition figures, longtime advocates for democracy, were detained on a single day in 2021. Forty-seven of them were charged with subversion under the new law, accused of conspiring in a plot to disrupt the local Beijing-backed government. Now, with most of the defendants having spent nearly two years behind bars, their trial begins Monday, a stark reminder of how dangerous any kind of organized dissent has become.
Here’s what to know about the law and the Hong Kong 47, as the defendants are often called.
The law was drafted in secret.
Free speech and judicial independence have long been cherished in Hong Kong and are protected under the Basic Law, as the city’s mini-constitution is known. But the Chinese government, which administers Hong Kong as a semi-autonomous territory, sees those principles as secondary to its control.
In 2003, not long after Hong Kong was returned to China, local pro-Beijing officials tried to pass security legislation. But a draft of the bill raised fears that civil liberties and human rights would be diminished. The legislation was shelved after a mass demonstration.
Chinese authorities took a different approach in 2020. A year earlier, a bill in Hong Kong that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China had set off months of protests. To preempt another wave of dissent, Beijing drafted the security law in secret, bypassing Hong Kong’s legislature. Its provisions were revealed a day before the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover to China. The law took effect immediately, a warning to the many residents who often marked the anniversary with pro-democracy protests.
The 47 democrats were charged over an election.
The main defendant in the case is Benny Tai, a law professor and leader of the Occupy Central movement in 2014, which demanded freer elections.
Since 2019, Tai had argued that the pro-democracy camp should hold an unofficial primary election, to find out who its most electable candidates were. Under his strategy, if the democrats could gain a majority in the legislature, they could block the government’s budget, which by law would have forced an ouster of Carrie Lam, then the city’s deeply unpopular leader.
The primary was held in July 2020, and turnout was high, despite authorities’ declaration that it could violate the new security law. The charges against the Hong Kong 47 center on the primary and Tai’s broader plan, which is being called a subversive plot to paralyze the government.
The case has ensnared longtime opponents of the Chinese government like Joshua Wong, who became world-famous as a teenage student leader during the 2014 “Umbrella Movement” protests for freer elections of the city’s leader.
Several other defendants, like Claudia Mo, Eddie Chu and Lam Cheuk-ting, were veteran lawmakers who had been at the forefront of Hong Kong’s democracy movement for years. Others, like Gwyneth Ho, Owen Chow and Winnie Yu, represented a newer generation of activists and unionists, politicized in the wake of the 2019 protests.
The trial is meant to send a message.
Analysts said the case demonstrated the wide reach of the national security law, which authorities initially said would only affect a small minority of the city.
“It’s hard to overestimate the enormity of this case, because it’s basically meant to be a knockout blow to Hong Kong’s peaceful political mainstream opposition,” said Thomas Kellogg, the executive director of the Center for Asian Law.
“This is a real choice by the Hong Kong government and Beijing,” he continued. “They could have focused on people who were talking about independence, for example, or people who had been more harshly critical of Hong Kong government policy and Beijing’s policy toward Hong Kong. Instead, they have gone after every sector of civic life.”
The mass arrests of the democrats, in January 2021, were followed by an overhaul of the city’s elections, with new laws to root out candidates who could be deemed disloyal to Beijing. The city ran a “patriots-only” election that December, and in 2022 a legislature was installed whose members were all pro-Beijing, except one.
“It really tells the world that as long as you are in alignment with the pro-democracy movement, you will be considered a criminal,” said Eric Lai, an expert in Hong Kong law.
Many of the 47 defendants have indicated they will plead guilty.
Eva Pils, a law professor at King’s College London, said guilty pleas would allow China to argue that the “wrongdoers” had seen the error of their ways. “Part of the purpose of that messaging operation is to normalize the criminalization of political dissent in Hong Kong,” she said.
Many protest tactics are banned under the security law.
Many of the offenses listed under the national security law are tactics that Hong Kong protesters used in 2019, such as disrupting public transport and vandalizing government property.
While adding a vast security apparatus to the city, the law also introduced socialist legal concepts to Hong Kong’s common law system, targeting four types of crime. They are:
— Secession: speech or actions advocating Hong Kong’s independence from China.
— Subversion: undermining the authority of the Chinese central government, including disrupting its activities and vandalizing its offices.
— Terrorist activities: violence and disruptions to public services for political purposes.
— Collusion with a foreign country or with “external elements”: receiving help from countries, institutions and individuals in imposing sanctions against China, rigging local elections or inciting hatred toward the government.
Prison sentences under the law can be harsh. Defendants convicted as “principal offenders” can be imprisoned for life, “active” participants face up to 10 years and minor players can be put away for up to three years.
Hong Kong’s judicial system has changed dramatically.
The security law has allowed Beijing to exert unprecedented control over Hong Kong.
With its implementation in 2020 came a web of new national security divisions within the city’s police force and prosecutor’s office. Chinese security forces were allowed to operate openly in Hong Kong for the first time, from a newly created base. This apparatus is led by a national security panel committee that includes Hong Kong’s chief executive, as well as Beijing’s top representative in the city.
The language of the law also gives Beijing the final say on how it should be interpreted, in effect circumventing decisions made in Hong Kong courts. The chief executive, the city’s Beijing-appointed leader, selects the judges who are allowed to hear national security cases. The law also takes precedence should it come into conflict with other laws.
The vast majority of the people charged under the law have been accused of speech crimes, like calling for Hong Kong’s independence or for sanctions against China. Most have been denied bail, which is difficult to obtain under the law.
This year will also see the trial of perhaps Beijing’s highest-profile target in Hong Kong: media mogul Jimmy Lai, a strident critic of China’s government. Critics say that his case demonstrates the erosion of free speech, journalism and judicial independence in Hong Kong in one fell swoop. His trial is scheduled for September.

Full text: Beijing used a national security law to quash dissent. Now another warning is being sent, with the mass trial of what was once Hong Kong's political opposition.
Vaguely worded and broad in scope, the law was crafted and enacted from Beijing. It quickly transformed life in Hong Kong.
Boisterous demonstrations all but disappeared. Newsrooms were raided and shuttered. Labor unions, pro-democracy coalitions and other civil society groups disbanded, one after another.

Many of the offenses listed under the national security law are tactics that Hong Kong protesters used in 2019, such as disrupting public transport and vandalizing government property.
While adding a vast security apparatus to the city, the law also introduced socialist legal concepts to Hong Kong's common law system, targeting four types of crime. They are:
Secession: speech or actions advocating Hong Kong's independence from China.
Subversion: undermining the authority of the Chinese central government, including disrupting its activities and vandalizing its offices.
Terrorist activities: violence and disruptions to public services for political purposes.
Collusion with a foreign country or with "external elements": receiving help from foreign countries, institutions and individuals in imposing sanctions against China, rigging local elections or inciting hatred toward the government.
Prison sentences under the law can be harsh. Defendants convicted as "principal offenders" can be imprisoned for life, "active" participants face up to 10 years and minor players can be put away for up to three years.
Hong Kong's judicial system has changed dramatically.
The security law has allowed Beijing to exert unprecedented control over Hong Kong.
With its implementation in 2020 came a web of new national security divisions within the city's police force and prosecutor's office. Chinese security forces were allowed to operate openly in Hong Kong for the first time, from a newly created base. This apparatus is led by a national security committee that includes Hong Kong's chief executive, as well as Beijing's top representative in the city.
The language of the law also gives Beijing the final say on how it should be interpreted, in effect circumventing decisions made in Hong Kong courts. The chief executive, the city's Beijing-appointed leader, selects the judges who are allowed to hear national security cases. The law also takes precedence should it come into conflict with other laws.
The vast majority of the people charged under the law have been accused of speech crimes, like calling for Hong Kong's independence or for sanctions against China. Most have been denied bail, which is difficult to obtain under the law.
This year will also see the trial of perhaps Beijing's highest-profile target in Hong Kong: the media mogul Jimmy Lai, a strident critic of the Chinese government. Critics say that his case demonstrates the erosion of free speech, journalism and judicial independence in Hong Kong in one fell swoop. His trial is scheduled for September.

Vaguely worded and broad in scope, the law was crafted and enacted from Beijing. It quickly transformed life in Hong Kong.
Boisterous demonstrations all but disappeared. Newsrooms were raided and shuttered. Labor unions, pro-democracy coalitions and other civil society groups disbanded, one after another.
Chinese officials have used the national security law, as it is called, to crack down on dissent in Hong Kong, essentially discarding the “one country, two systems” pledge that guaranteed the city a high degree of autonomy after Britain gave it back to China. In the past two years, more than 200 people have been arrested under the law, and more than 3,000 have been prosecuted on other charges over their roles in anti-government protests.
Virtually all of Hong Kong’s opposition figures, longtime advocates for democracy, were detained on a single day in 2021. Forty-seven of them were charged with subversion under the new law, accused of conspiring in a plot to disrupt the local Beijing-backed government. Now, with most of the defendants having spent nearly two years behind bars, their trial begins Monday, a stark reminder of how dangerous any kind of organized dissent has become.
Here’s what to know about the law and the Hong Kong 47, as the defendants are often called.
The law was drafted in secret.
Free speech and judicial independence have long been cherished in Hong Kong and are protected under the Basic Law, as the city’s mini-constitution is known. But the Chinese government, which administers Hong Kong as a semi-autonomous territory, sees those principles as secondary to its control.
In 2003, not long after Hong Kong was returned to China, local pro-Beijing officials tried to pass security legislation. But a draft of the bill raised fears that civil liberties and human rights would be diminished. It was shelved after a mass demonstration.
Chinese authorities took a different approach in 2020. A year earlier, a bill in Hong Kong that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China had set off months of protests. To preempt another wave of dissent, Beijing drafted the security law in secret, bypassing Hong Kong’s legislature. Its provisions were revealed a day before the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover to China. The law took effect immediately, a warning to residents who often marked the anniversary with pro-democracy protests.
The 47 democrats were charged over an election.
The main defendant in the case is Benny Tai, a law professor and leader of the Occupy Central movement in 2014, which demanded freer elections.
Since 2019, Tai had argued that the pro-democracy camp should hold an unofficial primary election, to find out who its most electable candidates were. Under his strategy, if the democrats could gain a majority in the legislature, they could block the government’s budget, which by law would have forced an ouster of Carrie Lam, then the city’s deeply unpopular leader.
The primary was held in July 2020, and turnout was high, despite authorities’ declaration that it could violate the new security law. The charges against the Hong Kong 47 center on the primary and Tai’s broader plan, which is being called a subversive plot to paralyze the government.
The case has ensnared longtime opponents of the Chinese government like Joshua Wong, who became world-famous as a teenage student leader during the 2014 “Umbrella Movement” protests for freer elections of the city’s leader.
Several other defendants, like Claudia Mo, Eddie Chu and Lam Cheuk-ting, were veteran lawmakers who had been at the forefront of Hong Kong’s democracy movement for years. Others, like Gwyneth Ho, Owen Chow and Winnie Yu, represented a newer generation of activists and unionists, politicized in the wake of the 2019 protests.
The trial is meant to send a message.
Analysts said the case demonstrated the wide reach of the national security law, which authorities initially said would only affect a small minority of the city.
“It’s hard to overestimate the enormity of this case, because it’s basically meant to be a knockout blow to Hong Kong’s peaceful political mainstream opposition,” said Thomas Kellogg, the executive director of the Center for Asian Law.
“This is a real choice by the Hong Kong government and Beijing,” he continued. “They could have focused on people who were talking about independence, for example, or people who had been more harshly critical of Hong Kong government policy and Beijing’s policy toward Hong Kong. Instead, they have gone after every sector of civic life.”
The mass arrests of the democrats, in January 2021, were followed by an overhaul of the city’s elections, with new laws to root out candidates who could be deemed disloyal to Beijing. The city ran a “patriots-only” election that December, and in 2022 a legislature was installed whose members were all pro-Beijing, except one.
“It really tells the world that as long as you are in alignment with the pro-democracy movement, you will be considered a criminal,” said Eric Lai, an expert in Hong Kong law.
Many of the 47 defendants have indicated they will plead guilty.
Eva Pils, a law professor at King’s College London, said guilty pleas would allow China to argue that the “wrongdoers” had seen the error of their ways. “Part of the purpose of that messaging operation is to normalize the criminalization of political dissent in Hong Kong,” she said.

Billy Packer, Analyst With Keen Mind and Pungent Style, Dies at 82: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With partners on NBC and then CBS, and with a rapid, opinionated style, he was heard during every N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament from 1975 to 2008.
Billy Packer, the sharp-eyed, opinionated lead college basketball analyst for NBC and CBS whose commentary was heard during every Final Four game of the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament from 1975 to 2008, died on Thursday in Charlotte, N.C. He was 82.
His son Brandt said the cause was kidney failure.
A former point guard and assistant coach at Wake Forest University, Mr. Packer began as a broadcast analyst in the early 1970s as the men's tournament, and especially the Final Four, became the signature sports event known as March Madness. He took to the national stage easily with a fast-talking, straightforward style and opinions that provoked strong feelings among fans.
"He had the ability to make every fan base feel he was against them, and he relished that role," Jim Nantz, who became Mr. Packer's partner at CBS Sports in 1991, said in a phone interview on Friday. "He wore the black hat better than anyone I'd ever seen." He added: "North Carolina thought he was in the bag for Duke. Duke thought he was pro-North Carolina. He loved it."
At NBC Sports, Mr. Packer worked with Dick Enberg and Al McGuire, a former coach at Marquette University, forming one of the most popular announcing teams in sports. Mr. Packer and Mr. McGuire had different views not just of basketball but also of the world, and they played off each other well, with Mr. Enberg acting as the straight man.
Their partnership broke up in 1981, when the tournament's television rights were acquired by CBS. Switching networks, Mr. Packer worked with several partners, including Brent Musburger and Mr. Nantz, with whom he stayed until he retired in 2008.
Mr. Packer was largely serious on the air, without any schtick, unlike ESPN's exuberant Dick Vitale; he stuck instead to X's and O's and strategy, with a healthy dose of opinion about the game he was watching and the state of college basketball.
"The poor guy is so serious about basketball that he can't have any fun with it," Mr. McGuire once said. "It's all life or death. There's no in-between with Billy. If it's on his mind, it jumps out of his mouth. But bless his heart, his mind is just as fast as his mouth."
In 2004, Mr. Packer excoriated St. Joseph's University as a No. 1 seed in its region in the N.C.A.A. tournament. The next year, he criticized N.C.A.A. officials for choosing some mid-major conference teams for the tournament while excluding teams from larger conferences that he deemed better.
More problematic was the time in 1996 when he called the Georgetown University guard Allen Iverson, who is Black, a "tough little monkey." He apologized on the air, saying he had not intended the comment to be racial. "Al Capone was a tough monkey," he said. "Mike Ditka was a tough monkey. Bobby Hurley was a tough monkey."
In 2000, he snapped at two female students who were checking press passes at Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium, saying, according to news reports, "Since when do we let women control who gets into a men's basketball game?" He later apologized.
Anthony William Paczkowski was born on Feb. 25, 1940, in Wellsville, N.Y., near the Pennsylvania border, and moved to Bethlehem, Pa., where his father, also named Anthony, was hired to coach the Lehigh University men's basketball team. The elder Mr. Packer changed the family name soon afterward. Billy's mother, Lois (Cruikshank) Packer, was a homemaker.
Billy played guard at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., and led the team to two Atlantic Coast Conference titles and to the Final Four in 1962, which the Demon Deacons lost to Ohio State. He totaled 1,316 points in his career, finishing second in scoring in each of his three years.
He graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1962 and returned to Wake Forest in 1966 as an assistant coach. He held that job until 1970 while also working in the furniture business. In the early 1970s, while Mr. Packer was sales manager for a radio station in Winston-Salem, a friend asked him to fill in for the announcer of an A.C.C. game being televised by a syndicator.
"I wasn't nervous," he told The Chapel Hill News in 1974. "I figured I'd just walk in and tell the people what I saw, and that's it. And that's been my approach throughout."
He became a regular on syndicated broadcasts and was hired by NBC in 1974, putting him in place to be at the center of college basketball for the next 34 years. He was there for John Wooden's last game as the U.C.L.A coach in 1975; the title-game victory of Magic Johnson's Michigan State team over Larry Bird's Indiana State team in 1979; North Carolina State's last-second win over Houston to win the 1983 championship; and the successes of Duke, Indiana, Louisville, Kansas and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
"He knew the game -- cold," Kevin O'Malley, the former CBS Sports executive who hired Mr. Packer in 1981, wrote in an email. He added, "Billy was the best basketball analyst at doing one very important thing in a fast-paced game -- 'see it and say it.' He wasted no words and reacted to what he saw on the floor instantaneously -- a really invaluable trait for the broadcast."
After retiring from CBS, Mr. Packer was replaced by Clark Kellogg.
In addition to his son Brandt, a golf producer at NBC Sports and Golf Channel, Mr. Packer is survived by another son, Mark, the host of a daily television program on the ACC Network, which covers A.C.C. sports; his daughter, Liz Kimberly; four grandchildren; his sister, Carol Dague; and his brother, Richard. His wife, Barbara (Sucansky) Packer, died last year.
Mr. Packer said that broadcasting was a hobby for him, compared with his interests in real estate and golf course development and art collecting. He also pursued other paths: He hired a psychic to find the knife used in the murders of O.J. Simpson's former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman in 1994. And he started a defense fund for Richard Jewell, the security guard who was wrongly suspected of planting a pipe bomb in Atlanta that killed one person and injured more than 100 during the 1996 Summer Olympics.
Mr. Packer had an entrepreneurial streak that he demonstrated on the Friday before the 1995 Final Four at the Kingdome in Seattle. Bryant Reeves, the Oklahoma State center, shattered the backboard on a layup drill during the team's practice, sending pieces of it all over the court. Mr. Packer went after the shards, stuffing his pockets with pieces shaped like three- or four-carat diamonds.
After an N.C.A.A. official made him surrender the pieces, he found the person who had swept them up, and he stuffed his pockets again.
"He didn't give up easily," Mr. Nantz said, "But when Oklahoma State got knocked out in the semifinals, I asked him what he was going to do with the shards. And he said: 'They're not worth anything. They lost. It's garbage now."'

Billy Packer, a sharp-eyed, opinionated lead college basketball analyst for NBC and CBS whose commentary was heard during every Final Four game of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament from 1975 to 2008, died Thursday in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was 82.
