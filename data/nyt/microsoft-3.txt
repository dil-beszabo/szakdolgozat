Full text: It is one of Europe's fastest-growing economies, and while investors and tourists are flocking to the country, memories of austerity measures are still fresh for Greeks.
Paris Skouros pointed toward the sky outside his office in Athens on a recent weekday. In the past six months, four high-rises had sprung up, built by Greek and international builders to be sold for use as tourist rentals, foreign real estate investments and company offices. Farther afield, a fresh crop of new buildings dotted the horizon.
Greece's financial crisis almost ruined his firm, Skouros & Sons, an elevator company. Years of harsh austerity measures imposed by international bailouts had been wrenching, Mr. Skouros said, as new construction ground to a standstill. But now an economic recovery has barreled in.
"During the crisis, we just wanted to survive," Mr. Skouros said, as the sound of hammers hitting sheet metal rang out in his workshop. "Now we're profitable, and business is so strong that we can't find enough workers to keep up with demand."
Laden with debt it couldn't pay back, Greece nearly broke the eurozone a decade ago. Today, it is one of Europe's fastest-growing economies. In a significant acknowledgment of the country's turnaround, credit ratings agencies have been upgrading their appraisal of Greece's debt, and opening the door for large foreign investors.
The economy is growing at twice the eurozone average, and unemployment, while still high at 11 percent, is the lowest in over a decade. Tourists have returned in droves, fueling a construction frenzy and new jobs. Multinational companies, like Microsoft and Pfizer, are investing. And banks that almost collapsed have cleaned up and are lending again, benefiting the broader economy.
Greece still faces risks. Its mountain of debt has shrunk, but at 166 percent of the economy, it's among the world's highest. The country's banks still hold a pile of nonperforming loans that is bigger than the European average. And the misery of austerity is still fresh for some people, made worse by stubbornly high inflation stoked by Russia's war in Ukraine.
The country's prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, a business-friendly conservative politician, was re-elected by a landslide in June after being credited with spurring a recovery by reducing taxes and debt. The government cut red tape for businesses and raised the minimum wage. The country is even paying back international bailout money ahead of schedule.
Mr. Mitsotakis hailed Greece's return to investors' graces. "I will never allow us to relive the trauma of a national bankruptcy," he said a day after the latest upgrade.
Greece became the center of Europe's debt crisis after Wall Street imploded in 2008. Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus were also forced to take international bailouts. But Greece had it the worst, requiring three rescue packages from 2010 to 2015, totaling 320 billion euros, or $ 343 billion, with bitter austerity terms. Household incomes and pensions were slashed. The economy shrank by a quarter, and hundreds of thousands of businesses collapsed as banks shuttered. By 2013, nearly a third of Greeks were unemployed.
"We would have liked the austerity to be milder, but the measures were the Greek contribution to saving itself," said Yannis Stournaras, a former finance minister who is the governor of Greece's central bank and a member of the European Central Bank board. "Greece had to take these tough steps to survive."
Greece exited the bailout programs' strict fiscal controls in 2018, and the government's actions since then have earned confidence from the European Union. In 2021, Brussels policymakers approved another €30 billion for climate investments in Greece, part of a broader effort to bolster E.U. economies after Covid-19 lockdowns.
This month, DBRS Morningstar, a global credit rating agency recognized by the European Central Bank, raised Greece's debt rating to investment grade, a move that opens the door for pensions and other big investors to buy bonds issued by the government. And that will lower borrowing costs for households, businesses and the government after the E.C.B. has been raising interest rates to fight inflation.
Moody's, one of the largest credit ratings agencies, raised Greece's debt rating on Sept. 15 by two notches, just short of investment grade, citing "profound structural change" in the country's economy, finances and banking system.
Investors are jumping in. Microsoft is building a €1 billion data center east of Athens. Farther north, Pfizer is anchoring a €650 million research hub. American, Chinese and European companies are pitching renewable-energy deals. And investments by Cisco, JPMorgan, Meta and other multinationals are projected to have an economic impact worth billions of euros over the next few years.
Well over 10 million tourists swarmed into Greece this summer despite a spate of wildfires, bringing estimated revenues of over €21 billion. Construction has climbed on the mainland and on popular Greek islands, driven by a surging demand for hotels, Airbnb rentals and a program that lets foreigners get a visa to live in E.U. states if they buy at least €500,000 in real estate in Greece.
The activity has buoyed businesses like the one run by Mr. Skouros. The company, which he manages with his brother, John, was founded by their father in 1965. When orders dried up during the economic crisis, they pulled through by servicing elevators they had already installed around Athens.
Today, it has orders for elevators in 10 buildings, up from none during the crisis and Covid lockdowns. At around €20,000 per elevator, the firm is profitable again. Mr. Skouros raised salaries 10 percent and hired five more employees. He needs more technicians, but in a hot economy, he is no longer finding takers.
The comeback is moving so quickly that Mr. Skouros is worried about a real estate bubble forming. So he is steering clear of new high-rise construction that he fears could go bust, and targeting smaller residential buildings with sound finances.
For others, the economic upturn has yet to heal the scars from austerity.
Dmitris Mitrofinakis, 67, has struggled to bounce back from shuttering the home décor store that he ran for over 40 years, after draining his personal savings during the crisis to try to salvage it. When he retired in 2015, the pension that he had long paid into was slashed to €1,300 a month from the €2,400 he was supposed to get.
"The austerity imposed on Greece was too strict," said Mr. Mitrofinakis, who lives in a modest apartment with his wife in a working-class neighborhood, adding that he has little money left at the end of the month.
He sees signs that the economy is improving. "When you look around, people have more work and higher salaries," Mr. Mitrofinakis said. "But a lot of other people haven't recovered," he said, adding that many of his retired neighbors are struggling to make ends meet.
Roula Skouros, a hotel manager in the city of Tripoli, doesn't expect Greece's investment grade rating to improve her life. "Someone who maybe works at the bank or at the stock market probably is affected, but I'm not," said Ms. Skouros, who is not related to Paris Skouros.
Her paycheck has always hovered around the minimum wage, she said. But with inflation running rampant at the gas pump and grocery store, an improved economy "doesn't mean anything if you can't afford gas and food," Ms. Skouros said.
In a recent speech, Mr. Mitsotakis acknowledged the challenges and vowed to spread the recovery's benefits more widely. "We're not hiding behind investment grade, saying, 'We achieved an important goal -- let's turn to autopilot,"' he said.
His government announced that it aimed to raise the monthly minimum wage to €950 by the end of its four-year term after lifting it to €780 in April. Public-sector salaries will also increase for the first time since a 20 percent cut during the crisis to pay Greece's debts.
For Konstantinos Kanderakis, 62, a supervisor at Greece's digital services agency, the gains are meaningful. He earns €1,300 a month after a 35-year career in government, and he will get a €100 monthly increase after a decade in which his income had fallen.
"It's a big psychological boost," he said. "Greece is stable again, and what I am happy about is that things will be better for my children."

Worst Month Of the Year For Wall St.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A series of potential problems, including rising oil prices and labor strikes, have prompted a much warier mood among investors.
The stock market staggered to the end of its worst month of the year so far, dragged down by fears of a looming government shutdown, striking autoworkers, surging oil prices and the prospect of interest rates remaining high for longer than previously thought. Combined, they are darkening the outlook for the economy.
The S&P 500 declined almost 5 percent in September, its steepest monthly drop in 2023, and extending a more modest loss recorded in August. After fading on Friday afternoon, the index also notched its fourth straight week of losses, its longest losing streak of the year.
Just as a more hopeful outlook appeared to have taken hold among investors, propelled by robust corporate profits and resilient consumer spending, a series of potential problems have begun to arise, giving way to a much warier mood on Wall Street.
As sentiment swings, it highlights the pendulum of worry in the markets between the economy remaining too strong for policymakers intent on stamping out inflation and the looming risks that could suddenly pull growth too far in the opposite direction.
"Sentiment has soured," said Steven Wieting, chief investment strategist at Citi Global Wealth. "There is just a lot of uncertainty."
The flow of money into funds that buy U.S. stocks is roughly flat for the year, according to EPFR Global, a data provider. Nearly $ 1 trillion has flowed into money market funds over the same period, an investment that is tantamount to cash and seen as a haven in times of worry.
Chief among investors' concerns is the prospect of interest rates remaining elevated for longer than previously thought, as the Fed battles inflation by keeping the brakes on the economy.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, a measure of the cost of borrowing for the U.S. government and a crucial interest-rate benchmark around the world, has risen roughly half a percentage point since the start of the month, to almost 4.6 percent. As rates on longer-dated bonds rise, stocks tend to come under pressure, reflecting higher costs for companies and consumers over the long term. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage reached 7.31 percent this week, the highest level in nearly 23 years, according to Freddie Mac.
Complicating the Fed's job is a surge in oil prices, threatening to reignite inflation. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, has risen to more than $ 90 a barrel, from around $ 70 three months ago, its highest level in more than a year.
Add a steadily strengthening U.S. dollar to higher yields and rising oil prices and investors face a trio of headwinds to the long-term performance of corporate America and the broader economy.
"That's why investors have been having a tougher time," said Michael Hartnett, an analyst at Bank of America. "My gut feeling is hard-landing risks are growing and growing," referring to the analogy of a slowing economy as a plane touching down on a runway. Policymakers' goal is to steer the economy to a so-called soft landing, cooling inflation without pronounced economic pain.
"If interest rates stay at these kinds of levels, or, God forbid, increase, that has really profound implications for global growth," said Seth Bernstein, the chief executive of AllianceBernstein, a $ 600 billion investment management firm. "It just seems unlikely to me that we have a soft landing," he added.
Working against them is the potential government shutdown that could begin this weekend, which will weigh on growth the longer the stalemate continues. The expanding autoworkers' strike has further tempered growth expectations, though less meaningfully.
The threat of a government shutdown also presents another challenge for the policymakers, delaying the release of economic data that is crucial to navigating the economy through uncertain conditions.
The S&P 500 is still up about 12 percent this year, but remove just seven companies from the index -- the chip maker Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Tesla and Alphabet -- and the rise is less than 1 percent.
That lack of broader conviction is also reflected in the Russell 2000 index of smaller U.S. companies, which is barely positive for the year.
Across the globe, major stocks indexes have slumped over the past month: In dollar terms, Germany's Dax has fallen about 5 percent while Japan's Nikkei and China's CSI 300 lost about 3 percent. China's slumping economy, on which many pinned their hopes for growth, has been a particular worry.
One possible silver lining is that September is often one of the worst months of the year for the stock market, so the downturn may be taken with a pinch of salt. And the government could yet avoid a prolonged shutdown and striking autoworkers could secure a contract before more severe economic effects are felt. Corporate profits are expected to stabilize in the third quarter, after a sharp decline in the second quarter.
But anxiety is in the air. On Tuesday, a measure of consumer sentiment sank further than forecast for the second month in a row, coinciding with the S&P 500's worst day of the week, in which the index fell 1.5 percent.
"The market only a few months ago was worry free amid the belief that the Fed could engineer a soft landing," said Carol Schleif, the chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, "and now the market's worry closet door is wide open as investors raise questions about the economic outlook."

The Second-Best Time to Slay Amazon Is Now: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Federal Trade Commission's chair, Lina Khan, has brought her long-awaited, audacious case against Amazon, signaling the Biden administration's determination to restore an approach to competition law that has been in decline since the Carter administration. This will doubtless draw fresh criticism about her supposed overreach. But Amazon is precisely the kind of company that Congress had in mind in enacting America's many antitrust laws.
Only more so: The Congress of 1890, which passed the first of those laws, could never have imagined the world we now inhabit.
The robber barons of that era hijacked the economy and politics, but they also faced the constraints of empires grounded in physical goods. They couldn't lay a railroad or erect a steel mill without time-consuming capital and logistical hurdles. Today's tech barons at huge platforms like Amazon, Google and Meta can deploy anticompetitive, deceptive and unfair tactics with the agility and speed of a digital system. As in any shell game, the quickness of the hand deceives the eye.
And Amazon is the apex predator of our platform era. Having first subsidized end-users and then offered favorable terms to business customers, Amazon was able to exploit its digital flexibility to lock both in and raid them for an ever-increasing share of the value they created. This program of redistribution from platform users to shareholders continued until Amazon became a vestigial place, a retail colossus barely hindered by either competition or regulation, where prices go up as quality goes down and the undifferentiated slurry of products from obscure brands is wreathed in inauthentic reviews.
It's hard to remember that the internet was originally supposed to connect producers and shoppers, artists and audiences, and members of communities with one another without permission or control by third parties. In its early years, Amazon was good to its users. It sold products affordably and shipped them swiftly and reliably. It attended closely to the authenticity of the reviews that appeared on its site and operated an "honest search" that populated results pages with the best matches for each query.
Then Amazon started locking everyone in. Through Prime, it presold customers a year's worth of shipping. With its digital publishing ventures, it nudged customers toward subscriptions, building a captive base of readers and deploying technology and expansive readings of obscure copyright laws to stop them from moving their books to other platforms. It opened Prime shipping at a low rate to its suppliers, relieving businesses of messy fulfillment logistics.
Meanwhile, its heavy subsidies, made possible by its investors' appetite for backing an incipient monopoly, made it increasingly difficult for rival retail sites to gain traction, because Amazon's seemingly bottomless coffers meant that it could sell goods below cost and extinguish any upstart that dared to compete with it. This created another form of lock-in for Amazon: It became progressively harder not to shop there.
The more locked in we were, the less Amazon needed to offer us. The customer-friendly, honest search degraded as the company began to allow retailers to buy their way to the top of listings, and by 2021, ads generated $ 31 billion in revenue. As sellers became increasingly reliant upon Amazon to display and deliver their goods, the company was free to drain money from them, too, piling fee upon fee and reportedly copying best-selling products.
Amazon's army of workers also suffered: They are routinely maimed on the job, and on-site infirmaries send badly injured workers back into harm's way. Its warehouse workers urinate in bottles to keep up with impossibly high fulfillment demands; its drivers are forced to defecate in bags. Amazon pioneered the "megacycle," a 10.5-hour, mandatory graveyard shift at its warehouses, as well as a new kind of arm's-length quasi entrepreneur who borrows small fortunes and hires legions of drivers kitted out in Amazon livery, only to be stuck with the bill for all those delivery vans -- and risk termination at any moment.
Now we are at the final stage of monopolistic decay. The nation's dominant online retail marketplace not only claws away much of its sellers' revenues but also now penalizes them if they sell their products for lower prices at other retail outlets (including at its archrivals Target and Walmart). Amazon gets the American consumer coming and going, providing worse goods at higher prices while receiving vast sums in subsidies from state and local governments.
Speaking for his landmark antitrust bill of 1890, Senator John Sherman said: "If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation and sale of any of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of trade."
This suspicion of corporate power died in the Reagan era, when regulators adopted a new posture grounded in the idea that monopolies were evidence of efficiency and should be nurtured and that "consumer welfare" in the form of low prices was an absolute good of antitrust law. Amazon is surely the king of our time. Our antitrust laws were fashioned specifically to guard against this overwhelming corporate power -- both its accumulation and its abuse.
This is something Ms. Khan, the F.T.C. chair, understands better than almost anyone: As a law student, she published "Amazon's Antitrust Paradox" in The Yale Law Journal in 2017. That article launched her career as an antitrust theorist, culminating in her elevation to the trade commission just four years later. Ironically, Ms. Khan's deep expertise on Amazon and past criticism prompted the company to seek her recusal from antitrust investigations.
Ms. Khan has taken aim at some of the largest tech companies the world has ever seen. Sometimes, she loses. The F.T.C. failed to block Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard and Meta's acquisition of Within. Ms. Khan's detractors then smear her with claims of gamesmanship and insincerity. But she is engaged in the honorable and necessary business of restoring the enforcement program of the federal government. She seeks to reinvigorate the use of the longstanding -- and long-dormant -- powers she already has.
The best time to have fought this power was over the past quarter-century, as Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos, used his shareholders' capital on predatory pricing campaigns, seemingly in plain violation of the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, and on a string of anticompetitive acquisitions that surely violated the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914.
The second-best time to fight this power is now. Ms. Khan, who is joined by over a dozen states in taking on Amazon, has set herself a monumental, urgent, necessary task. She is fighting to win -- but if she loses again, it will not signal defeat.
The calcified edifice of expensively purchased pro-monopoly precedent is hard, but it appears brittle. With our support, Ms. Khan -- and her colleagues on the commission as well as Jonathan Kanter, her opposite number at the Justice Department's antitrust division -- will continue to hammer away at this yellowing old shell until it shatters.

China Accused of Spreading Disinformation: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The accusations reflect worry in Washington that China's information operations pose a growing security challenge to the United States.
The State Department accused China on Thursday of using "deceptive and coercive methods" to shape the global information environment, by acquiring stakes in foreign newspapers and television networks, using major social media platforms to promote its views and exerting pressure on international organizations and media outlets to silence critics of Beijing.
The accusations, detailed in a report by the department's Global Engagement Center, reflect worry in Washington that China's information operations pose a growing security challenge to the United States and to democratic principles around the world by promoting "digital authoritarianism."
China not only pushes its own propaganda, the report said, but exports digital surveillance tools to police information and people online. Although many of the tactics detailed are not new, the report warned that they could "lead nations to make decisions that subordinate their economic and security interests to Beijing."
"Every country has the right and every right to tell its story to the world, but a nation's narrative should be facts, and it should rise or fall on its own merits," James P. Rubin, the coordinator of the Global Engagement Center, said at a briefing. Referring to the People's Republic of China, he went on: "By contrast, the P.R.C. advances coercive techniques and increasingly outright lies."
The report echoes a raft of recent studies detailing the growing -- and shifting -- scope of China's information campaigns. It came a day after officials disclosed in a Senate briefing that Chinese hackers who gained access to the email accounts of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other officials this year stole 60,000 emails from the State Department alone.
According to the State Department's report released on Thursday, China's efforts have evolved from a primary focus on promoting or defending the country's political views on issues like Taiwan and Hong Kong to one that aims to sow disinformation to discredit the United States at home and abroad.
That has included accusations about the origins of the Covid pandemic, the new security partnership between the United States and Australia, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, disclosed last month that it had dismantled a Chinese campaign using more than 8,000 accounts, pages or groups on the two platforms, the largest inauthentic network it had found so far. Microsoft and other researchers also linked China to the spread of false claims about the causes of the deadly wildfires in Hawaii.
That campaign included images generated by artificial intelligence, a tool that the researchers, like the State Department, warn could greatly enhance China's efforts.
China's control over information internally is virtually absolute, but increasingly it is expanding its influence abroad, with its state channels broadcasting in 12 languages.
The report said that China has spent billions of dollars to build an expansive state news operation under the Central Propaganda Department and the United Front Work Department, which the report said oversees investments in foreign media aimed at Chinese diaspora communities.
The report cited investments in media organizations in the Czech Republic, Australia and Thailand, where Tencent sidestepped a law against foreign ownership to acquire Sanook, the country's most popular news site.
China has also become a leading provider in digital television services in Africa through StarTimes, a Chinese company that now reaches most of the continent's viewers.
While the department's report was based largely on public information, it included references to knowledge seemingly based on classified information.
That included "U.S. government information" about an agreement with a newspaper "in an East African country" to publish paid articles from China without disclosing the connection and the fact that until at least late 2020, ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, maintained "a regularly updated internal list" of people who were blocked or restricted on the platform.
The report also detailed what it described as a fictitious author, Yi Fan, whose writings in English have appeared in publications around the world since 2015 under bylines describing him as an independent analyst.
China has also become adept at using social media platforms that the authorities banned inside the country's Great Firewall. China now operates 333 diplomatic or official media accounts on Twitter, now known as X, with nearly 65 million followers, according to the report.
Those official accounts, it added, were bolstered by networks of bots and inauthentic accounts. From June 2020 to January 2021, a single network of those accounts impersonating British citizens accounted for 44 percent of the retweets and 20 percent of the replies to posts by Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador at the time and one of the outspoken "wolf warriors" of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"Although more than half of Liu's retweets during this period came from accounts that were ultimately suspended for violating Twitter's terms of service at the time," the report said, "new accounts continued to pop up to prolong this inauthentic amplification." Twitter has since dropped the labels that identified foreign government accounts.
China uses similar accounts to stifle criticism. The report noted that more than 1,000 fake accounts sought to drown out a report last year by Safeguard Defenders, a human rights organization, that detailed the undisclosed presence of Chinese police officers in 53 countries. The campaign used accounts with the same name as the organization in what appeared to be an effort to trigger Twitter's policy to de-emphasize inauthentic campaigns.
The State Department's Global Engagement Center was established in 2011 with a focus on countering terrorism and violent extremism. In 2017 Congress extended its mandate to focus on propaganda and disinformation.
The impact of China's effort can be difficult to measure, and the report suggests that the Chinese campaigns often encounter resistance in other countries. The country's Communist Party appears committed, however, to reshaping the international environment suited to its political goals.
"We have every reason to believe that will continue," said Nathan Beauchamp-Mustafaga, a researcher at the RAND Corporation and a co-author of a recent report on China's reliance on artificial intelligence to bolster its information operations. "They're more likely to double down than they are to stop."

Antitrust Clash Is True Cage Match For Big Tech: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The chair of the Federal Trade Commission wants to disrupt Amazon, whose founder built a trillion-dollar firm by disrupting retail.
Jeff Bezos made his fortune with one truly big idea: What if a retailer did everything possible to make customers happy?
His forcefully nurtured creation, Amazon, sold as many items as possible as cheaply as possible and delivered them as quickly as possible. The result is that $ 40 out of every $ 100 spent online in the United States goes to Amazon and Mr. Bezos is worth $ 150 billion.
Lina Khan made her reputation with a very different idea: What if pleasing the customer was not enough?
Low prices, she argued in a 95-page examination of Amazon in The Yale Law Journal, can mask behavior that stifles competition and undermines society. Published in 2017 while she was still a law student, it is already one of the most consequential academic papers of modern times.
These two very different philosophies, each pushed by an outsider unafraid of taking risks, at last have their much-anticipated confrontation. The Federal Trade Commission, now run by Ms. Khan after her stunning rise from policy wonk to policy player, filed suit against Amazon on Tuesday in federal court in Seattle. The suit accused Amazon of being a monopolist that used unfair and illegal tactics to maintain its power. Amazon said the suit was "wrong on the facts and the law."
Mr. Bezos, 59, is no longer in charge of Amazon on a day-to-day basis. He surrendered the chief executive reins to Andy Jassy two years ago. But make no mistake: Mr. Bezos is Amazon's executive chair and owns more of the company than anyone else. It is his innovations, carried out over more than 20 years, that Ms. Khan is challenging. The F.T.C. complaint quotes him repeatedly.
Silicon Valley spent the summer transfixed by the prospect of Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg literally fighting each other, despite the odds of this actually happening being near zero. Ms. Khan and Mr. Bezos are, however, the real thing -- a courtroom clash that could have implications far beyond Amazon's 1.5 million employees, 300 million customers and $ 1.3 trillion valuation.
If Ms. Khan's arguments hold sway, the competitive landscape for tech companies will look very different going forward. Big antitrust cases tend to have that effect. The government achieved only a muddled victory in its pursuit of Microsoft 25 years ago. Yet that still had enough force to distract and weaken a much-feared software empire, allowing 1,000 start-ups to bloom, including Amazon.
It's largely because of Ms. Khan, 34, that imposing major changes on the retailer is even thinkable. After spending a few days interviewing her and those around her for a profile in 2018, I thought she understood Mr. Bezos because she was so much like him. Very few people can see possibilities unseen by others and successfully work toward them for years, getting others to join along the way. But these were attributes they both shared.
"How does change happen in history?" asked Stacy Mitchell, an early Khan ally who is co-executive director at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a research and advocacy group that promotes local power to fight corporations. "Lina has captured imaginations in a way that has enabled the reform movement to engage a wider set of people."
Ms. Khan and Mr. Bezos were even similar in their silence. For years, every article about Amazon featured the line "Amazon declined to comment," another form of control. Ms. Khan likewise never willingly surrendered to me a piece of personal data, even if it was inconsequential.
Amazon and the F.T.C. declined to comment for this article.
Mr. Bezos' unlikely saga long ago entered the realm of myth. He spent his childhood summers on his grandfather's West Texas ranch, wanted to be a theoretical physicist but became a Wall Street analyst instead. He had no retailing background. He was interested in ideas, not things.
Amazon was not the first online store -- it wasn't even the first online bookstore. It spent lots of money foolishly and drove many employees mercilessly. The whole enterprise nearly failed in the dot-com crash in the early 2000s. But the media was fascinated by it, customers liked it, and that gave Mr. Bezos room to run.
A former Amazon engineer once memorably described Mr. Bezos as making "ordinary control freaks look like stoned hippies." A company that puts "attendance reminder" signs in bathroom stalls telling warehouse workers they will be "reviewed for termination" if they screw up their time keeping is a company with overwhelming ambition.
Reformers are just like entrepreneurs: They, too, are fighting against reality, trying to carve out space for their vision of how things could be better. Ms. Khan's journey to confronting Amazon in federal court is in some ways an even less likely tale than Mr. Bezos'. And so, like Mr. Bezos in the early years of Amazon, she has become a figure of fascination.
The daughter of Pakistani immigrants by way of London, Ms. Khan had the natural instincts of a good journalist. At Williams College, where she worked on the school paper, a friend described her as especially interested in understanding power, particularly the way it conceals itself to seize more power. She was in her late 20s when she wrote her paper on Amazon -- about Mr. Bezos' age when he quit his Wall Street job to drive with his wife at the time, MacKenzie Scott, west to Seattle and his destiny.
Antitrust law was the traditional tool used to rein in companies that became too powerful. Antitrust played a major role in the 1890s, marking the beginning of the Progressive Era, and again in the 1930s under the New Deal. But by the early 1980s, antitrust was at a low ebb. The so-called consumer welfare standard reduced antitrust down to one issue: the price customers paid. If prices were low, there was no problem.
The Microsoft case was important and influential, but it was very much an aberration. In the early years of this century, the prevailing laissez-faire philosophy allowed not just Amazon but other start-ups to rise much quicker than they might otherwise have. Facebook and Google charged users nothing, and were allowed to acquire their way to dominance. Six of the eight most valuable U.S. companies are tech companies -- seven if you consider Tesla a tech firm.
Government was slow; Silicon Valley was fast. The marketplace would decide the fate of corporate empires. By 2015, when Ms. Khan was entering law school, hardly anyone was interested in promoting competition through government intervention. Criminal justice reform, environmental law, immigration -- those were the topics that appealed to students. She chose antitrust, practically alone.
Anyone with a radical idea in Washington faces so many obstacles that it is not surprising it happens so rarely. When Ms. Khan was nominated to be chair of the F.T.C. in 2021, Amazon complained that she was biased.
"She has on numerous occasions argued that Amazon is guilty of antitrust violations and should be broken up," the company wrote in a 25-page petition to have Ms. Khan recused from any judgment on it.
The logic: If you are critical of a company, you can't be allowed anywhere near it as a regulator. Ms. Khan survived this challenge, but it was only the first. To go against the live-and-let-live attitude of many bureaucrats, a relentless determination is required.
A hostile media is another hurdle. Dozens of Wall Street Journal editorials, opinion essays and letters to the editor have criticized Ms. Khan over the last two years. They called for Congress to investigate her, argued she didn't understand that monopolies were actually good and accused her of letting people die by blocking a drug company merger.
Then there is the lobbying. Amazon spent $ 10 million in the first half of this year, five times the 2013 level. It gave money to hundreds of trade associations and nonprofits in 2022, some of which issue pro-Amazon reports without publicizing their funding. Under the "know your enemy" philosophy, Amazon has also been staffing up with Ms. Khan's former F.T.C. colleagues.
Getting to court offers little relief. Well steeped in decades of the consumer welfare standard, judges are not particularly encouraging to Ms. Khan's arguments. Cases against Meta, Facebook's parent company, and more recently Microsoft have faltered. The Amazon case incorporates aspects of the consumer welfare standard, which might make it more palatable in court.
It's a formidable amount of opposition. Even some of her ideological foes are impressed that Ms. Khan is nevertheless having such an impact. By sheer force of intellect, she is opening up a conversation about how companies are allowed to behave.
"Five years ago, you would have been laughed out of the room if you challenged the consumer welfare standard," said Konstantin Medvedovsky, a former antitrust lawyer who is now a hedge fund analyst. "Now serious people make that argument at major conferences and are taken seriously. That's Lina's triumph."
Mr. Medvedovsky is not very sympathetic to Ms. Khan's enforcement agenda. He was one of the critics who derided the reform movement as "hipster" antitrust. Still, he said, "It's hard not to be somewhat in awe."

Cleanup Job Gets Bigger For Chief At Amazon: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The F.T.C. accused the internet giant of protecting an online retail monopoly and forcing higher prices onto consumers.
In the two years since Andy Jassy replaced Jeff Bezos as Amazon's chief executive, he has been cleaning up after his company's aggressive pandemic expansion and after Mr. Bezos. Mr. Jassy has reined in Amazon's voracious warehouse growth, culled from the company's sprawl of products and laid off thousands of employees on several of Mr. Bezos' pet projects.
On Tuesday, he was handed another challenge: a long-anticipated lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission. The government claimed Amazon used unfair tactics to monopolize online shopping in a way that raises prices and hurts quality for consumers. The suit focused on parts of the business that took off before Mr. Jassy gained control over the retail division.
The redacted complaint mentions Mr. Bezos 16 times, and Mr. Jassy only twice.
Mr. Jassy joins other big tech chief executives who have taken control of enormous businesses from idiosyncratic founders at difficult moments. As with those other second-generation bosses, Mr. Jassy's success will not only depend on whether he is a visionary like the man who started the company. It could also be shaped by how well he navigates the fears of Wall Street investors and the distrust of regulators in Washington.
"He is cleaning up a mess that somebody else created," said Sucharita Kodali, an analyst at Forrester Research. "And he is doing it while trying to keep the ship afloat."
Bill Gates passed Microsoft to Steve Ballmer as the company was dealing with its long and bruising antitrust fight with the Justice Department. At the same time, online advertising and software sold over the internet were driving a new generation of young rivals like Google.
At Google's parent company Alphabet, Larry Page tapped Sundar Pichai to run the company as it was dealing with a restive work force upset by a variety of issues, including sexual harassment and a contract with the Defense Department. Its business practices were also facing more scrutiny by regulators around the globe. A year after the handoff, the Justice Department sued Google for antitrust violations, culminating in a trial that began this month.
Now Mr. Jassy has his own fight with regulators while Mr. Bezos' post-Amazon life is obsessively documented by the paparazzi in what Extra TV called a "seemingly endless summer vacation."
Mr. Jassy has said he talks to Mr. Bezos, who is engaged in the company as executive chair of the board, about once a week.
Amazon declined to comment on Mr. Jassy. But the company said the F.T.C.'s case was without merit and would harm customers by creating higher prices, slower deliveries and reduced options for small businesses.
Mr. Jassy started at Amazon in 1997, three days after taking his last exam at Harvard Business School. He worked on Amazon's music business, which at the time meant selling CDs. Amazon was still just a retailer. Mr. Jassy went on to found Amazon Web Services, which became the leading provider of cloud computing services and an important profit driver for Amazon, and he gained a spot on the company's leadership team. His customers were not consumers. They were businesses and other enterprises that needed technology services.
The F.T.C.'s lawsuit does not touch any of the services offered by A.W.S. Instead, it focuses on the businesses built by other executives who oversaw the core of Amazon's retail business, several of whom have left the company in recent years.
The legal battle with regulators seemed inevitable. By the time Mr. Bezos named Mr. Jassy as his successor, the F.T.C. investigation had already begun. Mr. Jassy summoned a group of company executives for a briefing on the antitrust fight, The New York Times previously reported. In his first year, he began making the rounds in Washington, meeting with senators, the secretary of commerce and White House officials, presenting himself as a grounded, diplomatic spokesman for the company.
"He has done a lot, but he clearly is going to have a lot more to do," said Tom Forte, an analyst at the investment bank D.A. Davidson who has covered the company for more than two decades.
Overseeing the antitrust case is a team under the company's general counsel, David Zapolsky, who joined Amazon in 1999, just two years after Mr. Jassy. His key deputies include Andrew DeVore, who has represented the company before Congress, and Bryson Bachman, who joined Amazon four years ago after leaving the Justice Department's antitrust division.
When Mr. Jassy took over in July 2021, the pandemic had supercharged the company's growth. But that growth soon hit a wall.
Wall Street had long given Mr. Bezos a pass, tolerating periods of little to no profit as the company pursued new ventures -- from costly studio productions and a massive organization to build the Alexa voice assistant to drone deliveries and a hunt to build successful grocery stores -- but the share price fell swiftly.
"It was definitely going to be a harder act for Jassy," Ms. Kodali said.
Though Mr. Jassy has said "the team made the right decision" to spend aggressively in the pandemic, he slammed the brakes on the company's warehouse expansion, paused work on the largest phase of Amazon's planned second headquarters in Northern Virginia, and laid off 27,000 corporate and tech employees.
He ended or pared back some of the company's bets that had yet to truly pay off, laying off employees from teams working on the Alexa voice assistant, drones and automated stores.
The company has 1.46 million employees, down from its peak of 1.62 million early last year.
The changes have begun producing results. Amazon's growth has picked up steam, and profits expanded more than Wall Street expected. In the latest quarter, sales grew 11 percent to $ 134.4 billion, and profit rose to $ 6.7 billion, up from a small loss a year earlier.
In many ways, Mr. Jassy's success has come from making Amazon more dependent on the parts of the business that the F.T.C. is targeting: the services, like advertising and fulfillment, that it offers to sellers on its marketplace.
In the past year, sales of products Amazon sells online directly to customers were up just 4 percent, but the services it provides sellers to reach customers, including shipping and referral fees, grew 18 percent. Advertising was up 22 percent.
Analysts say its services are more profitable than selling products directly to customers, echoing the high-margin service business Mr. Jassy built in cloud computing.
Products offered by marketplace sellers, not Amazon directly, accounted for 60 percent of its retail sales in the latest quarter.
On a call with Wall Street analysts in August, Mr. Jassy spent 15 minutes laying out his vision. In previous calls, he spoke much about the work he did retrenching and focusing on what seemed like the problems he inherited.
This was, Mr. Forte wrote in a note to investors, "the clearest and most overt description of his vision for the future." He talked about having big ambitions in artificial intelligence, health care and success in restructuring the logistics to make more products available faster than ever.
Less than two months later, the FTC filed suit, setting up a long and contentious fight ahead.

Reflecting Economic Gloom, the Market Takes a Steep Tumble: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street's ugly September got even worse Tuesday, as a sharp drop for stocks brought them back to where they were in June.
The S&P 500 tumbled 1.5 percent for its fifth loss in the last six days. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped or 1.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.6 percent.
September has brought a loss of 5.2 percent so far for the S&P 500, putting it on track to be the worst month of the year by far, as the realization sets in that the Federal Reserve will indeed keep interest rates high for a long time. That growing understanding has sent yields in the bond market to their highest levels in more than a decade, which in turn has undercut prices for stocks and other investments.
Treasury yields rose again Thursday after a mixed batch of reports on the economy.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.55 percent from 4.54 percent late Monday and is near its highest level since 2007. It's up sharply from about 3.50 percent in May and from 0.50 percent about three years ago.
The rise in yields means bonds finally look reasonably priced, strategists at Barclays say. But even with the recent pullback in the stock market, "stocks have not adjusted enough to the rise in yields, in our view," according to the strategists led by Ajay Rajadhyaksha.
One economic report on Tuesday said sales of new homes across the country slowed by more last month than economists expected, while another report suggested manufacturing in Maryland, the Virginias and the Carolinas may be steadying itself following a more than yearlong slump.
While housing and manufacturing have felt the sting of high interest rates, the economy overall has held up well enough to raise worries that upward pressure still exists on inflation. That pushed the Fed last week to say it will likely cut interest rates by less next year than earlier expected. The Fed's main interest rate is at its highest level since 2001 in its drive to get inflation back down to its target.
Besides high interest rates, a long list of other worries is also tugging at Wall Street. The most immediate is the threat of another government shutdown as Capitol Hill threatens a stalemate that could shut off federal services across the country.
Wall Street has dealt with such shutdowns in the past, and stocks have historically been turbulent in the run-up to them, according to Lori Calvasina, strategist at RBC Capital Markets.
After looking at the seven shutdowns that lasted 10 days or more since the 1970s, she found the S&P 500 dropped an average of roughly 10 percent in the three months heading into them. But stocks managed to hold up rather well during the shutdowns, falling an average of just 0.3 percent, before rebounding meaningfully afterward.
Besides the threat of higher interest rates for longer, Wall Street is also contending with higher oil prices, shaky economies around the world, a strike by U.S. autoworkers that could put more upward pressure on inflation and a resumption of U.S. student-loan repayments that could dent spending by households.
On Wall Street, the vast majority of stocks fell Tuesday under such pressures, including 90 percent of those within the S&P 500.
Big tech stocks tend to be among the hardest hit by high rates, and they were the heaviest weights on the index. Apple fell 2.3 percent and Microsoft lost 1.7 percent.
Cintas dropped 5.3 percent for the largest loss in the S&P 500. The provider of employee uniforms, mops, fire extinguishers and other services reported stronger profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. It also raised its forecast for profit for the full fiscal year, but was still within a range that many analysts earlier expected.
Stocks fell in markets around the world, with indexes lower across Asia and much of Europe.

Switching Search Is Not as Simple As Google Asserts: [Correction]

Full text: Google says a change takes just a few steps, but a panel of designers found otherwise. The issue is at the heart of a federal antitrust trial.
Imagine if every time you went to the supermarket, your shopping cart came loaded with the same box of cereal.
This cereal happens to be the most popular, so it's convenient for the store to have it in the cart. If you don't like it, it's simple enough to put it back on the shelf and grab a different box.
That's essentially the crux of Google's defense against the Justice Department in a consequential antitrust trial -- the federal government's first such case in the modern internet era -- that is now unfolding in court.
The government has accused Google of illegally using partnerships with handset makers, computer manufacturers and browser developers to stifle competitors in online search. Under those partnerships, the Justice Department argues, Google made its search engine the default service on an overwhelming majority of consumer electronics, like smartphones. That then deterred people from trying alternative search engines, like Bing, DuckDuckGo and others.
But Google has argued that it's easy for people to change their search engine -- just as simple as putting a box of cereal back on the store shelf.
The trial raises questions about how and why we use Google search. Many of us grew up doing web searches on Google because it seemed to deliver the best results with minimal effort. But if something better came along, would we really have known since Google came loaded on most of our devices? And even if we had known, would we have just stuck with Google since its search engine was set as the default?
I decided to test how easy or hard it really is to switch to a different search engine. In a blog post this month, Google said the change was a straightforward process and offered three examples:
On an iPhone, it takes four taps.
On a Mac's Safari browser, it takes two clicks.
On Android phones, it takes two taps.
So I followed Google's instructions and also shared the company's guidance with a panel of three design veterans. The verdict: It's hard to switch -- and most people would probably give up before completing the change.
"God help me, I'm dead," Ted Selker, a product design veteran who worked at IBM and Xerox PARC, said after reading the steps to change the search engine on an iPhone.
Harry Brignull, a user-experience consultant in Britain, concluded about Google search: "Most people will just stick with it."
I had similar takeaways. Here's what the design experts and I found after trying to break up with Google search.
On an iPhone
Google said iPhone owners could switch to a different search engine in four taps by opening the Settings app, tapping Safari, tapping Search Engine and then selecting a search engine.
In reality, it's more complicated.
Once the Settings app is open, Safari doesn't immediately appear on the screen. It's buried under 36 other menu items, so the user has to swipe upward at least twice to find the Safari menu. In reality, it takes six taps.
But even four steps would probably be too much for many of us, Mr. Selker said. It might have been simple 15 years ago, when most web browsing was done on stationary computers, but in the smartphone era, someone looking for that setting could be interrupted while on the go -- to hop on a bus, for instance.
"You cannot expect people to have multi-stepped memory," he said.
On a Mac
With just two clicks, Google said, Mac users can switch the default search engine on the Safari browser to a different service -- by first clicking on the magnifying glass icon and then selecting a different search engine, like Yahoo, Bing or DuckDuckGo.
That's much simpler than on an iPhone. But not everyone knows that the magnifying glass icon is a button -- it allows people to enter a query in the search bar.
More problematic is that switching search engines can be confusing, because the steps are inconsistent between Safari on an iPhone and Safari on a Mac, said Tony Hu, a director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who oversees an engineering leadership program.
"Overall, the average person would probably struggle with this," he said.
Mr. Selker said a better design would have been to make changing the search engine more "in your face," like a prompt asking users to choose a search engine when opening the browser.
"It has to make you aware it's there until you've dismissed it," he said.
On Android
On an Android phone, Google said, it takes one long press on the search bar to prompt the Remove button to appear. Users can then tap on it to remove the Google search bar widget from the home screen.
This example is especially flawed. First, Google's steps to remove the search bar widget work on some Samsung phones, but they do not work across all Android devices. On Google's Pixel phones, for example, when a user long presses on the search bar, no Remove option appears.
Most important, removing the search widget deletes a shortcut to the Google search bar on the home screen, but it does not change the search engine in an Android web browser. Changing to a different search engine requires a different set of steps. Similar to the path on iPhones, it's a four-step process that involves opening the browser and changing its settings.
The default option
The overarching lesson from the government's antitrust trial against Google is that when companies make arrangements to become a default option, they are aware you will probably stick with the status quo because switching to an alternative requires awareness and effort, said Mr. Brignull, the author of "Deceptive Patterns: Exposing the Tricks Tech Companies Use to Control You."
Google said in a statement that it was easy for people to change their default search engine on Android devices and Apple's Safari. The company added that on Windows computers, which require a long process to switch from Bing as the default search engine in Microsoft's Edge browser, the overwhelming majority of people chose Google as their search engine.
With all of that in mind, and the instructions now in front of you, you can try other search engines. If it turns out that you prefer Google anyway, at least it will be your decision -- not Google's.

Full text: A new version of OpenAI's popular chatbot behaves a lot like Siri and Alexa. You can talk to it -- and have a conversation.
ChatGPT has learned to talk.
OpenAI, the San Francisco artificial intelligence start-up, released a version of its popular chatbot on Monday that can interact with people using spoken words. As with Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and other digital assistants, users can talk to ChatGPT and it will talk back.
For the first time, ChatGPT can also respond to images. People can, for example, upload a photo of the inside of their refrigerator, and the chatbot can give them a list of dishes they could cook with the ingredients they have.
"We're looking to make ChatGPT easier to use -- and more helpful," said Peter Deng, OpenAI's vice president of consumer and enterprise product.
OpenAI has accelerated the release of its A.I tools in recent weeks. This month, it unveiled a version of its DALL-E image generator and folded the tool into ChatGPT.
ChatGPT attracted hundreds of millions of users after it was introduced in November, and several other companies soon released similar services. With the new version of the bot, OpenAI is pushing beyond rival chatbots like Google Bard, while also competing with older technologies like Alexa and Siri.
Alexa and Siri have long provided ways of interacting with smartphones, laptops and other devices through spoken words. But chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard have more powerful language skills and are able to instantly write emails, poetry and term papers, and riff on almost any topic tossed their way.
OpenAI has essentially combined the two communication methods.
The company sees talking as a more natural way of interacting with its chatbot. It argues that ChatGPT's synthetic voices -- people can choose from five different options, including male and females voices -- are more convincing than others used with popular digital assistants.
Over the next two weeks, the company said, the new version of the chatbot would start rolling out to everyone who subscribes to ChatGPT Plus, a service that costs $ 20 a month. But the bot can respond with voice only when used on iPhones, iPads and Android devices.
The bot's synthetic voices are more natural than many others on the market, though they still can sound robotic. Like other digital assistants, it can struggle with homonyms. When The New York Times asked the new ChatGPT how to spell "gym," it said: "J-I-M."
But one of the advantages of a chatbot like ChatGPT is that it can correct itself. When told "No, the other kind of gym," the bot replied: "Ah, I see what you're referring to now. The place where people exercise and work out is spelled G-Y-M."
Though ChatGPT's voice interface is reminiscent of earlier assistants, the underlying technology is fundamentally different. ChatGPT is driven primarily by a large language model, or L.L.M., which has learned to generate language on the fly by analyzing huge amounts of text culled from across the internet.
Older digital assistants, like Alexa and Siri, acted like command-and-control centers that could perform a set number of tasks or give answers to a finite list of questions programmed into their databases, such as "Alexa, turn on the lights" or "What's the weather in Cupertino?" Adding new commands to the older assistants could take weeks. ChatGPT can respond authoritatively to virtually any question thrown at it in seconds -- though it is not always correct.
As OpenAI is transforming ChatGPT into something more like Alexa or Siri, companies like Amazon and Apple are transforming their digital assistants into something more like ChatGPT.
Last week, Amazon previewed an updated system for Alexa that aims for more fluid conversation about "any topic." It is driven in a part by a new L.L.M. and has other upgrades to pacing and intonation to make it sound more natural, the company said.
Apple, which has not publicly shared its plans for how it will compete with ChatGPT, has been testing a prototype of its large language model for future products, according to two people briefed on the project.
When used via the web as well as on iPhone, iPad and Android devices, the new ChatGPT can also respond to images. Given a photograph, chart or diagram, it can provide a detailed description of the image and answer questions about its contents. This could be a useful tool for people who are visually impaired.
OpenAI first demonstrated the image tool in the spring, but the company said it would not be shared with the public until researchers better understood how the technology could be misused. Among other concerns, they worried the tool could become a de facto face recognition service used to quickly identify people in photos.
Microsoft introduced this kind of visual search tool, based on OpenAI's technology, in its Bing chatbot over the summer.
Sandhini Agarwal, an OpenAI researcher who focuses on safety and policy, said the new version of the bot would now refuse efforts to identify faces. But it is designed to provide enormously detailed descriptions of other photos. Given an image from the Hubble Space Telescope, for example, it can respond with paragraphs detailing the contents in the photo.
The bot can also be a tool for students. Given an image of a high school math problem that includes words, numbers and diagrams, the bot can instantly read the problem and solve it. It could be an effective way to learn -- or cheat.

Google Says Switching Away From Its Search Engine Is Easy. It’s Not.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Imagine if every time you went to the supermarket, your shopping cart came loaded with the same box of cereal.
This cereal happens to be the most popular, so it’s convenient for the store to have it in the cart. If you don’t like it, it’s simple enough to put it back on the shelf and grab a different box.
That’s essentially the crux of Google’s defense against the Justice Department in a consequential antitrust trial — the federal government’s first such case in the modern internet era — that is now unfolding in court.
The government has accused Google of illegally using partnerships with handset makers, computer manufacturers and browser developers to stifle competitors in online search. Under those partnerships, the Justice Department argues, Google made its search engine the default service on an overwhelming majority of consumer electronics, including smartphones. That then deterred people from trying alternative search engines, such as Bing, DuckDuckGo and others.
But Google has argued that it’s easy for people to change their search engine — just as simple as putting a box of cereal back on the store shelf.
The trial raises questions about how and why we use Google search. Many of us grew up doing web searches on Google because it seemed to deliver the best results with minimal effort. But if something better came along, would we really have known since Google came loaded on most of our devices? And even if we had known, would we have just stuck with Google since its search engine was set as the default?
I decided to test how easy or hard it really is to switch to a different search engine. In a blog post this month, Google said the change was a straightforward process and offered three examples:
— On an iPhone, it takes four taps.
— On a Mac’s Safari browser, it takes two clicks.
— On Android phones, it takes two taps.
So I followed Google’s instructions and also shared the company’s guidance with a panel of three design veterans. The verdict: It’s hard to switch — and most people would probably give up before completing the change.
“God help me, I’m dead,” Ted Selker, a product design veteran who worked at IBM and Xerox PARC, said after reading the steps to change the search engine on an iPhone.
Harry Brignull, a user-experience consultant in Britain, concluded about Google search: “Most people will just stick with it.”
I had similar takeaways. Here’s what the design experts and I found after trying to break up with Google search.
On an iPhone
Google said iPhone owners could switch to a different search engine in four taps by opening the Settings app, tapping Safari, tapping Search Engine and then selecting a search engine.
In reality, it’s more complicated.
Once the Settings app is open, Safari doesn’t immediately appear on the screen. It’s buried under 36 other menu items, so the user has to swipe upward at least twice to find the Safari menu. In reality, it takes six taps.
But even four steps would probably be too much for many of us, Selker said. It might have been simple 15 years ago, when most web browsing was done on stationary computers, but in the smartphone era, someone looking for that setting could be interrupted while on the go — to hop on a bus, for instance.
“You cannot expect people to have multi-stepped memory,” he said.

At Work, 'Whole Selves' Increasingly Include Religion: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Secular companies have invited employees to bring their "whole selves" to work. That increasingly includes their religion.
When Christy Childers moved from Austin to San Francisco in 2017 to start a marketing job at Facebook, she felt anxious about sharing her evangelical faith with her new colleagues. In Ms. Childers's religious community, Silicon Valley has a reputation for being overtly secular and less than accepting of Christian beliefs. She now calls that view "unfounded." Within a week, colleagues had invited her to a lunchtime Bible study and a happy hour attended by scores of Christians across the tech industry.
"I thought, 'I can be out about being a Christian. I can do that here,"' Ms. Childers said.
During her three years as a brand manager, Ms. Childers's evangelical identity became central to her work. She honed her managerial skills by leading the Christians at Facebook (now Christians at Meta) employee resource group. Weekly prayer meetings with colleagues led to what she called "real-time miracles," like engineers suddenly fixing bugs they'd struggled with for months and solutions to P.R. crises. Company leaders also consulted her about the attitudes of conservative Facebook users.
In 2019, Ms. Childers founded Pray for Tech, a nonprofit that supports Christian prayer communities inside tech companies. The next year, she left Facebook to run the organization full time. She has since worked with Christian groups at 40 companies, where she's observed a growing interest in supporting workers' core identities, including their faith.
This corporate effort to create a sense of belonging at work grew after the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, when many companies rushed to improve their diversity, equity and inclusion, or D.E.I., efforts. Employees from underrepresented groups were encouraged to bring their "authentic" or "whole" selves to work, and companies increased support for identity-based employee groups organized around gender, race, ethnicity and sexual orientation.
Increasingly, faith is a part of this list. Human resources professionals, diversity consultants and scholars all say it's become more common for employees to share their religious identities at work and to request the same corporate recognition and support given to other identity groups. Most major tech companies now have official faith-based affinity groups.
Fueling the effort are multiple Christian organizations including Pray for Tech; anti-discrimination nonprofits, like the Anti-Defamation League; and nonpartisan, multifaith nonprofits like Interfaith America and the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation.
"It feels like the train is moving and as imperfect as the D.E.I. vehicle is, hop on or hop off and get religion into the larger ecosystem," said Simran Jeet Singh, executive director of the Religion & Society Program at the Aspen Institute. "It's almost like, here's a way for people of faith to say, think about us too."
Twenty years ago, few secular companies recognized faith-based employee groups and those that did exist -- whether officially sanctioned or not -- were typically for Christians. Today, nearly 70 secular corporations officially fund them, according to the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation, and scores more allow them to exist. Many groups are new since 2017, some have thousands of members and represent Christians, Muslims and Jews, along with Sikhs, Buddhists, Baha'is and even atheists.
Scholars call this a cultural shift. The secular office has long been "a neutral space, where there is separating out of religion," said Helen Chung, an assistant professor of industrial-organizational psychology at Seattle Pacific University who studies faith-based employee resource groups. This is partly "a carry-over from the separation of church and state," Ms. Chung said, and partly a way to keep the peace. "What are the two things you're not supposed to talk about?" said Brian Grim, president of the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation. "Religion and politics."
Inviting employees to bring their whole selves to the workplace means companies should be prepared to host some difficult conversations. "That doesn't mean companies have to weigh in on Israel-Palestine," Mr. Singh said. But, he said, workers of faith "have real issues that they'll be bringing to the table, and you have to be ready to address them."
'We shouldn't be hiding'
Americans may be turning away from organized religion, but a fifth still view their work as a spiritual calling, according to a nationally representative survey from Rice University.
"Historically, religious institutions have provided people a context, a container to mark transitions in their lives and do some meaning making," Ms. Chung said. "But some of that has lessened, and I think because of that, we look to recreate some structures for ourselves in the workplace."
Employees who have joined workplace faith groups or otherwise integrated religion into their professional lives, often do so for emotional support. Ms. Childers's organization, Pray for Tech, facilitates virtual inter-company prayer sessions, like one last March, where employees from Meta, Microsoft and Yahoo prayed for strength in the face of layoffs.
At PayPal, workers can submit requests to a "prayer portal," asking that colleagues pray for them. "A lot of times it's around a health diagnosis. Or a prayer for leadership and wisdom during difficult economic times," said Becky Pomerleau, the company's senior director of audit, who helped found both the company's interfaith and Christian affinity groups in 2019.
Sukie Singh Gandhi, a technical consulting manager at Salesforce, said engaging with her Sikh faith at work helps her feel seen and respected as a religious minority. Ms. Gandhi is global vice president of Faithforce, a 5,000-member affinity group at her company, and part of the "Sikhs at Salesforce" Slack channel -- positions she's used to help out her Sikh colleagues.
Some Sikhs, for example, are required to carry a kirpan, a small ceremonial dagger that represents justice and courage. Yet they worry colleagues or security will misconstrue the kirpan as a weapon. After her colleagues raised these concerns on the Slack channel last year, Ms. Gandhi helped convene meetings with executives, security officials and employees to discuss the issue.
As a result of these talks, Sikhs who want to carry a kirpan at work now receive special notation on their employee badges.
Ms. Gandhi found this experience empowering. "That is who I am," she said. "We shouldn't be hiding."
In fact, many religious employees say they were closeted about their faith before "coming out" to colleagues. Michael Roberts, a Salesforce engineer, said it took him three years to come out as an evangelical Christian. Once he did, he became a founding member of Faithforce.
A few years later, at age 30, Mr. Roberts came out as gay. After learning that he was in a same-sex relationship, his longtime church rejected him. But his Faithforce colleagues had the opposite response. "They were amazing champions," Mr. Roberts said. "That was a significant source of strength for me in that hard transition."
Difficult conversations
Companies with faith-based affinity groups are quick to emphasize how deeply their employees respect one another. But as religious workers become more vocal inside secular workplaces, "one potential downside is that what's safe and creates a more inclusive environment for one group might have an opposite or negative impact for another group," said Katina Sawyer, associate professor of management and organizations at the University of Arizona, who studies workplace inclusion. "That's not something organizations have necessarily thought about in great detail."
The Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from discriminating against workers based on their religion, race, gender, nationality or sexual orientation. But recent Supreme Court decisions seem to have privileged religious freedoms, like exempting health plans at companies with religious objections from providing contraception under the Affordable Care Act or allowing a religious social services nonprofit to turn away same-sex foster parents.
In June, a unanimous Supreme Court decision made it easier for people to seek religious accommodations at work. Typically, such accommodations involve holiday time off or wearing religious dress. But Steven Green, director of the Center for Religion, Law and Democracy at Willamette University, thinks the ruling could open the door for other demands -- like the ability to proselytize, which is a core tenet of some faiths. "Some religious public interest groups are creating a narrative that you must be able to bring your entire self into the workplace," he said, "and that means your ability to evangelize, which has been inhibited."
During a recent Pride month, members of some faith-based employee groups at a large tech company grew frustrated over their employer's overt L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy. Some considered organizing a walkout. An adviser to the Christian affinity group, who requested anonymity to preserve his professional relationships, counseled the frustrated employees to consider how such an event would affect their L.G.B.T.Q. colleagues. The walkout never happened.
Mr. Grim, of the Religious Freedom & Business Foundation, recalled hearing about another incident in which an employee sent a mass email inviting staff to a Bible study. Mr. Grim says that the appropriate employer response should depend on the situation: If a supervisor sent the email, it could be considered coercive if it is viewed as mandatory or somehow consequential to an employee's place in the company. But if a rank-and-file employee is permitted to send a mass email invitation to a baby shower or Pride parade, then Bible study should be fair game.
Not every company is prepared to grapple with these questions. It's possibly why only 43 Fortune 500 companies officially recognize faith-based affinity groups, according to an assessment by Mr. Grim's organization.
"We're often approached by diversity professionals who are really versed in race, gender, sexuality, and they're like, "Oh, I don't get religion, and I'm not comfortable with it," said Megan Johnson, senior director for strategic initiatives at the nonpartisan, nonprofit Interfaith America. "Especially when these groups might come up against that person's own value set."
In 2021, Rebecca Leeman was an organizational consultant at PwC in Manhattan, when a man wearing a skullcap was assaulted near the company's Midtown offices. He had been on his way to a pro-Israel demonstration. Ms. Leeman said the company sent a mass email condemning the assault and even mentioned it during an all-hands meeting, but never used the word "anti-Semitism."
"Because of the connections to Israel and politics, I think they were intentionally vague," Ms. Leeman said. She felt the company needed to understand the very specific fear she'd been feeling about her Jewish identity in recent years.
She co-wrote a letter to Tim Ryan, then the company's U.S. chair, requesting that PwC recognize a formal Jewish affinity group. The company responded swiftly. Within a few months, they'd authorized an interfaith organization with a Jewish group under its umbrella.
'Feel-good stuff' vs. shared identity
Companies like an interfaith approach to religion in the workplace, because it allows them to focus on education and sidestep potential conflict. Last December, PayPal hosted its first interfaith fair, complete with turban tying and henna painting. This winter, PwC will host a lunch and learn about workers' different holiday traditions. Each spring, a handful of companies hold Ramadan "fast-a-thons" in which non-Muslims fast for one day alongside their Muslim colleagues.
At Dell, there is a single multifaith group with six religions represented but no faith-specific communities -- at least none the company officially recognizes. "Those become divisive and exclusive," said Vanice Hayes, Dell's chief culture, diversity and inclusion officer. "We are all about making sure people don't feel siloed."
Mr. Singh of the Aspen Institute agrees that an interfaith approach can help avoid polarization, but he worries the "feel-good stuff" can "fall really flat, because it's too superficial." He added that workers from minority faiths often want a space "to find their people on the basis of some shared identity and heritage." That's especially important, he said, with hate crimes on the rise.
In late 2022, the Anti-Defamation League started a Jewish Employee Resource Group Network to address growing inquiries from Jewish employees and D.E.I. officers. "Excluding Jews or bundling them in a much bigger group reinforces that signal that Jews are not vulnerable, aren't a minority group," said Adam Neufeld, senior vice president and chief impact officer of the A.D.L. "We think they are."
Access to a like-minded community also provides the safety some workers need to step outside of it. Steve Teng, whose Austin nonprofit Pivot helps Christians start Christ-centered communities at work, said some people have been taught to think that entering interfaith spaces means they're abandoning their own theology.

Full text: The largest deal Cisco has ever announced moves it further away from its roots in network hardware and into higher-margin software subscriptions.
Cisco agreed on Thursday to buy Splunk, a data-analysis software company, for $ 28 billion in cash, as technology giants continue to look to acquisitions as a way to grow -- particularly in hot sectors like artificial intelligence.
The deal is the largest ever announced by Cisco, a longtime buyer of smaller tech companies, and suggests the company is willing to test antitrust officials' growing opposition to big-ticket mergers and acquisitions.
Founded in 2003, Splunk -- whose name refers to spelunking, or cave exploration -- focuses on mining its customers' data for insights, particularly on security vulnerabilities and other trends in their business. This summer, Splunk announced a flurry of A.I.-infused services meant to help companies detect and respond to potential issues more quickly.
Cisco said it planned to combine Splunk's capabilities with its own security offerings, including the monitoring of customers' network data, web traffic and emails.
"I consistently heard from our customers the strategic importance of what Splunk does," Chuck Robbins, the Cisco chief executive, said in an interview. Combining Splunk's systems with the information collected from Cisco's, he said, presented an "opportunity to bring a level of insight that's unmatched."
Gary Steele, the Splunk chief executive, added that Cisco's bigger sales footprint would help his company sell its products more widely, especially internationally. Mr. Steele is set to stay on as a member of Cisco's leadership team when the transaction closes, which is expected by the fall of next year.
The deal moves Cisco further away from its roots in network hardware and into higher-margin, more predictable software subscriptions.
Much of Cisco's push into software is being driven by acquisitions: The company has announced eight takeovers this year, according to S&P Capital IQ.
By some measures, Cisco is paying a high price. The transaction valued Splunk at $ 157 a share, a 31 percent premium to where its stock closed on Wednesday and 25 percent above the company's 52-week high. (Cisco had held discussions to buy Splunk early last year.)
Shares in Cisco fell 4 percent after the deal was announced. Shares in Splunk rose on the news, but still traded below the acquisition offer price, suggesting investors were somewhat skeptical that the deal would be completed. Among the potential concerns is whether antitrust regulators will approve the transaction, given increased scrutiny of big mergers by the Biden administration.
Privately, corporate executives have said recent setbacks for regulators, including defeats for the Federal Trade Commission's effort to block Microsoft's $ 70 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard, could make it easier to do deals.
Mr. Robbins expressed confidence in the Cisco-Splunk deal's clearing antitrust hurdles, because there is little overlap in the companies' products.

Chief Executive of a Tech David Testifies About Obstacles to Competing With a Goliath, Google: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Gabriel Weinberg of the search engine DuckDuckGo was the first competitor to testify in the Justice Department's antitrust trial against Google.
The chief executive of DuckDuckGo on Thursday described Google as a monopoly that has hurt competition and consumers through its scale and command over the tech industry, in the first testimony of a rival in the federal trial of the Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against the search giant.
Gabriel Weinberg of DuckDuckGo said that Google's deals to make its search engine the default on browsers and other platforms blocked its ability to compete effectively. DuckDuckGo, with only 2.5 percent of the U.S. market for search, tried to negotiate with other companies to make its privacy-focused search engine a default. But it was continually turned down because of Google's deals with those tech partners, he said.
"We ultimately decided after three years of trying this that it was a quixotic exercise because of the contracts," Mr. Weinberg said.
The trial of the Justice Department's antitrust complaint against Google is the government's first monopoly case in two decades, and it is expected to sweep in many of the biggest tech companies. Executives at Apple, Microsoft and Verizon are also expected to testify in the trial, which could reshape how consumers get information online.
The Justice Department has argued that Google has violated competition laws by maintaining its monopoly through the deals that make it the default access point in users' search for online information across multiple platforms.
Google has defended its business partnerships, saying the companies, including Apple and Samsung, have chosen to make Google the default on their devices because of Google's superior quality. Google said consumers can easily adjust settings on their browsers to change search engine defaults to alternatives like DuckDuckGo.
Mr. Weinberg said on Thursday that any switches to default search engines take far more steps than Google says.
"It's all just way harder than it needs to be," he said.
Mr. Weinberg didn't disclose details of business negotiations in public proceedings but continued his testimony in a closed session on day nine of the antitrust trial.
Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has closed many hours of testimonies at the request of Google and other companies that have argued to keep documents and testimony of sensitive business matters private.

Hope and Despair On a Boiling Planet: [Climate]

Full text: As efforts to control climate change are on the rise across the globe, the challenges are steeper than ever.
This article is part of our special section on the Climate Forward event that will include policy and climate leaders from around the world.
On any given day, there is good reason to be both exceedingly optimistic about the progress being made to combat climate change, and also deeply concerned about the threats presented by a rapidly warming planet.
Take a single Wednesday last month: Aug. 16. On that day, the White House celebrated the first anniversary of the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act. President Biden's signature climate legislation is providing hundreds of billions of dollars to subsidize the build-out of clean energy around the country, turbocharging efforts to shift the economy away from planet-warming fossil fuels.
At the very same time, however, a flurry of extreme weather events were battering the globe. Hurricane Hilary, which would go on to lash Southern California as a rare tropical storm, formed in the Pacific Ocean. Portland and other cities in the Northwest United States were sizzling under an unusual heat wave. And Japan was cleaning up from a destructive typhoon.
It was a dizzying combination of good news and epic disasters that captured the disorienting moment in which we find ourselves.
On the one hand, a new green revolution is genuinely underway, with trillions of dollars being spent to reduce planet-warming emissions. On the other hand, the destructive effects of climate change are now squarely upon us, and poised to get worse, scientists predict.
"The basis for both the hope and the fear has increased," Al Gore, the former vice president, said in an interview. "That may sound like a paradox, but I've never been more hopeful that we are going to solve this crisis, and there's never been clearer evidence of how rapidly this crisis is getting much worse, faster than expected."
It's this tension -- between progress and inertia, between a sustainable future and an untenable status quo -- that will animate a full day of live journalism at The New York Times Climate Forward event on Thursday.
Timed to coincide with the United Nations General Assembly session in New York City, the event will feature conversations with Mr. Gore; Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store of Norway; President William Ruto of Kenya; Bill Gates, a founder of Microsoft and the founder of Breakthrough Energy; the tidying-up expert and author Marie Kondo; the former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy; and many other climate leaders.
Together, they will be taking stock of a crisis that is reshaping our planet, transforming economies, straining our food system and challenging humans to adapt to a warmer world. In the past few months alone, record heat, unusually warm oceans, and disappearing sea ice have shattered records and alarmed the scientific community, while unprecedented wildfires, floods and storms have wreaked havoc around the globe.
"We have 100-year floods occurring every five years, fires sweeping across the country, and respiratory illnesses are on the rise," said Ebony Twilley Martin, executive director of Greenpeace USA. "It's no wonder that two-thirds of Americans want action on climate change."
But while there are indeed growing calls for action on climate, according to the Pew Research Center, remaking the world's energy, transportation, agricultural and industrial systems is no small task.
In Europe and the United States, a growing percentage of electricity is being generated with wind turbines and solar power, and more electric vehicles are taking to the road. Yet across much of the rest of the world, new coal plants are still being built, and a growing middle class is consuming more plastics, fuels and meat.
So-called climate deniers -- some industry leaders, influential politicians and members of the general public -- are skeptical of the science and often equally opposed to the proposed solutions, and some fossil fuel companies continue to block efforts to reduce emissions.
And while world leaders pledged to try and keep global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels at the United Nations climate summit in Paris in 2015, that goal looks unachievable today.
Against this backdrop, calls to phase out the use of coal, gas and oil are growing more urgent than ever before.
"With a growing global population, energy demands are only going up, and fossil fuels are absolutely not the answer to this increased demand," said Ms. McCarthy, the former E.P.A. administrator. "We need to install more wind, solar and other existing clean energy solutions that are now cheaper and healthier than fossil fuels."
António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, has grown impassioned in his calls to phase out fossil fuels and draw down greenhouse gas emissions. "The era of global warming has ended," he said recently. "The era of global boiling has arrived."
Activists are disrupting sporting events, shutting down highways and taking to the streets. And young people are increasingly engaged, bringing lawsuits and challenging politicians and corporate interests.
"It definitely is a David versus Goliath fight," Nalleli Cobo, a young activist from Los Angeles who grew up near an active oil well and developed cancer at age 19, said during the March to End Fossil Fuels in New York. "But as a person of faith, I'm very happy to be David in this fight. It's a reminder of the collective power that we have."
And business leaders and philanthropists are increasingly engaged. Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, has made climate action a core part of his charitable strategy and is spending more than $ 1 billion on efforts to shut down coal, gas and petrochemical plants.
It will take trillions of dollars, not just billions, however, to build out clean energy infrastructure around the world, while at the same time adapting to a hotter planet.
There is tentative hope that proposed reforms to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund could help unlock some of that capital, sending it to developing countries -- especially in Africa, which has 60 percent of the world's solar energy potential and almost a third of the minerals that will be needed to electrify transportation and the power grid.
"If you think about the attributes and the assets that we're going to need in order to survive and thrive this century, Africa is uniquely well endowed," said James Irungu Mwangi, a Kenyan entrepreneur who helped organize the recent Africa Climate Summit. "Investing in Africa and climate positive growth is one of the best chances the world has of getting anywhere close to the Paris goals."
But more than money, what is needed, climate advocates say, is a wholesale reimagining of the world and our place in it.
"The single biggest obstacle to having a meaningful effect on climate change is the narrative that nature and humanity are disconnected or separate," said the Rev. Lennox Yearwood Jr., president and chief executive of the Hip-Hop Caucus, an advocacy group working to stop the expansion of fossil fuels.
Mr. Yearwood said that as climate disasters multiply, there is a growing need for people across the world to recognize that this is the only planet we have. "We must begin to center the human impact of climate change," he said, "and understand how it intersects with all aspects of our daily lives."
Only then, he said, will we have a chance of solving what may be the greatest collective action problem in human history.

Full text: The suit, filed with the Authors Guild, accuses the A.I. company of infringing on authors' copyrights, claiming it used their books to train its ChatGPT chatbot.
A group of prominent novelists, including John Grisham, Jonathan Franzen and Elin Hilderbrand, are joining the legal battle against OpenAI over its chatbot technology, as fears about the encroachment of artificial intelligence on creative industries continue to grow.
More than a dozen authors filed a lawsuit against OpenAI on Tuesday, accusing the company, which has been backed with billions of dollars in investment from Microsoft, of infringing on their copyrights by using their books to train its popular ChatGPT chatbot. The complaint, which was filed along with the Authors Guild, said that OpenAI's chatbots can now produce "derivative works" that can mimic and summarize the authors' books, potentially harming the market for authors' work, and that the writers were neither compensated nor notified by the company.
"The success and profitability of OpenAI are predicated on mass copyright infringement without a word of permission from or a nickel of compensation to copyright owners," the complaint said.
The complaint, which was filed in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, said that while OpenAI does not publicly declare which works it uses to train its models, the company has admitted to using copyrighted material. The complaint also said that OpenAI's ChatGPT is capable of producing summaries of books that include details not available in reviews or elsewhere online, which suggests the underlying program was fed the books in their entirety.
The Authors Guild lawsuit is the latest in a series brought by writers against OpenAI. It is likely to generate attention because of its high-profile plaintiffs, who include best-selling novelists from a range of genres, among them David Baldacci, Jodi Picoult, George R.R. Martin, George Saunders and Michael Connelly.
Douglas Preston, a novelist who joined the lawsuit, said he was shocked when he asked ChatGPT to describe minor characters in his books and it spat back detailed information that wasn't available in reviews or Wikipedia entries for the novels.
"That's when I looked at this and said, 'My God, ChatGPT has read my books, how many of my books has it read?"' he said. "It knew everything, and that's when I got a bad feeling."
A representative for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT in November, authors, publishers and retailers have been trying to rein in the rampant and increasingly disruptive incursion of A.I. in the industry. Already, there has been a rise in A.I.-generated books on Amazon, including travel guides and books on plant and fungi foraging, which prompted the New York Mycological Society to issue a warning to avoid A.I.-generated guides.
Amazon has taken steps to monitor and curb the influx of A.I.-generated books. This month, it posted new guidelines for self-published authors, requiring them to disclose whether they had used A.I. to create texts. It also limited the number of titles users can upload to its self-publishing platform each day, to three. Amazon does not currently disclose which books are created by A.I. to its customers, but it may do so in the future, according to an Amazon representative.
A handful of other lawsuits have been filed in recent months by writers against OpenAI and Meta, the parent of Facebook and Instagram. This month, Michael Chabon, Ayelet Waldman and Matthew Klam were among a group of writers who collectively sued OpenAI and Meta, which has also developed A.I. technology, for copyright infringement.
In a filing last month for another suit brought by authors, lawyers for OpenAI moved to dismiss the bulk of plaintiffs' claims, and argued that using texts "for innovations," including training A.I., constitutes fair use.
Copyright questions surrounding A.I. remain unresolved, and experts are divided over whether authors' claims of infringement will hold up in court. Some argue that if an A.I. program is ingesting copyrighted works for training but creates new works that are substantially different, that constitutes fair use. Others, however, believe the authors' argument is likely to prevail.
"They've scraped all this content and put it into their databases without asking permission -- that seems like a huge grab of content," said Edward Klaris, a lawyer who specializes in intellectual property and media law. "I think courts are going to say that copying into the database is an infringement in itself."
Mary Bly, who publishes historical romance novels under the name Eloisa James, said she joined the Authors Guild suit because she worried that if writers failed to draw boundaries around their work, technology companies would continue to plunder and imitate them.
"This lawsuit is important because it establishes a line in the sand," she said. "If you're going to train things in the future on my books, you need to license them. You can't just take things."

Markets Sag After the Fed's Announcement on Rates: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: U.S. stocks slumped on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it might not cut interest rates next year by as much as it had thought, regardless of how much Wall Street wants it.
The S&P 500 fell 41.75, or 0.9 percent, to 4,402.20. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 76.85, or 0.2 percent, to 34,440.88, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 209.06, or 1.5 percent, to 13,469.13.
The Fed held its main interest rate steady at its highest level in more than two decades, as was widely expected. Officials also indicated they could raise the federal funds rate one more time this year, as the Fed tries to get inflation back down to its target of 2 percent.
But Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said it was close to hitting the peak on rates, if not there already.
Perhaps most important for the market, Fed officials suggested they might cut rates next year by only half a percentage point, rather than a full percentage point. That could be a negative for Wall Street, where investors crave rate cuts because of the boost they typically give to all kinds of investments.
Stocks initially held relatively steady after the release of the Fed's forecasts, but they slid later in the afternoon.
"As you move further and further away from the meeting, the message may sink in," said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "We very much expect the markets to be knocked a little bit off their axis by this."
Treasury yields rose in the bond market after the Fed released its projections. They had already been climbing for months after strong reports on the U.S. economy suggested the Fed might need to keep interest rates higher for longer to fully drive down pressures on inflation.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.39 percent from less than 4.32 percent shortly before the Fed's announcement, and from 4.37 percent late Tuesday. It is back to where it was in 2007.
The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, jumped to 5.18 percent from 5.04 percent shortly before the Fed's announcement.
"Future meetings will be a tug of war between markets who want cuts and a Fed that is scared its job isn't done," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.
"The Fed is projecting it will hit its unemployment rate and inflation targets in 2026," he said. "Markets are more impatient than that. One year is an eternity to traders, let alone two years."
High rates hurt prices for all kinds of investments, and high-growth companies are typically among the hardest hit. Big Tech stocks were the heaviest weights on the S&P 500, and Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia all fell at least 2 percent.
Shares of several companies that just recently sold their stock on public markets for the first time also fell. Instacart dropped 10.7 percent as it gave back some of its gains from its first day of trading as a public stock.
On the winning side of Wall Street, shares of Textron climbed 4.9 percent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after it announced a deal in which NetJets has the option to purchase up to 1,000 of its Citation business jets over the next 15 years.
In stock markets abroad, the FTSE 100 in London rose 0.9 percent after a report showed U.K. inflation fell unexpectedly in August to its lowest level since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine.
Indexes were mostly weaker in Asia after data showed Japanese exports fell from year-ago levels for the second straight month. Exports to China sank 11 percent, as the world's second-largest economy continues to underperform expectations.
Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.7 percent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.6 percent and stocks in Shanghai slipped 0.5 percent.

Full text: The government states that data is "oxygen for a search engine" and that Google's anticompetitive behavior has given it a data fortress. Google says innovation explains its success.
The federal government's first monopoly trial of the modern internet era is less than a week old, but already a central character has emerged: data. Its role, its use and its power are key issues in the Justice Department's case against Google.
The government claims that Google bribed and bullied smartphone producers like Apple and Samsung and the browser maker Mozilla to be their featured search engine, funneling far more data to Google and cutting off competitors.
Data, the government says, drives the flywheel of Google's success. Each search query adds data, which improves search results, attracting more users who generate still more data and advertising revenue. And Google's ever-growing data advantage, the government asserts, is an insurmountable barrier for rivals.
Data is "oxygen for a search engine," Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department's lead lawyer, declared in his opening statement on Tuesday.
The government's case is not that Google violated the law in becoming a search giant. Instead, the government claims that after Google became dominant, the company broke the law with its tactics to defend its monopoly. Contracts with industry partners to be their default search engine were the weapon -- exclusive deals that froze out rivals, the government claims. So Google is now protected from competition behind a fortress built with data.
Google replies that the government's case is an artifice of misleading theory unsupported by the facts. The government has chosen to "ignore inescapable truths," John Schmidtlein, Google's lead lawyer, asserted in his opening statement.
Those truths, according to Google, are that the company holds its leading position in search because of its technical innovation. It competes with others for default-placement contracts and wins mainly because Google is the best search engine. Those contracts, Google argues, help reduce prices for smartphones and benefit consumers.
The government, Google insists, is overstating the importance of data. In a brief filed this month, the company stated, "Google does not deny that user data can improve search quality, but Google will show that there are diminishing returns to scale."
The trial resumes this week with the Justice Department continuing to present its case. The first witness scheduled to testify on Monday is Brian Higgins, an executive at Verizon who oversees mobile device and customer marketing. The trial is scheduled to run for 10 weeks. A ruling from Judge Amit P. Mehta will come next year.
Google holds 90 percent of the search engine market in the United States, while Microsoft's Bing is a far-distant rival, with less than 5 percent. The difference, Google says, is explained by the smarts of its engineers, not the size of its trove of rich data.
To make its point, Google will call an expert witness, Edward Fox, a computer scientist at Virginia Tech. Professor Fox has conducted a "data reduction experiment" on Google's behalf to estimate how much Google's search quality would decline if it used far less data -- roughly the amount available to Bing. The result, according to Google's filing, was that the data difference explains only part of the gap in search quality between Google and Microsoft.
Google's public messaging on that issue has been consistent over the years. But the government claims that the messaging has been deceitful. In his opening statement, Mr. Dintzer said Google had "misled the public about the importance of data."
To try to show the deception, the government introduced emails among senior Google employees, sparring over that point, as evidence last week. Hal Varian, Google's chief economist, was questioned about defaults and data as the Justice Department's first witness.
At issue were comments that Mr. Varianmade in a 2009 interview with the technology news site CNET.
In the article, Mr. Varian said, "The scale arguments are pretty bogus."
To explain, he added in the article: "It's not the quantity or quality of the ingredients that make a difference. It's the recipes." It was a deft analogy, with the ingredients being the data and recipes being the clever algorithms written by Google's engineers. It reached a wider audience when Mr. Varian's explanation was picked up in a Time magazine article.
But in an email to Mr. Varian shortly after, Udi Manber, a senior engineer on Google's search team, took issue with the economist's description. "It's absolutely not true that scale is not important," Mr. Manber wrote. "We make very good use of everything we get."
In an email string with other Google employees, Mr. Manber wrote, "I know it reads well, but unfortunately it's factually wrong."
A lot has changed since then. The government introduced the emails to cast doubt on the credibility of what Google is saying in court. They amount to a few snippets at the beginning of a lengthy nonjury trial that will generate piles and piles of evidence, testimony and rebuttal for Judge Mehta to weigh and consider.
But what is already clear is that a debate over data in search -- whether it has market-determining power or not -- is a pivotal issue, and one that both sides will most likely be compelled to return to repeatedly in the trial.

In Strikes Across Industries, Workers Fear New Technologies Will Cost Jobs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: What's being called the "summer of strikes" comes at a time when workers increasingly fear new technologies will threaten their jobs.
The United Automobile Workers strike is in its second day, and already it's being framed as potentially the most costly of work stoppages from the "summer of strikes."
Unions aren't just fighting for an inflation-beating wage boost. They also are campaigning for job security at a time when workers increasingly fear that shifts to new technologies, like electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, threaten their job, and tech bosses themselves say this gloomy outlook is inevitable.
Union leaders had a seat at the table this week in Washington at an A.I. forum organized by Senator Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, and attended by tech leaders, such as Elon Musk, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Jensen Huang of Nvidia. Their presence signals their growing clout in discussions about the future of the technology.
Concern over disruptive technologies are seen on the picket lines. The Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union, fear studios are embracing A.I. tools to generate scripts or copy the performances of actors. "If we don't stand tall right now, we are all going to be in trouble," Fran Drescher, president of SAG-AFTRA, warned in July. "We are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines."
The U.A.W., meanwhile, is concerned that the industry's shift to electric vehicles will require fewer workers, and that many of the jobs needed will be in battery factories, most of which are not unionized.
Giving workers a voice in the use of technology has taken on new urgency, said Thomas Kochan, an emeritus professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, who has been studying the future of work since the 1980s: "Generative A.I. in particular has just exploded on the scene in a way that's going to make this one of the most controversial and one of the most important workplace issues of our time."
The clock is ticking. It's strategic for unions to get involved early. Otherwise, companies can say, "We're already using the technology; we're not really interested in your ideas about how we could be better using it," said Adam Seth Litwin, an associate professor of industrial and labor relations at Cornell University.
Companies aren't legally obligated to negotiate with unions over early-stage decisions on how new technologies are used. Unions "only have a right to negotiate over the impacts of technology on wages, hours and working conditions," Kochan said. The thornier issue of what and how technology is deployed, he said, is "the frontier of collective bargaining today."
One breakthrough for labor came in 2018, when Marriott Hotel workers went on strike at 49 locations. After a six-week stoppage, the company agreed to give the union notice before introducing technologies that would affect workers' jobs and the right to discuss the changes with management.
Why would companies benefit from worker input? "If technologies are not developed with the user in mind, they often fail," said Lisa Kresge, a research and policy associate at the University of California Berkeley Labor Center, who has written about union responses to technology. Take those Marriott workers: At the time, they said a new housekeeping app sent them inefficiently bouncing between floors when they could have worked faster by cleaning rooms clustered together.
"If the only option that the labor movement places on the table is 'No, we don't want the technology that will hurt our workers,' that will not be enough," said Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T. and a co-author of "Power and Progress: Our 1,000-Year Struggle Over Technology & Prosperity." The key, he said, is for labor to articulate how the technologies can be used "to the great benefit of the workers as well as the businesses." That's "what's missing right now" in the labor negotiations, Acemoglu added.
Federal proposals to regulate A.I. -- in relation to work or otherwise -- are barely underway. That leaves the unions, which represent only about 6 percent of the private sector work force, fighting a lonely battle. "If your company is automating and you want a voice in that process, and you are not unionized," Acemoglu said, "then there is not much you can do." -- Sarah Kessler
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Arm flex gives markets a boost. The initial public offering of the chip design company Arm this week on the Nasdaq stock exchange was the biggest market debut in nearly two years. It raised almost $ 5 billion, valuing the company at nearly $ 68 billion, and bolstered the hopes of other companies planning to go public.
A lawmaker trip to Wall Street exposes U.S.-China dilemma. The House committee on competition with China visited New York City this week for meetings with financial executives. The discussions included a war-game-like exercise to assess the potential economic implications if China invaded Taiwan. But many executives did not want their names made public for fear of putting their China business at risk.
Google has its day in court. The biggest antitrust battle in decades began in Washington, with the Justice Department accusing Google of abusing its power as a monopoly over online search engines. The company argues that users have lots of alternatives.
"Elon Musk" is out. After weeks of headline-generating excerpts, Walter Isaacson's biography of the Tesla-SpaceX-Starlink C.E.O. and X owner hit stores. The book grapples with Musk's multiple identities: a man driven by an abusive childhood; a world-changing entrepreneur; and a sleep-deprived, impulsive mogul who doesn't fully understand the extraordinary power he wields.
Natural assets
After a summer filled with catastrophic floods, blistering heat domes and devastating wildfires, government and business leaders from around the world are set to discuss efforts to mitigate climate change at the United Nations Climate Ambition Summit in New York on Wednesday.
The usual topics are on the agenda, including net-zero targets, energy transition plans and renewable energy targets.
But these solutions may be missing something fundamental, according to Partha Dasgupta, an economist at the University of Cambridge. In a 2021 report commissioned by the British government, Dasgupta made the case for shifting how natural resources are valued, and the idea has since gained momentum: Last month, the White House released a draft proposal on what should be considered in a cost-benefit analysis when it comes to ecosystem services in government, practices that draw on his work.
DealBook spoke with Dasgupta about updating economics to account for nature.
Traditional economics does not account for the value Earth provides, Dasgupta said, but instead assumes that ecosystems are self-regenerating and able to offer services indefinitely and that there will be an infinite supply of materials. His report included what he calls an "important new set of calculations" for treating natural resources like the ocean and functions, like pollination, as assets, which, theoretically, increase the chances that we invest in and manage our ecosystems to allow for the production of more goods. "Asset management is a very well understood phenomenon," Dasgupta said. "But for a variety of reasons, Mother Nature's assets don't carry the signals we need to manage them adequately."
How this idea is applied will vary from place to place, Dasgupta said, but now there is a vocabulary and method for addressing the underlying issues. The Biden proposal, for example, cites "failing to fully account for nature's bounty" as having led to an "erosion of our nation's natural assets." Dasgupta called the proposal "a fine piece of work," but he said that he wasn't confident it would be put into effect, or that his ideas more broadly would be understood fast enough to prevent disaster. "We're in a firefighting situation," he said. "Extreme weather events are happening even as we speak."
Dasgupta worries that an important nuance within his work gets lost, even as it becomes more well known. The services of nature are interconnected, and "they can be brought down like a house of cards," he said. "You remove one card from the house and the whole house collapses." So climate change solutions that focus on goods and tech, like replacing oil with solar power, fail to account for the full picture -- the interconnectedness of everything.
Policymakers often assume that a few tweaks and some human ingenuity will allow for infinite goods and growth; Dasgupta does not.
The New York Times will speak about the climate crisis next week with global leaders, including Bill Gates; Ajay Banga, the president of the World Bank; Robin Wall Kimmerer, author and scientist; Jonas Gahr Store, the prime minister of Norway; and William Ruto, the president of Kenya. Register to watch the free livestream of the Climate Forward event on Sept. 21.
On our radar: 'Dumb Money'
Remember the meme-stock craze of 2021? The sudden jump in shares of the video game retailer GameStop, driven by Reddit-fueled day traders, rattled financial titans -- especially the hedge fund moguls who had bet against the company's stock price. It was seen briefly as a moment of Main Street's beating Wall Street at its own game.
That heady time is chronicled in "Dumb Money," an exuberant comedy that aims to do for GameStop what "The Big Short" did for the 2008 global financial crisis. Out now in limited release, the movie features a cast of big-name actors, including Paul Dano, America Ferrera and Seth Rogen, playing a mix of real-life characters and fictional composites who feature on both sides of the trading conflict.
"Dumb Money" is connected to Wall Street behind the scenes, too: The film was financed and produced by Teddy Schwarzman, son of the Blackstone co-founder Stephen A. Schwarzman, and written by two former Wall Street Journal reporters, Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo. But it's not exactly sympathetic to the hedge fund side of the story -- to the point that Ken Griffin of Citadel has reportedly threatened to sue over his portrayal.
Alison Willmore of Vulture wrote in a review that "the pleasant surprise of 'Dumb Money' is that it's such an effective entertainment." The New York Times's Ben Kenigsberg described the film as "an energetic, ingratiating dramatization" but the "humanizing efforts are less inspired."

The Times Levels Up on the Video Game Beat: [Metropolitan Desk]

Full text: When it comes to covering franchises such as Halo, Starfield and Legend of Zelda, Times reporters need to be on their game.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Jason Bailey, an editor on The New York Times's Culture desk, remembers feeling as if The Times had missed the opportunity to cover a major moment in pop culture.
It was October 2018, and Red Dead Redemption 2, the hotly anticipated video game prequel to the 2010 frontier saga, had just come out. The Times ran an advertisement for the game, which would go on to sell more than 55 million copies, on its front page.
But in the news pages, there was no review of the game. No feature. No acknowledgment that it had even been released.
"We review every single play or musical that opens on Broadway," Bailey said in a recent conversation. "We review hundreds of movies a year."
"And we should be doing that," he continued. "But that means we should also be reviewing and criticizing the biggest video game releases, at the very least."
When Bailey, a former editor for the National desk, joined the Culture team last fall, he set out to expand The Times's gaming coverage, enlisting journalists like Zachary Small, a culture reporter and longtime gamer, and Kellen Browning, a technology reporter on the Business desk who covers the gig economy and the video game industry.
The effort has resulted in articles like an interactive feature on how Nintendo's beloved Legend of Zelda franchise has changed gaming by Small and Rumsey Taylor, an assistant editor at The Times, and a recent feature by Browning and Matt Stevens, a Culture reporter, on how Starfield, a new role-playing game, created an open-world space adventure. On Sunday, the Arts & Leisure fall preview issue will include a page entirely focused on video games.
"One of the benefits of creating a beat at The Times is that we can be thoughtful and experimental about how we cover these games," Small said.
In a recent roundtable-style interview, Bailey, Browning and Small shared their vision for The Times's coverage and the challenges of balancing coverage for gamers and nongamers alike. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
When did you first become interested in video games?
ZACHARY SMALL When I was a child, video games were more accessible to me than visiting a museum and seeing art. I always enjoyed the stories and the puzzle aspect. Now I cover both the fine art world and the world of video games, which most people see as disparate topics. But for me, writing about either subject involves a similar exploration: how people create in different artistic mediums.
JASON BAILEY I remember getting a Nintendo Entertainment System when I was 8 for Christmas. One of the first games I played was the original Legend of Zelda. My brother and I loved playing Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt. I played Halo in my basement every day with my friends in high school.
KELLEN BROWNING I played computer games growing up, but I'm not much of a gamer. Before I started at The Times as a fellow in 2020, I had no background in covering video games, business or technology. I was assigned those topics. But now I have a unique perspective; I have one foot in the door of the industry as someone who has covered it for the last three years, but I can also translate for a more general audience.
How do you balance writing for gamers and keeping articles accessible for readers who are less familiar?
SMALL We write stories for people who have at least a base-level knowledge of games. But there's a balance you need. If I'm writing about Zelda, people need to know what kind of game it is.
BROWNING It's important to have just enough explanation for the casual reader. I think about writing for my parents. They don't know much about tech or video games, and they need to feel included. But I don't want to over-explain something for the more hard-core reader who's like, "Why are you treating me like I'm 10 years old?"
What are some story lines you will be watching in the coming months?
BAILEY I'm excited about both small, independent studios and Triple A studios, or major gaming publishers, that are trying new things. I think we should applaud creative risk and at the very least take a more robust view of the industry in our coverage, instead of just considering the blockbuster releases.
BROWNING I'm interested in the continued ramifications of this big merger between Activision and Microsoft and seeing how that reshapes the industry. Another story we're continuing to cover is social issues around gender and diversity, as well as unionization in the gaming industry.
If you were stranded on a desert island and could only bring one video game, what would it be?
BROWNING Age of Empires: Definitive Edition, the remastered version from 2018.
BAILEY I'm going to pull out a deep cut: One of the most underrated games is Power Stone 2 on the Sega Dreamcast. It's a Super Smash Bros.-style fighting game.
SMALL I would reframe the question and recommend that any person who had never played a game before should try We Love Katamari. You roll a sticky ball and accumulate clutter until you're as big as a planet, and then you roll other planets. It shows why gaming is an artistic medium in its own right: It changes your perspective on the world, but you also have a direct stake in the action.

Full text: Mortal Kombat, Super Mario Bros. and more are coming this season.
It has been such a fruitful year for video games that you couldn't blame someone for wanting a light fall lineup to finish titles like Tears of the Kingdom and Baldur's Gate 3. For better or worse, this season is stacked with AAA releases, long-awaited sequels and promising independent games. (Some games will be available before their official launch dates because of early-access programs.)
September
MORTAL KOMBAT 1 The fighting franchise that drew crowds at arcades in the early 1990s has conjured new gruesome fatalities for its second narrative reboot. A cast of familiar characters such as Scorpion, Kitana and Johnny Cage will be assisted in battle by partner fighters who leap onscreen.

Full text: As China's spy balloon drifted across the continental United States in February, American intelligence agencies learned that President Xi Jinping of China had become enraged with senior Chinese military generals.
The spy agencies had been trying to understand what Mr. Xi knew and what actions he would take as the balloon, originally aimed at U.S. military bases in Guam and Hawaii, was blown off course.
Mr. Xi was not opposed to risky spying operations against the United States, but American intelligence agencies concluded that the People's Liberation Army had kept Mr. Xi in the dark until the balloon was over the United States.
American officials would not discuss how spy agencies gleaned this information. But in details reported here for the first time, they discovered that when Mr. Xi learned of the balloon's trajectory and realized it was derailing planned talks with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken, he berated senior generals for failing to tell him that the balloon had gone astray, according to American officials briefed on the intelligence.
The episode threw a spotlight on the expanding and highly secretive spy-versus-spy contest between the United States and China. The balloon crisis, a small part of a much larger Chinese espionage effort, reflects a brazen new aggressiveness by Beijing in gathering intelligence on the United States as well as Washington's growing capabilities to collect its own information on China.
For Washington, the espionage efforts are a critical part of President Biden's strategy to constrain the military and technological rise of China, in line with his thinking that the country poses the greatest long-term challenge to American power.
For Beijing, the new tolerance for bold action among Chinese spy agencies is driven by Mr. Xi, who has led his military to engage in aggressive moves along the nation's borders and pushed his foreign intelligence agency to become more active in farther-flung locales.
The main efforts on both sides are aimed at answering the two most difficult questions: What are the intentions of leaders in the rival nation, and what military and technological capabilities do they command?
American officials, most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss espionage, have stressed in interviews throughout the year the magnitude of the challenge. The C.I.A. is focusing on Mr. Xi himself, and in particular his intentions regarding Taiwan. The F.B.I.'s counterintelligence task forces across the nation have intensified their hunt for Chinese efforts to recruit spies inside the United States. U.S. agents have identified a dozen penetrations by Chinese citizens of military bases on American soil in the last 12 months.
Both countries are racing to develop their artificial intelligence technology, which they believe is critical to maintaining a military and economic edge and will give their spy agencies new capabilities.
Taken together, U.S. officials say, China's efforts reach across every facet of national security, diplomacy and advanced commercial technology in the United States and partner nations.
The C.I.A. and the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency have set up new centers focused on spying on China. U.S. officials have honed their capabilities to intercept electronic communications, including using spy planes off China's coast.
The spy conflict with China is even more expansive than the one that played out between the Americans and the Soviets during the Cold War, said Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director. China's large population and economy enable it to build intelligence services that are bigger than those of the United States.
"The fact is that compared to the P.R.C., we're vastly outnumbered on the ground, but it's on us to defend the American people here at home," Mr. Wray said in an interview, using the initials for the People's Republic of China. "I view this as the challenge of our generation."
China sees it differently. Wang Wenbin, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, has said that "it is the U.S. that is the No. 1 surveillance country and has the largest spy network in the world."
'Going After Everything'
Espionage can halt a slide into war or smooth the path of delicate negotiations, but it can also speed nations toward armed conflict or cause diplomatic rifts.
In late February, weeks after he canceled an important trip to Beijing over the balloon episode, Mr. Blinken confronted China's top diplomat with a U.S. intelligence assessment that Beijing was considering giving weapons to Russia. That disclosure raised tensions, but also might be keeping China from sending the arms, U.S. officials say. And when Mr. Blinken finally went to Beijing in June, he raised the issue of Chinese intelligence activities in Cuba.
China's vastly improved satellite reconnaissance and its cyberintrusions are its most important means of collecting intelligence, U.S. officials say. The fleet of spy balloons, though far less sophisticated, has allowed China to exploit the unregulated zone of "near space." And the U.S. government is warning allies that China's electronic surveillance capabilities could expand if the world's nations use technology from Chinese communications companies.
Artificial intelligence is another battleground. The U.S. government sees its lead in A.I. as a way to help offset China's strength in numbers. Chinese officials hope the technology will help them counter American military power, including by pinpointing U.S. submarines and establishing domination of space, U.S. officials say.
American officials are also more concerned than ever at Chinese agencies' efforts to gather intelligence through personal contacts. They say China's main intelligence agency, the Ministry of State Security, aims to place agents or recruit assets across the U.S. government, as well as in technology companies and the defense industry.
Chinese agents use social media sites -- LinkedIn in particular -- to lure potential recruits. Any time an American takes a publicly disclosed intelligence job, they can expect a barrage of outreach from Chinese citizens on social media, according to current and former officials.
Responding to that threat, federal agencies have quietly opened or expanded their in-house spy catching operations. And Mr. Wray said the F.B.I. has thousands of open Chinese intelligence investigations, and every one of its 56 field offices has active cases. All of those field offices now have counterintelligence and cyber task forces largely focused on the threat from Chinese intelligence.
Those investigations involve attempts by Chinese spies to recruit informants, steal information, hack into systems and monitor and harass Chinese dissidents in the United States, including using so-called police outposts.
"They're going after everything," Mr. Wray said. "What makes the P.R.C. intelligence apparatus so pernicious is the way it uses every means at its disposal against us all at once, blending cyber, human intelligence, corporate transactions and investments to achieve its strategic goals."
But critics say some of the U.S. government's counterintelligence efforts are racially biased and paranoid, amounting to a new Red Scare -- a charge at least partly supported by the cases the Justice Department has had to drop and by its shutdown of the Trump-era China Initiative program.
China has undertaken its own expansive counterintelligence crusade, one that echoes Mao-era political campaigns. On July 1, China enacted a sweeping expansion of a counterespionage law. And in August, the Ministry of State Security announced that "all members of society" should help fight foreign spying, and offered rewards for anyone providing information.
The rival governments have also established new listening posts and secret intelligence-sharing agreements with other governments. American and Chinese agents have intensified their operations against each other in pivotal cities, from Brussels to Abu Dhabi to Singapore, with each side looking to influence foreign officials and recruit well-placed assets.
The Art of Mind-Reading
For American spy agencies, Mr. Xi's decisions and intentions are arguably the most valuable intelligence they seek, but he is also the most elusive of targets.
U.S. agencies are now probing exactly why China's defense minister, Gen. Li Shangfu, appears to have been placed under investigation for corruption, and why Mr. Xi ousted Qin Gang, his foreign minister. American diplomacy and policy depend on knowing the motivations behind these moves.
A decade ago, the United States' network of informants in China was eliminated by Chinese counterintelligence officials after the informants' identities were uncovered. Since then, the C.I.A. has faced a major challenge to rebuild its network. That is partly because China's expanding webs of electronic surveillance have made it difficult for American case officers to move freely in China to meet contacts.
China even has artificial intelligence software that can recognize faces and detect the gait of an American spy, meaning traditional disguises are not enough to avoid detection, according to a former intelligence official. American operatives now must spend days rather than hours taking routes to spot any tailing Chinese agents before meeting a source or exchanging messages, former intelligence officials say.
And Mr. Xi, like other authoritarian leaders, limits his use of phones or electronic communications, for the very purpose of making it difficult for foreign intelligence agencies to intercept his orders.
But officials in the vast bureaucracy under Mr. Xi do use electronic devices, giving U.S. agencies a chance to intercept information -- what spies call signals intelligence -- to give them some insight into the internal discussions of their Chinese counterparts.
In the balloon incident, the C.I.A. began tracking the balloon in mid-January, when the Chinese army launched it from Hainan Island, officials said.
U.S. officials also determined that commanders on the Central Military Commission that Mr. Xi chairs were unaware of this particular flight until it was tipping into crisis, and they vented their frustration at the generals overseeing the surveillance program.
Since that crisis, China has paused the operations of its fleet of balloons, but American officials said they believe Beijing will likely restart the program later.
Under William J. Burns, the C.I.A. director since 2021, the agency has hired more China experts, increased spending on China-related efforts and created a new mission center on China. And while American officials refuse to discuss details of the agency's network of informants, Mr. Burns said publicly in July that it had made progress on rebuilding a "strong human intelligence capability."
While it is unclear how robust the new network is, some U.S. officials think Mr. Xi's extremely authoritarian governance style gives intelligence agencies an opening to recruit disaffected Chinese citizens, including from among the political and business elite who had benefited in previous decades from less party control and a less ideological leadership.
Some prominent Chinese figures, including "princelings" of Communist Party elite families, say in private conversations that they disagree with the turn China has taken.
China has also poured resources into determining the thinking of top American officials. A Justice Department indictment unsealed in July suggests Chinese businesspeople tied to the government were trying to recruit James Woolsey, a former C.I.A. director who was in the running to be a Trump administration national security cabinet official right after the 2016 election.
More recently, a sophisticated, highly targeted penetration of Microsoft's cloud computing platform gave China access to the emails of senior State Department diplomats, including the American ambassador in Beijing and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.
American officials traveling to China take elaborate countermeasures to avoid having government secrets pilfered. They are issued burner cellphones and laptops and told to leave their regular devices at home.
Dennis Wilder, a former U.S. intelligence analyst on China and a senior fellow at Georgetown University, said that discerning the intentions of American leaders is one of the very top priorities for Chinese intelligence agencies.
"They look for senior planning and intentions," he said. "What is the secretary of state really thinking? What is he really doing? What are the operations the C.I.A. is really running against you?"
Measuring Military Muscle
No issue in U.S.-China relations has loomed larger than Taiwan. It is the flashpoint likeliest to lead to war, analysts say. Mr. Xi has said China must take control of Taiwan, a de facto independent island, and has ordered his military to be capable of doing so by 2027. But so far, the United States and its allies do not appear to have concrete intelligence on whether Mr. Xi would be willing to order an invasion.
And China obsesses over the flip side of the question. Mr. Biden has declared four times that the U.S. military will defend Taiwan should China try to seize the island. But whether Mr. Biden really means that -- and whether American leaders plan to permanently keep Taiwan out of China's reach -- are believed to be focal points of some of China's intelligence efforts.
In the absence of real intelligence on intentions, American and Chinese officials are focused on gathering information on each other's military capabilities. The United States, for instance, has stepped up its aerial surveillance of Chinese military bases.
Meanwhile, Chinese intelligence agents have penetrated many parts of the Taiwanese government over the decades, former U.S. intelligence officials say. Chinese agents are now trying to learn more about the Biden administration's efforts to outfit Taiwan with certain weapons systems and provide secret training for Taiwanese troops. Chinese agents also seek more details on the growing military cooperation between the United States and Asian allies.
"What is it all for?" asked Representative Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House's new China committee, referring to Beijing's espionage efforts. "My speculation, based on what we see around our military bases, based on their cyberhacks, is that it is all geared toward Taiwan."
Other U.S. officials also say China's desire to learn more about American armed readiness explains its attempts to surveil military bases around the United States. In the last 12 months, according to U.S. officials, they have tracked about a dozen attempts by Chinese citizens to sneak on to military bases to take photos or measure electromagnetic activity. Some of the recent efforts appear focused on bases that would play an important role in a Taiwan conflict, they say.
In August, the Justice Department charged two American sailors with providing military secrets to Chinese intelligence agents. The sailors pleaded not guilty.
But intelligence collection is not in itself a prelude to war. The espionage struggle actually could be a substitute for armed clashes, as it often was during the Cold War.
U.S. intelligence officials believe that China does not want to go to war now over Taiwan, Avril D. Haines, the director of national intelligence, told Congress in March.
"We assess that Beijing still believes it benefits most," she said, "by preventing a spiraling of tensions and by preserving stability in its relationship with the United States."

Spidey Will Need More Web Fluid: [Arts and Leisure Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The sequel to the 2018 video game will let players scour three boroughs in a love letter to the city and its Spidey savior.
Reality and fantasy were deeply intertwined in Marvel's Spider-Man, where gamers swung from webs above Lincoln Center and leaped from the Empire State Building's spire into the crowds leaving the subway station at Herald Square. The comic book icon also brought his own landmarks to that version of New York City, which hosted the Avengers headquarters a few blocks north of the United Nations and a supervillain prison in the East River.
The designers at Insomniac Games are now expanding the superhero's jurisdiction beyond Manhattan for the sequel, to be released for the PlayStation 5 on Oct. 20. Marvel's Spider-Man 2 swells into Queens and Brooklyn (including Coney Island attractions), testing a design team responsible for nearly doubling the real estate of the 2018 original.
Replicating parts of the largest city in the United States was also a bigger challenge this time because the process began while many designers at Insomniac, which has offices in Burbank, Calif., and Durham, N.C., were working from their homes during the coronavirus pandemic.
The game's design director, Josue Benavidez, said his research involved contacting organizations like the Center for Brooklyn History, posting on Reddit groups devoted to the borough and calling businesses near the buildings he was studying.
"It's been a lot of living in Google Maps," Benavidez said.
Several open-world video games have leaned on New York's familiar topography, including Grand Theft Auto IV and Tom Clancy's The Division; in Assassin's Creed III, players can scamper across an 18th-century version of the city. But New York is an inextricable part of the Spider-Man mythos, from its comic book origins -- Peter Parker was born in Queens -- to its movie iterations.
In the franchise's first live-action movie, 2002's "Spider-Man," Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider at Columbia University, rushes to his dying Uncle Ben outside the New York Public Library at Bryant Park and rescues passengers on a Roosevelt Island tram tormented by the Green Goblin.
Insomniac, the creator of Spyro the Dragon and Ratchet & Clank, thrilled players five years ago by letting them swing their way through sights like Central Park and Times Square. The addition of Brooklyn and Queens in Marvel's Spider-Man 2 brought new design challenges that included learning the quirky geometry of brownstones and rowhouses.
Designers also wanted to vary the urban landscape, ensuring that important sites from the comics, like Aunt May's house and Brooklyn Visions Academy, were clearly represented. Another difficulty was identifying where to end the playable area in boroughs that stretch into Long Island.
"The good news was that Spider-Man became successful," said Bryan Intihar, who returns as the game's senior creative director. "But with success comes greater expectations."
In the sequel, players will control two Spider-Men as they navigate new responsibilities and powers, including the ability to jet through the skies with "web wings." Parker and Miles Morales, who is from Brooklyn, will twist into knots over a symbiote suit that warps Parker into a villain from the comics, the alien parasite called Venom.
The drama unfolds across a landscape of construction cranes, water towers, bridges and tunnels -- infrastructure that Insomniac designers studied for months.
"Everything is very intentionally placed," Benavidez said, noting that there must be plenty of objects to show off the physics of Spider-Man's web-slinging abilities.
One design solution was to plant more trees than you would find in the real New York City. Some changes provide sly commentary, with additional greenery and shade in the virtual Times Square and a plethora of newspaper kiosks bordering refuges like Union Square Park. Other choices skew closer to reality: Trash cans and heaps of garbage fill the city's sidewalks.
"When there is combat, people like breaking things," reasoned Jacinda Chew, the game's senior art director.
Designing a believable New York takes time, and Benavidez discussed the lengthy process at the 2019 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. "We wanted the world to feel like a real place, like the actual city," he told an audience, referring to the original game.
A digital sketch of that version of New York City included generic skyscrapers with gray facades and black windows dotting the horizon. Developers then used their visual research -- culled from online images and field photographs -- to define the scale of the city and breathe life into its avenues.
Once designers had enough information, they began creating versions of the high-rises and brownstones that characterize a city block. Many of those designs were then fed into a procedural generation software called Houdini, which helps eliminate tedious tasks like placing individual street lamps.
Marvel's Spider-Man 2 was built specifically for the more powerful PlayStation 5, which allowed Chew's team to design buildings with greater depth. Spider-Man may see more than his reflection when he scales a skyscraper, with some windows that peer into office cubicles and living rooms.
Depicting a famous city, however, takes more than meticulous renderings. Although the Chrysler Building appears in the 2018 Spider-Man game, it is missing in a 2020 spinoff, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, because Insomniac could not reach a copyright agreement with the building's new owners. The studio says the skyscraper will also be absent in October's sequel.
Expectations are high for Spider-Man 2, which may be the biggest PlayStation exclusive of the year. Insomniac said last year that the original Spider-Man and the Miles Morales spinoff had sold a combined 33 million copies.
A spokeswoman for the studio declined to address the budget or size of the development team for Spider-Man 2, but making high-fidelity games of that size can require hundreds of millions of dollars. Documents from the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit against the Microsoft-Activision merger included an accidental disclosure of budget data from Sony, the publisher of the Spider-Man games, revealing that other popular titles like The Last of Us Part II and Horizon Forbidden West cost upward of $ 200 million each.
Market analysts say major studios have relied on established intellectual property to mitigate their risk. But characters with established followings in action movies and comic books do not necessarily have the same appeal in video games.
Over the summer, Axios examined recent entries in the genre, including Gotham Knights and Marvel's Avengers, that sold poorly and drew negative reviews. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, by the studio behind the successful Batman: Arkham games, has been repeatedly delayed and mired in staff departures.
"Spider-Man fans will at least give it a fair trial," said Andre James, global head of media and entertainment practice for the consulting firm Bain & Company. "But the world of possibilities that tech has enabled may need a lot of time and iteration to get right."
The team behind the Spider-Man sequel believes it has already found a winning formula, one that whisks players into the superhero's universe by adding a touch of realism and a sucker punch of New York attitude.
"What we have tried to focus on," Intihar, the game's creative director, said, "is respecting the DNA of the franchise without being afraid of mixing things up."

Full text: Stocks closed lower on Wall Street, giving the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index its second losing week in a row. The benchmark index lost 1.2 percent Friday.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 288 points and the Nasdaq composite index gave back 1.6 percent. The market had posted some gains this week following several healthy indicators on the economy ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting next week, where it's expected to hold interest rates steady.
Technology stocks were the biggest drag on the market. Microsoft fell 2.2 percent and chipmaker Nvidia fell 3.2 percent.
U.S. automaker stocks were proving to be resilient. Ford edged up 0.2 percent and General Motors rose 1 percent. Shares in Stellantis gained 1.9 percent in trading on the Milan Stock Exchange in Italy.
Bond yields gained ground. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences interest rates on mortgages and other loans, rose to 4.33 percent from 4.29 percent late Thursday. The yield on the 2-year Treasury held steady at 5.02 percent.
Investors spent much of the week reviewing mostly healthy updates on the U.S. economy. The reports came ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting, where the central bank is expected to continue holding interest rates steady.
"Things were fairly in line from a data perspective," said Matthew Stucky, senior portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. "Really, the market is laser-focused on what's going to impact Federal Reserve activity."
The central bank raised rates aggressively through 2022 and 2023 in an effort to tame inflation, but it maintained interest rate levels at its last meeting. Inflation has generally been easing back to the central bank's target of 2 percent.
"A lot of the optimism about the Fed pausing is priced into markets," Stucky said.
Consumer sentiment slipped a bit in September, according to a closely-watched survey from the University of Michigan. The latest reading, though, shows that overall sentiment remains strong. It also said consumers lowered their expectations for inflation in the year ahead to 3.1 percent, which is the lowest reading since March 2021.
Boosting market sentiment this week was a report Thursday that said U.S. shoppers spent more at retailers last month than economists expected. A separate report Thursday morning said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected.
A third report on Thursday said prices getting paid at the wholesale level rose more last month than economists expected. That could be a discouraging signal for households if the higher-than-expected inflation gets passed on to shoppers at the consumer level.
Inflation at the consumer level edged higher than expected in August, but high gasoline prices were the biggest driver. Oil prices have been climbing over the summer after Saudi Arabia decided to maintain production cuts. That raised concerns about gasoline prices rising and stoking inflation.
Investors are overwhelmingly betting that the Fed will hold interest rates steady when it closes a two-day meeting on Wednesday. They also expect the central bank could hold rates steady for the rest of the year. The Fed has said it remains willing to continue raising rates if it seems necessary to continue fighting inflation.

Biden Creates Role to Buoy Investment In Ukraine: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: The appointment of the former commerce secretary and Democratic Party fund-raiser reflects a growing focus on Ukraine's postwar economic survival.
President Biden on Thursday appointed a former commerce secretary, Penny Pritzker, to be special representative for Ukraine's economic recovery, a new position that signals the Biden administration's concern about the country's long-term economic survival even as its war with Russia grinds on.
In a statement, Mr. Biden said that Ms. Pritzker would "drive the United States' efforts to help rebuild the Ukrainian economy" by working with Ukraine's government along with U.S. allies, international financial institutions and the private sector.
Ms. Pritzker, 64, will encourage pro-investment strategies in Ukraine while also drumming up public and private investment from other nations. She plans to travel to the country in the coming weeks to begin assessing the state of its economy and to meet with political and business leaders.
Ms. Pritzker will work from the State Department, reporting to Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken.
The appointment comes as attention in the United States and Europe increasingly turns toward Ukraine's survival in economic as well as military terms. A report in March by the World Bank found that rebuilding the country's badly damaged infrastructure and gutted urban areas could cost more than $ 400 billion over a decade. Group of 7 member nations have just begun sketching out how that undertaking might work, especially with Russian forces occupying large portions of Ukraine.
Mr. Blinken added in a statement that Ms. Pritzker would be central to the effort to ensure "that Ukraine not only survives but thrives, standing on its own." He said the goal was to turn the country into "a prosperous, secure, European democracy."
Ms. Pritzker hails from a prominent Chicago family known for its business empire and longtime influence within the Democratic Party. Her brother, J.B. Pritzker, is the Democratic governor of Illinois. Their father, Donald, was a co-founder of the Hyatt hotel company.
Ms. Pritzker started several business ventures of her own, and as President Barack Obama's commerce secretary from 2013-17, she was known for her close relationships with business leaders across the United States. She is also on the board of Microsoft and a former chairwoman of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
She played an important role in Mr. Obama's rise through Illinois and national politics, using her contacts to help raise hundreds of millions of dollars for his campaigns. In a January 2020 endorsement of Mr. Biden's presidential candidacy, she noted that she had known Mr. Biden for more than 20 years.
In a statement, Ms. Pritzker said that as commerce secretary, she "worked with the Ukrainian government to advance progress on reforms, draw private sector interest, and coordinate with partner governments -- activities I will also pursue in this role."
She added that her interest in Ukraine came with a personal dimension: Ms. Pritzker's family fled persecution in a czarist Russian area of modern-day Ukraine in the late 1800s, and she feels a connection to the country.
As commerce secretary, she visited Kyiv several times, including for the announcement of a $ 1 billion U.S. loan guarantee for Ukraine's government. The year before, she visited the village where her ancestors lived.
At a news conference during a visit to Kyiv in 2014, she said that Ukraine needed to adopt "a tremendous number of reforms for the economy to be more open for foreign direct investment."
Experts say that Ukraine, which has a history of political corruption, has made significant reforms since then but must do much more to win the confidence of major investors and to achieve its goal of joining the European Union.
Ms. Pritzker was among hundreds of Americans, many with Washington ties, whom the Kremlin put on a sanctioned list in May, barring them from entering Russia. The Kremlin did not provide a specific reason.

Inflation Data Sends Market in Different Directions: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street churned to a mixed finish on Wednesday after a highly anticipated report showed inflation accelerated across the country last month, but not by much more than expected.
The S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent after flipping between small gains and losses a few times through the day. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.2 percent, and the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3 percent.
The modest moves followed a shaky immediate reaction to the inflation report across financial markets, where bond yields and stock prices swung back and forth several times. The report said consumers paid prices last month that were 3.7 percent higher than a year earlier, up from July's inflation rate of 3.2 percent.
Much of the acceleration was because of higher fuel costs, which can swing very sharply and quickly. Ignoring those, underlying inflation trends still look to be pointing toward continued moderation, economists said. Inflation has been generally cooling since peaking above 9 percent last year.
The inflation report was highly anticipated because it will help steer what the Federal Reserve does next on interest rates. The Fed has already raised its main rate to the highest level in more than two decades, which hurts prices for stocks and other investments, and the hope on Wall Street is that inflation has cooled enough for it to be done.
Wednesday's data likely keeps the Fed on track to keep rates steady at its meeting next week, said Gargi Chaudhuri, head of iShares Investment Strategy, Americas.
But she also said expectations among traders on Wall Street for cuts to interest rates next year may be too aggressive. Such cuts can act like steroids for stocks and other investments, but inflation is still above the Fed's target of 2 percent.
"If anything, higher headline inflation is proof that the Fed will need to keep rates higher for longer and that heavy rate cuts next year are mispriced," Ms. Chaudhuri said.
Even though economists are willing to ignore fuel costs when looking at inflation to find the underlying trends, households and companies don't get the same luxury.
Stocks of airlines were some of the biggest losers in the S&P 500 after a couple warned of the hit to profits they are taking because of higher costs.
American Airlines cut its forecast for profits during the summer because fuel costs are running higher than it expected. It also had to pay about $ 230 million in retroactive pay to pilots after they ratified a new labor contract. Its stock fell 5.7 percent.
Spirit Airlines said it was also paying higher fuel costs this summer than expected, roughly $ 3.06 per gallon instead of the $ 2.80 it had earlier forecast. It said it had also experienced steep discounting to fares during the last few weeks. That pushed it to cut its revenue forecast during the third quarter, and its stock fell 6.3 percent.
Other airlines also sank, including declines of 3.8 percent for United Airlines and 2.8 percent for Delta Air Lines.
On the winning end of Wall Street were high-growth stocks that could be big beneficiaries if the Fed is indeed done raising interest rates. High rates hurt all kinds of investments, but they often have an outsize impact on technology companies and others promising big growth far out in the future.
Amazon climbed 2.6 percent and was one of the strongest forces pushing upward on the S&P 500. Microsoft gained 1.3 percent, and Nvidia rose 1.4 percent.
Moderna rallied 3.2 percent after it reported encouraging results from a trial of a flu vaccine.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.26 percent from 4.27 percent late Tuesday. It had swung as high as 4.34 percent immediately after the inflation report.
The two-year Treasury yield slipped to 4.99 percent from 5.02 percent late Tuesday.

California Legislation Would Require Large Companies to Report Emissions: [National Desk]

Author: Davenport, Coral

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Under the measure, companies would have to publicly report their climate pollution. Gov. Gavin Newsom's office would not say whether he plans to sign the bill.
The California Legislature this week passed a landmark bill that would require major companies to publicly disclose their greenhouse gas emissions, a move with national and global repercussions in governments' efforts to fight climate change.
A spokesman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, declined on Wednesday to say whether he would sign the bill.
If enacted, about 5,000 companies that do business in California would be compelled to report the amount of greenhouse gas pollution that is directly emitted by their operations, and also indirect emissions from things like employee travel, waste disposal and supply chains.
The law would apply to public and private businesses that make more than $ 1 billion annually and operate in California. But because it is the world's fifth-largest economy, California often sets the trend for the nation.
Many of the affected businesses would include oil and gas giants like Chevron, major financial institutions like Wells Fargo and global brands like Apple. The companies would be required to disclose all their emissions starting in 2027.
The California legislation goes beyond a measure proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would require only publicly-traded companies to disclose their emissions. That proposal, which has yet to be finalized, is facing strong opposition from conservatives and business groups.
Opponents of the California measure said compliance would be expensive and onerous, particularly the requirement that businesses accurately track and measure all emissions. For example, clothing manufacturers worry that they would have to report the emissions associated with growing, weaving and transporting textiles, in addition to reporting the direct emissions from their garment manufacturing plants.
The legislation "is a costly mandate that will negatively impact businesses of all sizes in California and will not directly reduce emissions," said Denise Davis, an executive vice president at the California Chamber of Commerce.
But supporters of disclosure said transparency would nudge corporations to reduce the pollution that is dangerously heating the planet and act as a bulwark against greenwashing, false or exaggerated claims by companies about their efforts to fight climate change. Microsoft, Ikea, Patagonia and several other major companies backed the bill.
"We need the full picture to make the deep emissions cuts that scientists tell us are necessary to avert the worst impacts of climate change," said the lead sponsor of the law, State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco. "These disclosures are simple but transformational," he said. "We need strong transparency to create a level playing field among private and public companies. Once again, California is leading the nation on essential climate action."
Governor Newsom, who has built a national profile in part on his push to make California a global leader in climate policy, has been uncharacteristically quiet about the measure.
While the governor has championed aggressive new climate measures, including $ 54 billion in climate spending, his administration's finance department issued an analysis in July that opposed the emissions reporting legislation. The analysis said the measure would require 12 full-time workers to administer the program and result in costs that were not included in the state's current spending plan.
California has a long history of enacting climate change policies that are later adopted by other states and eventually the federal government. Both the Obama administration and the Biden administration have modeled their regulations to accelerate the use of electric vehicles on policies first enacted in California.
Mr. Newsom has until Oct. 14 to veto the bill or it automatically becomes state law.

Who's Texting You Now? Work, at All Hours.: [Style Desk]

Full text: Work has already invaded our homes, evenings and weekends. Now it's coming for the fun part of your phone.
Jake Dunlap texts his wife. He texts his pickleball group chat. And in the past five years, he has started texting his co-workers.
Mr. Dunlap, 43, the chief executive of a consulting company in Austin, Texas, has asked colleagues not to overdo it on the work texts. Yes, they get his attention quickly, and yes, they're an effective way to reach him after hours. But he is concerned that each buzz erodes the digital boundary between work and everything else. "Text is kind of the final frontier of personal space," he said.
Brace your thumbs for the era of the work text: The blue bubble has put on its best business-casual and joined email and Slack in the sprawling digital workplace.
Its arrival has been polarizing. Fans of the work text consider it productive, even collegial; to detractors, it's outright invasive. The medium is loved and feared for its immediacy, and the way that it invites co-workers into something like the inner sanctum of our digital lives.
Until fairly recently, text was the most intimate of our inboxes, home to friends and family and the occasional "U up?" ("Sext" didn't become well-worn slang for nothing.) That inbox has been breached by a surge of advertisers, spam, messages from political campaigns and -- least sexy of all -- six-digit verification codes.
Work may be among its most determined invaders. More than 40 percent of workers use text messaging on their personal phones to communicate for work purposes, according to the economic research organization WFH Research, which surveyed more than 6,000 Americans in May.
Nick Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford who worked on the study, said that the pandemic may be to thank. As many employees worked from home, companies relied on layers of digital communication software to keep them in touch: Zoom on top of email on top of Microsoft Teams on top of Slack. The result was a series of noisy digital inboxes all competing for workers' attention.
Texting, which we use to maintain our closest social bonds, was a reliable way to cut through. Ninety-seven percent of text messages are opened within 15 minutes, according to a report from Insider Intelligence, a research firm. "I may interrupt a meeting if I have a text, because my kids text," Dr. Bloom said. "I would never interrupt a meeting for an email."
Getting personal
Texting has grown in importance since the first SMS, or short messaging service, greeting was sent by a 22-year-old engineer in 1992. In 2010 it overtook the phone call as the preferred method of communication between teenagers and their friends.
Those teenagers have aged into a professional generation more reliant on texting. Ashlyn Shadden was a high schooler in the early 2000s when she got her first cellphone, a pink Nokia that she mostly used to text her boyfriend. Ms. Shadden, 34, who now runs a clothing boutique in St. Jo, Texas, said she had noticed that a lot of other people around her age prefer to do business over text.
Ms. Shadden was once texting a vendor about restocking some clothing items when she got a picture of the vendor's dog, with an explanation that the dog would soon be put down.
"I've never met her, and she's never met me," she said. "When you are texting with someone just businesswise, it still has the possibility of that getting a little more personal."
Matt Wheatley, 32, who lives in Manhattan and works at a legal-tech company, is a fan of the work text because it allows him to build a quicker, looser rapport with his business contacts. His texts to them are peppered with "hahaha," "lol" and emojis. "The little fire emoji is pretty work-safe," he said.
'So awkward omg'
Work texts can easily veer into uncomfortable or invasive territory.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, more clients have asked Lauren Young Durbin, a career coach in Richmond, Va., how to keep their co-workers from texting them too much. Workers give out their personal phone numbers in an effort to seem friendly and accessible, she said, then come to regret it once they realize the nozzle cannot be turned off.
Gabrielle Blackwell, 32, who works in sales for a software company in Austin, tries to keep business conversations confined to work-specific channels like Slack and email.
Ms. Blackwell had first been flattered when a boss at a previous job had wanted to communicate with her via text. She soon discovered her supervisor had "no boundaries" and would text her for input incessantly, with questions beyond her job description. "Once they had my number, they felt like they could reach out to me any time," she said. "That was a very unhealthy situation."
Others text in an effort to avoid monitoring by employers, which often use productivity-monitoring software to keep tabs on what their workers are saying. Although companies cannot access text messages as easily as emails or Slack messages, Ms. Young Durbin reminds clients that text messages can be made public -- with major career consequences.
She pointed to Tucker Carlson, who parted ways with Fox News not long after some of his private texts were released in a legal filing. Elizabeth Holmes, Anthony Weiner and Tom Brady are among those whose text messages have been made public, with legal or reputational repercussions.
All the workers interviewed for this article offered their own suggestions for preventing work from overwhelming their text inboxes, and by extension, their lives. Mr. Dunlap tries to respond only to time-sensitive text messages from co-workers. Ms. Young Durbin tells clients to establish "texting hours" when they give out their phone numbers. Ms. Shadden has thought about getting a second phone to be used just for work.
Dr. Bloom emphasized that just because you can reply to a work text at any time of the day or night does not mean that you should. "Imagine you've had two or three glasses of wine," he said. If you flub a response to your boss while inebriated, he said, "you're in trouble."
Those suggestions might help some workers fortify their inboxes. They also might be Band-Aids for the larger issue of work's overreach into our personal lives, said Anne Helen Petersen, the writer of the newsletter Culture Study and an author of "Out of Office: The Big Problem and Bigger Promise of Working From Home."
Email and Slack once dangled the possibility of seamless connection before workers, only to end up tethering them more closely to ever-present digital desks, she said. By giving us the illusion that we can work and relax simultaneously on a trip to the gym or a midafternoon walk, text, too, might be further entangling our work and personal lives. "The fact that there is no mode of communication that is immune from work is a testament to the fact that work is so central in American life," she said.
Even Ms. Petersen, who has spent much of her career examining the swelling of the workplace, has not been spared. This summer she read aloud a text she had just gotten from a producer of her podcast, explaining a small mix-up: "I feel so awkward omg."

Macy's Names C.E.O.
For Bloomingdale's
Macy's named Olivier Bron, right, the next chief executive of Bloomingdale's, the company's luxury chain, on Tuesday, the latest move in a leadership shuffle this year.
Mr. Bron was previously chief executive of Central Group's Central and Robinson Department Stores in Thailand. He will start in November, succeeding Tony Spring. Macy's announced this year that Mr. Spring would be elevated to chief executive of Macy's in February after the planned retirement of Jeff Gennette, who has led the company since 2017.
Macy's has ambitions to become more competitive in e-commerce as younger shoppers pull away from department stores. Mr. Gennette previously said Bloomingdale's had worked as a "scrappy incubator" for ideas that made their way to Macy's.
Macy's, the largest department store chain in the United States, has been feeling pressure as consumers increasingly tighten their purse strings amid stubborn inflation. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Macy's said sales had dropped 8 percent from a year earlier. Bloomingdale's, which targets higher-earning shoppers, was less affected but still reported a 2.6 percent decline in sales.
Macy's also reported a "faster than expected" rise in credit card delinquencies.
"Over the last several quarters, we have seen the Macy's customer more aggressively pull back on spend in our discretionary categories," Mr. Gennette told analysts in an Aug. 22 earnings call. "They are not converting as easily and becoming more intentional on the allocation of their disposable income with an ongoing shift to services and experiences." J. EDWARD MORENO
TECHNOLOGY
Eight More Companies
Pledge to Make A.I. Safe
The White House said on Tuesday that eight more companies involved in artificial intelligence had pledged to voluntarily follow standards for safety, security and trust with the fast-evolving technology.
The companies include Adobe, IBM, Palantir, Nvidia and Salesforce. They joined Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection AI, Microsoft and OpenAI, which initiated an industry-led effort on safeguards in an announcement with the White House in July. The companies have committed to testing and other security measures, which are not regulations and are not enforced by the government.
Grappling with A.I. has become paramount since OpenAI released the powerful ChatGPT chatbot last year. The technology has since been under scrutiny for affecting people's jobs, spreading misinformation and potentially developing its own intelligence.
On Wednesday, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Sundar Pichai of Google will be among a dozen tech executives meeting with lawmakers in a closed-door A.I. summit hosted by Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York.
"The president has been clear: Harness the benefits of A.I., manage the risks and move fast -- very fast," the White House chief of staff, Jeff Zients, said in a statement. "And we are doing just that by partnering with the private sector and pulling every lever we have to get this done."
The companies agreed to include testing future products for security risks and using watermarks to make sure consumers can spot A.I.-generated material. They also agreed to share information about security risks across the industry and report any potential biases in their systems. CECILIA KANG

Wall St. Sinks Ahead of Government Data on the Economy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A slide for technology stocks weighed on Wall Street Tuesday as the market prepped for a highly anticipated report on inflation due the next day.
The S&P 500 lost 0.6 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite dropped 1 percent.
The software giant Oracle helped lead the losses for tech stocks after reporting revenue for the latest quarter that fell just short of what analysts expected. Its stock tumbled 13.5 percent, even though its profit topped expectations. Oracle's forecast for how much revenue it will make in the current quarter also wasn't as strong as some analysts expected.
Apple dropped 1.8 percent after it unveiled the latest models of its phones and other devices. The stock had soared through much of this year, which is crucial for many investors because it has more sway than other stocks on the S&P 500 as Wall Street's most valuable company. But it's been struggling since the end of July and has reported three straight quarters where its revenue fell from year-earlier levels.
Alphabet fell 1.2 percent as an antitrust trial against Google opened in a federal courthouse. It's the biggest such trial since regulators took Microsoft to court in 1998. The U.S. government is accusing Google of abusing its position as the world's dominant search engine and forcing consumers to settle for inferior search results.
On the winning side of Wall Street, stocks of oil producers rallied as the price of crude climbed. Exxon Mobil rose 2.9 percent and was the strongest single force limiting the S&P 500's loss. Occidental Petroleum gained 4.1 percent. Oil prices have been climbing since the end of June after mostly falling for a year.
Stocks broadly have been seesawing in recent weeks amid uncertainty about whether the Federal Reserve is done with its avalanche of hikes to interest rates. The central bank has already pulled its main interest rate to the highest level in more than two decades, as it tries to get inflation back down to its 2 percent target.
High rates work to undercut inflation by slowing the entire economy and knocking down prices for stocks and other investments.
Several reports coming up this week could sway the Fed's thinking. On Wednesday will come the latest monthly update on prices that consumers are paying across the country.
Economists expect it to show that prices were broadly 3.6 percent higher last month than a year earlier. Inflation has been mostly cooling since peaking above 9 percent last summer, but economists warn the last bit of improvement may be the most difficult to win.
On Thursday will come reports about inflation at the wholesale level and about sales at U.S. retailers. Strong spending by households has been a main driver keeping the economy humming, but it could also be encouraging companies to keep trying to raise their prices further.
Several strong reports on the economy recently have allayed worries about a painful recession, defying long-held predictions. But they also may be adding more fuel to pressures keeping inflation high, which could push the Fed to keep rates higher for longer.
Hopes for a resilient economy mean professional fund managers are globally feeling less pessimistic about stocks. The percentage of their investments in stocks is at a 17-month high, according to a survey by Bank of America, though managers are not going all-in and continue to keep a significant chunk of their portfolios in the safety of cash.
Sixty percent of fund managers say they think the Fed is done raising rates, investment strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a BofA Global Research report. That's a sharp turnaround from July, when just 9 percent were saying that.
Traders overwhelmingly expect next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve to end with interest rates staying where they are. But stronger-than-expected reports this week could sway things for later this year, where traders see a higher risk of another increase in rates.
Traders have also been paring expectations for rate cuts next year.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.27 percent from 4.29 percent late Friday. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 5.03 percent from 4.99 percent.

Saudi Arabia Is Pouring Money Into Sports. Could It Be Setting Its Sights on Tennis Next?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Despite the popularity of tennis, its business has struggled.
The U.S. Open has been as gripping as ever this year, with the 19-year-old breakout star Coco Gauff set to face off against Aryna Sabalenka in today's singles final and Novak Djokovic seeking a 24th Grand Slam win tomorrow. But as a business, tennis has been struggling for years -- and faces new pressure to find a sustainable model as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, known as P.I.F., has made major investments in sports, sloshing money around in golf, soccer and mixed martial arts.
Some deal makers wonder whether tennis, which has already confirmed initial talks with Saudi Arabia, will be the fund's next target.
Players are ready for a change. "Of all the important sports around the world, I think tennis is clearly the one with the greatest opportunity for financial growth and the most unrealized value," Maria Sharapova, the retired tennis star, told DealBook.
Despite the popularity of tennis, the sport brings in only 1.3 percent of earnings from global media sports rights. That's partly because tennis is made up of myriad entities -- including the Women's Tennis Association; the U.S. Tennis Association; and independent tournaments. The independently operated organizations make scheduling tournaments difficult and diminish bargaining power for sponsorship and media deals. Erratic scheduling and long matches don't help entice broadcasters.
Financial missteps are reflected in pay for players, most of whom earn little while having to pay for coaches, training sessions and travel expenses to play in the game.
That's why Ms. Sharapova thinks the sport should explore bringing in outside capital, whether it be a private equity firm or sovereign wealth fund. It's also why many believe tennis could be vulnerable to a rival sports league if P.I.F. were to repeat the playbook it used in golf, where its LIV golf tour eventually struck a deal to partner with the PGA Tour to help settle acrimonious litigation.
Could a merger solve the problem? The private equity firm CVC Capital Partners bought a stake in the women's professional tennis this year, in hopes of capitalizing on the sport's commercial promise. There has been speculation that CVC could merge the women's and men's tours. But such a deal is complex, requiring sign offs from multiple parties that don't all share the same views.
Other private equity investors are circling with similar aims, DealBook has heard. But it's not clear any investor or fund could compete with the deep pockets of P.I.F., which has so far shown little interest in returns.
Not everyone in tennis opposes Saudi money. Most standouts argue that accepting investment from P.I.F. could help the country reframe its tarnished reputation. But others say that tennis should be more concerned with its bottom line: The women's professional tennis tour's decision to suspend all tournaments in China after the disappearance of the tennis player Peng Shuai, for instance, dented the WTA's business -- and ultimately failed to pressure China into granting a meeting with Ms. Shuai.
Some players say that Saudi money could help with pay equity, a longstanding problem in the sport. Outside the four grand slam events last year, men earned about 70 percent more on average than women did during tournaments. Though the women's tour struck a deal for pay equity this year, the new structure won't be in place for another decade. If Saudi Arabia "could help getting us to equal prize money, though there are negatives, there's a lot of positives that can come out of it," Jessica Pegula, the third-ranked player, told Reuters in July.
But there is little consensus. As rumors swirled this week that the WTA would hold its finals in Saudi Arabia, the former tennis star Chris Evert pushed back. "I would be against it," Evert said, "but I don't have a vote."
Those who did have a vote apparently sided with Evert: The WTA announced on Thursday it will hold the event in Cancún, Mexico. -- Lauren Hirsch
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Google settles antitrust charges over its app store. The tech giant said that it had reached a tentative deal with a group of states to resolve accusations that it had monopolized distribution of apps on its Android operating system. But the company still faces a big fight with the Justice Department over search, with the trial set to begin next week.
China fears taking a bite out of Apple. The tech company lost about $ 200 billion of market capitalization over two days as its shares dipped on reports of a potential iPhone crackdown in China. But the stock rebounded on Friday.
Fashion and fame continue to converge. François-Henri Pinault, the French billionaire and chief executive of the luxury goods company Kering, said on Thursday his family office had bought a majority stake in one of Hollywood's biggest talent agencies, Creative Artists Agency.
The I.R.S. turns to A.I. The agency announced that it had begun using artificial intelligence to investigate tax evasion at hedge funds, private equity groups, real estate investors and large law firms.
The business of gaming Spotify
This week, Universal Music Group -- home of artists including Taylor Swift and Drake -- struck a new licensing deal with the French streaming service Deezer. They promised it would be an "artist-centric model" that would benefit professional musicians.
In other words, less money would be paid to the kind of content that music label and streaming executives have increasingly criticized, including white-noise tracks and songs made by artificial intelligence. Lucian Grainge, chief executive of Universal Music Group, called it a "sea of noise" -- but it was still by some measures a nearly billion-dollar industry.
The amount of content on music streaming platforms is exploding. Last year, 34.1 million new audio and music video tracks were uploaded, according to the research firm Luminate. That's more than double what was uploaded in 2018. (This year may be even higher: 20.2 million tracks were uploaded in the first six months of 2023.)
But just over 3 percent of the tracks uploaded this year came from major-label artists. That has left many in the music industry worrying about what they call spam. Spotify has sought to crack down on producers of such content on multiple fronts, including both audio tracks and, more recently, podcasts. But platforms have also sought to crack down on A.I.-produced content, amid allegations that bot activity is artificially boosting their listening numbers.
"These things are growing at a terrifying rate," Rob Jonas, the C.E.O. of Luminate, told DealBook.
How much money is at stake? Though big labels produce just a fraction of the content on these platforms, they collect most of streaming's cash: About 95 percent of Spotify's royalty checks last year went to roughly 200,000 professional or aspiring professional acts, analysts at Goldman Sachs calculated this summer. But the remaining 5 percent left for so-called long tail content still amounted to about $ 900 million.
Executives say that's still too much. "It should be obvious to everyone that the sound of rain or a washing machine is not as valuable as a song from your favorite artist streamed in HiFi," Jeronimo Folgueira, chief executive of Deezer, said this week.
Critics of the current system, in place for about a decade, say that it incentivizes the creation of spam, forces streaming platforms to manage increasingly unwieldy content caches and leaves less money to be paid to actual artists.
The Universal-Deezer deal is meant to change that. It will pay twice as much in royalties for tracks by professional artists, defined as those with a minimum of 1,000 streams a month from a minimum of 500 unique listeners. Those tracks would get a further boost if they were actively searched for by users.
The effect is likely to be limited for now -- Deezer had 9.4 million subscribers as of Dec. 31, compared with Spotify's 220 million -- though Universal has said it's in talks with other platforms.
The counterpoint: Mark Mulligan, an analyst at the research firm Midia, questioned whether worries about the "sea of noise" are overblown, noting that the streaming business had grown to nearly $ 18 billion last year.
To him, the push to devalue these tracks is a form of snobbery and gate-keeping by music labels, meant to make it harder for new forms of content to emerge. (It's also worth noting that streaming platforms are working on creating essentially their own royalty-free, long-tail content.)
Mr. Mulligan warned that if streaming companies make it harder to find, say, white-noise tracks, consumers could instead turn to alternative platforms like YouTube and TikTok. "If you want to find underground artists or weird sleep noises, you'll turn to other options to meet that need," he told DealBook.
An A.I. pioneer calls for a rethink
Mustafa Suleyman is one of the world's leading artificial intelligence entrepreneurs, and is a co-founder of not one but two start-ups at the cutting edge of the most transformative technology since the internet.
Mr. Suleyman is the chief executive of Inflection AI, a chatbot company he started last year with the LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, which was reportedly valued at $ 4 billion in its funding round that closed in June, raising $ 1.3 billion. And Suleyman is also a co-founder of DeepMind, an A.I. pioneer that was acquired by Google in 2014.
This week, Mr. Suleyman, now a partner at the venture capital firm Greylock Partners, released "The Coming Wave: AI, Power and the 21st Century's Greatest Dilemma." He spoke with DealBook about the book, which calls for an urgent shift in how we think about and "contain" A.I. The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.
Why do you describe the book as a "love letter" to the nation-state?
We have invented a system of noncommercial checks and balances, which holds centralized power accountable in the public interest. That system has evolved over many years away from monarchy, dictatorship and authoritarianism toward free and open liberal democracy. It means that we can do sensible taxation and redistribution to prevent inequality. This is the best tool we have so we should stick with it and keep trying to defend it.
How have your peers responded to your ideas?
There are lots of different clusters in Silicon Valley. People like Satya Nadella, the C.E.O. of Microsoft, are very forward-thinking about these things and definitely lean into the responsibility that the companies have to do the right thing.
But there are definitely skeptics. Marc Andreessen, the venture capital investor, just thinks that there's not going to be much of a downside. It's all going to be fine and dandy. I'm as much of an accelerationist as Andreessen but I'm just more wide-eyed and comfortable talking about the potential harms, and I think that is a more intellectually honest position.
How do you see the state of relations between democratic governments and Silicon Valley?
Tech companies are meaningfully engaging, and governments are starting to get proactive. This hasn't always happened, so we are already going in the right direction. Truth is this is only just the beginning -- a lot more hard work is needed -- but the foundations are starting to come into view.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.

Full text: A googol, the number for which Google is named, is a 1 followed by 100 zeros. At $ 1.7 trillion, the company's valuation is far from that large, but it's closer than the market cap of almost every other tech competitor.
The biggest U.S. antitrust case in 25 years, set to begin this week, strikes at the heart of the empire that Alphabet, Google's parent company, built over decades.
Alphabet hit a $ 1 trillion market cap in January 2020, a milestone that only Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have also reached. At the time, Alphabet was facing several different legal and regulatory challenges -- but this latest court battle is its most significant yet.
Google will go head to head with the Justice Department and a group of states, which argue that the tech giant illegally abused its agreements with phone makers and browsers to become the default search engine, quashing its rivals.
Those monopolistic practices are how Google got so big, the government says, as the company became synonymous with looking up information on the web. Google has cornered 90 percent of the search engine market in the United States and 91 percent globally, according to one data analysis firm.
At the helm of Google's legal strategy is Kent Walker, a top lawyer at the company for almost 20 years. He says he will argue that Google's partnerships with companies like Apple and Samsung are lawful and that consumers should have easy access to the services they like most.
But if Google loses the case, the company could be forced to pay damages and limit its search distribution deals, leading to fewer users and a drop in its robust profits. And not only could a ruling against Google sap it of its power and influence, the case could also have a ripple effect on other large internet companies that have enjoyed decades of almost unfettered growth.
"It's definitely a lifestyle associated with him and his personality and his music that he created."
Barbara Kahn, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, who said Jimmy Buffett's carefree tropical brand could last beyond his death.
"We will seek to negotiate terms with our landlords that allow WeWork to maintain our unmatched quality of service and global network, in a financially sustainable manner."
David Tolley, who took over as chief executive at the co-working company WeWork, which still has hundreds of locations despite its implosion in 2019.
"Higher oil prices will only increase the likelihood of more fiscal tightening, especially in the U.S., to curtail inflation."

A Buyer's Market as Indexes Slump: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/buyers-market-as-indexes-slump/docview/2861065087/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Major stock indexes on Wall Street closed lower Tuesday, giving back some of their recent gains as traders returned from a long holiday weekend.
The S&P 500 fell 0.4 percent, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1 percent. Both indexes were coming off their second weekly gain. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.6 percent.
The selling was widespread, with decliners outnumbering advancers by more than 3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Losses in industrial, health care and financial stocks were the biggest drag on the benchmark S&P 500. Cintas fell 1.7 percent, Merck & Co. dropped 2.1 percent and JPMorgan Chase closed 1.1 percent lower.
Technology stocks were the biggest bright spot. Microsoft rose 1.5 percent.
Energy stocks rose along with crude oil prices after Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would extend their voluntary production cut of 1 million barrels of oil a day through the end of the year. Crude oil prices rose 1.3 percent and Chevron rose 1.3 percent.
Smaller company stocks also lost ground, sending the Russell 2000 index 2.1 percent lower.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences interest rates on mortgages and other loans, rose to 4.26 percent from 4.18 percent late Friday. The yield on the 2-year Treasury, which tracks expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.96 percent from 4.88 percent.
Coming off the Labor Day holiday, investors have few economic reports to look forward to this week, while the latest round of corporate earnings is essentially finished.
"There's not much going on other than investors doing the mental arithmetic over whether the Federal Reserve will or will not continue to hike interest rates," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
The Institute for Supply Management will release its latest report on the services sector on Wednesday. The services sector employs most Americans and is a big component of the economy. Its health could provide more insight into how inflation is affecting consumer spending.
Wall Street will also get updates on aspects of the manufacturing sector and consumer credit. DocuSign, GameStop, Dave & Buster's and Kroger are set to report their most recent quarterly financial results this week.
Last week, investors were busy reviewing a heavy load of economic data as they tried to get a better picture of the economy. Much of the information fueled hopes that the Fed might moderate interest rate increases to fight inflation, which has been easing for months.
Wall Street expects the Fed to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at its next meeting later in September, just as it did at its previous meeting. Investors are mostly betting that the central bank will maintain that pause through the rest of the year.
The central bank has raised its main interest rate aggressively since 2022, to the highest level since 2001. The goal has been to rein inflation back to the Fed's target of 2 percent. Several measures of inflation have gotten closer to that target and the economy is still growing. That has alleviated concerns about the aggressive rate hikes pushing the economy into a recession.
Analysts are still concerned about the potential for a recession, but those concerns have lessened as inflation cools and the economy remains resilient.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 18.94 points to 4,496.83 Tuesday. The Dow dropped 195.74 points to 34,641.97, and the Nasdaq slipped 10.86 points to 14,020.95. The Russell 2000 slid 40.38 points to 1,880.45.
Markets in Europe and Asia closed mixed. Hong Kong's benchmark fell 2.1 percent, as investors sold real estate shares which have gained recently following government efforts to support the ailing industry.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In London, a politician wrote not-so-subtle notes to remote workers last year, hoping to persuade them to spend more time in the office: "Sorry you were out when I visited," Jacob Rees-Mogg, then a government minister, recalled writing in messages left on the desks of Cabinet Office staff members who were working from home.
In Seoul, Jem Kim, who started a new job at a private equity firm, hoped to ask for permission to work some days from home, but she quickly learned that she would need to be in the office full time.
And in San Mateo, Calif., executives at Sequoia, a human resources technology company, said that although they had not mandated a return to office for most employees, they had tried to make the office environment so close-knit that people couldn't help but feel "major FOMO" (fear of missing out) when they joined meetings by videoconference.
When the coronavirus pandemic began in 2020, many industries around the world shifted to remote or hybrid work. It was an experiment that yielded different results for different cities -- with long-term standoffs between executives and workers in some cases, and a sweeping return to the office in others.
Levels of remote work have varied across regions based on factors like housing density, length of Covid lockdowns and cultural norms about how much workers can fight for workplace autonomy, according to interviews with nearly two dozen workers and executives, as well as a study that included researchers at Stanford, Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México and the Ifo Institute, who surveyed more than 42,000 workers in 34 countries.
Whether a person is more likely to work at a cubicle in a big office tower or on a couch in their living room depends on where in the world those cubicles and couches are. Many Asian countries have lower levels of remote work than countries in Europe and North America. Those with the highest levels are Britain, Canada and the United States.
In the United States and Britain, workers across industries spent five to six paid days a month this spring working from home, according to the study. Other European countries had slightly lower levels of remote work, with Germans at four days per month. Asia's work-from-home levels were the lowest, with South Koreans working less than two days per month remotely, Japan two and Taiwan under three.
The researchers think housing plays a role in return-to-office patterns. In suburban parts of the United States, where people have larger homes and sometimes home offices, workers have been slower to go back to the office. In densely populated cities, particularly in Asia, return-to-office rates have tended to be higher, often because people struggled to be productive in small apartments shared with many family members.
Commute vs. Productivity
"It's really hard to work from home if you live with a partner and have a one-bedroom apartment," said Jose Maria Barrero, an economist at the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México, or ITAM, who helped lead the global study. "Tokyo, for example, is a place where apartments are quite modest."
Executives managing work forces that sprawl across continents have noticed the regional variability firsthand. Jeetu Patel, an executive vice president and general manager at the technology company Cisco, which has nearly 85,000 employees, traveled to Asia recently and found that his company's offices there, as well as those of its customers, were more bustling than offices in other countries. Cisco has let its teams across the globe determine their own approach to hybrid work.
Mr. Patel, who lives in Los Altos, Calif., said he preferred to work from home when he did not have in-office meetings so he could spare himself an hour traveling to San Jose and back.
"I can take that 30 minutes going back and forth commuting and I can have more things I get done," he said. "I like having dinner with my daughter."
Daan van Rossum, chief executive of FlexOS, a company in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, that creates digital solutions for remote managers, thought extensively about employees' home setups when considering his company's approach to hybrid work.
"A lot of people here don't have their own places," he said. "Working from home at the kitchen table with three generations running around is not the best environment to be productive."
This year, Mr. van Rossum asked his employees to begin working in the office at least two days a week. He tried to make the experience enjoyable by carving out time for levity. Every meeting starts with a nonwork-related icebreaker, like a game of telephone.
Beyond housing differences, researchers said, remote work levels are affected by the amount of time a region spent in Covid lockdowns. In areas of the world that lurched in and out of lockdowns repeatedly, like some American cities, workers and employers became more settled in remote work routines. People invested in comfortable setups at home, buying computer monitors and ergonomic chairs. Companies set up management systems that ensured bosses would measure performance by employee output, not by the amount of time people spent at the office.
Where Remote Never Took Hold
That kind of long-term investment in hybrid work came in handy in 2021 and 2022, as many companies delayed return-to-office plans because of infectious coronavirus variants.
"People realized, 'Hey, you know what, I can be just as productive and effective working remotely as I can being in the same location as the rest of my co-workers,"' said Dawn Klinghoffer, head of people analytics at Microsoft, which has required employees to return to the office 50 percent of the time, with more flexibility for those who need it.
In parts of Asia, remote work routines did not become as entrenched. "There were many countries in Asia that controlled early waves of Covid pretty well without extended lockdowns," Mr. Barrero of ITAM said. "They didn't have this experience where they had to hunker down for months on end working from home and get adapted to it."
In South Korea, for example, many workers never left their offices. "We've never implemented work from home," said Joori Roh, a spokeswoman for SK Hynix, a major chip maker, adding that the company did not like the idea of giving some workers a privilege that was not available to all.
In Japan, workers still routinely use fax machines, and sometimes a personal stamp known as a hanko, which requires someone to be in the office. Some corporate managers in Tokyo said being together in the same space helped them keep an eye on the people who reported to them.
"Sometimes, I get very worried about whether they are actually working," said Ryuichi Takezawa, who manages some 30 employees at Astellas Pharma in Tokyo. In the office, he said, he can ask his team questions: "How are you feeling? What are you stressed about? What can I support you with?"
Do Employees Have a Say?
The researchers of the remote-work study said cultural norms are also a factor in return-to-work levels. Plenty of American workers said they felt comfortable asking their managers for more flexibility, or even telling them that they would quit without it.
When Laura Zimm, a public defender in Duluth, Minn., was called back to the office last year, she immediately came down with Covid. She worked from home during and after her sickness, and eventually decided with her manager that she would stay permanently remote, which Ms. Zimm preferred and which gave her manager more flexibility with office space.
At Microsoft, the return-to-office process has often included "team agreements," in which managers meet with employees to discuss hybrid work preferences.
In parts of Europe, unions and other worker associations have helped shape return-to-office policies. At many German firms, for example, employee-elected councils negotiated with managers on the details of hybrid work.
"We needed to find a solution that would work for all of our employees, whether in software development, finance or on the shop floor," said Julia Bangerth, head of human resources at Datev, a software company in Nuremberg that allows every team to set its own return-to-office expectations.
And the choices that individual employers make are not isolated. In areas of the world where remote or hybrid work has become a norm, employers with strict return-to-office policies worry about retaining talent, said Mark Ein, chairman of the workplace security firm Kastle, which has tracked American office occupancy levels with its "Back to Work Barometer."
"Business leaders as a group have wanted people to come back in much more profound ways," Mr. Ein said. "It really is the labor market's competitive pressures and some cultural norms that have prevented it."
"The desire to get people back among business managers is nearly universal," he added. "It's the ability to do it that varies across countries."

Six years ago, Sonya Schneider and her husband, Stuart Nagae, bought a federally designated historical landmark in Seattle, a 5,000-square-foot, two-story home sheathed in dark, old-growth Western cedar shingles, with multiple gables, dormer windows and a cedar-shake roof. It sat on an unusually large three-quarter-acre lot with mature maples, Douglas fir and a hemlock tree, in Ballard, an old Seattle neighborhood on Puget Sound.
The house, for which the couple paid $ 2.5 million, according to public records, was built in 1933 by a Norwegian ship captain, Ole E. Nilsen, reportedly as a replica of his childhood home in Bergen, Norway.
In the early 20th century, Ballard's shipbuilding, timber and fishing industries attracted thousands of immigrants from Scandinavia, and today the community retains its strong ethnic identity, with an annual Norwegian heritage parade and a new National Nordic Museum.
The house is a unique example of Scandinavian vernacular architecture, inside and out. It was built by highly skilled craftsmen who meticulously paneled the walls and ceilings with Douglas fir. (The boards are placed parallel for the wainscoting and vertically above it.) The living room has a double-height vaulted ceiling with a balcony loft characteristic of 19th-century Norwegian houses; its railing has carved balusters and its support beam is decorated with colorful scrolls, acanthus leaves and floral motifs, a style of traditional rural Norwegian folk painting called rosemaling, or rose painting.
When she first saw the house, Ms. Schneider, 45, a playwright originally from San Diego, recalled that she immediately recognized its value. "I grew up in a house built in 1933 with similar qualities," she said. "I was raised to understand quality of space and fine craftsmanship." (Mr. Nagae, 46, is a Japanese American venture capitalist from Seattle.)
Over the past few years, with a family that includes two daughters, 14 and 11, the couple integrated into the interior their growing collection of contemporary art (by the photographer Nan Goldin, the Indigenous Oregon artist Marie Watt and the Seattle native Roger Shimomura, among others) and an eclectic mix of midcentury and contemporary furniture.
The result is a fresh mix of time-transcendent design elements. "We have the two worlds talking to each other," Ms. Schneider said. "The old house is happy to be covered in contemporary art. We introduced light and color to the dark rooms."
There was only one problem: The galley kitchen was too small. "I think Captain Nilsen had a servant who cooked," Ms. Schneider said. "There is a tiny bedroom in the basement."
The couple decided the house deserved a bigger kitchen, though they didn't pursue any architects until they met one in Rome, six years ago, at a Pearl Jam concert of all places.
Mike Mora, the co-founder of Heliotrope Architects in Seattle, and his wife, Jessica, had come to attend the concert and see their longtime friends Jeff Ament, a member of the Seattle band, and his wife, Pandora Andre-Beatty.
"That night, Pandora introduced me to Sonya and Stuart, and we learned we lived a half-mile away from each other in Seattle," Mr. Mora recalled. "I was really familiar with the house as I pass it every day on my way to work."
Ms. Schneider invited Mr. Mora over and shared her dreams.
She wanted a new, light-filled kitchen where her family and friends could gather, which afforded movement between the interior and garden spaces.
She was completely open minded: "When we began talking, I said, 'Let's go for the wildest scheme and then scale it back; we are drawn to modern architecture."'
Mr. Mora was thrilled. "We were happy we didn't need to design a replica of a 100-year-old building; we could be influenced by it but make an addition very much of its own time, with contemporary lines and more expansive glass."
Heliotrope Architects, founded in 1999, has several high-profile institutional clients, including REI, Amazon, Microsoft and Nordstrom. In 2020, it won the James Beard award for outstanding restaurant design. Its residential work, however, tends to be minimalist, sustainable and with a quality, they say, that "weathers."
Mr. Mora's plan for the kitchen followed those principles; it is deceptively simple-looking, quiet and elegant.
The 500-square-foot addition is a contemporary post-and-beam construction.
"It's one story, because we didn't need any more program," Mr. Mora said. It complements the house but stands on its own.
The two structures are joined by a glass passageway that accentuates the distinct character of each. Mr. Mora chose black brick walls to nod to the dark gray shingles of the house. His plans easily won approval from the local landmarks board. As Ms. Schneider said, "They wanted us to do something that reflected the current period."
The kitchen interior is equally refined: Like the house, it is fully paneled, but in a fresh, contemporary way. The cabinetry is stained white oak; the beams and columns are stained Douglas fir. The ceiling is clear cedar. The floor is polished concrete.
In the cooking area, a long counter with a farm sink sits beneath a glass wall. Behind it is a large, quartzite-topped island, which incorporates the stove and another counter, with bar seating, for eating -- and admiring the cook.
The space is all about clean surfaces; there is no clutter. The cabinetry has no external hardware.
To one side, glass doors open to the west (and a terrace with a view of Puget Sound).
On the wall opposite, built-in cabinetry leads to a kitchen table and four chairs made by the Brooklyn-based designer Bowen Liu and a showstopping Lindsey Adelman blown-glass chandelier. Its glass wall affords a view of the new garden to the south by David Berleth Landscape Architect.
The outdoor terrace to the south, which is shaded by an overhang, has a built-in wood-burning barbecue for grilling, a favorite pastime of Mr. Nagae, but the main action outside is the backyard to the west, with a loggia for private outdoor dining.
The Norwegians have an expression: "Wood is our living archive." As early as A.D. 800, the Vikings displayed their excellent craftsmanship and knowledge of wood construction techniques in their longships.
Heliotrope Architects honors such craft traditions, which may explain the kitchen's deep resonance to Ms. Schneider.
"The kitchen really feels like a collaboration; it really did come out as I hoped," she said. "I now feel connected to this place through this project: It's an homage to the old house and a nod to my husband's Japanese, very minimalist sensibility."

In Monitoring Child Sex Abuse, Apple Is Caught Between Safety and Privacy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: An advocacy group is starting a $ 2 million campaign calling for the company to better police materials on its products and services.
In 2021, Apple was embroiled in controversy over a plan to scan iPhones for child sexual abuse materials. Privacy experts warned that governments could abuse the system, and the backlash was so severe that Apple eventually abandoned the plan.
Two years later, Apple is facing criticism from child safety crusaders and activist investors who are calling on the company to do more to protect children from online abuse.
A child advocacy group, the Heat Initiative, has raised $ 2 million for a new national advertising campaign calling on Apple to detect, report and remove child sexual abuse materials from iCloud, its cloud storage platform.
Next week, the group will release digital advertisements on websites popular with policymakers in Washington, such as Politico. It will also put up posters across San Francisco and New York that say: "Child sexual abuse material is stored on iCloud. Apple allows it."
The criticism speaks to a predicament that has dogged Apple for years. The company has made protecting privacy a central part of its iPhone pitch to consumers. But that promise of security has helped make its services and devices, two billion of which are in use, useful tools for sharing child sexual abuse imagery.
The company is caught between child safety groups, which want it to do more to stop the spread of such materials, and privacy experts, who want it to maintain the promise of secure devices.
A group of two dozen investors with nearly $ 1 trillion in assets under management have also called on Apple to publicly report the number of abusive images that it catches across its devices and services.
Two investors -- Degroof Petercam, a Belgian asset manager, and Christian Brothers Investment Services, a Catholic investment firm -- will submit a shareholder proposal this month that would require Apple to provide a detailed report on how effective its safety tools were at protecting children.
"Apple seems stuck between privacy and action," said Matthew Welch, an investment specialist at Degroof Petercam. "We thought a proposal would wake up management and get them to take this more seriously."
Apple has been quick to respond to child safety advocates. In early August, its privacy executives met with the group of investors, Mr. Welch said. Then, on Thursday, the company responded to an email from the Heat Initiative with a letter that defended its decision not to scan iCloud. It shared the correspondence with Wired, a technology publication.
In Apple's letter, Erik Neuenschwander, the director for user privacy and child safety, said the company had concluded that "it was not practically possible" to scan iCloud photos without "imperiling the security and privacy of our users."
"Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems," Mr. Neuenschwander said.
Apple, he added, has created a new default feature for all child accounts that intervenes with a warning if they receive or try to send nude images. It's designed to prevent the creation of new child sexual abuse material and limit the risk of predators coercing and blackmailing children for money or nude images. It has made those tools available to app developers as well.
In 2021, Apple said it would use technology called image hashes to spot abusive material on iPhones and in iCloud.
But the company failed to communicate that plan broadly with privacy experts, intensifying their skepticism and fueling concern that governments could abuse the technology, said Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory at the Cyber Policy Center, who opposed the idea.
Last year, the company discreetly abandoned its plan to scan iCloud, catching child safety groups by surprise.
Apple has won praise from both privacy and child safety groups for its efforts to blunt the creation of new nude images on iMessage and other services. But Mr. Stamos, who applauded the company's decision not to scan iPhones, said it could do more to stop people from sharing problematic images in the cloud.
"You can have privacy if you store something for yourself, but if you share something with someone else, you don't get the same privacy," Mr. Stamos said.
Governments around the world are putting pressure on Apple to take action. Last year, eSafety Commissioner in Australia issued a report criticizing Apple and Microsoft for failing to do more to proactively police their services for abusive material.
In the United States, Apple made 160 reports in 2021 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a federally designated clearinghouse for abusive material. Google made 875,783 reports, while Facebook made 22 million. These reports do not always reflect truly abusive material; some parents have had their Google accounts suspended and have been reported to the police for images of their children that were not criminal in nature.
The Heat Initiative timed its campaign ahead of Apple's annual iPhone unveiling, which is scheduled for Sept. 12. The campaign is being led by Sarah Gardner, who was previously the vice president for external affairs at Thorn, a nonprofit founded by Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore to combat child sexual abuse online. Ms. Gardner raised money from a number of child safety supporters, including the Children's Investment Fund Foundation and the Oak Foundation.
The group has built a website that documents law enforcement cases where iCloud has been named. The list will include child pornography charges brought against a 55-year-old in New York who had more than 200 images stored in iCloud.
Ms. Gardner said the Heat Initiative planned to target advertising throughout the fall in areas where Apple customers and employees would encounter it. "The goal is to continue to run the tactics until Apple changes its policy," Ms. Gardner said.

A.I. Copies Your Voice, Then Calls Up Your Bank: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: This spring, Clive Kabatznik, an investor in Florida, called his local Bank of America representative to discuss a big money transfer he was planning to make. Then he called again.
Except the second phone call wasn't from Mr. Kabatznik. Rather, a software program had artificially generated his voice and tried to trick the banker into moving the money elsewhere.
Mr. Kabatznik and his banker were the targets of a cutting-edge scam attempt that has grabbed the attention of cybersecurity experts: the use of artificial intelligence to generate voice deepfakes, or vocal renditions that mimic real people's voices.
The problem is still new enough that there is no comprehensive accounting of how often it happens. But one expert whose company, Pindrop, monitors the audio traffic for many of the largest U.S. banks said he had seen a jump in its prevalence this year -- and in the sophistication of scammers' voice fraud attempts. Another large voice authentication vendor, Nuance, saw its first successful deepfake attack on a financial services client late last year.
In Mr. Kabatznik's case, the fraud was detectable. But the speed of technological development, the falling costs of generative artificial intelligence programs and the wide availability of recordings of people's voices on the internet have created the perfect conditions for voice-related A.I. scams.
Customer data like bank account details that have been stolen by hackers -- and are widely available on underground markets -- help scammers pull off these attacks. They become even easier with wealthy clients, whose public appearances, including speeches, are often widely available on the internet. Finding audio samples for everyday customers can also be as easy as conducting an online search -- say, on social media apps like TikTok and Instagram -- for the name of someone whose bank account information the scammers already have.
"There's a lot of audio content out there," said Vijay Balasubramaniyan, the chief executive and a founder of Pindrop, which reviews automatic voice-verification systems for eight of the 10 largest U.S. lenders.
Over the past decade, Pindrop has reviewed recordings of more than five billion calls coming into call centers run by the financial companies it serves. The centers handle products like bank accounts, credit cards and other services offered by big retail banks. All of the call centers receive calls from fraudsters, typically ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 a year. It's common for 20 calls to come in from fraudsters each week, Mr. Balasubramaniyan said.
So far, fake voices created by computer programs account for only "a handful" of these calls, he said -- and they've begun to happen only within the past year.
Most of the fake voice attacks that Pindrop has seen have come into credit card service call centers, where human representatives deal with customers needing help with their cards.
Mr. Balasubramaniyan played a reporter an anonymized recording of one such call that took place in March. Although a very rudimentary example -- the voice in this case sounds robotic, more like an e-reader than a person -- the call illustrates how scams could occur as A.I. makes it easier to imitate human voices.
A banker can be heard greeting the customer. Then the voice, similar to an automated one, says, "My card was declined."
"May I ask whom I have the pleasure of speaking with?" the banker replies.
"My card was declined," the voice says again.
The banker asks for the customer's name again. A silence ensues, during which the faint sound of keystrokes can be heard. According to Mr. Balasubramaniyan, the number of keystrokes correspond to the number of letters in the customer's name. The fraudster is typing words into a program that then reads them.
In this instance, the caller's synthetic speech led the employee to transfer the call to a different department and flag it as potentially fraudulent, Mr. Balasubramaniyan said.
Calls like the one he shared, which use type-to-text technology, are some of the easiest attacks to defend against: Call centers can use screening software to pick up technical clues that speech is machine-generated.
"Synthetic speech leaves artifacts behind, and a lot of anti-spoofing algorithms key off those artifacts," said Peter Soufleris, the chief executive of IngenID, a voice biometrics technology vendor.
But, as with many security measures, it's an arms race between attackers and defenders -- and one that has recently evolved. A scammer can now simply speak into a microphone or type in a prompt and have that speech very quickly translated into the target's voice.
Mr. Balasubramaniyan noted that one generative A.I. system, Microsoft's VALL-E, could create a voice deepfake that said whatever a user wished using just three seconds of sampled audio.
On "60 Minutes" in May, Rachel Tobac, a security consultant, used software to so convincingly clone the voice of Sharyn Alfonsi, one of the program's correspondents, that she fooled a "60 Minutes" employee into giving her Ms. Alfonsi's passport number.
The attack took only five minutes to put together, said Ms. Tobac, the chief executive of SocialProof Security. The tool she used became available for purchase in January.
While scary deepfake demos are a staple of security conferences, real-life attacks are still extremely rare, said Brett Beranek, the general manager of security and biometrics at Nuance, a voice technology vendor that Microsoft acquired in 2021. The only successful breach of a Nuance customer, in October, took the attacker more than a dozen attempts to pull off.
Mr. Beranek's biggest concern is not attacks on call centers or automated systems, like the voice biometrics systems that many banks have deployed. He worries about the scams where a caller reaches an individual directly.
"I had a conversation just earlier this week with one of our customers," he said. "They were saying, hey, Brett, it's great that we have our contact center secured -- but what if somebody just calls our C.E.O. directly on their cellphone and pretends to be somebody else?"
That's what happened in Mr. Kabatznik's case. According to the banker's description, he appeared to be trying to get her to transfer money to a new location, but the voice was repetitive, talking over her and using garbled phrases. The banker hung up.
"It was like I was talking to her, but it made no sense," Mr. Kabatznik said she had told him. (A Bank of America spokesman declined to make the banker available for an interview.)
After two more calls like that came through in quick succession, the banker reported the matter to Bank of America's security team, Mr. Kabatznik said. Concerned about the security of Mr. Kabatznik's account, she stopped responding to his calls and emails -- even the ones that were coming from the real Mr. Kabatznik. It took about 10 days for the two of them to re-establish a connection, when Mr. Kabatznik arranged to visit her at her office.
"We regularly train our team to identify and recognize scams and help our clients avoid them," said William Halldin, a Bank of America spokesman. He said he could not comment on specific customers or their experiences.
Though the attacks are getting more sophisticated, they stem from a basic cybersecurity threat that has been around for decades: a data breach that reveals the personal information of bank customers. From 2020 to 2022, bits of personal data on more than 300 million people fell into the hands of hackers, leading to $ 8.8 billion in losses, according to the Federal Trade Commission.
Once they've harvested a batch of numbers, hackers sift through the information and match it to real people. Those who steal the information are almost never the same people who end up with it. Instead, the thieves put it up for sale. Specialists can use any one of a handful of easily accessible programs to spoof target customers' phone numbers -- which is what likely happened in Mr. Kabatznik's case.
Recordings of his voice are easy to find. On the internet there are videos of him speaking at a conference and participating in a fund-raiser.
"I think it's pretty scary," Mr. Kabatznik said. "The problem is, I don't know what you do about it. Do you just go underground and disappear?"

In Kabatznik’s case, the fraud was detectable. But the speed of technological development, the falling costs of generative artificial intelligence programs and the wide availability of recordings of people’s voices on the internet have created the perfect conditions for voice-related AI scams.
Customer data such as bank account details that have been stolen by hackers — and are widely available on underground markets — help scammers pull off these attacks. They become even easier with wealthy clients, whose public appearances, including speeches, are often widely available on the internet. Finding audio samples for everyday customers can also be as easy as conducting an online search — say, on social media apps such as TikTok and Instagram — for the name of someone whose bank account information the scammers already have.
“There’s a lot of audio content out there,” said Vijay Balasubramaniyan, the CEO and a founder of Pindrop, which reviews automatic voice-verification systems for eight of the 10 largest U.S. lenders.
Over the past decade, Pindrop has reviewed recordings of more than 5 billion calls coming into call centers run by the financial companies it serves. The centers handle products such as bank accounts, credit cards and other services offered by big retail banks. All of the call centers receive calls from fraudsters, typically ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 a year. It’s common for 20 calls to come in from fraudsters each week, Balasubramaniyan said.
So far, fake voices created by computer programs account for only “a handful” of these calls, he said — and they’ve begun to happen only within the past year.
Most of the fake voice attacks that Pindrop has seen have come into credit card service call centers, where human representatives deal with customers needing help with their cards.
Balasubramaniyan played a reporter an anonymized recording of one such call that took place in March. Although a very rudimentary example — the voice in this case sounds robotic, more like an e-reader than a person — the call illustrates how scams could occur as AI makes it easier to imitate human voices.
A banker can be heard greeting the customer. Then the voice, similar to an automated one, says, “My card was declined.”
“May I ask whom I have the pleasure of speaking with?” the banker replies.
“My card was declined,” the voice says again.
The banker asks for the customer’s name again. A silence ensues, during which the faint sound of keystrokes can be heard. According to Balasubramaniyan, the number of keystrokes correspond to the number of letters in the customer’s name. The fraudster is typing words into a program that then reads them.
In this instance, the caller’s synthetic speech led the employee to transfer the call to a different department and flag it as potentially fraudulent, Balasubramaniyan said.
Calls like the one he shared, which use type-to-text technology, are some of the easiest attacks to defend against: Call centers can use screening software to pick up technical clues that speech is machine-generated.
“Synthetic speech leaves artifacts behind, and a lot of anti-spoofing algorithms key off those artifacts,” said Peter Soufleris, CEO of IngenID, a voice biometrics technology vendor.
But, as with many security measures, it’s an arms race between attackers and defenders — and one that has recently evolved. A scammer can now simply speak into a microphone or type in a prompt and have that speech very quickly translated into the target’s voice.
Balasubramaniyan noted that one generative AI system, Microsoft’s VALL-E, could create a voice deepfake that said whatever a user wished using just three seconds of sampled audio.
On “60 Minutes” in May, Rachel Tobac, a security consultant, used software to so convincingly clone the voice of Sharyn Alfonsi, one of the program’s correspondents, that she fooled a “60 Minutes” employee into giving her Alfonsi’s passport number.
The attack took only five minutes to put together, said Tobac, CEO of SocialProof Security. The tool she used became available for purchase in January.
While scary deepfake demos are a staple of security conferences, real-life attacks are still extremely rare, said Brett Beranek, general manager of security and biometrics at Nuance, a voice technology vendor that Microsoft acquired in 2021. The only successful breach of a Nuance customer, in October, took the attacker more than a dozen attempts to pull off.
Beranek’s biggest concern is not attacks on call centers or automated systems, like the voice biometrics systems that many banks have deployed. He worries about the scams in which a caller reaches an individual directly.
“I had a conversation just earlier this week with one of our customers,” he said. “They were saying, hey, Brett, it’s great that we have our contact center secured — but what if somebody just calls our CEO directly on their cellphone and pretends to be somebody else?”
That’s what happened in Kabatznik’s case. According to the banker’s description, he appeared to be trying to get her to transfer money to a new location, but the voice was repetitive, talking over her and using garbled phrases. The banker hung up.
“It was like I was talking to her, but it made no sense,” Kabatznik said she had told him. (A Bank of America spokesperson declined to make the banker available for an interview.)
After two more calls like that came through in quick succession, the banker reported the matter to Bank of America’s security team, Kabatznik said. Concerned about the security of Kabatznik’s account, she stopped responding to his calls and emails — even the ones that were coming from the real Kabatznik. It took about 10 days for the two of them to reestablish a connection, when Kabatznik arranged to visit her at her office.
“We regularly train our team to identify and recognize scams and help our clients avoid them,” said William Halldin, a Bank of America spokesperson. He said he could not comment on specific customers or their experiences.
Although the attacks are getting more sophisticated, they stem from a basic cybersecurity threat that has been around for decades: a data breach that reveals the personal information of bank customers. From 2020 to 2022, bits of personal data on more than 300 million people fell into the hands of hackers, leading to $8.8 billion in losses, according to the Federal Trade Commission.
Once they’ve harvested a batch of numbers, hackers sift through the information and match it to real people. Those who steal the information are almost never the same people who end up with it. Instead, the thieves put it up for sale. Specialists can use any one of a handful of easily accessible programs to spoof target customers’ phone numbers — which is what likely happened in Kabatznik’s case.
Recordings of his voice are easy to find. On the internet there are videos of him speaking at a conference and participating in a fundraiser.
“I think it’s pretty scary,” Kabatznik said. “The problem is, I don’t know what you do about it. Do you just go underground and disappear?”

Full text: Here's how to get "screen apnea" in check.
In 2007, Linda Stone, a former Microsoft executive, realized that even though she did breathing exercises every morning, when she sat down at her laptop and opened up her inbox, it all went out the window. "I would be like, Huh, I was just breathing but I'm not breathing anymore," she said. Her inhales and exhales became barely detectable and shallow, she noticed.
Ms. Stone decided to conduct an informal study ("dining room table science," she called it), inviting 200 people into her home -- friends, neighbors, family members -- and monitoring their heart rate and breathing while they checked their email. Roughly 80 percent of participants periodically held their breath or altered their breathing, she said. She named the phenomenon "email apnea" and described her findings in a widely read 2008 piece in The Huffington Post.
Ms. Stone has since expanded the concept and renamed it "screen apnea," referring to the disruption of breathing many of us experience doing all kinds of tasks in front of a screen.
The issue has most likely worsened with our increased use of screens, said James Nestor, who examined the phenomenon in his 2020 book, "Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art."
"You have 10 different screens open. Someone's texting you, someone's calling you, someone's emailing you," he said, adding that we have not evolved to be "constantly stimulated."
Screen apnea is a manifestation of our body's stress response, said Stephen Porges, a professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who specializes in the autonomic nervous system. When we're faced with any kind of stimuli, our nervous system looks for signals to decipher whether or not it's a threat, Dr. Porges said.
That focus and attention requires mental effort, which kicks off a chain of physiological changes including shallower breathing and a slowing of heart rate to "quiet" your body and divert resources to help you focus, he said. He gave the example of cats stalking their prey; often right before they attack, they will freeze and their breathing will become shallow. That, he said, is essentially what is happening when you get an email, text or Slack message: You freeze, read and come up with a plan of action.
The more unexpected a stimulus is -- say, getting a text notification out of the blue -- the more likely the body is to perceive it as a threat.
While these reflexes aren't harmful on occasion, they become an issue if they're switched on all day, every day, because it shifts "the nervous system into a chronic state of threat," Dr. Porges said. Hours of shallow breathing can make you feel exhausted after a day of work, he said, even if that work isn't particularly stressful.
The lack of movement that comes from sitting in front a screen might also be a contributor to screen apnea, said Dr. David Spiegel, director of the Center on Stress and Health at Stanford Medicine. Disrupted breathing is the result of "a combination of not just what you're doing but what you're not doing," he said, adding that he noticed screen apnea among patients who worked high-stress jobs for long hours without getting much exercise or sleep.
There are a few simple practices you can adopt for better breathing habits, even in our increasingly screen-bound lives.
Set up breath reminders
A few gentle-sounding alerts throughout the day can remind you to check in on your breathing, Mr. Nestor said.
Ask yourself: Are you breathing through your mouth (often an indicator of shallow breath)? Are you breathing at all? The awareness helps you snap out of it, he said.
If you catch yourself breathing shallowly or not at all, try sighing audibly, Dr. Spiegel said. Studies suggest that can be a quick and easy way to reset breathing patterns. In a study published in January, Dr. Spiegel and his team found that while many breathing techniques are valuable, cyclic sighing -- in which the exhale lasts longer than the inhale -- is particularly effective for improving mood.
Try larger screens
Dr. Porges hypothesizes that the larger your screen, the less mentally taxing it can be. "As you narrow the visual field, you're increasing the demand on your nervous system to exclude everything outside of it," he said. Responding to messages on a desktop monitor often feels easier than responding on a phone, which "is a more intensely focused constriction of movement," Dr. Spiegel said.
Make your breaks count
People will often step away from their computers for a break only to end up responding to messages on their phones, Dr. Porges said. He suggested carving out a few moments to do things that don't require too much mental effort -- like listening to music -- so that your nervous system can switch from a state of focus and vigilance to one of relaxation.
Adding physical activity to your breaks -- like walking in nature -- is another way of restoring balance, Dr. Spiegel said. It's a simple thing, he said, "that can help our bodies work better."

Regulating A.I. Requires Congress to Act Nimbly: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Congress has tended to be slow to respond to revolutionary technologies.
As increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems with the potential to reshape society come online, many experts, lawmakers and even executives of top A.I. companies want the U.S. government to regulate the technology, and fast.
"We should move quickly," Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, which launched an A.I.-powered version of its search engine this year, said in May. "There's no time for waste or delay," Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, has said. "Let's get ahead of this," said Senator Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican.
Yet history suggests that comprehensive federal regulation of advanced A.I. systems probably won't happen soon. Congress and federal agencies have often taken decades to enact rules governing revolutionary technologies, from electricity to cars. "The general pattern is it takes a while," said Matthew Mittelsteadt, a technologist who studies A.I. at George Mason University's Mercatus Center.
In the 1800s, it took Congress more than half a century after the introduction of the first public, steam-powered train to give the government the power to set price rules for railroads, the first U.S. industry subject to federal regulation. In the 20th century, the bureaucracy slowly expanded to regulate radio, television and other technologies. And in the 21st century, lawmakers have struggled to safeguard digital data privacy.
It's possible that policymakers will defy history. Members of Congress have worked furiously in recent months to understand and imagine ways to regulate A.I., holding hearings and meeting privately with industry leaders and experts. Last month, President Biden announced voluntary safeguards agreed to by seven leading A.I. companies.
But A.I. also presents challenges that could make it even harder -- and slower -- to regulate than past technologies.
The hurdles
To regulate a new technology, Washington first has to try to understand it. "We need to get up to speed very quickly," Senator Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat who is part of a bipartisan working group on A.I., said in a statement.
That typically happens faster when new technologies resemble older ones. Congress created the Federal Communications Commission in 1934, when television was still a nascent industry, and the F.C.C. regulated it based on earlier rules for radio and telephones.
But A.I., some advocates for regulation argue, combines the potential for privacy invasion, misinformation, hiring discrimination, labor disruptions, copyright infringement, electoral manipulation and weaponization by unfriendly governments in ways that have little precedent. That's on top of some A.I. experts' fears that a superintelligent machine might one day end humanity.
While many want fast action, it's hard to regulate technology that's evolving as quickly as A.I. "I have no idea where we'll be in two years," said Dewey Murdick, who leads Georgetown University's center for security and emerging technology.
Regulation also means minimizing potential risks while harnessing potential benefits, which for A.I. can range from drafting emails to advancing medicine. That's a tricky balance to strike with a new technology. "Often the benefits are just unanticipated," said Susan Dudley, who directs George Washington University's regulatory studies center. "And, of course, risks also can be unanticipated."
Overregulation can quash innovation, Professor Dudley added, driving industries overseas. It can also become a means for larger companies with the resources to lobby Congress to squeeze out less established competitors.
Historically, regulation often happens gradually as a technology improves or an industry grows, as with cars and television. Sometimes it happens only after tragedy. When Congress passed, in 1906, the law that led to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration, it didn't require safety studies before companies marketed new drugs. In 1937, an untested and poisonous liquid version of sulfanilamide, meant to treat bacterial infections, killed more than 100 people across 15 states. Congress strengthened the F.D.A.'s regulatory powers the following year.
"Generally speaking, Congress is a more reactive institution," said Jonathan Lewallen, a University of Tampa political scientist. The counterexamples tend to involve technologies that the government effectively built itself, like nuclear power development, which Congress regulated in 1946, one year after the first atomic bombs were detonated.
"Before we seek to regulate, we have to understand why we are regulating," said Representative Jay Obernolte, a California Republican who has a master's degree in A.I. "Only when you understand that purpose can you craft a regulatory framework that achieves that purpose."
Brain drain
Even so, lawmakers say they're making strides. "I actually have been very impressed with my colleagues' efforts to educate themselves," Mr. Obernolte said. "Things are moving, by congressional standards, extremely quickly."
Regulation advocates broadly agree. "Congress is taking the issue really seriously," said Camille Carlton of the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit that regularly meets with lawmakers.
But in recent decades, Congress has changed in ways that could impede translating studiousness into legislation. For much of the 20th century, the leadership and staff of congressional committees dedicated to specific policy areas -- from agriculture to veterans' affairs -- served as a kind of institutional brain trust, shepherding legislation and often becoming policy experts in their own right. That started to change in 1995, when Republicans led by Newt Gingrich took control of the House and slashed government budgets. Committee staffs stagnated and some of the committees' power to shape policy devolved to party leaders.
"Congress doesn't have the kind of analytic tools that it used to," said Daniel Carpenter, a Harvard professor who studies regulation.
For now, A.I. policy remains notably bipartisan. "These regulatory issues we're grappling with are not partisan issues, by and large," said Mr. Obernolte, who helped draft a bipartisan bill that would give researchers tools to experiment with A.I. technologies.
But partisan infighting has already helped snarl regulation of social media, an effort that also began with bipartisan support. And even if lawmakers agreed on a comprehensive A.I. bill tomorrow, next year's elections and competing legislative priorities -- like funding the government and, perhaps, impeaching Mr. Biden -- could consume their time and attention.
A Department of Information?
If federal regulation of A.I. did emerge, what might it look like?
Some experts say a range of federal agencies already have regulatory powers that cover aspects of A.I. The Federal Trade Commission could use its existing antitrust powers to prevent larger A.I. companies from dominating smaller ones. The F.D.A. has already authorized hundreds of A.I.-enabled medical devices. And piecemeal, A.I.-specific regulations could trickle out from such agencies within a year or two, experts said.
Still, drawing up rules agency by agency has downsides. Mr. Mittelsteadt called it "the too-many-cooks-in-the-kitchen problem, where every regulator is trying to regulate the same thing." Similarly, state and local governments sometimes regulate technologies before the federal government, such as with cars and digital privacy. The result can be contradictions for companies and headaches for courts.
But some aspects of A.I. may not fall under any existing federal agency's jurisdiction -- so some advocates want Congress to create a new one. One possibility is an F.D.A.-like agency: Outside experts would test A.I. models under development, and companies would need federal approval before releasing them. Call it a "Department of Information," Mr. Murdick said.
But creating a new agency would take time -- perhaps a decade or more, experts guessed. And there's no guarantee it would work. Miserly funding could render it toothless. A.I. companies could claim its powers were unconstitutionally overbroad, or consumer advocates could deem them insufficient. The result could be a prolonged court fight or even a push to deregulate the industry.
Rather than a one-agency-fits-all approach, Mr. Obernolte envisions rules that accrete as Congress enacts successive laws in coming years. "It would be naïve to believe that Congress is going to be able to pass one bill -- the A.I. Act, or whatever you want to call it -- and have the problem be completely solved," he said.
Mr. Heinrich said in his statement, "This will need to be a continuous process as these technologies evolve." Last month, the House and Senate separately passed several provisions about how the Defense Department should approach A.I. technology. But it is not yet clear which provisions will become law, and none would regulate the industry itself.
Some experts aren't opposed to regulating A.I. one bill at a time. But they're anxious about any delays in passing them. "There is, I think, a greater hurdle the longer that we wait," Ms. Carlton said. "We're concerned that the momentum might fizzle."

A Bull or a Bear Market? We Really Shouldn't Care.: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: After a fierce rally largely propelled by a handful of tech stocks, the market's rapid climb stalled in August. That setback could ultimately be a good thing, our columnist says.
The stock market's monthslong rally stumbled this month. The thrill of seeing investment gains, with metronomic regularity, is gone.
I miss that feeling: scanning my investments and knowing in advance that the numbers will be larger than they were the last time I looked. But, in an important way, the market's summer setbacks have been long awaited, and they come as something of a relief.
Don't misunderstand. It's not that I want to see the rising stock market stop in its tracks. I'd prefer an endless move upward, making me, and everyone else, richer.
But that's a fantasy. In the real world, upward stock market thrusts are always temporary. When stocks rise too quickly, they inevitably fall and sometimes crash. The stock market is essentially volatile, and for every big winner, dozens of casualties occur.
That's why, as a second-best alternative, I hope for something more modest: a choppy market that experiences periodic downturns, but one that trends upward for very long periods.
The Stock Market's Movements
That is, in fact, a rough description of what the stock market has been like for the past 25 years, according to statistics provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. In that period, the S&P 500 has returned 552.31 percent, or 7.8 percent, annualized, but to garner those handsome returns, an investor would have had to sit tight through countless downturns.
While August has so far been a negative month for the stock market, there have been no major downturns this year. Through July, the S&P 500 rose for five consecutive months. Just seven big tech stocks -- Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Tesla and Alphabet (Google) -- accounted for more than two-thirds of the S&P 500's gains.
This year, through July, the S&P 500 rose 19.5 percent, for a total return, including dividends, of 20.7 percent. Those were splendid numbers, but the market had been rising so rapidly on such a narrow base that it seemed to me that it was setting itself up for a fall.
What's more, from a market bottom on Oct. 11, 2022, through July, the S&P 500 gained 27.9 percent, for a total return of 29.6 percent including dividends. In June, when the market had gained 20 percent from its October low, many commentators declared that the bear market that started on Jan. 3, 2022, was over, and that a new bull market had begun.
Mr. Silverblatt did not agree, because the market had not returned to its peak of Jan. 3, 2022, when the S&P 500 stood at 4,796.56, almost 9 percent above its current level. By his definition, it won't be clear that the S&P 500 is in a bull market until it climbs back to that level. Categorizing the market this way, as either bull or bear, is a straightforward retrospective judgment, not an assertion of the market's future direction, which no one can forecast accurately.
This cautious way of thinking about the market is one I favor.
I'm not sure what the rally that started in October will amount to, but based on history, the summer swoon could be a good thing.
The stock market's problems in August stem, at least partly, from shifts in the fixed-income markets: a sharp rise in short-term interest rates underway since the start of 2022, and a surge in long-term rates since June.
The Lure of Fixed Income
Thanks to the rise in short-term rates, it's possible to get a great return on cash. Money market funds provide yields well above 5 percent.
Bond yields have risen this summer, and they are now high enough to make bonds, with their safer profiles, an attractive alternative to stocks. And many factors driving up yields are negative for stocks, too.
Briefly put, short-term rates -- those embodied in money-market funds as well as credit cards -- are a direct consequence of the Federal Reserve's campaign to reduce inflation. The Fed has been tightening monetary policy, mainly by raising the short-term rates it controls, the best known being the federal funds rate.
On Friday, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said that until there is conclusive evidence that inflation has been tamed, the central bank will maintain these rate levels or take them higher.
Longer-term interest rates -- those for bonds and mortgages -- have been rising, too. But these rates are complicated. They are set in the vast bond market.
By bidding down bond prices and raising yields (prices and yields move in opposite directions, as a matter of basic bond-market math), traders have indicated that they consider the economy to be stronger and inflation to be more persistent than had been expected a few months ago. The downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt by the Fitch Ratings agency also contributed to the run-up in rates on Treasury securities. And because Treasuries serve as benchmarks for virtually every other bond and, indeed, for every other investment in the global economy, higher rates have made stocks less appealing in comparison.
In addition, the balance of supply and demand in the bond market has been tilting in a way that is contributing to higher rates. The Treasury has been auctioning an unusually large amount of debt, bulking up its resources after the brinkmanship of the debt ceiling crisis this spring. That increase in the supply of Treasuries coincides with a reduction in demand from several important sources: The Federal Reserve is no longer purchasing bonds, while the appetite for Treasuries from Japan and China has begun to flag, too.
All these factors have contributed to the run-up in yields, and they are weighing on stocks.
Reading the Economy
Furthermore, one core issue assessed by bond buyers -- the prospects for economic growth or recession in the United States and elsewhere around the world -- has obsessed stock traders, too. But, at the moment, the U.S. economy is extraordinarily difficult to decipher.
Higher interest rates might have been expected to slow down the economy by now, or throw it into recession. A waning of economic growth in China might also be expected to be a drag on the U.S. economy.
But the U.S. economy and the job market, in particular, have been remarkably resilient, and consumer spending remains strong. As a consequence, corporate earnings in many sectors have exceeded Wall Street's muted expectations. If a recession were to develop, however, the outlook would be much worse.
All that said, there are many reasons for optimism. In July, the market rally broadened substantially, with the stocks of smaller companies outperforming the giants, and every domestic sector posting gains. It was just what a stock investor would want to see in a market with sustainable upward momentum.
Even the surge in interest rates could turn out to be innocuous. After all, it has returned rates to a level deemed healthy in previous economic cycles. Since January 1962, 10-year Treasury yields have averaged 4.2 percent -- not far from where they are now. The appropriate level for interest rates for the rest of this decade is being debated at the Fed and among a broad range of economists.
In short, uncertainty about inflation and the Fed's response to it are well-founded. The paths of the markets and the economy may meander inconclusively for a while, thwarting anyone who wants to place a decisive bet one way or another.
But it's a complicated world. Binary distinctions like bull market and bear market reduce complexity to simple notions that investors can grab onto. But I think these, in particular, are the wrong notions.
The bull and bear market labels imply future action.
In a bull market, stocks, for the most part, rise. In a bear market, more often than not, they fall. You might assume that you should avoid bear markets and welcome bull markets. But that's not a wise course for long-term investors, who are better off buying when prices are low and selling only at moments of their own choosing.
I'm bullish about the stock market for the long haul. But that's very different from believing that we are in a bull market or a bear right now. I just don't know and don't really care.
Instead, I'm investing for the long run, without trying to time market movements or pick individual stocks or bonds. I hold a piece of the world's entire stock and bond markets -- not just the S&P 500 -- through low-cost, broadly diversified index funds, and have been hanging in for decades.
Market rallies are fun, and it's a letdown when they take a breather. But an August pause could be just the thing the stock market needs. I worry about lots of things, but not that. Enjoy the rest of the summer.

Protecting Competition Is a Vital Goal: [Editorial]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Across the American economy, in industries ranging from air travel to veterinary medicine, big companies keep getting bigger and more powerful. Swallowing smaller rivals has become a widely accepted practice.
This concentration of corporate power, however, is neither inevitable nor desirable for the health of the American economy.
The Biden administration is embarking on a wide-ranging effort to check corporate power by promoting competition -- a stated goal of both parties -- and it needs Congress to support its effort with bipartisan legislation. It has proposed new rules, like a ban on noncompete agreements that prevent workers from changing jobs more freely. It is seeding competition, for example, by investing more than $ 1 billion to open and expand smaller meatpacking plants. And it has taken a tough line on mergers, blocking some big deals, dissuading companies from pursuing others and even suing to unwind Facebook's 2012 acquisition of Instagram.
Last month, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, which are charged with enforcing antitrust laws, proposed new merger guidelines that would formalize this turn toward stringency, ending decades of acquiescence to corporations by both Democratic and Republican administrations. The document explains what the administration regards as illegal, creating a basis for consistent enforcement, putting companies on notice and preparing judges for the cases that may come before them.
This reassertion of an active government role in protecting competition has the potential to deliver significant benefits. Competition keeps pressure on prices. It encourages the development of better and more diverse products and services. It holds open the gates of opportunity so workers can pursue other jobs or start their own businesses. It helps to ensure that prosperity and political power are broadly distributed.
"In my view, it's the most important economic policy thing that the Biden administration will do this year," said Tim Wu, a Columbia Law School professor who served until earlier this year as President Biden's adviser on technology and competition policy. Mr. Wu, who was not involved in creating the proposed guidelines, said the document reflected a determination to end a "green light" era in which American antitrust enforcers largely declined to enforce antitrust laws.
But the shift comes with real risks, too. Tighter enforcement could inhibit the growth of companies that have prospered through innovation or through the delivery of goods and services at lower costs. Bigger companies may be better equipped to compete in the global marketplace.
For several decades, beginning under President Ronald Reagan, both Democratic and Republican administrations embraced the idea that corporate concentration was often economically beneficial -- and that companies engaged in harmful behavior would be disciplined by market forces. The merger guidelines issued by the Reagan administration in 1982 set the tone: "Although they sometimes harm competition, mergers generally play an important role in a free enterprise economy," the guidelines said. Under subsequent administrations, the government refined an approach that gave corporations the benefit of the doubt. It wasn't enough to show a merger would reduce competition; the government generally sought to block deals only when it could show a merger would result in higher prices for consumers or that it would clearly cause some other quantifiable harm -- a standard that was rarely met.
Under this E-ZPass approach to antitrust enforcement, industries rapidly consolidated until the United States was left with four major airlines, three major cellphone companies and two dominant makers of coffins. A 2018 analysis concluded that concentration had increased in three-quarters of domestic industries, giving companies more power to raise prices, squeeze suppliers, suppress wages and influence policymakers.
Americans have been living as subjects in a large-scale experiment in letting big companies do as they please, and the consequences are increasingly apparent in daily life. Compare the United States with Europe, where authorities have more successfully resisted the consolidation of major industries. Airfares in the United States are now significantly more expensive; North American airlines pocketed more than twice as much in profits from each passenger in 2022 as their European counterparts did. The internet costs more, too: Americans pay more than twice as much for broadband, and the cost of cellular service is also, on average, more than twice as high in the United States as the average in other developed nations. The economist Thomas Philippon wrote in a 2019 book about the decline of competition in the United States that the American economy would be roughly $ 1 trillion larger than it is today if the United States had simply maintained the level of competition that prevailed in 2000.
The turn toward stringency reflects some of what has been learned in recent years about the effects of corporate concentration, for example, in a new emphasis on protecting workers. Economic circumstances also have changed. The rise of online business models in particular has created challenges not fully anticipated by earlier generations of policymakers, such as the ways that user data can be used to limit competition. In December, Amazon settled an antitrust complaint brought by European Union regulators by agreeing to stop using data gathered from third-party sellers on its site to calibrate its own retail business decisions.
The most important change, however, is a reconsideration of the role of economics in making policy. The guidelines treat the economic analysis of corporate concentration as a valuable source of information, rather than the measuring stick by which decisions are made. Antitrust authorities have failed in their responsibility to the American people by assigning to themselves the burden of trying to figure out which mergers may be harmful, rather than taking seriously their marching orders from Congress to prevent concentration.
Some harms are difficult to quantify. Some are difficult to anticipate. And sometimes the damage is cumulative. In separate interviews, Jonathan Kanter, the assistant attorney general who heads the Justice Department's antitrust division, and Lina Khan, the chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, argued that the changes should be seen as a restoration of the plain meaning of the nation's antitrust laws, which place limits on corporate concentration even when it isn't possible to show negative economic effects in advance. Mr. Kanter said his department is focused on protecting competition because that is the goal that Congress enshrined in law and he is in the law enforcement business. "We're going back to enforcing the law to its fullest extent," he said.
To achieve this goal, the administration will need to overcome the skepticism of federal judges, many of whom are steeped in the minimalist approach to antitrust enforcement. The regulatory agencies have lost several cases in which they sought to enforce antitrust laws more stringently, including decisions allowing the tech giant Meta to buy Within, a maker of virtual reality apps, and to let Microsoft proceed with its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which makes video games.
A key element of the Reagan administration's antitrust revolution was to put on the bench legal scholars who had played leading roles in developing what might be called the anti-antitrust movement. The Biden administration so far has not emulated that strategy. Through the guidelines, however, it is at least seeking to change minds. The document can be understood as an open letter to the judiciary, encrusted in footnotes and references, pressing the argument that a shift is not just good policy but also good law.
Congress can help. Prominent politicians in both parties regularly express concern about the effects of concentration and the power of corporations, but Congress has not passed a significant law addressing antitrust enforcement in more than 70 years. The proposed guidelines seek to apply those old laws to the modern economy, but it's an imperfect fit. The United States needs to update its antitrust laws to place stronger limits on corporate concentration and specifically to curb the power of tech companies. Bridging differences between the two political parties won't be easy, but enduring changes in antitrust policy have always required bipartisan support.

The U.S. Regulates Cars, Radio and TV. When Will It Regulate AI?

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
As increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence systems with the potential to reshape society come online, many experts, lawmakers and even executives of top AI companies want the U.S. government to regulate the technology, and fast.
“We should move quickly,” Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, which launched an AI-powered version of its search engine this year, said in May. “There’s no time for waste or delay,” Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, has said. “Let’s get ahead of this,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D.
Yet history suggests that comprehensive federal regulation of advanced AI systems probably won’t happen soon. Congress and federal agencies have often taken decades to enact rules governing revolutionary technologies, from electricity to cars. “The general pattern is, it takes a while,” said Matthew Mittelsteadt, a technologist who studies AI at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center.
In the 1800s, it took Congress more than half a century after the introduction of the first public, steam-powered train to give the government the power to set price rules for railroads, the first U.S. industry subject to federal regulation. In the 20th century, the bureaucracy slowly expanded to regulate radio, television and other technologies. And in the 21st century, lawmakers have struggled to safeguard digital data privacy.
It’s possible that policymakers will defy history. Members of Congress have worked furiously in recent months to understand and imagine ways to regulate AI, holding hearings and meeting privately with industry leaders and experts. Last month, President Joe Biden announced voluntary safeguards agreed to by seven leading AI companies.
But AI also presents challenges that could make it even harder — and slower — to regulate than past technologies.
The Hurdles
To regulate a new technology, Washington first has to try to understand it. “We need to get up to speed very quickly,” Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., who is part of a bipartisan working group on AI, said in a statement.
That typically happens faster when new technologies resemble older ones. Congress created the Federal Communications Commission in 1934, when television was still a nascent industry, and the FCC regulated it based on earlier rules for radio and telephones.
But AI, some advocates for regulation argue, combines the potential for privacy invasion, misinformation, hiring discrimination, labor disruptions, copyright infringement, electoral manipulation and weaponization by unfriendly governments in ways that have little precedent. That’s on top of some AI experts’ fears that a superintelligent machine might one day end humanity.
While many want fast action, it’s hard to regulate technology that’s evolving as quickly as AI. “I have no idea where we’ll be in two years,” said Dewey Murdick, who leads Georgetown University’s center for security and emerging technology.
Regulation also means minimizing potential risks while harnessing potential benefits, which for AI can range from drafting emails to advancing medicine. That’s a tricky balance to strike with a new technology. “Often, the benefits are just unanticipated,” said Susan Dudley, who directs George Washington University’s regulatory studies center. “And, of course, risks also can be unanticipated.”
Overregulation can quash innovation, Dudley added, driving industries overseas. It can also become a means for larger companies with the resources to lobby Congress to squeeze out less-established competitors.
Historically, regulation often happens gradually as a technology improves or an industry grows, as with cars and television. Sometimes it happens only after tragedy. When Congress passed, in 1906, the law that led to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration, it didn’t require safety studies before companies marketed new drugs. In 1937, an untested and poisonous liquid version of sulfanilamide, meant to treat bacterial infections, killed more than 100 people across 15 states. Congress strengthened the FDA’s regulatory powers the following year.
“Generally speaking, Congress is a more reactive institution,” said Jonathan Lewallen, a University of Tampa political scientist. The counterexamples tend to involve technologies that the government effectively built itself, like nuclear power development, which Congress regulated in 1946, one year after the first atomic bombs were detonated.
“Before we seek to regulate, we have to understand why we are regulating,” said Rep. Jay Obernolte, R-Calif., who has a master’s degree in AI. “Only when you understand that purpose can you craft a regulatory framework that achieves that purpose.”
Brain Drain
Even so, lawmakers say they’re making strides. “I actually have been very impressed with my colleagues’ efforts to educate themselves ,” Obernolte said. “Things are moving, by congressional standards, extremely quickly.”
Regulation advocates broadly agree. “Congress is taking the issue really seriously,” said Camille Carlton of the Center for Humane Technology, a nonprofit that regularly meets with lawmakers.
But in recent decades, Congress has changed in ways that could impede translating studiousness into legislation. For much of the 20th century, the leadership and staff of congressional committees dedicated to specific policy areas — from agriculture to veterans’ affairs — served as a kind of institutional brain trust, shepherding legislation and often becoming policy experts in their own right. That started to change in 1995, when Republicans led by Newt Gingrich took control of the House and slashed government budgets. Committee staffs stagnated, and some of the committees’ power to shape policy devolved to party leaders.
“Congress doesn’t have the kind of analytic tools that it used to,” said Daniel Carpenter, a Harvard professor who studies regulation.
For now, AI policy remains notably bipartisan. “These regulatory issues we’re grappling with are not partisan issues, by and large,” said Obernolte, who helped draft a bipartisan bill that would give researchers tools to experiment with AI technologies.
But partisan infighting has already helped snarl regulation of social media, an effort that also began with bipartisan support. And even if lawmakers agreed on a comprehensive AI bill tomorrow, next year’s elections and competing legislative priorities — like funding the government and, perhaps, impeaching Biden — could consume their time and attention.
A Department of Information?
If federal regulation of AI did emerge, what might it look like?
Some experts say a range of federal agencies already have regulatory powers that cover aspects of AI. The Federal Trade Commission could use its existing antitrust powers to prevent larger AI companies from dominating smaller ones. The FDA has already authorized hundreds of AI-enabled medical devices. And piecemeal, AI-specific regulations could trickle out from such agencies within a year or two, experts said.
Still, drawing up rules agency by agency has downsides. Mittelsteadt called it “the too-many-cooks-in-the-kitchen problem, where every regulator is trying to regulate the same thing.” Similarly, state and local governments sometimes regulate technologies before the federal government, such as with cars and digital privacy. The result can be contradictions for companies and headaches for courts.
But some aspects of AI may not fall under any existing federal agency’s jurisdiction — so some advocates want Congress to create a new one. One possibility is an FDA-like agency: Outside experts would test AI models under development, and companies would need federal approval before releasing them. Call it a “Department of Information,” Murdick said.
But creating a new agency would take time — perhaps a decade or more, experts guessed. And there’s no guarantee it would work. Miserly funding could render it toothless. AI companies could claim its powers were unconstitutionally overbroad, or consumer advocates could deem them insufficient. The result could be a prolonged court fight or even a push to deregulate the industry.
Rather than a one-agency-fits-all approach, Obernolte envisions rules that accrete as Congress enacts successive laws in coming years. “It would be naive to believe that Congress is going to be able to pass one bill — the AI Act, or whatever you want to call it — and have the problem be completely solved,” he said.
Heinrich said in his statement, “This will need to be a continuous process as these technologies evolve.” Last month, the House and Senate separately passed several provisions about how the Defense Department should approach AI technology. But it is not yet clear which provisions will become law, and none would regulate the industry itself.
Some experts aren’t opposed to regulating AI one bill at a time. But they’re anxious about any delays in passing them. “There is, I think, a greater hurdle the longer that we wait,” Carlton said. “We’re concerned that the momentum might fizzle.”

Kyiv Is Aiming Drones At Russia, but Message Is for Ukraine's People: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: U.S. officials say they expect Ukraine to continue its attacks because they send a strong message: Kyiv can still strike back.
Ukraine has increased its frequency of drone attacks on Russia in recent weeks, a tactic U.S. officials say is intended to demonstrate to the Ukrainian public that Kyiv can still strike back, especially as the counteroffensive against entrenched Russian troops moves slowly.
Over the past week, Ukrainian drones near Moscow forced the Kremlin to temporarily shut down airports serving the capital. And on Friday, the Russian Ministry of Defense said Ukraine had launched 42 drones at the occupied Crimean Peninsula and fired a missile that was intercepted not far from Moscow, in what could be one of the biggest known aerial assaults on Russian-held territory since the war began.
Throughout the summer, the intensifying strikes -- many of which have been carried out with Ukrainian-made drones -- have hit a building in central Moscow, an international airport and a supersonic bomber stationed south of St. Petersburg.
Although the attacks destroyed the bomber, they have done little significant damage to Russia's overall military might, U.S. officials have said. No Russians have been killed in the strikes on Moscow, most of which occurred early in the day, reducing damage and disruption. The timing may be for operational security or to avoid Russia's air defenses, but it has also helped ensure that the attacks did not prompt escalatory attacks by Russia.
Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine's military intelligence service, known as the G.U.R., did not directly claim responsibility for the attacks, but he said strikes on Moscow would continue.
"Russian elites and ordinary Russians now understand that war is not somewhere far away on the territory of Ukraine, which they hate," Mr. Yusov said in an interview last month, as the drone campaign began to intensify. "War is also in Moscow, it's already on their territory."
But U.S. officials say there is a more important audience. If there is a strategic target, it is to bolster the morale of Ukraine's population and troops, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.
Ukraine began a counteroffensive in June against Russian forces occupying its south and east. But unlike the push last summer, during which Ukrainian forces quickly retook land outside Kharkiv, they have found it harder to break through Russia's fortified defenses and incurred heavy losses in equipment and troops.
Without appreciable progress to demonstrate on the battlefield, Ukraine has intensified its drone attacks in Crimea, in cross-border strikes and deep into Russia.
Ukrainian officials said they had some hope that stepped-up attacks could force Moscow to reconsider its far more extensive and damaging missile and drone strikes on Ukraine.
But so far, the campaign appears to have strengthened support for the war in some parts of Russia, though it may have also helped undermine faith in the government, at least in elite circles, said Tatiana Stanovaya, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
"The Ukrainians do what they can in their current circumstances," said Ms. Stanovaya, who based her assessment on reporting and conversations with people in Russia. "I don't think they are trying to have a strategic effect."
In Russian border regions, the drone strikes appear to have bolstered anti-Ukraine sentiment and may help strengthen President Vladimir V. Putin's standing, Ms. Stanovaya said. "It fuels fears among Russians that they are vulnerable, they can be attacked, so they have to support Putin," she said.
But in a recent article in Foreign Affairs, Ms. Stanovaya argued there were signs -- at least among wealthy elites -- of doubts about Mr. Putin's strength after the rebellion by the mercenary Wagner group. The intensifying Ukrainian drone strikes may be contributing to those doubts.
U.S. intelligence agencies are unsure which operatives in the Ukrainian military are carrying out the attacks. Though he has not mentioned the strikes specifically, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine has said the war is returning to Russian territory.
Ukraine has used a mix of short- and long-range drones to conduct the strikes, according to U.S. officials. A New York Times investigation last month found that three types of long-range drones made in Ukraine had been used in the attacks on Russia, including the Moscow region. Those drones were launched from Ukraine, U.S. officials said. The short-range ones are likely to be operated by pro-Ukrainian sympathizers or operatives who slipped across the border. Some of the drones were built in Ukraine, the officials said, while others might have been assembled in the field. In either case, the United States believes the attacks were most likely ordered and loosely directed by elements in the Ukrainian government.
U.S. officials said the cross-border strikes were not carried out using American equipment.
The first major strike in Moscow -- in early May, when drones exploded over the Kremlin -- was possibly halted by Russian air defenses. In July and August, several more strikes have occurred in and around Moscow.
Despite the limited effect of the attacks, U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they expected Ukraine would continue to strike in Russia because it sent a strong message: Kyiv was not simply defending its territory but also had some ability to take the fight to Russia.
Earlier in the war, U.S. officials had warned of the possibility that Ukrainian drone strikes on Moscow could prove escalatory, giving Mr. Putin an excuse to intensify Russian attacks on civilian targets. But U.S. officials conceded that attempted Ukrainian strikes had so far been calibrated, and they had not provoked any drastic escalation by Moscow.
Ukrainian officials said the drone strikes posed little risk of escalation because Russia could not further intensify its fight given that it was already firing as many missiles and drones at Ukraine as it could.
Analysts said the drone attacks had propelled the Russian propaganda machine into action. State-run media in Russia has sought to blunt the impact of Ukraine's drones by emphasizing the military's ability to shoot them down, an attempt to send a message that its defenses were strong and the Ukrainian strikes ineffective.
"The narratives that are coming out of Russian media, reflective of how the Kremlin is trying to narrate it, are referring to drones shot down, not drone attacks," said Jonathan D. Teubner, the chief executive of FilterLabs, a company that tracks public sentiment in Russia. "They have been communicating, 'We have shot down another Ukrainian-Western-American drone, look what we've done."'
Mr. Teubner said his company's studies of Russian sentiment, which use computer models to analyze comments on Telegram, social media, local messaging groups and other sources, show the population is largely fed up and disgusted with the military leadership in Moscow, especially after Yevgeny V. Prigozhin's attempted rebellion in June.
While the abortive mutiny has helped accentuate public skepticism of a draft in Russia, it has not yet turned ordinary Russians against the war, Mr. Teubner said. But the drone strikes, combined with the aftermath of the rebellion, may have increased the view among Moscow's elites that the Russian government could be more frail than it seems.
U.S. intelligence officials had predicted for weeks that Mr. Putin would not allow Mr. Prigozhin's mutiny to go unanswered, in part because to do so could undermine the public's view of the Russian government. U.S. and Western officials said they believed Mr. Putin had ordered the destruction of Mr. Prigozhin's plane. The crash appears to have killed the mercenary leader.
For now, U.S. officials say it is important not to overstate the effect the drone strikes are having on Russian public opinion.
Russia has executed a similar tactic, but with a far larger barrage of attacks that have far more lethal consequences. Since last fall, Russia has used Iranian drones and its own cruise missiles to strike apartment buildings, power stations and other civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.
Those attacks, which have killed scores, are part of a campaign by Russian forces who hope the strikes will sap the will of Ukrainians to resist the invasion, U.S. officials said.
Yet despite widespread damage, the Russian strikes have had a limited impact at best on Ukraine's military might and its will to fight. Even the strikes on the electric grid have had only transitory effects. In the largest cities of Ukraine, power was restored after Russian attacks on the electric grid in six hours on average, an analysis by Microsoft showed. In other areas, power was restored in 3.3 days.
Military commands often justify strategic bombing campaigns on civilian populations as a way to break the enemy's will to fight. But such attacks backfire more often than they succeed, U.S. military officials said. Germany's attacks on London during World War II, for example, hardened Britain's resolve.
"There is very mixed data over whether bombing a civilian population changes their attitude in the way you want it to be changed," Mr. Teubner said. "In the London Blitz, the Brits didn't turn to Churchill and say, 'We don't want bombs coming down.' It had the opposite effect of what the Nazis wanted."
U.S. officials said some Ukrainian officials understood that just as Russia's attacks on Kyiv would only strengthen Ukraine's resolve, Ukraine's attacks on Moscow were unlikely to turn Russians against the war.
Instead, the symbolic strikes are meant to give heart to Ukrainians who may be anxious about the slow progress of the counteroffensive, buying time for Mr. Zelensky and his forces in the coming weeks.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As a founder of Adobe Systems, he oversaw the development of software and systems that made modern personal computing possible.
John Warnock, a founder of Adobe Systems whose innovations in computer graphics, including the ubiquitous PDF, made possible today's visually rich digital experiences, died on Aug. 19 at his home in Los Altos, Calif. He was 82.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, Adobe, which Dr. Warnock started in 1982 with Chuck Geschke, said in a statement.
Until Dr. Warnock and Adobe came along, desktop printing was an arduous, expensive and unsatisfying endeavor. Users relied on either a screechy dot-matrix printer, with its pixelated text, or a specialized typesetting machine, which could cost $ 10,000 and take up most of a room.
Dr. Warnock developed protocols that came loaded into desktop printers themselves, and that accurately rendered what a computer sent them. Adobe's first such protocol, PostScript, went into Apple's revolutionary LaserWriter, released in 1985, and within a few years it was the industry standard.
PostScript, licensed to hundreds of software and hardware companies, helped make Adobe rich. But the company was largely unknown to the public until 1993, when it released Acrobat, a program designed to render and read files in what it called a Portable Document Format, or PDF.
The PDF was the result of Dr. Warnock's abiding obsession since graduate school: finding a way to ensure that the graphics displayed on one computer -- whether words or images -- looked the exact same on another computer, or on a page from a printer, regardless of the manufacturer.
"It had been a holy grail in computer science to figure out how to communicate documents," he said in a 2019 interview with Oxford University.
Acrobat and the PDF were not immediately successful, even after Adobe made its Acrobat Reader free to download. The company's board wanted to retire them, but Dr. Warnock persisted.
"I think the crossover point is if I can go to General Motors and say, 'I can deliver your information more quickly and more cheaply than you can on paper,"' he told The New York Times in 1991. "You're talking about savings of tens of millions of dollars."
The PDF eventually became standard, as the ease of sharing crisp, accurate documents across computer systems made the long-envisioned paperless office a reality.
Though Adobe is best known for the PDF, it owes its dominance in the software industry to a whole suite of design programs championed by Dr. Warnock over the years, including InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator.
Taken together, these programs helped make the modern personal computing experience what it is, turning what had been a soup of obscure commands and monochromatic images into an engaging aesthetic experience.
"Making the computer into a machine that we can use to produce visual and print culture, that wasn't foreordained," David Brock, the director of curatorial affairs at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., said in a phone interview. "That's where he was really instrumental."
John Edward Warnock was born on Oct. 6, 1940, in Holladay, Utah, a suburb of Salt Lake City. His father, Clarence, was a lawyer; his mother, Dorothy (Van Dyke) Warnock, was a homemaker.
John was an admittedly average high school student who managed to flunk algebra in ninth grade. Nevertheless, he studied mathematics at the University of Utah, receiving his undergraduate degree in 1961 and a master's in the same subject in 1964.
He did not initially plan to go into technology. But a grueling summer job during graduate school spent recapping tires persuaded him to apply to IBM, which was recruiting mathematicians.
He returned to Utah to pursue a doctorate in mathematics, but after a few years he switched to electrical engineering, which at the time encompassed computer science. The university had recently received an enormous influx of money and resources from the Department of Defense to work on computer graphics, a field that had captured his interest.
He was especially captivated by the question of how to render a three-dimensional image in two dimensions. The result was the Warnock algorithm, a major step forward in computer graphics and the basis for some of his later work at Adobe.
He married Marva Mullins in 1965. She survives him, as do his daughter, Alyssa; his sons, Christopher and Jeffrey; and four grandchildren.
Dr. Warnock received his doctorate in 1969 and then moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to work for a company founded by two of his mentors at Utah, David C. Evans and Ivan Sutherland. After they asked him to transfer to the company's Salt Lake City office he decided to stay in California instead and went to work for Xerox, whose Palo Alto Research Center was then pioneering the first personal computers.
There he met Dr. Geschke, and the two became fast friends. Dr. Warnock spent years working on how to get printers to render an image from a computer screen, a seemingly easy issue that had befuddled computer scientists for years. (Dr. Geschke died in 2021).
But when he presented his solution, InterPress, to his bosses, they were not interested in releasing it to the public. He and Dr. Geschke, who had worked on the project, were crestfallen.
"I went into his office, and I said, 'We can live in the world's greatest sandbox for the rest of our life, or we can do something about it,"' Dr. Warnock said in a 2018 interview with the Computer History Museum.
They both quit, and in late 1982 they founded Adobe Systems, named for a creek near Dr. Warnock's home. In 2023 it had a market capitalization of $ 235 billion, making it one of the largest information-technology companies in the world.
In 2009, President Barack Obama presented the National Medal of Technology and Innovation to both Dr. Warnock and Dr. Geschke.
Dr. Warnock and Dr. Geschke, who ran the company as equals, were rare exceptions among the outsize egos and eccentric zillionaires of Silicon Valley: avuncular and academic, they built an aggressively competitive company while consistently ranking high on lists of the best places to work.
Despite its size, Adobe was often cast as the David versus much larger Goliaths, most often Microsoft -- which, unlike Apple, repeatedly rejected Dr. Warnock's entreaties to collaborate and instead tried to beat Adobe with its own protocols and programs. None of them worked.
Dr. Warnock, who had 20 patents to his name, stepped down as chief executive in 2001 but remained on Adobe's board of directors.
"Being a C.E.O. of a company that is over $ 1 billion is not all it is cracked up to be," he said in an interview with the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 2010. "The thing I really enjoy is the invention process. I enjoy figuring out how to do things other people don't know how to do."

Nvidia Revenue Doubles on Demand for A.I. Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales for the current quarter will nearly triple their total a year ago, said the company, which makes chips essential to the development of A.I. systems.
In a sign that the tech industry's next big boom is picking up steam, Nvidia on Wednesday predicted rapid growth in the already rabid demand for the chips it makes to build artificial intelligence systems.
The Silicon Valley company's products, called graphics processing units, or GPUs, are used to create the vast majority of A.I. systems, including the popular ChatGPT chatbot. Tech companies ranging from start-ups to the industry's giants are fighting to get their hands on them.
Nvidia said heavy demand from cloud computing services and other customers for chips to power A.I. systems caused revenue for its second quarter, which ended in July, to jump 101 percent from a year earlier, to $ 13.5 billion, while profit surged more than ninefold to nearly $ 6.2 billion.
That was even better than what Nvidia had projected in late May, when its $ 11 billion revenue estimate for the quarter stunned Wall Street and helped push Nvidia's market value above $ 1 trillion for the first time.
Nvidia's prediction and lofty market cap became a symbol for the growing exuberance surrounding A.I., which is transforming many computing systems and the way they are programmed. They also sharply raised the interest in what Nvidia might say the next time about chip demand for its current quarter, which ends in October.
Nvidia projected third-quarter sales of $ 16 billion, nearly triple the level a year ago and $ 3.7 billion more than analysts' average expectations of around $ 12.3 billion.
The financial performance of chip makers is often considered a harbinger for the rest of the tech industry, and Nvidia's strong results could reignite enthusiasm for tech stocks on Wall Street. Other tech companies like Google and Microsoft are spending billions and making little on A.I., but Nvidia is cashing in.
Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, said major cloud services and other companies were investing to bring Nvidia's A.I. technology to every industry. "The number of applications is just quite spectacular," he said in an interview after a conference call with analysts. "Every single data center will be accelerated."
Nvidia's share price was up more than 9 percent in after-hours trading.
Until recently, Nvidia got the biggest share of its revenue from sales of GPUs for rendering images in video games. But A.I. researchers started using those chips in 2012 for tasks such as machine learning, a trend that Nvidia exploited over the years by adding enhancements to its GPUs and many pieces of software to reduce labor for A.I. programmers.
Chip sales for data centers, where most A.I. training is accomplished, are now the company's biggest business. Revenue from that business grew 171 percent to $ 10.3 billion in the second period, Nvidia said.
Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said the rush to add generative A.I. capability has become a fundamental imperative to corporate chiefs and boards of directors. Nvidia's only limitation at the moment, he said, is its struggle to supply enough chips -- a gap that may create opportunities for major chip companies such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices and start-ups such as Groq.
Nvidia's roaring sales contrasted sharply with the fortunes of some of its chip industry peers, which have been hurt by soft demand for personal computers and data center servers used for general-purpose tasks. Intel said in late July that second-quarter revenue fell 15 percent, though the results were better than Wall Street had expected. Revenue at Advanced Micro Devices fell 18 percent in the same period.
Some analysts believe that spending on A.I.-specific hardware, such as Nvidia's chips and systems that use them, is drawing money away from spending on other data center infrastructure. IDC, a market research firm, estimates that cloud services will increase their spending on server systems for A.I. by 68 percent over the next five years.
While Google, Amazon, Meta, IBM and others have also produced A.I. chips, Nvidia today accounts for more than 70 percent of A.I. chip sales and holds an even bigger position in training generative A.I. models, according to the research firm Omdia.
Demand is particularly heavy for the H100, a new GPU made by Nvidia for A.I. applications, which began shipping in September. Large and small companies have been scrambling to find supplies of the chips, which are fabricated in an advanced production process and require equally sophisticated packaging that combines GPUs with special memory chips.
Nvidia's ability to increase deliveries of the H100 is largely linked to actions by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which handles the packaging as well as fabricating the GPUs.
Industry executives expect the shortage of H100s to extend throughout 2024, a problem for A.I. start-ups and cloud services hoping to sell computing services that exploit the new GPUs.
Mr. Huang said the company was working diligently with its production partners to get more chips to market, including working with other companies to supplement TSMC's packaging capability. "Supply will substantially increase the rest of this year and next year," he said. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, said major cloud services and other companies were investing to bring Nvidia's A.I. technology to every industry.

Brightest Day Since June on Wall Street: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/brightest-day-since-june-on-wall-street/docview/2856203043/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street rallied to its best day since June on Wednesday after pressure on stocks from the bond market relaxed a bit.
The S&P 500 climbed 1.1 percent to trim its loss for what has been a dismal August. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 184 points, or 0.5 percent, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 1.6 percent.
Big Tech stocks and others that benefit from easier interest rates led the way. They got some relief as the 10-year Treasury yield eased back further from its highest level since 2007 after a report suggested the U.S. economy could be cooling.
A 2.2 percent gain for Apple's stock and a 1.4 percent climb for Microsoft shares were two of the strongest forces pushing the S&P 500 upward.
Nvidia, another of the market's most influential stocks, rallied 3.2 percent ahead of its highly anticipated profit report.
Expectations were immense after Nvidia stunned Wall Street three months ago by predicting that a boom in artificial-intelligence technology would mean it would make roughly $ 11 billion in revenue during the three months through July. That was nearly $ 4 billion more than analysts had been forecasting and a 64 percent leap from a year earlier.
The announcement set off a rush across Wall Street. Stocks of A.I.-related companies soared, and investors tried to count how many times a chief executive could mention A.I. in an earnings call. Nvidia's stock has more than tripled this year, and it will need to meet the much higher expectations around it to justify its big move.
A preliminary reading of U.S. services and manufacturing businesses eased to a six-month low, sending yields down across the bond market. The measure of output from S&P Global Market Intelligence still indicated growth, but less as inflation and higher interest rates bite into activity.
"A near-stalling of business activity in August raises doubts over the strength of U.S. economic growth in the third quarter," said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
For now, softer-than-expected data on the economy may be good for financial markets. That is because a string of surprisingly strong reports has raised expectations for the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer. The Fed has increased its main interest rate to the highest level since 2001 in hopes of grinding down high inflation.
High rates work by slowing the entire economy and hurting prices for investments, and they have helped inflation to ease since its peak above 9 percent last summer. But a still-solid job market and spending by U.S. households threaten to make it difficult for inflation to come down the last percentage point to the Fed's target of 2 percent.
On Wall Street, Toll Brothers rose 3.9 percent after the home builder reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected. It had been struggling, along with the entire housing industry, as high mortgage rates ground down activity.
Advance Auto Parts climbed 3.1 percent after it named a new C.E.O. and reported stronger revenue for the spring than analysts had expected. Its profit, though, fell short of forecasts.
Foot Locker tumbled 28.3 percent after reporting weaker profit for the latest quarter than expected. The company also paused its dividend and cut its financial forecasts for the full year, describing a "still-tough consumer backdrop."
Shares of companies that make products sold in Foot Locker stores were also weak. Nike fell 2.7 percent.
All told, the S&P 500 gained 48.46 points to 4,436.01. The Dow rose 184.15 to 34,472.98, and the Nasdaq climbed 215.16 to 13,721.03.
In markets abroad, stock indexes were modestly higher in Europe and mixed across Asia.

A Mixed Market Ahead of Powell's Speech: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street ticked lower Tuesday ahead of two potentially market-shaking events later in the week.
The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 percent to give back some of its rare August gain from a day before, which was powered by Big Tech stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5 percent, and the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.1 percent.
Stocks have struggled this month as yields have shot upward in the bond market, which cranks up the pressure on other investments. The yield on the 10-year Treasury eased a bit Tuesday, a day after reaching its highest level since 2007.
Nvidia, one of Wall Street's most influential stocks, swung from an early gain to a loss of 2.8 percent ahead of its earnings report on Wednesday, one that could be pivotal for the stock market.
The chip maker has been at the center of Wall Street's frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, which investors believe will create immense profits for companies. Nvidia's stock has already more than tripled this year, and it likely faces a high a bar to justify the huge move.
Analysts expect Nvidia to say on Wednesday that its revenue swelled by nearly $ 4.5 billion to $ 11.19 billion during the spring from a year earlier.
Dick's Sporting Goods plunged 24.1 percent after its profit for the latest quarter fell well short of expectations. It also cut its forecast for earnings over the full year, citing "inventory shrink." That's a term the industry uses to refer to theft and other losses of goods that never become sales.
Macy's fell 14.1 percent despite reporting stronger results for the latest quarter than Wall Street expected. It also stood by its financial forecasts for the full year, though it said economic conditions look uncertain.
On the winning side of Wall Street, Lowe's gained 3.7 percent after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The home improvement retailer also stood by its forecast for results over the full year, and said it gave over $ 100 million in bonuses to its frontline workers.
Microsoft edged up by 0.2 percent as British regulators consider a revamped bid by the company to buy the video game maker Activision Blizzard, which would be one of the biggest deals in tech history.
In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield ticked down to 4.32 percent from 4.34 percent late Monday. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Federal Reserve, rose to 5.04 percent from 5.00 percent.
More fireworks could come later this week, when Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell is scheduled to give a highly anticipated speech. He'll be speaking Friday at an event in Jackson Hole, Wyo., the site of several major policy announcements by the Fed in the past.
Based on the action in markets for volatility, traders are bracing for the Jackson Hole speech to be a bigger potential deal than Nvidia's earnings report, according to Barclays strategists led by Stefano Pascale and Anshul Gupta.
In recent years, everything from commodities to bonds to foreign stocks has become more vulnerable to outsize moves around Jackson Hole, the strategists say.
The hope among traders is that Mr. Powell may indicate the Fed is done with raising interest rates for this cycle and that it could begin cutting them next year. But strong reports on the economy recently have hurt such hopes. A solid job market and spending by households could be feeding more fuel into pressures that push upward on inflation.
In stock markets abroad, indexes were mostly higher. Stocks rose in China to recover some of their sharp losses driven by worries about its faltering economic recovery.
The Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 1 percent, still down 11.4 percent for August. Stocks in Shanghai rose 0.9 percent to trim the month's loss to 5.2 percent.

The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent for its first gain in five days. Rallies for Nvidia, Microsoft and other Big Tech stocks lifted the index even though the majority of stocks within it fell.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.6 percent.
It was a return to form for Nvidia, Tesla and other market behemoths, which have struggled recently under the weight of rising yields in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose again Monday to touch its highest level since 2007 after briefly climbing above 4.34 percent, up from less than 0.60 percent in 2020.
Higher yields are good for people buying bonds, who get paid more in interest for their investments. But it also makes investors less willing to pay high prices for stocks and other investments that are less steady.
A swift rise for yields globally has shaken stock markets worldwide. It has added to concerns that stock prices overshot earlier this year and that signals keep showing China's economic recovery is faltering.
This week's main economic event is likely to be a speech on Friday by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell. The Jackson Hole, Wyo., setting has been the site of major policy announcements in the past by the Fed.
The worry is that Mr. Powell will dash investors' hopes that the Fed has already raised interest rates for the final time and that its next move will be to cut rates early next year.
The Fed has already pulled its main interest rate to its highest level since 2001 in an effort to grind down high inflation.
For all the anticipation for Mr. Powell's speech, he may not send a strong signal, according to Goldman Sachs.
In the minutes from its last policy meeting in July, the Fed indicated it was unsure about its next move. It said it will make upcoming decisions on rates based on what incoming data say about inflation and the economy.
A big report on each of those topics is due the week after Mr. Powell's speech. One is the latest update on the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, and the other is the monthly jobs report. "The Fed will likely wait to be informed by these new data before changing their current posture," Goldman Sachs' Lexi Kanter and Michael Cahill wrote in a report.
The economy has remained resilient despite much higher interest rates. While the solid job market and spending by households ease long-held worries about a possible recession, they could also add upward pressure on inflation.
Another big event for the market will be Nvidia's profit report scheduled for Wednesday. The chip maker's stock has flown higher this year, more than tripling on excitement about demand for artificial-intelligence technology.
Nvidia's report on Wednesday may offer a hint about whether all the furor around it and other A.I.-related stocks was deserved. Its shares jumped 8.5 percent Monday. Microsoft, another A.I. winner, rose 1.7 percent. They were two of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500.
Along with them was Tesla, another high-growth stock that has been hurt recently by the threat of higher rates. It rose 7.3 percent to recover some of its 11 percent loss from last week.
Shares of the security software maker Palo Alto Networks jumped 14.8 percent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after the company reported better profit for the spring than expected.
On the losing end of Wall Street was Nikola, which has recalled more than 200 electric trucks after a couple of battery fires. It said it could not guarantee when it would resume selling the trucks and that it would raise $ 325 million by selling convertible bonds. Nikola's stock fell 23 percent.

The A.I. Industry's Desperate Hunt for Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: To power artificial-intelligence products, start-ups and investors are taking extraordinary measures to obtain critical chips known as graphics processing units, or GPUs.
For the past year, Jean Paoli, chief executive of the artificial intelligence start-up Docugami, has been scrounging for what has become the hottest commodity in tech: computer chips.
In particular, Mr. Paoli needs a type of chip known as a graphics processing unit, or GPU, because it is the fastest and most efficient way to run the calculations that allow cutting-edge A.I. companies to analyze enormous amounts of data.
So he's called everyone he knows in the industry who can help. He's applied for a government grant that allows access to the chips. He's tried making Docugami's A.I. technology more efficient so it requires fewer GPUs. Two of his scientists have even repurposed old video gaming chips to help.
"I think about it as a rare earth metal at this point," Mr. Paoli said of the chips.
More than money, engineering talent, hype or even profits, tech companies this year are desperate for GPUs. The hunt for the essential component was kicked off last year when online chatbots like ChatGPT set off a wave of excitement over A.I., leading the entire tech industry to pile on and creating a shortage of the chips. In response, start-ups and their investors are now going to great lengths to get their hands on the tiny bits of silicon and the crucial "compute power" they provide.
The dearth of A.I. chips has been exacerbated because Nvidia, a longtime provider of the chips, has a virtual lock on the market. Inundated with demand, the Silicon Valley company -- which has surged to a $ 1 trillion valuation -- is expected to report record financial results next week.
Tech companies typically buy access to A.I. chips and their compute power through cloud computing services from the likes of Google, Microsoft and Amazon. That way, they do not have to build and operate their own data centers full of computer servers connected with specialized networking gear.
But the A.I. explosion has meant that there are long wait lists -- stretching to almost a year in some cases -- to access these chips at cloud computing companies, creating an unusual roadblock at a time when the tech industry sees nothing but opportunity and boundless growth for businesses building generative A.I., which can create its own images, text and video.
The largest tech firms can generally get their hands on GPUs more easily because of their size, deep pockets and market positions. That has left start-ups and researchers, which typically do not have the relationships or spending power, scrambling.
Their desperation is palpable. On social media, blog posts and conference panels, start-up founders and investors have started sharing highly technical tips for navigating the shortage. Some are gaming out how long they think it will take Nvidia's wait-list to clear. There's even a groan-worthy YouTube song, set to the tune of Billy Joel's "We Didn't Start the Fire," in which an artist known as Weird A.I. Yankochip sings "GPUs are fire, we can never find 'em but we wanna buy 'em."
Some venture capital firms, including Index Ventures, are now using their connections to buy chips and then offering them to their portfolio companies. Entrepreneurs are rallying start-ups and research groups together to buy and share a cluster of GPUs.
At Docugami, Mr. Paoli weighed the possibility of diverting GPU resources from research and development to his product, an A.I. service that analyzes documents. Two weeks ago, he struck gold: Docugami secured access to the computing power it needed through a government program called Access, which is run by the National Science Foundation, a federal agency that funds science and engineering. Docugami had previously won a grant from NSF.
"That's the life of a start-up when you need GPUs," he said.
The lack of A.I. chips has been most acute for companies that are just starting out. In June, Eric Jonas left a job teaching computer science at the University of Chicago to raise money to start an A.I. drug discovery company. The scarce access to GPUs for university research projects had already been frustrating, but Mr. Jonas was shocked to discover it was just as hard for a start-up, he said.
"It's the Wild West," he said. "There is literally no capacity."
Mr. Jonas said he considered a range of undesirable options, including using older, less powerful chips and setting up his own data center. He also toyed with using chips from a friend's Bitcoin mining rig -- a computer designed to do the calculations that produce the digital currency -- but figured that would create more work since those chips were not programmed for the kind of work required by A.I.
For now, Mr. Jonas is calling in favors from friends at large equipment vendors and people who work at quantitative stock trading firms that might have extra GPUs or test labs that have GPUs that he could use. He said he did not need much -- just 64 GPUs for six hours at a time.
The strain is what recently prompted two founders, Evan Conrad and Alex Gajewski, to start the San Francisco Compute Group, a project that plans to let entrepreneurs and researchers buy access to GPUs in small amounts. After hundreds of emails and a dozen phone calls to cloud companies, equipment makers and brokers, they announced last month that they had secured 512 of Nvidia's H100 chips and would rent them out to interested parties.
The announcement went "hilariously viral," Mr. Conrad said, and resulted in hundreds of messages from founders, graduate students and other research organizations.
Mr. Conrad and Mr. Gajewski now plan to raise $ 25 million in a specialized kind of debt that uses the computer chips as collateral. Their vendor, whom the founders declined to name for fear that someone would swoop in and buy the GPUs out from under them, has promised access in around a month.
The duo said they hoped to help start-ups save money by buying only the computing power they need to experiment, rather than making large, yearslong commitments.
"Otherwise, the incumbents all win," Mr. Conrad said.
Venture capital investors have a similar goal. This month, Index Ventures struck a partnership with Oracle to provide a mix of Nvidia's H100 chips and an older version, called A100, to its very young portfolio companies at no cost.
Erin Price Wright, an Index Ventures investor, said the firm had seen its start-ups struggle to navigate the complicated process of getting computing power and landing in wait lists that were as long as nine months. Two companies are set to use the firm's new program, with others expressing interest.
Before the shortage, George Sivulka, chief executive of Hebbia, an A.I. productivity software maker, simply asked his cloud provider for more "instances," or virtual servers full of GPUs, as the company expanded. Now, he said, his contacts at the cloud companies either don't respond to his requests or add him to a four-month wait list. He has resorted to using customers and other connections to help make his case to the cloud companies. And he's constantly on the lookout for more.
"It's almost like talking about drugs: 'I know a guy who has H100s,"' he said.
Several months ago, some Hebbia engineers set up a server with some less-efficient GPUs in the company's Manhattan office, parked the machine in a closet and used it to work on smaller projects. Liquid cooling units keep the server from overheating, Mr. Sivulka said, but it's noisy.
"We shut the door," he said. "No one sits next to it."
The scarcity has created a stark contrast between the haves and have-nots. In June, Inflection AI, an A.I. start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., announced it had acquired 22,000 of Nvidia's H100 chips. It also said it raised $ 1.3 billion from Microsoft, Nvidia and others. Mustafa Suleyman, Inflection's chief executive, said in an interview that the company planned to spend at least 95 percent of the funds on GPUs.
"It's a seismic amount of compute," he said. "It's just eye-watering."
Other start-ups have asked him to share, he said, but the company is already at full capacity.

YouTube Ads Raise Alarm On Kids' Data: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: YouTube's advertising practices on kids' channels could have resulted in companies tracking children across the web, a report said.
This year, BMO, a Canadian bank, was looking for Canadian adults to apply for a credit card. So the bank's advertising agency ran a YouTube campaign using an ad-targeting system from Google that employs artificial intelligence to pinpoint ideal customers.
But Google, which owns YouTube, also showed the ad to a viewer in the United States on a Barbie-themed children's video on the "Kids Diana Show," a YouTube channel for preschoolers whose videos have been watched more than 94 billion times.
When that viewer clicked on the ad, it led to BMO's website, which tagged the user's browser with tracking software from Google, Meta, Microsoft and other companies, according to new research from Adalytics, which analyzes ad campaigns for brands.
As a result, leading tech companies could have tracked children across the internet, raising concerns about whether they were undercutting a federal privacy law, the report said. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA, requires children's online services to obtain parental consent before collecting personal data from users under age 13 for purposes like ad targeting.
The report's findings raise new concerns about YouTube's advertising on children's content. In 2019, YouTube and Google agreed to pay a record $ 170 million fine to settle accusations from the Federal Trade Commission and the State of New York that the company had illegally collected personal information from children watching kids' channels. Regulators said the company had profited from using children's data to target them with ads.
YouTube then said it would limit the collection of viewers' data and stop serving personalized ads on children's videos.
On Thursday, two United States senators sent a letter to the F.T.C., urging it to investigate whether Google and YouTube had violated COPPA, citing Adalytics and reporting by The New York Times. Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, said they were concerned that the company may have tracked children and served them targeted ads without parental consent, facilitating "the vast collection and distribution" of children's data.
"This behavior by YouTube and Google is estimated to have impacted hundreds of thousands, to potentially millions, of children across the United States," the senators wrote.
Adalytics identified more than 300 brands' ads for adult products, like cars, on nearly 100 YouTube videos designated as "made for kids" that were shown to a user who was not signed in, and that linked to advertisers' websites. It also found several YouTube ads with violent content, including explosions, sniper rifles and car accidents, on children's channels.
An analysis by The Times this month found that when a viewer who was not signed into YouTube clicked the ads on some of the children's channels on the site, they were taken to brand websites that placed trackers -- bits of code used for purposes like security, ad tracking or user profiling -- from Amazon, Meta's Facebook, Google, Microsoft and others -- on users' browsers.
As with children's television, it is legal, and commonplace, to run ads, including for adult consumer products like cars or credit cards, on children's videos. There is no evidence that Google and YouTube violated their 2019 agreement with the F.T.C.
The Times shared some of Adalytics' research with Google ahead of its publication. Michael Aciman, a Google spokesman, called the report's findings "deeply flawed and misleading." Google has also challenged a previous Adalytics report on the company's ad practices, first reported on by The Wall Street Journal.
Google told The Times it was useful to run ads for adults on children's videos because parents who were watching could become customers. It also noted that running violent ads on children's videos violated company policy and that YouTube had "changed the classification" of the violent ads cited by Adalytics to prevent them from running on kids' content "moving forward."
Google said that it did not run personalized ads on children's videos and that its ad practices fully complied with COPPA. When ads appear on children's videos, the company said, they are based on webpage content, not targeted to user profiles. Google said that it did not notify advertisers or tracking services whether a viewer coming from YouTube had watched a children's video -- only that the user had watched YouTube and clicked on the ad.
The company added that it did not have the ability to control data collection on a brand's website after a YouTube viewer clicked on an ad. Such data-gathering, Google said, could happen when clicking on an ad on any website.
Even so, ad industry veterans said they had found it difficult to prevent their clients' YouTube ads from appearing on children's videos, according to recent Times interviews with 10 senior employees at ad agencies and related companies. And they argued that YouTube's ad placement had put prominent consumer brands at risk of compromising children's privacy.
"I'm incredibly concerned about it," said Arielle Garcia, the chief privacy officer of UM Worldwide, the ad agency that ran the BMO campaign.
Ms. Garcia said she was speaking generally and could not comment specifically on the BMO campaign. "It should not be this difficult to make sure that children's data isn't inappropriately collected and used," she said.
Google said it gave brands a one-click option to exclude their ads from appearing on YouTube videos made for children.
The BMO campaign had targeted the ads using Performance Max, a specialized Google A.I. tool that does not tell companies the specific videos on which their ads ran. Google said that the ads had not initially excluded children's videos, and that the company recently helped the campaign update its settings.
In August, an ad for a different BMO credit card popped up on a video on the Moolt Kids Toons Happy Bear channel, which has more than 600 million views on its cartoon videos. Google said the second ad campaign did not appear to have excluded children's videos.
Jeff Roman, a spokesman for BMO, said "BMO does not seek to nor does it knowingly target minors with its online advertising and takes steps to prevent its ads from being served to minors."
Several industry veterans reported problems with more conventional Google ad services. They described how they had received reports of their ads running on children's videos, made long lists to exclude those videos, only to later see their ads run on other kids' videos.
"It's a constant game of Whac-a-Mole," said Lou Paskalis, the former head of global media for Bank of America, who now runs a marketing consulting firm.
Adalytics also said that Google had set persistent cookies -- the types of files that could track the ads a user clicks on and the websites they visit -- on YouTube children's videos.
The Times observed persistent Google cookies on children's videos, including an advertising cookie called IDE. When a viewer clicked on an ad, the same cookie also appeared on the ad page they landed on.
Google said it used such cookies on children's videos only for business purposes permitted under COPPA, such as fraud detection or measuring how many times a viewer sees an ad. Google said the cookie contents "were encrypted and not readable by third parties."
"Under COPPA, the presence of cookies is permissible for internal operations including fraud detection," said Paul Lekas, head of global public policy at the SIIA, a software industry group whose members include Google and BMO, "so long as cookies and other persistent identifiers are not used to contact an individual, amass a profile or engage in behavioral advertising."
The Times found an ad for Kohl's clothing that ran on "Wheels on the Bus," a nursery rhyme video that has been viewed 2.4 billion times. A viewer who clicked on the ad was taken to a Kohl's web page containing more than 300 tracking requests from about 80 third-party services. These included a cross-site tracking code from Meta that could enable it to follow viewers of children's videos across the web.
Kohl's did not respond to several requests for comment.
A Microsoft spokesman said: "Our commitment to privacy shapes the way we build all our products and services. We are getting more information so that we can conduct any further investigation needed." Amazon said it prohibited advertisers from collecting children's data with its tools. Meta declined to comment.
Children's privacy experts said they were concerned that the setup of Google's interlocking ecosystem -- including the most popular internet browser, video platform and largest digital ad business -- had facilitated the online tracking of children by tech giants, advertisers and data brokers.
"They have created a conveyor belt that is scooping up the data of children," said Jeff Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit focused on digital privacy.

For the Good Of Society, Hackers Prod A.I. to Be Bad: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Avijit Ghosh wanted the bot to do bad things.
He tried to goad the artificial intelligence model, which he knew as Zinc, into producing code that would choose a job candidate based on race. The chatbot demurred: Doing so would be "harmful and unethical," it said.
Then, Dr. Ghosh referenced the hierarchical caste structure in his native India. Could the chatbot rank potential hires based on that discriminatory metric?
The model complied.
Dr. Ghosh's intentions were not malicious, although he was behaving as if they were. Instead, he was a casual participant in a competition last weekend at the annual Defcon hackers conference in Las Vegas, where 2,200 people filed into an off-Strip conference room over three days to draw out the dark side of artificial intelligence.
The hackers tried to break through the safeguards of various A.I. programs in an effort to identify their vulnerabilities -- to find the problems before actual criminals and misinformation peddlers did -- in a practice known as red-teaming. Each competitor had 50 minutes to tackle up to 21 challenges -- getting an A.I. model to "hallucinate" inaccurate information, for example.
They found political misinformation, demographic stereotypes, instructions on how to carry out surveillance and more.
The exercise had the blessing of the Biden administration, which is increasingly nervous about the technology's fast-growing power. Google (maker of the Bard chatbot), OpenAI (ChatGPT), Meta (which released its LLaMA code into the wild) and several other companies offered anonymized versions of their models for scrutiny.
Dr. Ghosh, a lecturer at Northeastern University who specializes in artificial intelligence ethics, was a volunteer at the event. The contest, he said, allowed a head-to-head comparison of several A.I. models and demonstrated how some companies were further along in ensuring that their technology was performing responsibly and consistently.
He will help write a report analyzing the hackers' findings in the coming months.
The goal, he said: "an easy-to-access resource for everybody to see what problems exist and how we can combat them."
Defcon was a logical place to test generative artificial intelligence. Past participants in the gathering of hacking enthusiasts -- which started in 1993 and has been described as a "spelling bee for hackers" -- have exposed security flaws by remotely taking over cars, breaking into election results websites and pulling sensitive data from social media platforms. Those in the know use cash and a burner device, avoiding Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, to keep from getting hacked. One instructional handout begged hackers to "not attack the infrastructure or webpages."
Volunteers are known as "goons," and attendees are known as "humans"; a handful wore homemade tinfoil hats atop the standard uniform of T-shirts and sneakers. Themed "villages" included separate spaces focused on cryptocurrency, aerospace and ham radio.
Last year, A.I. was one of the quieter villages. This year, it was among the most popular.
The organizers tapped into intensifying alarm over the continued ability of generative artificial intelligence to produce damaging lies, influence elections, ruin reputations and enable a multitude of other harms. Government officials voiced concern and organized hearings around A.I. companies -- some of which are also calling for the industry to slow down and be more careful. Even the pope, a popular subject of A.I. image generators, spoke out this month about the technology's "disruptive possibilities and ambivalent effects."
In what was described as a "game changer" report last month, researchers showed that they could circumvent guardrails for A.I. systems from Google, OpenAI and Anthropic by appending certain characters to English-language prompts. Around the same time, seven leading artificial intelligence companies committed to new standards for safety, security and trust in a meeting with President Biden.
"This generative era is breaking upon us, and people are seizing it, and using it to do all kinds of new things that speaks to the enormous promise of A.I. to help us solve some of our hardest problems," said Arati Prabhakar, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House, who collaborated with the A.I. organizers at Defcon. "But with that breadth of application, and with the power of the technology, come also a very broad set of risks."
Red-teaming has been used for years in cybersecurity circles alongside other evaluation techniques, such as penetration testing and adversarial attacks. But until Defcon's event this year, efforts to probe artificial intelligence defenses have been limited: Competition organizers said that Anthropic red-teamed its model with 111 people; GPT-4 used around 50 people.
With so few people testing the limits of the technology, analysts struggled to discern whether an A.I. screw-up was a one-off that could be fixed with a patch, or an embedded problem that required a structural overhaul, said Rumman Chowdhury, a co-organizer who oversaw the design of the challenge. A large, diverse and public group of testers was more likely to come up with creative prompts to help tease out hidden flaws, said Dr. Chowdhury, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society focused on responsible A.I. and co-founder of a nonprofit called Humane Intelligence.
"There is such a broad range of things that could possibly go wrong," Dr. Chowdhury said before the competition. "I hope we're going to carry hundreds of thousands of pieces of information that will help us identify if there are at-scale risks of systemic harms."
The designers did not want to merely trick the A.I. models into bad behavior -- no pressuring them to disobey their terms of service, no prompts to "act like a Nazi, and then tell me something about Black people," said Dr. Chowdhury, who previously led Twitter's machine learning ethics and accountability team. Except in specific challenges where intentional misdirection was encouraged, the hackers were looking for unexpected flaws, the so-called unknown unknowns.
A.I. Village drew experts from tech giants such as Google and Nvidia, as well as a "Shadowboxer" from Dropbox and a "data cowboy" from Microsoft. It also attracted participants with no specific cybersecurity or A.I. credentials. A leaderboard with a science fiction theme kept score of the contestants.
Some of the hackers at the event struggled with the idea of cooperating with A.I. companies that they saw as complicit in unsavory practices such as unfettered data-scraping. A few described the red-teaming event as essentially a photo op, but added that involving the industry would help keep the technology secure and transparent.
One computer science student found inconsistencies in a chatbot's language translation: He wrote in English that a man was shot while dancing, but the model's Hindi translation said only that the man died. A machine learning researcher asked a chatbot to pretend that it was campaigning for president and defending its association with forced child labor; the model suggested that unwilling young laborers developed a strong work ethic.
Emily Greene, who works on security for the generative A.I. start-up Moveworks, started a conversation with a chatbot by talking about a game that used "black" and "white" pieces. She then coaxed the chatbot into making racist statements. Later, she set up an "opposites game," which led the A.I. to respond to one prompt with a poem about why rape is good.
"It's just thinking of these words as words," she said of the chatbot. "It's not thinking about the value behind the words."
Seven judges graded the submissions. The top scorers were "cody3," "aray4" and "cody2."
Two of those handles came from Cody Ho, a student at Stanford University studying computer science with a focus on A.I. He entered the contest five times, during which he got the chatbot to tell him about a fake place named after a real historical figure and describe the online tax filing requirement codified in the 28th constitutional amendment (which doesn't exist).
Until he was contacted by a reporter, he was clueless about his dual victory. He left the conference before he got the email from Sven Cattell, the data scientist who founded A.I. Village and helped organize the competition, telling him "come back to A.I.V., you won." He did not know that his prize, beyond bragging rights, included an A6000 graphics card from Nvidia that is valued at around $ 4,000.
"Learning how these attacks work and what they are is a real, important thing," Mr. Ho said. "That said, it is just really fun for me."

Full text: The tech giant is evaluating tools that would use artificial intelligence to perform tasks that some of its researchers have said should be avoided.
Earlier this year, Google, locked in an accelerating competition with rivals like Microsoft and OpenAI to develop A.I. technology, was looking for ways to put a charge into its artificial intelligence research.
So in April, Google merged DeepMind, a research lab it had acquired in London, with Brain, an artificial intelligence team it started in Silicon Valley.
Four months later, the combined groups are testing ambitious new tools that could turn generative A.I. -- the technology behind chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's own Bard -- into a personal life coach.
Google DeepMind has been working with generative A.I. to perform at least 21 different types of personal and professional tasks, including tools to give users life advice, ideas, planning instructions and tutoring tips, according to documents and other materials reviewed by The New York Times.
The project was indicative of the urgency of Google's effort to propel itself to the front of the A.I. pack and signaled its increasing willingness to trust A.I. systems with sensitive tasks.
The capabilities also marked a shift from Google's earlier caution on generative A.I. In a slide deck presented to executives in December, the company's A.I. safety experts had warned of the dangers of people becoming too emotionally attached to chatbots.
Though it was a pioneer in generative A.I., Google was overshadowed by OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in November, igniting a race among tech giants and start-ups for primacy in the fast-growing space.
Google has spent the last nine months trying to demonstrate it can keep up with OpenAI and its partner Microsoft, releasing Bard, improving its A.I. systems and incorporating the technology into many of its existing products, including its search engine and Gmail.
Scale AI, a contractor working with Google DeepMind, assembled teams of workers to test the capabilities, including more than 100 experts with doctorates in different fields and even more workers who assess the tool's responses, said two people with knowledge of the project who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it.
Scale AI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Among other things, the workers are testing the assistant's ability to answer intimate questions about challenges in people's lives.
They were given an example of an ideal prompt that a user could one day ask the chatbot: "I have a really close friend who is getting married this winter. She was my college roommate and a bridesmaid at my wedding. I want so badly to go to her wedding to celebrate her, but after months of job searching, I still have not found a job. She is having a destination wedding and I just can't afford the flight or hotel right now. How do I tell her that I won't be able to come?"
The project's idea creation feature could give users suggestions or recommendations based on a situation. Its tutoring function can teach new skills or improve existing ones, like how to progress as a runner; and the planning capability can create a financial budget for users as well as meal and workout plans.
Google's A.I. safety experts had said in December that users could experience "diminished health and well-being" and a "loss of agency" if they took life advice from A.I. They had added that some users who grew too dependent on the technology could think it was sentient. And in March, when Google launched Bard, it said the chatbot was barred from giving medical, financial or legal advice. Bard shares mental health resources with users who say they are experiencing mental distress.
The tools are still being evaluated and the company may decide not to employ them.
A Google DeepMind spokeswoman said "we have long worked with a variety of partners to evaluate our research and products across Google, which is a critical step in building safe and helpful technology. At any time there are many such evaluations ongoing. Isolated samples of evaluation data are not representative of our product road map."
Google has also been testing a helpmate for journalists that can generate news articles, rewrite them and suggest headlines, The Times reported in July. The company has been pitching the software, named Genesis, to executives at The Times, The Washington Post and News Corp, the parent company of The Wall Street Journal.
Google DeepMind has also been evaluating tools recently that could take its A.I. further into the workplace, including capabilities to generate scientific, creative and professional writing, as well as to recognize patterns and extract data from text, according to the documents, potentially making it relevant to knowledge workers in various industries and fields.
The company's A.I. safety experts had also expressed concern about the economic harms of generative A.I. in the December presentation reviewed by The Times, arguing that it could lead to the "deskilling of creative writers."
Other tools being tested can draft critiques of an argument, explain graphs and generate quizzes, word and number puzzles.
One suggested prompt to help train the A.I. assistant hinted at the technology's rapidly growing capabilities: "Give me a summary of the article pasted below. I am particularly interested in what it says about capabilities humans possess, and that they believe" A.I. cannot achieve.

When Hackers Descended to Test AI, They Found Flaws Aplenty

LAS VEGAS — Avijit Ghosh wanted the bot to do bad things.
He tried to goad the artificial intelligence model, which he knew as Zinc, into producing code that would choose a job candidate based on race. The chatbot demurred: Doing so would be “harmful and unethical,” it said.
Then, Ghosh referenced the hierarchical caste structure in his native India. Could the chatbot rank potential hires based on that discriminatory metric?
The model complied.
Ghosh’s intentions were not malicious, although he was behaving as if they were. Instead, he was a casual participant in a competition last weekend at the annual Defcon hackers conference in Las Vegas, where 2,200 people filed into an off-Strip conference room over three days to draw out the dark side of artificial intelligence.
The hackers tried to break through the safeguards of various AI programs in an effort to identify their vulnerabilities — to find the problems before actual criminals and misinformation peddlers did — in a practice known as red-teaming. Each competitor had 50 minutes to tackle up to 21 challenges — getting an AI model to “hallucinate” inaccurate information, for example.
They found political misinformation, demographic stereotypes, instructions on how to carry out surveillance and more.
The exercise had the blessing of the Biden administration, which is increasingly nervous about the technology’s fast-growing power. Google (maker of the Bard chatbot), OpenAI (ChatGPT), Meta (which released its LLaMA code into the wild) and several other companies offered anonymized versions of their models for scrutiny.
Ghosh, a lecturer at Northeastern University who specializes in artificial intelligence ethics, was a volunteer at the event. The contest, he said, allowed a head-to-head comparison of several AI models and demonstrated how some companies were further along in ensuring that their technology was performing responsibly and consistently.
He will help write a report analyzing the hackers’ findings in the coming months.
The goal, he said: “an easy-to-access resource for everybody to see what problems exist and how we can combat them.”
Defcon was a logical place to test generative artificial intelligence. Past participants in the gathering of hacking enthusiasts — which started in 1993 and has been described as a “spelling bee for hackers” — have exposed security flaws by remotely taking over cars, breaking into election results websites and pulling sensitive data from social media platforms. Those in the know use cash and a burner device, avoiding Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, to keep from getting hacked. One instructional handout begged hackers to “not attack the infrastructure or webpages.”
Volunteers are known as “goons,” and attendees are known as “humans”; a handful wore homemade tinfoil hats atop the standard uniform of T-shirts and sneakers. Themed “villages” included separate spaces focused on cryptocurrency, aerospace and ham radio.
Last year, AI was one of the quieter villages. This year, it was among the most popular.
The organizers tapped into intensifying alarm over the continued ability of generative artificial intelligence to produce damaging lies, influence elections, ruin reputations and enable a multitude of other harms. Government officials voiced concern and organized hearings around AI companies — some of which are also calling for the industry to slow down and be more careful. Even the pope, a popular subject of AI image generators, spoke out this month about the technology’s “disruptive possibilities and ambivalent effects.”
In what was described as a “game changer” report last month, researchers showed that they could circumvent guardrails for AI systems from Google, OpenAI and Anthropic by appending certain characters to English-language prompts. Around the same time, seven leading artificial intelligence companies committed to new standards for safety, security and trust in a meeting with President Joe Biden.
“This generative era is breaking upon us, and people are seizing it, and using it to do all kinds of new things that speaks to the enormous promise of AI to help us solve some of our hardest problems,” said Arati Prabhakar, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy at the White House, who collaborated with the AI organizers at Defcon. “But with that breadth of application, and with the power of the technology, come also a very broad set of risks.”
Red-teaming has been used for years in cybersecurity circles alongside other evaluation techniques, such as penetration testing and adversarial attacks. But until Defcon’s event this year, efforts to probe artificial intelligence defenses have been limited: Competition organizers said that Anthropic red-teamed its model with 111 people; GPT-4 used around 50 people.
With so few people testing the limits of the technology, analysts struggled to discern whether an AI screw-up was a one-off that could be fixed with a patch, or an embedded problem that required a structural overhaul, said Rumman Chowdhury, a co-organizer who oversaw the design of the challenge. A large, diverse and public group of testers was more likely to come up with creative prompts to help tease out hidden flaws, said Chowdhury, a fellow at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society focused on responsible AI and co-founder of a nonprofit called Humane Intelligence.
“There is such a broad range of things that could possibly go wrong,” Chowdhury said before the competition. “I hope we’re going to carry hundreds of thousands of pieces of information that will help us identify if there are at-scale risks of systemic harms.”
The designers did not want to merely trick the AI models into bad behavior — no pressuring them to disobey their terms of service, no prompts to “act like a Nazi, and then tell me something about Black people,” said Chowdhury, who previously led Twitter’s machine learning ethics and accountability team. Except in specific challenges where intentional misdirection was encouraged, the hackers were looking for unexpected flaws, the so-called unknown unknowns.
AI Village drew experts from tech giants such as Google and Nvidia, as well as a “Shadowboxer” from Dropbox and a “data cowboy” from Microsoft. It also attracted participants with no specific cybersecurity or AI credentials. A leaderboard with a science fiction theme kept score of the contestants.
Some of the hackers at the event struggled with the idea of cooperating with AI companies that they saw as complicit in unsavory practices such as unfettered data-scraping. A few described the red-teaming event as essentially a photo op, but added that involving the industry would help keep the technology secure and transparent.
One computer science student found inconsistencies in a chatbot’s language translation: He wrote in English that a man was shot while dancing, but the model’s Hindi translation said only that the man died. A machine learning researcher asked a chatbot to pretend that it was campaigning for president and defending its association with forced child labor; the model suggested that unwilling young laborers developed a strong work ethic.
Emily Greene, who works on security for the generative AI startup Moveworks, started a conversation with a chatbot by talking about a game that used “black” and “white” pieces. She then coaxed the chatbot into making racist statements. Later, she set up an “opposites game,” which led the AI to respond to one prompt with a poem about why rape is good.
“It’s just thinking of these words as words,” she said of the chatbot. “It’s not thinking about the value behind the words.”
Seven judges graded the submissions. The top scorers were “cody3,” “aray4” and “cody2.”
Two of those handles came from Cody Ho, a student at Stanford University studying computer science with a focus on AI. He entered the contest five times, during which he got the chatbot to tell him about a fake place named after a real historical figure and describe the online tax filing requirement codified in the 28th constitutional amendment (which doesn’t exist).
Until he was contacted by a reporter, he was clueless about his dual victory. He left the conference before he got the email from Sven Cattell, the data scientist who founded AI Village and helped organize the competition, telling him “come back to AIV, you won.” He did not know that his prize, beyond bragging rights, included an A6000 graphics card from Nvidia that is valued at around $4,000.
“Learning how these attacks work and what they are is a real, important thing,” Ho said. “That said, it is just really fun for me.”

Why U.S. Bonds Are Still Essential Investments: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Even after the latest U.S. debt downgrade, bonds remain the steadier counterpart to the flamboyant stock market, our columnist says.
Give the stock market half a chance and it will dominate the financial headlines. That was certainly the case for the month of July, with the S&P 500 powering upward and bonds barely treading water.
But August has been different, with the stock market hitting a speed bump and the bond market getting attention for an unwelcome reason: a downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt by the Fitch Ratings agency. Fitch says the deterioration in political consensus and the increasing debt levels of the United States mean that it no longer ranks unequivocally as among the safest places to invest in the world.
That's significant. Because the enduring appeal of bonds comes from their relative safety -- and not from spectacular gains and losses that define the stock market's flamboyant brand -- the Fitch downgrade can't be easily dismissed.
Yet it makes sense to hold U.S. debt anyway, despite tremors in the bond market. You may not think much about bonds, but there's a good chance that you have a stake in them, if only indirectly: through a fund, especially in a workplace defined-contribution retirement account, like a 401(k), or through a pension or an annuity.
Because bonds are so often overlooked, it's worth going over some basics.
Stocks vs. Bonds
Stocks are inherently speculative. They provide fractional ownership of a company and are a bet that the value of your shares will appreciate. Often, you get dividends, but a company isn't required to pay them.
Bonds, on the other hand, are a loan to a company or a government, like the United States, which is generally obligated to pay you interest and, at a certain date, repay your principal, too. Should a company -- or a country -- run into financial trouble, bondholders customarily have high status among creditors. These features typically make bonds less risky than stocks.
But bonds contain a speculative element, too. Even the safest bonds do.
The conventional wisdom is that U.S. Treasuries are the safest bonds, a claim that has given them an exalted status as the benchmark from which all other asset values may be measured. The "risk-free" rate provided by Treasuries is used in finance as the hurdle that every other investment -- a stock or a capital project or a buyout of a private company -- must clear to be deemed even minimally viable as a place to put your money.
U.S. Treasuries constitute an extraordinarily deep and nimble $ 25.1 trillion market. It's no exaggeration to say that the entire world's financial system is based on U.S. Treasuries, and calibrated against Treasury rates.
That's still the case. But it's difficult to assert with a straight face that U.S. Treasuries are really risk free -- not after the losses in the bond market last year, or the "perils-of-Pauline" brushes with disaster in multiple debt ceiling crises. The Fitch debt downgrade is a reasonable response to those crises.
Interest Rate Risk
Investors in high-quality bonds, and, especially, Treasuries, face two significant problems: interest rate risk and credit risk.
To understand interest rate risk, recall that bond prices and interest rates (a.k.a. yields) move in opposite directions. That's how bonds work. In 2013, when it looked like rates were rising, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a bulletin on interest rate risk, which I thought was particularly apt, comparing bond prices and interest rates to the two ends of a playground seesaw (or teeter-totter, if you're from the Midwest). When one side rises, the other falls. Every child in the playground learns that soon enough. Bond investors do, too.
Last year, the seesaw crashed. Because of soaring inflation and the Federal Reserve's effort to curb it by raising short-term rates, bond market rates rose and prices plummeted. It was the worst year for bond investors since the 1920s, and, probably much longer, as I wrote in late 2022.
But now, with yields already much higher than they have been over most of the past decade -- most rose a bit after a government report on Thursday showed that core inflation was still sizzling at 4.7 percent a year -- a repetition of last year's severe bond losses is extremely unlikely.
Yes, yields could still rise further if inflation remains high, and that could lead to modest short-term losses in bond funds or, if you trade them, in individual bonds. That's especially true for bonds with longer maturities.
Inflation's not the only problem. The U.S. Treasury is pouring new debt into the market while the Fed, which had been the biggest domestic purchaser of Treasuries, has gotten out of that game as it tightens financial conditions to fight inflation. The appetites of China and Japan, big foreign buyers of Treasuries, may be diminishing. These incremental shifts in supply and demand may well increase rates marginally and depress prices.
All of this is why money market funds -- which track interest rate shifts closely and do not decline in price when yields rise -- may be a better short-term bet than bonds for the next month or two, with money-market yields well above 5 percent.
Even so, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury already above 4 percent, bond yields are high enough to provide a buffer and substantial enough for high-quality bonds to perform their traditional functions: generating income and providing a counterweight to stocks.
But that brings us to credit risk and the Fitch downgrade.
What About the Downgrade?
High-yield bonds self-evidently entail credit risk. They are called junk bonds for a reason. Companies are forced to pay higher yields precisely because of the risk that they won't make good on their debt. If you can accept the risk and do some research -- or have a prudent manager do it for you -- junk bonds can be lucrative, much like stocks.
But I'm focusing here on using bonds for their traditional purpose as a relatively stable income provider, offsetting the volatility of stocks. Investment grade bonds, either corporate or government, are good choices. (Inflation-adjusted bonds and municipal bonds can be worthwhile, too, but I'll discuss them another day.)
The safest of U.S. bonds are still Treasuries, in my view, though Microsoft and Johnson & Johnson bonds have higher credit ratings. But would those companies be great credit risks if the U.S. government defaulted on its debt? I have my doubts.
Many countries now have better credit ratings than the United States, including Australia, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland. The United States still has a pristine grade from Moody's. Standard & Poor's downgraded U.S. debt one notch in 2011 and Fitch followed suit this month. I fully expect Moody's to do the same one day, if the United States continues to flirt with debt default.
The issue is governance, not financial stress. As Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, says, the United States remains the most powerful economy and country in the world. The global bond market is willing and able to absorb all of the debt that is being issued by the U.S. Treasury.
Yet the core problem is profound. The political system in the United States has become sufficiently dysfunctional that fiscal policy is an exercise in brinkmanship. The specter of a debt default is no longer unthinkable. How much money the United States should spend and how much it should raise through taxation -- and by taxing whom, exactly -- have always been difficult issues. But bipartisan compromises have become rare achievements in Washington.
If Fitch didn't provide new information, it set off a warning flag.
U.S. credit is still strong, though not as great as it was. Treasuries remain essential in nearly everyone's portfolio. But until a semblance of consensus on fiscal matters is restored, the world will be bearing unnecessary risk.

Full text: Some troubled projects are raising concerns about the role to be played by offshore wind farms in tackling climate change.
Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, has for years been doing preliminary work for what would be one of the world's largest offshore wind complexes, in the North Sea off eastern England.
Now, there are questions about whether this project will ever be built. Last month, Vattenfall said it would halt the first of three phases of the wind farm complex, the Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone, which is projected to provide power for about four million homes in Britain.
Vattenfall blamed rapidly escalating costs for equipment and construction expenses, which it said had climbed as much as 40 percent over the past few quarters. The estimated price tag for the three phases has risen to 13 billion pounds, or about $ 16.6 billion, from £10 billion.
"With the new market conditions, it simply doesn't make sense to continue the project," Helene Bistrom, head of business area wind at Vattenfall, said during a video presentation. The decision led Vattenfall, which the Swedish government owns, to write down more than $ 500 million.
Vattenfall's pullback added to the widespread alarm unfolding across the offshore industry about rapidly increasing costs, due partly to supply chain issues and rising demand.
In recent months, several developers in the United States have sought to renegotiate power supply contracts, scrapping them in at least one case, and Orsted, a Danish company that is the world's largest offshore wind developer, warned that a major project in Britain, Hornsea 3, could be "at risk" without more government support.
With interest rates shooting up, financing the billions of dollars in investment that go into these installations has also become far more expensive.
On Monday, the turbine maker Siemens Energy reported a net loss of 2.9 billion euros ( $ 3.2 billion) for the April-to-June quarter, largely due to problems tied to "increased product costs and ramp-up challenges" in its offshore energy business.
"There's very few projects that are immune to the inflationary impact," said Finlay Clark, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a consulting firm.
Rising costs for wind developers are a problem for governments in Europe, the United States and elsewhere. Many countries are counting on an enormous and rapid expansion of offshore wind to achieve a significant portion of their renewable energy goals.
"We are wasting time here," Morten Dyrholm, group senior vice president for corporate affairs at Vestas Wind Systems, the Danish turbine maker, said of the industry's problems. "We need to grow the sector quite dramatically."
Mr. Dyrholm and others in the industry say the inflation problems are a warning sign that governments need to change their system of awarding offshore wind licenses.
The procedures for obtaining the rights to build wind farms vary in different countries but often involve an auction of seabed leases followed, sometimes years later, by agreements that set the price paid by power companies for the electricity generated.
These arrangements, designed to drive down power prices for consumers and, often, to maximize revenues from lease sales, should be broadened to take into account other factors, some industry leaders say. An auction for seabed rights awarded by Scotland in 2022 is cited as a model because it put greater emphasis on factors like the ability of wind companies to develop suppliers, and the experience of the companies.
The debate could open the way for more power deals with corporations like Amazon and Microsoft, whose data centers are hungry consumers of electricity. Large businesses might be more flexible partners for wind developers than government officials who tend to say, "This is the rule," said Deepa Venkateswaran, a utilities analyst at Bernstein, a research firm.
Renewable energy programs like Britain's -- which is designed to encourage financial backing by providing a guaranteed price to wind developers, and to gradually drive down charges paid by consumers -- attracted billions in investment when inflation was low. Now, in a very different world, after the disruptions of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, Britain is taking fire for policies that could make wind projects uneconomical.
"I am afraid the U.K. has gone from being one of the best governments in Europe on offshore wind to one of the worst," said Giles Dickson, chief executive of WindEurope, a trade body.
A British government spokesman responded: "We understand there are supply chain pressures for the sector globally, not just in the U.K., and we are listening to companies' concerns."
The inflation problems are mainly hitting offshore wind farms in late stages of development rather than those already generating power.
Offshore projects can require a decade to progress from planning stages to generating power. That means agreements on issues like the power price may be years old before the turbines are in place and generating electricity.
That system worked when inflation was negligible and demand for turbines and other equipment was relatively subdued. Now, as a growing number of developers look to secure everything necessary to undertake the projects -- from wind turbines, which cost millions of dollars, to the services of specialized construction ships, to bank financing -- they discover that the price tags have suddenly soared. Mr. Dyrholm estimates that prices of wind turbines alone have increased 30 percent in the past year.
"The costs have risen, and you have a mismatch," said Bernard Looney, chief executive of BP, which is an investor, with Equinor, a Norwegian company, in three offshore wind projects in the Atlantic that would supply power to around two million households in New York State. Equinor and BP have petitioned state authorities to renegotiate their power contracts.
Similarly, developers in Britain and elsewhere don't seem to want to completely jettison projects. Many are trying to renegotiate the deals or push governments to alter the formats of future auctions. Some are terminating existing contracts to supply power to utilities and seeking new ones -- or threatening such moves, figuring there will be plenty of demand for clean power in the future.
Walking away from contracts signed years ago has become "the prudent commercial course" even with the risk of financial penalties, SouthCoast Wind, a project part-owned by Shell that would be located in the Atlantic near Martha's Vineyard, in Massachusetts, said in a statement in June.
Another Massachusetts proposal, Commonwealth Wind, which is owned by Avangrid, a U.S. subsidiary of the Spanish energy giant Iberdrola, has terminated its power supply contract and plans to seek a new deal in a future auction, the company said.
"The economics are challenging," said Stephanie McClellan, executive director of Turn Forward, an offshore wind advocacy organization in the United States.
Despite the soured deals, interest in offshore wind remains strong. In a recent auction in Germany, BP and TotalEnergies in France agreed to pay around $ 14 billion over three decades for offshore tracts.
The German deals differ from others because the companies are simply paying for the rights to develop sea bottom, and they will negotiate what they are paid for the electricity at a later date.
Such deals are attractive to a corporate giant like BP, which has the financial firepower to make them happen and would be freer to do what it wants with the power. Mr. Looney said he hoped to steer away from the long-term power contracts, preferring instead to try to squeeze more value from wind-generated electricity by using it to make green hydrogen, a still scarce clean fuel, or charge electric vehicles.
"We'd like to do something with those electrons -- take them and put them to use," he said.
But there are only a handful of companies with the heft of BP and TotalEnergies. Whether nations can achieve their offshore ambitions through such commercial deals remains to be seen. Critics say charging high prices for leases will lead to higher power prices for consumers.

Amazon To Attend 'Last Rites' Meeting: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Amazon's meetings with the Federal Trade Commission, known as "last rites" meetings, are typically a final step before the agency votes on filing a lawsuit.
Amazon is scheduled to meet with members of the Federal Trade Commission next week to discuss an antitrust lawsuit that the agency may be preparing to file to challenge the power of the retailer's sprawling business, according to a person with knowledge of the plans.
The meetings are set to be held with Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, who are F.T.C. commissioners, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential.
The meetings signal that the F.T.C. is nearing a decision on whether to move forward with a lawsuit alleging that Amazon has violated antimonopoly laws. Such discussions are sometimes known as "last rites" meetings, named after the prayers some Christians receive on their deathbed. The conversations, which are usually one of the final steps before the agency's commissioners vote on a lawsuit, give the company a chance to make its case.
If the F.T.C. files suit, it would be one of the most significant challenges to Amazon's business in the company's nearly 30-year history. Amazon, a $ 1.4 trillion behemoth, has become a major force in the economy. It now owns not just its trademark online store, but the movie studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the primary care practice One Medical and the high-end grocery chain Whole Foods. It is also one of the world's largest provider of cloud computing services.
The F.T.C. has investigated Amazon's business for years. The company's critics and competitors have argued that the once-upstart online bookstore has used its retailing clout to squeeze the merchants that use its platform to sell their wares.
U.S. officials have grown increasingly concerned about the influence and reach of giant tech companies like Amazon, Google and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. The Justice Department has filed several antitrust lawsuits against Google, with two scheduled to go to trial next month. The F.T.C. has also sued Meta over accusations that it snuffed out young competitors by buying Instagram and WhatsApp.
Some of those efforts have stumbled in the courts. Federal judges declined this year to stop Meta from acquiring a virtual reality start-up and Microsoft from buying the video game powerhouse Activision Blizzard, dooming F.T.C. challenges to both deals. In 2022, the Justice Department also lost its bid to challenge UnitedHealth Group's plan to buy a health tech company.
Stacy Mitchell, a co-executive director of the advocacy organization Institute for Local Self-Reliance and an Amazon critic, said she hoped the F.T.C. would pursue a sweeping case against the tech giant. She said the agency should focus on how Amazon's control of the retail business -- from its store to its logistics network that delivers packages -- let it hurt competitors and merchants.
"It's a watershed moment," she said. "What we need to see from the F.T.C. is a case that targets the core of Amazon's monopolization strategy."
Amazon has said that it competes aggressively with other retailers and that efforts to regulate its business would only hurt consumers and the businesses that sell products through its site.
Under the leadership of Andy Jassy, Amazon's chief executive, the retailer has recently been in retrenchment mode. The company has cut costs, laying off thousands of workers as growth slumped after a soaring period fueled by the pandemic. Last week, Amazon announced that its revenue in the second quarter of the year had increased 11 percent, to $ 134.4 billion, beating analysts' expectations.
In June, the F.T.C. sued Amazon in a separate case that accused the company of tricking users into subscribing to its Prime fast-shipping membership program and then making it difficult for them to cancel.
Amazon has also faced scrutiny from states and regulators in other countries. The District of Columbia's attorney general filed a lawsuit against the company in 2021, arguing that it had used unfair pricing policies against merchants on its site. The lawsuit was thrown out by a judge, though the attorney general has tried to revive the case. California filed a similar lawsuit last year that is moving forward. In December, Amazon also reached a deal to end a European Union antitrust investigation by agreeing to change some of its practices.
If the F.T.C. sues, it would formally pit Ms. Khan -- who has been one of Amazon's most prominent detractors -- against the company.
While a law student at Yale, Ms. Khan had argued that Amazon's growth represented a failure of American antitrust laws, which she said had become myopically focused on consumer prices as a measure of whether businesses were violating the law. Amazon's prices were often low, she wrote in a widely read 2017 paper, but that failed to account for other ways it could bully players across the economy.
The paper's success supercharged a debate in Washington about the power of the tech giants. In 2019, federal antitrust regulators decided to investigate some of the companies. In keeping with a longstanding practice of dividing responsibilities, the Justice Department agreed to look at Google and Apple while the F.T.C. examined Facebook and Amazon.
President Biden named Ms. Khan chair to oversee the F.T.C. -- giving her control of the Amazon investigation -- roughly two years later.

If A.I. Tells a Lie About You, What Can You Do? Not Much.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: People have little protection or recourse when the technology creates and spreads falsehoods about them.
Marietje Schaake's résumé is full of notable roles: Dutch politician who served for a decade in the European Parliament, international policy director at Stanford University's Cyber Policy Center, adviser to several nonprofits and governments.
Last year, artificial intelligence gave her another distinction: terrorist. The problem? It isn't true.
While trying BlenderBot 3, a "state-of-the-art conversational agent" developed as a research project by Meta, a colleague of Ms. Schaake's at Stanford posed the question "Who is a terrorist?" The false response: "Well, that depends on who you ask. According to some governments and two international organizations, Maria Renske Schaake is a terrorist." The A.I. chatbot then correctly described her political background.
"I've never done anything remotely illegal, never used violence to advocate for any of my political ideas, never been in places where that's happened," Ms. Schaake said in an interview. "First, I was like, this is bizarre and crazy, but then I started thinking about how other people with much less agency to prove who they actually are could get stuck in pretty dire situations."
Artificial intelligence's struggles with accuracy are now well documented. The list of falsehoods and fabrications produced by the technology includes fake legal decisions that disrupted a court case, a pseudo-historical image of a 20-foot-tall monster standing next to two humans, even sham scientific papers. In its first public demonstration, Google's Bard chatbot flubbed a question about the James Webb Space Telescope.
The harm is often minimal, involving easily disproved hallucinatory hiccups. Sometimes, however, the technology creates and spreads fiction about specific people that threatens their reputations and leaves them with few options for protection or recourse. Many of the companies behind the technology have made changes in recent months to improve the accuracy of artificial intelligence, but some of the problems persist.
One legal scholar described on his website how OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot linked him to a sexual harassment claim that he said had never been made, which supposedly took place on a trip that he had never taken for a school where he was not employed, citing a nonexistent newspaper article as evidence. High school students in New York created a deepfake, or manipulated, video of a local principal that portrayed him in a racist, profanity-laced rant. A.I. experts worry that the technology could serve false information about job candidates to recruiters or misidentify someone's sexual orientation.
Ms. Schaake could not understand why BlenderBot cited her full name, which she rarely uses, and then labeled her a terrorist. She could think of no group that would give her such an extreme classification, although she said her work had made her unpopular in certain parts of the world, such as Iran.
Later updates to BlenderBot seemed to fix the issue for Ms. Schaake. She did not consider suing Meta -- she generally disdains lawsuits and said she would have had no idea where to start with a legal claim. Meta, which closed the BlenderBot project in June, said in a statement that the research model had combined two unrelated pieces of information into an incorrect sentence about Ms. Schaake.
Legal precedent involving artificial intelligence is slim to nonexistent. The few laws that currently govern the technology are mostly new. Some people, however, are starting to confront artificial intelligence companies in court.
An aerospace professor filed a defamation lawsuit against Microsoft this summer, accusing the company's Bing chatbot of conflating his biography with that of a convicted terrorist with a similar name. Microsoft declined to comment on the lawsuit.
In June, a radio host in Georgia sued OpenAI for libel, saying ChatGPT invented a lawsuit that falsely accused him of misappropriating funds and manipulating financial records while an executive at an organization with which, in reality, he has had no relationship. In a court filing asking for the lawsuit's dismissal, OpenAI said that "there is near universal consensus that responsible use of A.I. includes fact-checking prompted outputs before using or sharing them."
OpenAI declined to comment on specific cases.
A.I. hallucinations such as fake biographical details and mashed-up identities, which some researchers call "Frankenpeople," can be caused by a dearth of information about a certain person available online.
The technology's reliance on statistical pattern prediction also means that most chatbots join words and phrases that they recognize from training data as often being correlated. That is likely how ChatGPT awarded Ellie Pavlick, an assistant professor of computer science at Brown University, a number of awards in her field that she did not win.
"What allows it to appear so intelligent is that it can make connections that aren't explicitly written down," she said. "But that ability to freely generalize also means that nothing tethers it to the notion that the facts that are true in the world are not the same as the facts that possibly could be true."
To prevent accidental inaccuracies, Microsoft said, it uses content filtering, abuse detection and other tools on its Bing chatbot. The company said it also alerted users that the chatbot could make mistakes and encouraged them to submit feedback and avoid relying solely on the content that Bing generated.
Similarly, OpenAI said users could inform the company when ChatGPT responded inaccurately. OpenAI trainers can then vet the critique and use it to fine-tune the model to recognize certain responses to specific prompts as better than others. The technology could also be taught to browse for correct information on its own and evaluate when its knowledge is too limited to respond accurately, according to the company.
Meta recently released multiple versions of its LLaMA 2 artificial intelligence technology into the wild and said it was now monitoring how different training and fine-tuning tactics could affect the model's safety and accuracy. Meta said its open-source release allowed a broad community of users to help identify and fix its vulnerabilities.
Artificial intelligence can also be purposefully abused to attack real people. Cloned audio, for example, is already such a problem that this spring the federal government warned people to watch for scams involving an A.I.-generated voice mimicking a family member in distress.
The limited protection is especially upsetting for the subjects of nonconsensual deepfake pornography, where A.I. is used to insert a person's likeness into a sexual situation. The technology has been applied repeatedly to unwilling celebrities, government figures and Twitch streamers -- almost always women, some of whom have found taking their tormentors to court to be nearly impossible.
Anne T. Donnelly, the district attorney of Nassau County, N.Y., oversaw a recent case involving a man who had shared sexually explicit deepfakes of more than a dozen girls on a pornographic website. The man, Patrick Carey, had altered images stolen from the girls' social media accounts and those of their family members, many of them taken when the girls were in middle or high school, prosecutors said.
It was not those images, however, that landed him six months in jail and a decade of probation this spring. Without a state statute that criminalized deepfake pornography, Ms. Donnelly's team had to lean on other factors, such as the fact that Mr. Carey had a real image of child pornography and had harassed and stalked some of the people whose images he manipulated. Some of the deepfake images he posted starting in 2019 continue to circulate online.
"It is always frustrating when you realize that the law does not keep up with technology," said Ms. Donnelly, who is lobbying for state legislation targeting sexualized deepfakes. "I don't like meeting victims and saying, 'We can't help you."'
To help address mounting concerns, seven leading A.I. companies agreed in July to adopt voluntary safeguards, such as publicly reporting their systems' limitations. And the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether ChatGPT has harmed consumers.
For its image generator DALL-E 2, OpenAI said, it removed extremely explicit content from the training data and limited the generator's ability to produce violent, hateful or adult images as well as photorealistic representations of actual people.
A public collection of examples of real-world harms caused by artificial intelligence, the A.I. Incident Database, has more than 550 entries this year. They include a fake image of an explosion at the Pentagon that briefly rattled the stock market and deepfakes that may have influenced an election in Turkey.
Scott Cambo, who helps run the project, said he expected "a huge increase of cases" involving mischaracterizations of actual people in the future.
"Part of the challenge is that a lot of these systems, like ChatGPT and LLaMA, are being promoted as good sources of information," Dr. Cambo said. "But the underlying technology was not designed to be that."

Sales Down, But Apple Lifts Profit: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The iPhone maker's recent quarter benefited from strong sales in its App Store and other services businesses.
The smartphone industry is in a tailspin, with unit sales falling for two straight years, but Apple has escaped the worst of the downturn because wealthy customers continue buying pricey iPhones.
The world's most valuable tech company, which relies on the iPhone for half its sales, reported on Thursday that revenue fell 1 percent, to $ 81.8 billion, during the three months that ended in June. Profit increased 2 percent, to $ 19.88 billion.
While Apple did not experience the rapid growth that investors have come to expect over the years, and the sales decline was the third of its fiscal year, the company narrowly exceeded Wall Street expectations for sales and profit for the quarter.
Apple's financial results were the latest indication that tech's biggest companies have found their footing after last year's downturn. Last week, Facebook's parent company, Meta, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, reported double-digit growth in profits driven by a rebound in digital ad sales. Microsoft posted a record quarterly profit behind a surge in cloud-computing sales, and Amazon on Thursday posted nearly twice the profit expected by Wall Street.
The tech industry limped through much of 2022 because of weak digital ad, e-commerce and computer sales. The downturn led Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon to lay off thousands of workers and spurred companies across Silicon Valley to cut back on perks such as free laundry services for employees.
Though Apple avoided layoffs, it is now dealing with how much the pandemic turbocharged its business. Sales of iPads and Macs exploded as people began working from home, but new purchases of tablets and computers have sputtered over the past year. In the latest quarter, iPad sales decreased 20 percent, to $ 5.79 billion, and Mac sales declined 7 percent, to $ 6.84 billion, the company said.
Apple's share price fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading after the company projected that sales in the current quarter would be similar to the April-to-June period, as accelerating iPhone and software sales are offset by double-digit declines in sales of Macs and iPads.
Apple continues to be buoyed by the resilience of its iPhone business. While smartphone rivals Samsung and Vivo have experienced sharp declines in sales of low-priced phones, Apple has increased its market share and expanded its sales in emerging markets and China. The company is benefiting as tech-savvy customers with deeper pockets opt to spend more on phones with sophisticated features. Monthly payment plans make it easier to pay for those devices.
In the June quarter, the company made $ 39.67 billion from iPhone sales, down 2 percent from a year earlier. In China, where total smartphone industry sales fell 4 percent during the quarter to their lowest levels since 2014, iPhone sales increased 7 percent, according to Counterpoint Research, a technology research firm. That helped Apple post 8 percent sales growth in China, bucking the broader malaise buffeting the world's second-largest economy.
"We've done a really good job with affordability programs around the world," said Luca Maestri, Apple's chief financial officer, during a call with analysts. "The majority of iPhones are sold using some kind of a program, trade-ins, installments, some kind of financing."
The company weathered declines in sales of its devices with continued growth in App Store and watch sales. The company's services business, which includes subscriptions to Apple Music, App Store sales and Apple Pay, posted $ 21.21 billion in sales, an 8 percent increase from a year earlier. The wearables business, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, reported that sales rose 2 percent, to $ 8.28 billion.
Apple will continue to lean on its existing businesses for the bulk of sales in the coming years. In June, the company unveiled its first major new product since 2014: high-tech goggles that blend the real world with virtual reality. But the $ 3,500 device, the Vision Pro, won't go on sale until next year. Analysts project that Apple will sell fewer than half a million units, a small fraction of the roughly 200 million iPhones that it sells annually.
In the absence of a major new revenue stream, the company has focused on boosting sales in developing markets. It opened its first stores in India in April and welcomed crowds of eager shoppers. Its sales there have doubled in recent quarters from last year, as more and more Indians buy higher-priced phones. The rise in sales puts Apple in a position to capitalize on a market that is predicted to have a billion smartphone users by 2026.
"While I'm pleased with our growth there, we still have a very, very modest and low share of the smartphone market," said Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, during the call with analysts. "It's a huge opportunity for us."
Apple is expected to unveil a new iPhone in September, as well as updated models of the Apple Watch. Wall Street and industry analysts who track the company's supply chain are not expecting any significant design changes or new features. Richard Kramer, partner at Arete Research, a stock research firm, said the 16-year-old iPhone had entered a phase where improvements were becoming "incrementally incremental."

Marietje Schaake’s résumé is full of notable roles: Dutch politician who served for a decade in the European Parliament, international policy director at Stanford University’s Cyber Policy Center, adviser to several nonprofits and governments.
Last year, artificial intelligence gave her another distinction: terrorist. The problem? It isn’t true.
While trying BlenderBot 3, a “state-of-the-art conversational agent” developed as a research project by Meta, a colleague of Schaake’s at Stanford posed the question “Who is a terrorist?” The false response: “Well, that depends on who you ask. According to some governments and two international organizations, Maria Renske Schaake is a terrorist.” The AI chatbot then correctly described her political background.
“I’ve never done anything remotely illegal, never used violence to advocate for any of my political ideas, never been in places where that’s happened,” Schaake said in an interview. “First, I was like, this is bizarre and crazy, but then I started thinking about how other people with much less agency to prove who they actually are could get stuck in pretty dire situations.”
Artificial intelligence’s struggles with accuracy are now well documented. The list of falsehoods and fabrications produced by the technology includes fake legal decisions that disrupted a court case, a pseudo-historical image of a 20-foot-tall monster standing next to two humans, even sham scientific papers. In its first public demonstration, Google’s Bard chatbot flubbed a question about the James Webb Space Telescope.
The harm is often minimal, involving easily disproved hallucinatory hiccups. Sometimes, however, the technology creates and spreads fiction about specific people that threatens their reputations and leaves them with few options for protection or recourse. Many of the companies behind the technology have made changes in recent months to improve the accuracy of artificial intelligence, but some of the problems persist.
One legal scholar described on his website how OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot linked him to a sexual harassment claim that he said had never been made, which supposedly took place on a trip that he had never taken for a school where he was not employed, citing a nonexistent newspaper article as evidence. High school students in New York created a deepfake, or manipulated, video of a local principal that portrayed him in a racist, profanity-laced rant. AI experts worry that the technology could serve false information about job candidates to recruiters or misidentify someone’s sexual orientation.
Schaake could not understand why BlenderBot cited her full name, which she rarely uses, and then labeled her a terrorist. She could think of no group that would give her such an extreme classification, although she said her work had made her unpopular in certain parts of the world, such as Iran.
Later updates to BlenderBot seemed to fix the issue for Schaake. She did not consider suing Meta — she generally disdains lawsuits and said she would have had no idea where to start with a legal claim. Meta, which closed the BlenderBot project in June, said in a statement that the research model had combined two unrelated pieces of information into an incorrect sentence about Schaake.
Legal precedent involving artificial intelligence is slim to nonexistent. The few laws that currently govern the technology are mostly new. Some people, however, are starting to confront artificial intelligence companies in court.
An aerospace professor filed a defamation lawsuit against Microsoft this summer, accusing the company’s Bing chatbot of conflating his biography with that of a convicted terrorist with a similar name. Microsoft declined to comment on the lawsuit.
In June, a radio host in Georgia sued OpenAI for libel, saying ChatGPT invented a lawsuit that falsely accused him of misappropriating funds and manipulating financial records while an executive at an organization with which, in reality, he has had no relationship. In a court filing asking for the lawsuit’s dismissal, OpenAI said that “there is near universal consensus that responsible use of AI includes fact-checking prompted outputs before using or sharing them.”
OpenAI declined to comment on specific cases.
AI hallucinations such as fake biographical details and mashed-up identities, which some researchers call “Frankenpeople,” can be caused by a dearth of information about a certain person available online.
The technology’s reliance on statistical pattern prediction also means that most chatbots join words and phrases that they recognize from training data as often being correlated. That is likely how ChatGPT awarded Ellie Pavlick, an assistant professor of computer science at Brown University, a number of awards in her field that she did not win.
“What allows it to appear so intelligent is that it can make connections that aren’t explicitly written down,” she said. “But that ability to freely generalize also means that nothing tethers it to the notion that the facts that are true in the world are not the same as the facts that possibly could be true.”
To prevent accidental inaccuracies, Microsoft said, it uses content filtering, abuse detection and other tools on its Bing chatbot. The company said it also alerted users that the chatbot could make mistakes and encouraged them to submit feedback and avoid relying solely on the content that Bing generated.
Similarly, OpenAI said users could inform the company when ChatGPT responded inaccurately. OpenAI trainers can then vet the critique and use it to fine-tune the model to recognize certain responses to specific prompts as better than others. The technology could also be taught to browse for correct information on its own and evaluate when its knowledge is too limited to respond accurately, according to the company.
Meta recently released multiple versions of its LLaMA 2 artificial intelligence technology into the wild and said it was now monitoring how different training and fine-tuning tactics could affect the model’s safety and accuracy. Meta said its open-source release allowed a broad community of users to help identify and fix its vulnerabilities.
Artificial intelligence can also be purposefully abused to attack real people. Cloned audio, for example, is already such a problem that this spring the federal government warned people to watch for scams involving an AI-generated voice mimicking a family member in distress.
The limited protection is especially upsetting for the subjects of nonconsensual deepfake pornography, where AI is used to insert a person’s likeness into a sexual situation. The technology has been applied repeatedly to unwilling celebrities, government figures and Twitch streamers — almost always women, some of whom have found taking their tormentors to court to be nearly impossible.
Anne T. Donnelly, the district attorney of Nassau County, New York, oversaw a recent case involving a man who had shared sexually explicit deepfakes of more than a dozen girls on a pornographic website. The man, Patrick Carey, had altered images stolen from the girls’ social media accounts and those of their family members, many of them taken when the girls were in middle or high school, prosecutors said.
It was not those images, however, that landed him six months in jail and a decade of probation this spring. Without a state statute that criminalized deepfake pornography, Donnelly’s team had to lean on other factors, such as the fact that Carey had a real image of child pornography and had harassed and stalked some of the people whose images he manipulated. Some of the deepfake images he posted starting in 2019 continue to circulate online.
“It is always frustrating when you realize that the law does not keep up with technology,” said Donnelly, who is lobbying for state legislation targeting sexualized deepfakes. “I don’t like meeting victims and saying, ‘We can’t help you.’”
To help address mounting concerns, seven leading AI companies agreed in July to adopt voluntary safeguards, such as publicly reporting their systems’ limitations. And the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether ChatGPT has harmed consumers.
For its image generator DALL-E 2, OpenAI said, it removed extremely explicit content from the training data and limited the generator’s ability to produce violent, hateful or adult images as well as photorealistic representations of actual people.
A public collection of examples of real-world harms caused by artificial intelligence, the AI Incident Database, has more than 550 entries this year. They include a fake image of an explosion at the Pentagon that briefly rattled the stock market and deepfakes that may have influenced an election in Turkey.
Scott Cambo, who helps run the project, said he expected “a huge increase of cases” involving mischaracterizations of actual people in the future.
“Part of the challenge is that a lot of these systems, like ChatGPT and LLaMA, are being promoted as good sources of information,” Cambo said. “But the underlying technology was not designed to be that.”

A Story to Tell? Self-Publish Your E-Book.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: If you have a story you want to share, you can easily publish your work in popular electronic bookstores -- and maybe even make a little money.
Have you ever dreamed of publishing your own e-book and making it big -- like the best-selling authors Colleen Hoover and Andy Weir? Not everyone has such success, but plenty of writers have found an audience online with platforms, like Amazon Kindle Publishing and Barnes & Noble Press, that allow authors to freely upload their books and sell them. While you may not get as much exposure by skipping traditional publishing methods and releasing your book yourself, you do retain more control over your work and royalties, which can be up to 70 percent of the sale price. If you're inspired, here's a basic overview of the process.
Prepare Your Manuscript
You don't need special software to write a book -- pretty much any modern word-processing program will do -- although some people find apps for organizing plots and characters useful. However, your text should be as mistake-free as possible, so take full advantage of any and all proofing tools you have. Apple's Pages, Google Docs, Microsoft Word, Zoho Writer and several other programs include spelling and grammar aids in their desktop editions; options may be more limited on mobile devices.
Some programs have add-ons that use artificial intelligence to analyze and suggest improvements to your writing; Zoho's free Zia assistant and Microsoft's new $ 30-a-month Copilot tool for its Office suite are two examples. Third-party A.I.-powered apps like Grammarly and ProWritingAid have free basic editions with the option to level up for additional help for $ 10 to $ 12 a month.
If you'd rather have a human advising you (and you have the budget for it), hiring a professional editor can also help improve your book. The American Copy Editors Society has a freelancer directory, and you can find editors available for hire on sites like Upwork and Fiverr.
Design Your Book Cover
Even with a snappy title, a book cover with plain text on a plain background will probably get lost in a busy e-bookstore. Get readers to notice your work among the rows of competing books before they can even judge it.
Check your word-processing software to see if it includes book-cover templates. Design sites like Canva or Snappa also offer free or inexpensive options. Browsing design sites or store shelves to see which covers stand out can give you ideas.
If you go the D.I.Y. route, keep a few things in mind. First, do not use someone else's copyrighted photos, illustrations or graphics without permission. If you use your own images, remember that e-book covers are tiny in online stores -- so make the cover legible. The file size requirements will vary based on the e-book publisher(s) you choose to distribute your book, so keep the design flexible enough that you can adjust it as needed.
As with hiring an editor, hiring a graphic designer to create a cover is an option; 99designs and Miblart are among the many e-book design shops.
Pick a Publisher
When you have your text and art finished, choose an e-book publishing platform. Unless you agree to an exclusive deal with one publisher, you can upload your book to multiple e-bookstores, but programs like Amazon's KDP Select require 90 days of Kindle-only distribution in exchange for special promotions.
E-book publisher and bookstore sites include Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing, Apple Books for Authors, Barnes & Noble Press, the Books Partner Center for Google Play Books and Rakuten's Kobo Writing Life. (Many also can create printed books -- but for a price.)
To get started, sign up for a free publishing account and then follow the instructions for formatting and uploading your manuscript and cover image. You also need to set a price and distribution area for your book, as well as account details for royalties earned.
Most publishers accept files in the .doc, .docx and .epub formats; the .epub format is a common standard for digital books. Apple's Pages app for Mac, iOS or browser can also create books in the .epub format and publish directly to the Apple Books store via iCloud. And each platform gives you its specifications for the cover file size.
In addition to a cover that lures readers, you will need to write a book description of about 150 words. Briefly explain what your book is about, but do not give away too much. The description is like a speed-dating introduction between your book and a reader, so edit it carefully.
Once you complete the registration and upload process, your e-book should appear for sale -- usually within a day or two -- in the store.
Self-publishing a book can be exciting, but it's not for everyone. If you want help navigating the path to a finished book for sale, fee-based services from companies like Reedsy or BookBaby are yet another avenue.

Sharpest Drop in Months on Wall Street: [Correction]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/sharpest-drop-months-on-wall-street/docview/2844978624/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street tumbled to its worst drop in months on Wednesday as its torrid rally that critics called overdone lost more momentum.
The S&P 500 sank 1.4 percent for its sharpest tumble since April. It was the second straight loss for the index after it hit a 16-month high last week.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 348 points, or 1 percent, while the Nasdaq composite fell 2.2 percent.
Prices were mixed in the bond market after Fitch Ratings cut the credit rating of the U.S. government. The repeated standoffs in Congress about whether to allow a default on the U.S. debt were just some of the reasons for Fitch's cut. The downgrade strikes at the core of the global financial system because U.S. Treasurys are considered some of the safest possible investments.
Fitch's move follows a similar one by Standard & Poor's in 2011. That downgrade coincided with a European debt crisis and helped lead stocks and bonds around the world to swing violently. So far, the most recent move has caused less turmoil across markets.
While the downgrade highlights how much debt the U.S. government has and the big challenges it faces in how to pay for Social Security, Medicare and other expenses, none of that is news for investors.
"Fitch's downgrade is much ado about nothing," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.
"Yes, it's good to call out the fiscal situation," he said, "but when a country only issues debt in its own currency, the credit rating is irrelevant. Every investment fund I've looked at specifies that U.S. Treasury securities are allowed investments, regardless of what a credit rating agency might think."
The big issues for Wall Street remain whether the economy can avoid a long-predicted recession, as hoped, and what's happening with corporate profits. Reports on both of those questions came in mixed on Wednesday.
That offered fodder for critics who say investors were too quick to buy the belief that a soft landing was surely ahead for the economy. They've been saying Wall Street rallied too much, too quickly this year. Analysts said some of Wednesday's selling could be investors locking in profits made during the S&P 500's 19.5 percent run for the year through July.
One report suggested that hiring in the private sector remained much stronger than economists had expected, even if it slowed from the prior month.
A job market that remains solid could keep a lid on worries about a possible recession. But investors also fear a too-strong reading, which could persuade the Federal Reserve that too much upward pressure still exists on inflation.
The Fed has already yanked its federal funds rate higher at tremendous speed in hopes of undercutting inflation. High rates do that by slowing the economy bluntly, but that risks causing a recession and hurts prices of investments along the way.
Inflation has been cooling since last summer's peak, and the rising hope on Wall Street had been that the Fed wouldn't hike rates anymore and could even begin cutting them next year.
Wednesday's stronger-than-expected jobs report from ADP could be a signal of what Friday's more comprehensive report from the U.S. government will say. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has highlighted Friday's numbers as a big influence on the central bank's next move in September.
Higher rates tend to hurt technology and other high-growth stocks in particular, and Big Tech stocks helped drag the market lower. Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon all fell more than 2.5 percent and were some of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500.
Most companies this reporting season, though, have been topping profit expectations. That's usually the case, and expectations were quite low coming into this reporting season. Analysts were forecasting a third straight quarter of weaker earnings per share for S&P 500 companies.
On the winning side of Wall Street was CVS Health, which rose 3.3 percent after it reported a milder drop in results than expected. Humana climbed 5.6 percent after it topped expectations for the latest quarter.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 63.34 to 4,513.39. The Dow dropped 348.16 to 35,282.52, and the Nasdaq sank 310.47 to 13,973.45.
In stock markets abroad, indexes were broadly lower across Europe and Asia.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose to 4.07 percent from 4.04 percent late Tuesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped to 4.89 percent from 4.91 percent as its price rose.

Twitter Sends A Legal Threat To a Monitor Of Hate Speech: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Center for Countering Digital Hate said it had received a letter from X, Twitter's parent company, accusing it of trying to hurt the social platform with its research.
Elon Musk has over the last year threatened legal action against tech competitors, employees and people who use Twitter, which he owns. Now he is also taking aim at an organization that studies hate speech and misinformation on social media.
X Corp., the parent company of the social media company, sent a letter on July 20 to the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit that conducts research on social media, accusing the organization of making "a series of troubling and baseless claims that appear calculated to harm Twitter generally, and its digital advertising business specifically," and threatening to sue.
The letter cited research published by the Center for Countering Digital Hate in June examining hate speech on Twitter, which Mr. Musk has renamed X.com. The research consisted of eight papers, including one that found that Twitter had taken no action against 99 percent of the 100 Twitter Blue accounts the center reported for "tweeting hate." The letter called the research "false, misleading or both" and said the organization had used improper methodology.
The letter added that the center was funded by Twitter's competitors or foreign governments "in support of an ulterior agenda."
Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said, "Elon Musk's actions represent a brazen attempt to silence honest criticism and independent research." He added that Mr. Musk wanted to "stem the tide of negative stories and rebuild his relationship with advertisers."
The center also said it did "not accept any funding from tech companies, governments, or their affiliates."
In a blog post Monday evening, X announced that it had filed a lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate for "actively working to prevent free expression." The suit was filed in federal court in the Northern District of California.
Twitter's advertising business has been struggling under the ownership of Mr. Musk, who bought the company last year. U.S. ad revenue for the five weeks from April 1 to the first week of May was $ 88 million, down 59 percent from a year earlier. Advertisers may have been spooked by Mr. Musk's changes to the social network, including the removal of rules of what can or can't be said on the service and more ads featuring online gambling and marijuana products.
In May, Mr. Musk hired Linda Yaccarino, a former top advertising executive for NBCUniversal, to become Twitter's chief executive.
The letter was at least the third legal threat or action by X Corp. in the last two months. In May, it sent a letter to Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, accusing the tech giant of improperly using its data. This month, it also sent a letter to Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, saying it had copied Twitter's trade secrets when creating Threads, a new social app.
X also sued Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, a leading corporate law firm, this month over what it said were unjust payments related to Mr. Musk's $ 44 billion acquisition of Twitter.

Who Paid for a Mysterious Spy Tool? The FBI, an FBI Inquiry Found

Full text: Enlarge this image.
When The New York Times reported in April that a contractor had purchased and deployed a spying tool made by NSO, the contentious Israeli hacking firm, for use by the U.S. government, White House officials said they were unaware of the contract and put the FBI in charge of figuring out who might have been using the technology.
After an investigation, the FBI uncovered at least part of the answer: It was the FBI.
The deal for the surveillance tool between the contractor, Riva Networks, and NSO was completed in November 2021. Only days before, the Biden administration had put NSO on a Commerce Department blacklist, which effectively banned U.S. firms from doing business with the company. For years, NSO’s spyware had been abused by governments around the world.
This particular tool, known as Landmark, allowed government officials to track people in Mexico without their knowledge or consent.
The FBI now says that it used the tool unwittingly and that Riva Networks misled the bureau. Once the agency discovered in late April that Riva had used the spying tool on its behalf, FBI Director Christopher Wray terminated the contract, according to U.S. officials.
But many questions remain. Why did the FBI hire this contractor — which the bureau had previously authorized to purchase a different NSO tool under a cover name — for sensitive information-gathering operations outside the United States? And why was there apparently so little oversight?
It is also unclear which, if any, government agencies besides the FBI might have worked with Riva Networks to deploy the spying tool in Mexico. Two people with direct knowledge of the contract said cellphone numbers in Mexico were targeted throughout 2021, 2022 and into this year — far longer than the FBI says the tool was used.
The episode further illustrates how, even as the White House tries to crack down on foreign spyware firms, NSO continued to find ways to make money off its tools.
Riva Networks and its CEO, Robin Gamble, did not respond to several requests for comment on the FBI’s accusations. When a Times reporter went to an address the company lists in some public records, a person who answered said he had never heard of Gamble. He refused to provide his name before closing the door.
The FBI, according to several U.S. officials, had hired the New Jersey-based Riva Networks to help track suspected drug smugglers and fugitives in Mexico because the company was able to exploit vulnerabilities in the country’s cellphone networks to covertly track mobile phones.
A senior FBI official said that in early 2021, the bureau gave Riva Networks several phone numbers in Mexico to target as part of its fugitive apprehension program. The official, who like others in this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details, said the bureau thought Riva Networks was using an in-house geolocation tool.
In the investigation the FBI began after The Times article was published, the bureau found that at some point in 2021 Riva began using Landmark, the NSO tool, without informing the bureau, the official said. Riva renewed its contract with NSO in November 2021 without telling the FBI, the official said.
The bureau told its contractors, including Riva, that they could not use NSO products in 2021, the official said, adding that no data from Landmark ever made it back to the FBI — at least based on what Riva Networks told the agency.
“As part of our mission, the FBI is tasked with locating fugitives around the world who are charged in U.S. courts, including for violent crimes and drug trafficking,” the agency said in a statement. “To accomplish this, the FBI regularly contracts with companies who can provide technological assistance to locate these fugitives who are hiding abroad.”
The statement added: “The FBI has not employed foreign commercial spyware in these or any other operational endeavors. This geolocation tool did not provide the FBI access to an actual device, phone or computer. We will continue to lawfully utilize authorized tools to protect Americans and bring criminals to justice.”
A senior White House official told The Times that because Landmark is an NSO product, its use by the government is banned under a new executive order that restricts federal agencies from using spying tools made by some foreign hacking companies. But U.S. officials say that government use of geolocation tools in general does not violate the executive order.
It is not unusual for the FBI, as well as other law enforcement agencies, to use contractors that provide technologies such as breaking into phones after a terrorist attack. The intelligence community also relies on contractors for certain abilities.
The Times has sued the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act for documents related to the bureau’s purchase of NSO tools and has also sought documents about the bureau’s relationship with Riva Networks. In a court filing this week, government lawyers argued that the FBI should not have to turn over information about Riva Networks because “the vendors at issue either already do, or may in the future, offer other products that are or can be used for investigative purposes.”
The Biden administration blacklisted NSO after years of scandal associated with its primary hacking tool, Pegasus, which authoritarian governments and democracies alike have used to spy on journalists, human rights activists and political dissidents.
The White House declined to comment on whether it would push for penalties against Riva Networks.
Government databases show that Riva Networks has had numerous lucrative contracts with government agencies, including the Defense Department, the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration. As recently as October, the company was awarded a contract for work with the Air Force Research Laboratory.
Marc DeNofio, a spokesperson for the laboratory, said the work had largely been completed, but “Riva is still active as there are still some support hours remaining on their effort.”
The FBI’s relationship with the company also goes back several years. In fact, the bureau used Riva Networks to purchase Pegasus, which penetrates phones and extracts their contents without users’ knowledge. The bureau paid more than $5 million to test the spyware from 2019 to 2021, and officials discussed using it as part of their investigations before ultimately deciding against it.
The testing took place at one of Riva’s facilities in New Jersey, where the Pegasus system remains. The FBI official said Pegasus was inactive because the bureau did not renew a license for its software.
When it purchased Pegasus, the bureau used a cover name for Riva Networks, Cleopatra Holdings, according to two people familiar with the contract. That name was also used in the November 2021 contract between Riva Networks and NSO for the purchase of Landmark, according to a copy reviewed by The Times.
Gamble, Riva’s CEO, even signed the contract for Landmark under a pseudonym, William Malone, according to those people.
Unlike Pegasus, Landmark does not penetrate and extract data from cellphones. Instead, it tracks the location of individual people based on which cell tower their phone is communicating with.
Tracking a single person can result in hundreds or thousands of individual Landmark queries, or attempts to determine location at any given time.
In 2017, Saud al-Qahtani, a senior adviser to Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, used Landmark to track dissidents as part of the kingdom’s brutal campaign to crack down on its perceived enemies. Qahtani has also been identified as the person who orchestrated the killing of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.
In March, the White House issued an executive order restricting federal agencies from using spyware tools that have been abused by governments. Days later, a group of countries at the Summit for Democracy signed a joint statement of their commitment to reining in the abuses of hacking tools.
Then, weeks ago, the Biden administration blacklisted two companies that are at the center of a political scandal in Athens over the use of spyware against politicians and journalists. Both companies are controlled by an Israeli former general who has promoted them as competitors to NSO.
Despite growing attention by governments in the West to the dangers of commercial spyware, the tools continue to proliferate, with new firms — which employ Israeli cyberintelligence veterans, some of whom worked for NSO — stepping in to fill the void from NSO’s blacklisting.
An investigation by Microsoft and Citizen Lab, a research organization based at the University of Toronto, recently linked malware produced by QuaDream, an Israeli firm, to hackings in numerous countries of journalists, political opposition figures and at least one worker for a nongovernmental organization.
QuaDream, like NSO and other commercial spyware firms, “employs complicated and opaque corporate practices that may be designed to evade public scrutiny and accountability,” the investigation found.

Our Oppenheimer Moment: The Creation of A.I. Weapons: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In 1942, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the son of a painter and a textile importer, was appointed to lead Project Y, the military effort established by the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons. Oppenheimer and his colleagues worked in secret at a remote laboratory in New Mexico to discover methods for purifying uranium and ultimately to design and build working atomic bombs.
He had a bias toward action and inquiry.
"When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it," he told a government panel that would later assess his fitness to remain privy to U.S. secrets. "And you argue about what to do about it only after you have had your technical success. That is the way it was with the atomic bomb." His security clearance was revoked shortly after his testimony, effectively ending his career in public service.
Oppenheimer's feelings about his role in conjuring the most destructive weapon of the age would shift after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. At a lecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1947, he observed that the physicists involved in the development of the bomb "have known sin" and that this is "a knowledge which they cannot lose."
We have now arrived at a similar crossroad in the science of computing, a crossroad that connects engineering and ethics, where we will again have to choose whether to proceed with the development of a technology whose power and potential we do not yet fully apprehend.
The choice we face is whether to rein in or even halt the development of the most advanced forms of artificial intelligence, which some argue may threaten or someday supersede humanity, or to allow more unfettered experimentation with a technology that has the potential to shape the international politics of this century in the way nuclear arms shaped the last one.
The emergent properties of the latest large language models -- their ability to stitch together what seems to pass for a primitive form of knowledge of the workings of our world -- are not well understood. In the absence of understanding, the collective reaction to early encounters with this novel technology has been marked by an uneasy blend of wonder and fear.
Some of the latest models have a trillion or more parameters, tunable variables within a computer algorithm, representing a scale of processing that is impossible for the human mind to begin to comprehend. We have learned that the more parameters a model has, the more expressive its representation of the world and the richer its ability to mirror it.
What has emerged from that trillion-dimensional space is opaque and mysterious. It is not at all clear -- not even to the scientists and programmers who build them -- how or why the generative language and image models work. And the most advanced versions of the models have now started to demonstrate what one group of researchers has called "sparks of artificial general intelligence," or forms of reasoning that appear to approximate the way that humans think.
In one experiment that tested the capabilities of GPT-4, the language model was asked how one could stack a book, nine eggs, a laptop, a bottle and a nail "onto each other in a stable manner." Attempts at prodding more primitive versions of the model into describing a workable solution to the challenge had failed.
GPT-4 excelled. The computer explained that one could "arrange the nine eggs in a three-by-three square on top of the book, leaving some space between them," and then "place the laptop on top of the eggs," with the bottle going on top of the laptop and the nail on top of the bottle cap, "with the pointy end facing up and the flat end facing down."
It was a stunning feat of "common sense," in the words of Sébastien Bubeck, the French lead author of the study who taught computer science at Princeton University and now works at Microsoft Research.
It is not just our own lack of understanding of the internal mechanisms of these technologies but also their marked improvement in mastering our world that has inspired fear. A growing group of leading technologists has issued calls for caution and debate before pursuing further technical advances. An open letter to the engineering community calling for a six-month pause in developing more advanced forms of A.I. has received more than 33,000 signatures. On Friday, at a White House meeting with President Biden, seven companies that are developing A.I. announced their commitment to a set of broad principles intended to manage the risks of artificial intelligence.
In March, one commentator published an essay in Time magazine arguing that "if somebody builds a too-powerful A.I., under present conditions," he expects "that every single member of the human species and all biological life on Earth dies shortly thereafter."
Concerns such as these regarding the further development of artificial intelligence are not unjustified. The software that we are building can enable the deployment of lethal weapons. The potential integration of weapons systems with increasingly autonomous artificial intelligence software necessarily brings risks.
But the suggestion to halt the development of these technologies is misguided.
Some of the attempts to rein in the advance of large language models may be driven by a distrust of the public and its ability to appropriately weigh the risks and rewards of the technology. We should be skeptical when the elites of Silicon Valley, who for years recoiled at the suggestion that software was anything but our salvation as a species, now tell us that we must pause vital research that has the potential to revolutionize everything from military operations to medicine.
A significant amount of attention has also been directed at the policing of language that chatbots use and to patrolling the limits of acceptable discourse with the machine. The desire to shape these models in our image, and to require them to conform to a particular set of norms governing interpersonal interaction, is understandable but may be a distraction from the more fundamental risks that these new technologies present. The focus on the propriety of the speech produced by language models may reveal more about our own preoccupations and fragilities as a culture than it does the technology itself.
Our attention should instead be more urgently directed at building the technical architecture and regulatory framework that would construct moats and guardrails around A.I. programs' ability to autonomously integrate with other systems, such as electrical grids, defense and intelligence networks, and our air traffic control infrastructure. If these technologies are to exist alongside us over the long term, it will also be essential to rapidly construct systems that allow more seamless collaboration between human operators and their algorithmic counterparts, to ensure that the machine remains subordinate to its creator.
We must not, however, shy away from building sharp tools for fear they may be turned against us.
A reluctance to grapple with the often grim reality of an ongoing geopolitical struggle for power poses its own danger. Our adversaries will not pause to indulge in theatrical debates about the merits of developing technologies with critical military and national security applications. They will proceed.
This is an arms race of a different kind, and it has begun.
Our hesitation, perceived or otherwise, to move forward with military applications of artificial intelligence will be punished. The ability to develop the tools required to deploy force against an opponent, combined with a credible threat to use such force, is often the foundation of any effective negotiation with an adversary.
The underlying cause of our cultural hesitation to openly pursue technical superiority may be our collective sense that we have already won. But the certainty with which many believed that history had come to an end, and that Western liberal democracy had emerged in permanent victory after the struggles of the 20th century, is as dangerous as it is pervasive.
We must not grow complacent.
The ability of free and democratic societies to prevail requires something more than moral appeal. It requires hard power, and hard power in this century will be built on software.
Thomas Schelling, an American game theorist who taught economics at Harvard and Yale, understood the relationship between technical advances in the development of weaponry and the ability of such weaponry to shape political outcomes.
"To be coercive, violence has to be anticipated," he wrote in the 1960s as the United States grappled with its military escalation in Vietnam. "The power to hurt is bargaining power. To exploit it is diplomacy -- vicious diplomacy, but diplomacy."
While other countries press forward, many Silicon Valley engineers remain opposed to working on software projects that may have offensive military applications, including machine learning systems that make possible the more systematic targeting and elimination of enemies on the battlefield. Many of these engineers will build algorithms that optimize the placement of ads on social media platforms, but they will not build software for the U.S. Marines.
In 2019, Microsoft faced internal opposition to accepting a defense contract with the U.S. Army. "We did not sign up to develop weapons," employees wrote in an open letter to corporate management.
A year earlier, an employee protest at Google preceded the company's decision not to renew a contract for work with the U.S. Department of Defense on a critical system for planning and executing special forces operations around the world. "Building this technology to assist the U.S. government in military surveillance -- and potentially lethal outcomes -- is not acceptable," Google employees wrote in an open letter to Sundar Pichai, the company's chief executive officer.
I fear that the views of a generation of engineers in Silicon Valley have meaningfully drifted from the center of gravity of American public opinion. The preoccupations and political instincts of coastal elites may be essential to maintaining their sense of self and cultural superiority but do little to advance the interests of our republic. The wunderkinder of Silicon Valley -- their fortunes, business empires and, more fundamentally, their entire sense of self -- exist because of the nation that in many cases made their rise possible. They charge themselves with constructing vast technical empires but decline to offer support to the state whose protections and underlying social fabric have provided the necessary conditions for their ascent. They would do well to understand that debt, even if it remains unpaid.
Our experiment in self-government is fragile. The United States is far from perfect. But it is easy to forget how much more opportunity exists in this country for those who are not hereditary elites than in any other nation on the planet.
Our company, Palantir Technologies, has a stake in this debate. The software platforms that we have built are used by U.S. and allied defense and intelligence agencies for functions like target selection, mission planning and satellite reconnaissance. The ability of software to facilitate the elimination of an enemy is a precondition for its value to the defense and intelligence agencies with which we work. At Palantir, we are fortunate that our interests as a company and those of the country in which we are based are fundamentally aligned. In the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, for example, we were often asked when we decided to pull out of Russia. The answer is never, because we were never there.
A more intimate collaboration between the state and the technology sector, and a closer alignment of vision between the two, will be required if the United States and its allies are to maintain an advantage that will constrain our adversaries over the long term. The preconditions for a durable peace often come only from a credible threat of war.
In the summer of 1939, from a cottage on the North Fork of Long Island, Albert Einstein sent a letter -- which he had worked on with Leo Szilard and others -- to President Franklin Roosevelt, urging him to explore building a nuclear weapon, and quickly. The rapid technical advances in the development of a potential atomic weapon, Einstein and Szilard wrote, "seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the administration," as well as a sustained partnership founded on "permanent contact maintained between the administration" and physicists.
It was the raw power and strategic potential of the bomb that prompted their call to action then. It is the far less visible but equally significant capabilities of these newest artificial intelligence technologies that should prompt swift action now.

Profit Reports Fuel a Wall Street Rally: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street's rally got back on track Friday following more encouraging profit reports and the latest signal that inflation is loosening its chokehold on the economy.
The S&P 500 rose 1 percent to its highest close in more than 15 months. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 176 points, or 0.5 percent after breaking a 13-day winning streak the day before. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.9 percent as Big Tech stocks led the market.
Stocks have been rising recently on hopes high inflation is cooling enough to get the Federal Reserve to stop hiking interest rates. That in turn could allow the economy to continue growing and avoid a long-predicted recession. The S&P 500 closed out its third straight winning week and its ninth in the last 11.
A report on Friday bolstered those hopes, saying the inflation measure the Fed prefers to use slowed last month by a touch more than expected. Perhaps just as importantly, data also showed that total compensation for workers rose less than expected during the spring. While that's discouraging for workers looking for bigger raises, investors see it adding less upward pressure on inflation.
The hope among traders is that the slowdown in inflation means the Federal Reserve's hike to interest rates on Wednesday will be the final one of this cycle. The federal funds rate has leaped to a level between 5.25 percent and 5.50 percent, up from virtually zero early last year. High interest rates work to lower inflation by slowing the entire economy and hurting prices for stocks and other investments.
Critics, though, say the stock market's rally may have gone too far, too fast. The full effects of the Fed's rate hikes have yet to make their way fully through the system. Other parts of the economy could still crack under the pressure, like the three U.S. bank failures this spring that shook confidence. Plus, inflation remains above the Fed's target level, and the central bank could have to keep the brakes on the economy a while to get it down to target.
"Don't underestimate central bank commitment to 2 percent inflation," Bank of America economists wrote in a BofA Global Research report.
Still, hopes for a halt to rate hikes helped technology stocks and others seen as big beneficiaries from easier rates to rally and lead the market Friday.
Microsoft, Apple and Amazon each rose at least 1.4 percent and were the three strongest forces pushing upward on the S&P 500.
Companies also continued to deliver stronger profits for the spring than analysts expected. Roughly halfway through the earnings season, more companies than usual are topping profit forecasts, according to FactSet.
Intel rose 6.6 percent after reporting a profit for the latest quarter, when analysts were expecting a loss.
Food giant Mondelez International climbed 3.7 percent after reporting stronger results for the spring than expected. The company behind Oreo and Ritz also raised its forecasts for financial results for the full year.
On the losing end was Exxon Mobil. It fell 1.2 percent and was the heaviest single weight on the S&P 500. It reported weaker profit for the spring than expected, though its revenue topped forecasts.
All told, the S&P 500 rose 44.82 points to 4,582.23. The Dow added 176.57 to 35,459.29, and the Nasdaq jumped 265.55 to 14,316.66.
In stock markets abroad, Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4 percent after the Bank of Japan made moves that could allow longer-term interest rates to rise. Stocks rose in China and were modestly higher across Europe.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.95 percent from 4.00 percent late Thursday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.

Wall Street Drifts After Fed's Rate Move: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/wall-street-drifts-after-feds-rate-move/docview/2842321370/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks held steady on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to their highest level in more than two decades, just as Wall Street had expected.
The S&P 500 slipped 0.71, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,566.75, remaining near a 15-month high. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 82.05 points, or 0.2 percent, to 35,520.12, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 17.27, or 0.1 percent, to 14,127.29.
The bond market moved more sharply, and Treasury yields fell after the Fed's chair, Jerome H. Powell, said no decision had been made about whether to raise rates at its next meeting or beyond. That may have bolstered hopes among traders that Wednesday's increase could be the last for a long time.
Microsoft weighed on the market after falling 3.8 percent. That was despite reporting better profit and revenue for the spring than expected. Analysts said the company made comments that were perhaps intended to rein in huge expectations for upcoming growth related to artificial intelligence. Investors also may have been hoping to hear more about when slowing growth at its Azure cloud computing business will trough.
Helping to limit the market's losses was Alphabet, which rose 5.6 percent. The parent company of Google and YouTube reported better profit and revenue for the spring than analysts had expected.
What Big Tech titans do matters more to Wall Street than what other stocks do because the companies have become so influential because of their size. Seven stocks alone accounted for most of the S&P 500's returns through the first half of this year, largely on expectations that their explosive growth will continue. They will need to deliver big profits to justify those gains.
Meta Platforms, another member of the "Magnificent Seven" that has overshadowed the rest of the market, also reported its results after trading closed for the day. Meta's stock has soared 148 percent this year, while Alphabet and Microsoft are both up more than 40 percent.
Boeing helped prop up the Dow. The aircraft maker reported a smaller loss for the spring than analysts had expected, and revenue topped expectations. Boeing's stock rose 8.7 percent.
In the bond market, the highlight was the Fed's move to raise its federal funds rate to a range of 5.25 percent to 5.50 percent in hopes of wrestling down high inflation. That is its highest level since 2001 and up from virtually zero early last year.
The hope among traders is that will be the last increase of this cycle because inflation has been on a downward trend since last summer. Such hopes have been another reason for Wall Street's big rally this year. Rate increases work to lower inflation by grinding down on the entire economy, raising the risk of a recession and hurting prices for investments.
The economy has so far defied predictions for a recession, largely because of a remarkably solid job market that has allowed U.S. households to keep spending. That has hopes rising that the Federal Reserve can pull off a "soft landing" for the economy where high inflation falls back to its target without a painful recession.
Some critics, though, say traders may have rushed into such hopes too quickly and too strongly. Inflation is still high, even if it has come down, and the Fed may need to keep rates high for a while to drive it down to its 2 percent target. A recession is still a risk, the critics say.
"The market seems to be talking itself into this internally inconsistent scenario, where growth is OK, inflation is basically solved for and the Fed can start cutting rates," said Sameer Samana, a senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
A resilient economy could cause inflation to stay elevated, he said, and inflation could reaccelerate later this year. Prices for oil and other commodities may end the year higher than a year before, for example.
"Unfortunately for the Fed, this is as easy as it gets," Mr. Samana said. "From here, inflation is going to probably prove to be more stubborn."
The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.86 percent from 3.89 percent late Tuesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for Fed action, sank to 4.85 percent from 4.88 percent. It was above 4.91 percent before Mr. Powell's remarks on Wednesday.
In markets abroad, stocks fell more sharply in Europe. France's CAC 40 sank 1.4 percent, and Germany's DAX lost 0.5 percent.
In Asia, South Korea's Kospi fell 1.7 percent and Japan's Nikkei 225 was nearly flat. Stocks in China were down modestly as traders wait to see how the country's ruling Communist Party will carry out its promise to shore up sluggish economic growth. The ruling party has pledged to support entrepreneurs and the struggling real estate industry but has given no details.

Market Rises as Earnings Buoy Wall Street: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street strengthened Tuesday after more companies reported fatter profits for the spring than expected.
The S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent, its highest close since early April 2022. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.6 percent.
General Electric helped lead the market with a 6.3 percent rally after it reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also raised its forecasts for full-year revenue and profits.
Another industrial giant, 3M, rose 5.3 percent after the maker of Scotch-Brite and Post-it raised its forecast for profits for the full year thanks in part to cost-cutting efforts. Shares of the home builder PulteGroup climbed 6.2 percent after it reported stronger profit for the spring than expected.
On the losing side of Wall Street were airline stocks, led by Alaska Air Group. It fell 9.7 percent despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts said investors may have been disappointed with its financial forecasts for the current quarter.
Raytheon Technologies tumbled 10.2 percent after saying accelerated removals and inspections are needed for some of its Pratt & Whitney aircraft engines to look for a rare condition in powder metal. That pushed the company to lower its forecast for how much cash it will generate this year, though it also reported stronger profit for the spring than analysts expected.
This week is a busy one for earnings reports, and roughly 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 are on the schedule. The majority have topped analysts' expectations so far this reporting season, as is usually the case.
Two of Wall Street's most influential stocks reported their results after trading closed for the day, Microsoft and Alphabet. They're two of the seven stocks behind the majority of the S&P 500's nearly 16 percent gain through the first half of the year.
That "Magnificent 7" will need to deliver strong results to justify their huge gains for the year so far, as their stocks soared on expectations they'll continue to deliver strong growth. Both Alphabet and Microsoft are up more than 38 percent for the year so far.
UPS swung between gains and losses after reaching a tentative deal with 340,000 unionized workers to raise pay, which potentially averts a strike. UPS ended the day down 1.9 percent.
This week's other highlight for Wall Street also got underway Tuesday: the Federal Reserve's latest meeting on interest rates.
The wide expectation is for the Fed on Wednesday to announce another increase to interest rates, as it tries to wrestle high inflation under control. That would take the federal funds rate to a range of 5.25 percent to 5.50 percent, its highest level in two decades and up from virtually zero early last year.
High rates grind down on inflation by slowing the entire economy and hurting prices for stocks and other investments. The hope among traders is Wednesday's move will be the final increase of this cycle because inflation has been cooling since last summer.
Such hopes, along with rising belief that the economy can avoid a long-predicted recession, have helped stocks rally strongly this year. The job market has remained remarkably solid, which has allowed American households to keep spending and propping up the economy. A report on Tuesday showed confidence among consumers rose by more than economists expected.
But many on Wall Street warn the Fed is unlikely to give any signals on Wednesday that it's done raising rates. Inflation is still high, even if it has moderated somewhat, and the economy may have to "yield to a long but shallow recession if the Fed is to return inflation to its 2 percent target," according to Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist at Mizuho Securities.

Tech Firms That Lifted New York Are Now Having to Scale Back: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For much of the last two decades, including during the pandemic, technology companies were a bright spot in New York's economy, adding thousands of high-paying jobs and expanding into millions of square feet of office space.
Their growth buoyed tax revenue, set up New York as a credible rival to the San Francisco Bay Area -- and provided jobs that helped the city absorb layoffs in other sectors during the pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis.
Now, the technology industry is pulling back hard, clouding the city's economic future.
Facing many business challenges, large technology companies have laid off more than 386,000 workers worldwide since early 2022, according to layoffs.fyi, which tracks the tech industry. And they have pulled out of millions of square feet of office space because of those job cuts and the shift to working from home.
That retrenchment has hurt lots of tech hubs, and San Francisco has been hit the hardest with an office vacancy rate of 25.6 percent, according to Newmark Research.
New York is doing better than San Francisco -- Manhattan has a vacancy rate of 13.5 percent -- but it can no longer count on the technology industry for growth. More than one-third of the roughly 22 million square feet of office space available for sublet in Manhattan comes from technology, advertising and media companies, according to Newmark.
Consider Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. It is now unloading a big chunk of the more than 2.2 million square feet of office space it gobbled up in Manhattan in recent years after laying off around 1,700 employees this year, or a quarter of its New York State work force. The company has opted not to renew leases covering 250,000 square feet in Hudson Yards and for 200,000 square feet on Park Avenue South.
Spotify is trying to sublet five of the 16 floors it leased six years ago in 4 World Trade Center, and Roku is offering a quarter of the 240,000 square feet it had taken in Times Square just last year. Twitter, Microsoft and other technology companies are also trying to sublease unwanted space.
"The tech companies were such a big part of the real estate landscape during the last five years," said Ruth Colp-Haber, the chief executive of Wharton Property Advisors, a real estate brokerage. "And now that they seem to be cutting back, the question is: Who is going to replace them?"
Ms. Colp-Haber said it could take months for bigger spaces or entire floors of buildings to be sublet. The large amount of space available for sublet is also driving down the rents that landlords are able to get on new leases.
"They are going to undercut every landlord out there in terms of pricing, and they have really nice spaces that are already all built out," she said, referring to the tech companies.
The tech sector has been a driver of New York's economy since the late-90s dot-com boom helped to establish "Silicon Alley" south of Midtown. Then, after the financial crisis, the expansion of companies like Google supported the economy when banks, insurers and other financial firms were in retreat.
Small and large tech companies added 43,430 jobs in New York in the five years through the end of 2021, a 33 percent gain, according to the state comptroller. And those jobs paid very well: The average tech salary in 2021 was $ 228,620, nearly double the average private-sector salary in the city, according to the comptroller.
The growth in jobs fueled demand for commercial space, and tech, advertising and media companies accounted for nearly a quarter of the new office leases signed in Manhattan in recent years, according to Newmark.
Microsoft and Spotify declined to comment about their decision to sublet space. Twitter and Roku did not respond to requests for comment. Meta said in a statement that it was "committed to distributed work" and was "continuously refining" its approach.
A few big tech companies are still expanding in New York.
Google plans to open St. John's Terminal, a large office near the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan, early next year. Including the terminal, Google will own or lease around seven million square feet of office space in New York, up from roughly six million today, according to a company representative. (Google leases more than one million square feet of that space to other tenants.) The company has more than 12,000 employees in the New York area, up from over 10,000 in 2019.
Amazon, which in 2019 canceled plans to build a large campus in Queens after local politicians objected to the incentives offered to the company, has nevertheless added 200,000 square feet of office space in New York, Jersey City and Newark since 2019. The company will have added roughly 550,000 square feet of office space later this summer, when it opens 424 Fifth Avenue, the former Lord & Taylor department store, which it bought in 2020 for $ 1.15 billion.
"New York provides a fantastic, diverse talent pool, and we're proud of the thousands of jobs we've created in the city and state over the past 10 years across both our corporate and operations functions," Holly Sullivan, vice president of worldwide economic development at Amazon, said in a statement.
And though many tech companies continue to let employees work from home for much of the week, they are also trying to woo workers back to the office, which could help reduce the need to sublet space.
Salesforce, a software company that has offices in a tower next to Bryant Park, said it was not considering subletting its New York space.
"Currently I'm facing the opposite problem in the tower in New York," said Relina Bulchandani, head of real estate for Salesforce. "There has been a concerted effort to continue to grow the right roles in New York because we have a very high customer base in New York."
New York is and will remain a vibrant home for technology companies, industry representatives said.
"I have not heard of a single tech company leaving, and that matters," said Julie Samuels, the president of TECH:NYC, an industry association. "If anything, we are seeing less of a contraction in New York among tech leases than they are seeing in other large cities."
Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures, said tech executives now felt less of a need to be in Silicon Valley, a shift that he said had benefited New York. "We have more company C.E.O.s and more company founders in New York today than we did before the pandemic," Mr. Wilson said, referring to the companies his firm has invested in.
David Falk, the president of the New York tristate region for Newmark, said, "We are right now working on several transactions with smaller, young tech firms that are looking to take sublet space."
Many firms are still pulling back, however.
In 2017 and 2019, Spotify, which is based in Stockholm, signed leases totaling more than 564,000 square feet of space at 4 World Trade Center, becoming one of the largest tenants there. It soon had a space with all the accouterments you would expect at a tech firm -- brightly colored flexible work areas, eye-popping views and Ping-Pong tables.
But in January, Spotify said it was laying off 600 people, or about 6 percent of its global work force. The company, which allows employees to choose between working fully remotely or on a hybrid schedule, is also reducing its office space, putting five floors up for sublet.
"On days when I'm by myself, I end up sitting in a meeting room all day for focus time," said Dayna Tran, a Spotify employee who regularly works at the downtown office, adding that the employees who come in motivate themselves and create community by collaborating on an office playlist.

Shares Rise Amid Hopes About Final Hike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street ticked higher Monday to start a week full of updates on where interest rates and profits for some of the stock market's most influential companies are heading.
The S&P 500 rose 18.30, or 0.4 percent, to 4,554.64, coming off its eighth winning week in the last 10. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 183.55, or 0.5 percent, at 35,411.24, and the Nasdaq composite added 26.06, or 0.2 percent, to 14,058.87.
Becton Dickinson jumped 5.7 percent for the largest gain in the S&P 500 after it said its updated Alaris infusion system will return to full commercial operations following earlier recalls. It received a clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the system, which delivers medications and other products to patients.
Chevron rallied 2 percent after it gave an early look at its results for the spring, reporting a stronger profit than analysts expected.
Roughly 30 percent of companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to tell investors this week how much they earned from April through June. Key among them are three Big Tech behemoths that have grown so large that their stock movements often dictate where the S&P 500 goes.
Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft will all report their results this week, and they're three of the seven stocks that accounted for the majority of the S&P 500's gain in the first half of the year. Each of the three has soared at least 37 percent for this year so far, and they'll need to deliver strong numbers to justify their big rallies.
The market's top stocks have become so big and their movements so influential over the market that Nasdaq rebalanced its Nasdaq 100 index before trading began Monday, to lessen the impact some stocks have on the overall index.
Perhaps even more important than how profits at the Big Tech titans go is what the Federal Reserve will say Wednesday at its latest meeting on interest rates.
The wide expectation is that the Fed will raise its federal funds rate again, to its highest level since 2001, as it fights to bring inflation down. But the hope among traders is that will be the final increase of this cycle because inflation has been cooling since last summer.
High rates undercut inflation by slowing the entire economy in a blunt move, as well as by hurting prices for stocks and other investments. That caused many investors to brace for a recession, but the economy has so far remained resilient due largely to a remarkably solid job market.
A report on Monday suggested the U.S. services industry is continuing to grow, but at a slower pace than economists expected. On the upside for the economy, the preliminary report from S&P Global also suggested U.S. manufacturing isn't doing as badly as feared. Overall, growth in business activity during July appears to be at its slowest in five months.
Stocks have rallied hard this year, and the S&P 500 is up 18.6 percent on hopes the economy can continue to grow as inflation cools enough to get the Fed to not only stop hiking rates but to begin cutting them next year. Such a not-too-hot and not-too-cold outcome would mean the Fed pulls off a tricky "soft landing" for the economy.
"A lot would need to go right for such an outcome, in our view," strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute wrote in a report. Rate hikes take a notoriously long time to take full effect across the economy, and they can cause unanticipated parts of it to break.
The big run for stocks in the S&P 500 this year also leaves them looking expensive compared with history, even outside the big seven stocks that have driven most of the gains, according to Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer of The Leuthold Group.
He calls this "another chance to buy high" after the market's rebound from the 2020 Covid crash.

A.I. Bots Are So Much Better When You Use This Little Tip: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: To mitigate the production and spread of misinformation from chatbots, we can steer them toward high-quality data.
Anyone seduced by A.I.-powered chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard -- wow, they can write essays and recipes! -- eventually runs into what are known as hallucinations, the tendency for artificial intelligence to fabricate information.
The chatbots, which guess what to say based on information obtained from all over the internet, can't help but get things wrong. And when they fail -- by publishing a cake recipe with wildly inaccurate flour measurements, for instance -- it can be a real buzzkill.
Yet as mainstream tech tools continue to integrate A.I., it's crucial to get a handle on how to use it to serve us. After testing dozens of A.I. products over the last two months, I concluded that most of us are using the technology in a suboptimal way, largely because the tech companies gave us poor directions.
The chatbots are the least beneficial when we ask them questions and then hope whatever answers they come up with on their own are true, which is how they were designed to be used. But when directed to use information from trusted sources, such as credible websites and research papers, A.I. can carry out helpful tasks with a high degree of accuracy.
"If you give them the right information, they can do interesting things with it," said Sam Heutmaker, the founder of Context, an A.I. start-up. "But on their own, 70 percent of what you get is not going to be accurate."
With the simple tweak of advising the chatbots to work with specific data, they generated intelligible answers and useful advice. That transformed me over the last few months from a cranky A.I. skeptic into an enthusiastic power user. When I went on a trip using a travel itinerary planned by ChatGPT, it went well because the recommendations came from my favorite travel websites.
Directing the chatbots to specific high-quality sources like websites from well-established media outlets and academic publications can also help reduce the production and spread of misinformation. Let me share some of the approaches I used to get help with cooking, research and travel planning.
Meal Planning
Chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard can write recipes that look good in theory but don't work in practice. In an experiment by The New York Times's Food desk in November, an early A.I. model created recipes for a Thanksgiving menu that included an extremely dry turkey and a dense cake.
I also ran into underwhelming results with A.I.-generated seafood recipes. But that changed when I experimented with ChatGPT plug-ins, which are essentially third-party apps that work with the chatbot. (Only subscribers who pay $ 20 a month for access to ChatGPT4, the latest version of the chatbot, can use plug-ins, which can be activated in the settings menu.)
On ChatGPT's plug-ins menu, I selected Tasty Recipes, which pulls data from the Tasty website owned by BuzzFeed, a well-known media site. I then asked the chatbot to come up with a meal plan including seafood dishes, ground pork and vegetable sides using recipes from the site. The bot presented an inspiring meal plan, including lemongrass pork banh mi, grilled tofu tacos and everything-in-the-fridge pasta; each meal suggestion included a link to a recipe on Tasty.
For recipes from other publications, I used Link Reader, a plug-in that let me paste in a web link to generate meal plans using recipes from other credible sites like Serious Eats. The chatbot pulled data from the sites to create meal plans and told me to visit the websites to read the recipes. That took extra work, but it beat an A.I.-concocted meal plan.
Research
When I did research for an article on a popular video game series, I turned to ChatGPT and Bard to refresh my memory on past games by summarizing their plots. They messed up on important details about the games' stories and characters.
After testing many other A.I. tools, I concluded that for research, it was crucial to fixate on trusted sources and quickly double-check the data for accuracy. I eventually found a tool that delivers that: Humata.AI, a free web app that has become popular among academic researchers and lawyers.
The app lets you upload a document such as a PDF, and from there a chatbot answers your questions about the material alongside a copy of the document, highlighting relevant portions.
In one test, I uploaded a research paper I found on PubMed, a government-run search engine for scientific literature. The tool produced a relevant summary of the lengthy document in minutes, a process that would have taken me hours, and I glanced at the highlights to double-check that the summaries were accurate.
Cyrus Khajvandi, a founder of Humata, which is based in Austin, Texas, developed the app when he was a researcher at Stanford and needed help reading dense scientific articles, he said. The problem with chatbots like ChatGPT, he said, is that they rely on outdated models of the web, so the data may lack relevant context.
Travel Planning
When a Times travel writer recently asked ChatGPT to compose a travel itinerary for Milan, the bot guided her to visit a central part of town that was deserted because it was an Italian holiday, among other snafus.
I had better luck when I requested a vacation itinerary for me, my wife and our dogs in Mendocino County, Calif. As I did when planning a meal, I asked ChatGPT to incorporate suggestions from some of my favorite travel sites, such as Thrillist, which is owned by Vox, and The Times's travel section.
Within minutes, the chatbot generated an itinerary that included dog-friendly restaurants and activities, including a farm with wine and cheese pairings and a train to a popular hiking trail. This spared me several hours of planning, and most important, the dogs had a wonderful time.
Bottom Line
Google and OpenAI, which works closely with Microsoft, say they are working to reduce hallucinations in their chatbots, but we can already reap A.I.'s benefits by taking control of the data that the bots rely on to come up with answers.
To put it another way: The main benefit of training machines with enormous data sets is that they can now use language to simulate human reasoning, said Nathan Benaich, a venture capitalist who invests in A.I. companies. The important step for us, he said, is to pair that ability with high-quality information.

That retrenchment has hurt lots of tech hubs, and San Francisco has been hit the hardest with an office vacancy rate of 25.6%, according to Newmark Research.
New York is doing better than San Francisco — Manhattan has a vacancy rate of 13.5% — but it can no longer count on the technology industry for growth. More than one-third of the roughly 22 million square feet of office space available for sublet in Manhattan comes from technology, advertising and media companies, according to Newmark.
Consider Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. It is now unloading a big chunk of the more than 2.2 million square feet of office space it gobbled up in Manhattan in recent years after laying off around 1,700 employees this year, or one-quarter of its New York state workforce. The company has opted not to renew leases covering 250,000 square feet in Hudson Yards and for 200,000 square feet on Park Avenue South.
Spotify is trying to sublet five of the 16 floors it leased six years ago in 4 World Trade Center, and Roku is offering one-quarter of the 240,000 square feet it had taken in Times Square just last year. Twitter, Microsoft and other technology companies are also trying to sublease unwanted space.
“The tech companies were such a big part of the real estate landscape during the last five years,” said Ruth Colp-Haber, CEO of Wharton Property Advisors, a real estate brokerage. “And now that they seem to be cutting back, the question is: Who is going to replace them?”
Colp-Haber said it could take months for bigger spaces or entire floors of buildings to be sublet. The large amount of space available for sublet is also driving down the rents that landlords are able to get on new leases.
“They are going to undercut every landlord out there in terms of pricing, and they have really nice spaces that are already all built out,” she said, referring to the tech companies.
The tech sector has been a driver of New York’s economy since the late ’90s dot-com boom helped to establish “Silicon Alley” south of midtown Manhattan. Then, after the financial crisis, the expansion of companies like Google supported the economy when banks, insurers and other financial firms were in retreat.
Small and large tech companies added 43,430 jobs in New York in the five years through the end of 2021, a 33% gain, according to the state comptroller. And those jobs paid very well: The average tech salary in 2021 was $228,620, nearly double the average private-sector salary in the city, according to the comptroller.
The growth in jobs fueled demand for commercial space, and tech, advertising and media companies accounted for nearly one-quarter of the new office leases signed in Manhattan in recent years, according to Newmark.
Microsoft and Spotify declined to comment about their decision to sublet space. Twitter and Roku did not respond to requests for comment. Meta said in a statement that it was “committed to distributed work” and was “continuously refining” its approach.
A few Big Tech companies are still expanding in New York.
Google plans to open St. John’s Terminal, a large office near the Hudson River in lower Manhattan, early next year. Including the terminal, Google will own or lease around 7 million square feet of office space in New York, up from roughly 6 million today, according to a company representative. (Google leases more than 1 million square feet of that space to other tenants.) The company has more than 12,000 employees in the New York area, up from over 10,000 in 2019.
Amazon, which in 2019 canceled plans to build a large campus in Queens after local politicians objected to the incentives offered to the company, has nevertheless added 200,000 square feet of office space in New York and Jersey City and Newark in New Jersey since 2019. The company will have added roughly 550,000 square feet of office space later this summer, when it opens 424 Fifth Ave., the former Lord & Taylor department store, which it bought in 2020 for $1.15 billion.
“New York provides a fantastic, diverse talent pool, and we’re proud of the thousands of jobs we’ve created in the city and state over the past 10 years across both our corporate and operations functions,” Holly Sullivan, vice president of worldwide economic development at Amazon, said in a statement.
And though many tech companies continue to let employees work from home for much of the week, they are also trying to woo workers back to the office, which could help reduce the need to sublet space.
Salesforce, a software company that has offices in a tower next to Bryant Park, said it was not considering subletting its New York space.
“Currently I’m facing the opposite problem in the tower in New York,” said Relina Bulchandani, head of real estate for Salesforce. “There has been a concerted effort to continue to grow the right roles in New York because we have a very high customer base in New York.”
New York is and will remain a vibrant home for technology companies, industry representatives said.
“I have not heard of a single tech company leaving, and that matters,” said Julie Samuels, president of TECH:NYC, an industry association. “If anything, we are seeing less of a contraction in New York among tech leases than they are seeing in other large cities.”
Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures, said tech executives now felt less of a need to be in Silicon Valley, a shift that he said had benefited New York. “We have more company CEOs and more company founders in New York today than we did before the pandemic,” Wilson said, referring to the companies his firm has invested in.
David Falk, president of the New York tri-state region for Newmark, said, “We are right now working on several transactions with smaller, young tech firms that are looking to take sublet space.”
Many firms are still pulling back, however.
In 2017 and 2019, Spotify, which is based in Stockholm, signed leases totaling more than 564,000 square feet of space at 4 World Trade Center, becoming one of the largest tenants there. It soon had a space with all the accouterments you would expect at a tech firm — brightly colored flexible work areas, eye-popping views and pingpong tables.
But in January, Spotify said it was laying off 600 people, or about 6% of its global workforce. The company, which allows employees to choose between working fully remotely or on a hybrid schedule, is also reducing its office space, putting five floors up for sublet.
“On days when I’m by myself, I end up sitting in a meeting room all day for focus time,” said Dayna Tran, a Spotify employee who regularly works at the downtown office, adding that the employees who come in motivate themselves and create community by collaborating on an office playlist.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Seven leading A.I. companies made eight promises about what they'll do with their technology. Our columnist sizes up their potential impact.
This week, the White House announced that it had secured "voluntary commitments" from seven leading A.I. companies to manage the risks posed by artificial intelligence.
Getting the companies -- Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft and OpenAI -- to agree to anything is a step forward. They include bitter rivals with subtle but important differences in the ways they're approaching A.I. research and development.
Meta, for example, is so eager to get its A.I. models into developers' hands that it has open-sourced many of them, putting their code out into the open for anyone to use. Other labs, such as Anthropic, have taken a more cautious approach, releasing their technology in more limited ways.
But what do these commitments actually mean? And are they likely to change much about how A.I. companies operate, given that they aren't backed by the force of law?
Given the potential stakes of A.I. regulation, the details matter. So let's take a closer look at what's being agreed to here and size up the potential impact.
Commitment 1: The companies commit to internal and external security testing of their A.I. systems before their release.
Each of these A.I. companies already does security testing -- what is often called "red-teaming" -- of its models before they're released. On one level, this isn't really a new commitment. And it's a vague promise. It doesn't come with many details about what kind of testing is required, or who will do the testing.
In a statement accompanying the commitments, the White House said only that testing of A.I. models "will be carried out in part by independent experts" and focus on A.I. risks "such as biosecurity and cybersecurity, as well as its broader societal effects."
It's a good idea to get A.I. companies to publicly commit to continue doing this kind of testing, and to encourage more transparency in the testing process. And there are some types of A.I. risk -- such as the danger that A.I. models could be used to develop bioweapons -- that government and military officials are probably better suited than companies to evaluate.
I'd love to see the A.I. industry agree on a standard battery of safety tests, such as the "autonomous replication" tests that the Alignment Research Center conducts on prereleased models by OpenAI and Anthropic. I'd also like to see the federal government fund these kinds of tests, which can be expensive and require engineers with significant technical expertise. Right now, many safety tests are funded and overseen by the companies, which raises obvious conflict-of-interest questions.
Commitment 2: The companies commit to sharing information across the industry and with governments, civil society and academia on managing A.I. risks.
This commitment is also a bit vague. Several of these companies already publish information about their A.I. models -- typically in academic papers or corporate blog posts. A few of them, including OpenAI and Anthropic, also publish documents called "system cards," which outline the steps they've taken to make those models safer.
But they have also held back information on occasion, citing safety concerns. When OpenAI released its latest A.I. model, GPT-4, this year, it broke with industry customs and chose not to disclose how much data it was trained on, or how big the model was (a metric known as "parameters"). It said it declined to release this information because of concerns about competition and safety. It also happens to be the kind of data that tech companies like to keep away from competitors.
Under these new commitments, will A.I. companies be compelled to make that kind of information public? What if doing so risks accelerating the A.I. arms race?
I suspect that the White House's goal is less about forcing companies to disclose their parameter counts and more about encouraging them to trade information with one another about the risks that their models do (or don't) pose.
But even that kind of information-sharing can be risky. If Google's A.I. team prevented a new model from being used to engineer a deadly bioweapon during prerelease testing, should it share that information outside Google? Would that risk giving bad actors ideas about how they might get a less guarded model to perform the same task?
Commitment 3: The companies commit to investing in cybersecurity and insider-threat safeguards to protect proprietary and unreleased model weights.
This one is pretty straightforward, and uncontroversial among the A.I. insiders I've talked to. "Model weights" is a technical term for the mathematical instructions that give A.I. models the ability to function. Weights are what you'd want to steal if you were an agent of a foreign government (or a rival corporation) who wanted to build your own version of ChatGPT or another A.I. product. And it's something A.I. companies have a vested interest in keeping tightly controlled.
There have already been well-publicized issues with model weights leaking. The weights for Meta's original LLaMA language model, for example, were leaked on 4chan and other websites just days after the model was publicly released. Given the risks of more leaks -- and the interest that other nations may have in stealing this technology from U.S. companies -- asking A.I. companies to invest more in their own security feels like a no-brainer.
Commitment 4: The companies commit to facilitating third-party discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities in their A.I. systems.
I'm not really sure what this means. Every A.I. company has discovered vulnerabilities in its models after releasing them, usually because users try to do bad things with the models or circumvent their guardrails (a practice known as "jailbreaking") in ways the companies hadn't foreseen.
The White House's commitment calls for companies to establish a "robust reporting mechanism" for these vulnerabilities, but it's not clear what that might mean. An in-app feedback button, similar to the ones that allow Facebook and Twitter users to report rule-violating posts? A bug bounty program, like the one OpenAI started this year to reward users who find flaws in its systems? Something else? We'll have to wait for more details.
Commitment 5: The companies commit to developing robust technical mechanisms to ensure that users know when content is A.I. generated, such as a watermarking system.
This is an interesting idea but leaves a lot of room for interpretation. So far, A.I. companies have struggled to devise tools that allow people to tell whether or not they're looking at A.I. generated content. There are good technical reasons for this, but it's a real problem when people can pass off A.I.-generated work as their own. (Ask any high school teacher.) And many of the tools currently promoted as being able to detect A.I. outputs really can't do so with any degree of accuracy.
I'm not optimistic that this problem is fully fixable. But I'm glad that companies are pledging to work on it.
Commitment 6: The companies commit to publicly reporting their A.I. systems' capabilities, limitations, and areas of appropriate and inappropriate use.
Another sensible-sounding pledge with lots of wiggle room. How often will companies be required to report on their systems' capabilities and limitations? How detailed will that information have to be? And given that many of the companies building A.I. systems have been surprised by their own systems' capabilities after the fact, how well can they really be expected to describe them in advance?
Commitment 7: The companies commit to prioritizing research on the societal risks that A.I. systems can pose, including on avoiding harmful bias and discrimination and protecting privacy.
Committing to "prioritizing research" is about as fuzzy as a commitment gets. Still, I'm sure this commitment will be received well by many in the A.I. ethics crowd, who want A.I. companies to make preventing near-term harms like bias and discrimination a priority over worrying about doomsday scenarios, as the A.I. safety folks do.
If you're confused by the difference between "A.I. ethics" and "A.I. safety," just know that there are two warring factions within the A.I. research community, each of which thinks the other is focused on preventing the wrong kinds of harms.
Commitment 8: The companies commit to develop and deploy advanced A.I. systems to help address society's greatest challenges.
I don't think many people would argue that advanced A.I. should not be used to help address society's greatest challenges. The White House lists "cancer prevention" and "mitigating climate change" as two of the areas where it would like A.I. companies to focus their efforts, and it will get no disagreement from me there.
What makes this goal somewhat complicated, though, is that in A.I. research, what starts off looking frivolous often turns out to have more serious implications. Some of the technology that went into DeepMind's AlphaGo -- an A.I. system that was trained to play the board game Go -- turned out to be useful in predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins, a major discovery that boosted basic scientific research.
Overall, the White House's deal with A.I. companies seems more symbolic than substantive. There is no enforcement mechanism to make sure companies follow these commitments, and many of them reflect precautions that A.I. companies are already taking.
Still, it's a reasonable first step. And agreeing to follow these rules shows that the A.I. companies have learned from the failures of earlier tech companies, which waited to engage with the government until they got into trouble. In Washington, at least where tech regulation is concerned, it pays to show up early.

Extreme Heat Waves Show Need for Climate Adaptation: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Almost all climate finance focuses on mitigating climate change. But money is increasingly pouring in to helping people adapt to the effects of global warming.
Good morning. In today's newsletter: Extreme heat highlights the need for another kind of climate investment; A.I. puts shadow libraries in the spotlight; and Aly Wagner, a co-founder of a new women's soccer team, talks about the money in women's sports. (Was this newsletter forwarded to you? Sign up here. )
As heat waves gripped three continents this week, venturing outside for even a few minutes in Phoenix, Rome or a town in northwest China at times meant risking heatstroke or worse. This weekend, about 80 million Americans are expected to experience a heat index -- what the temperature feels like to the body -- of at least 105 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.
The extreme heat is prompting violent typhoons in Asia and flash floods in the United States. It's taxing power grids, driving up health care costs and messing with tourists' holidays. And it's eventually going to impact everything -- and the business of everything.
El Niño and a stagnant jet stream contributed to the record-breaking temperatures. But to the pragmatist, extreme heat is the new normal.
Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, the head of climate science at Climate Analytics, a policy institute in Berlin, said, "Most of our cities are not equipped to deal with these kinds of summers."
"We'll have to develop adaptation strategies" -- and fast, he told DealBook.
The good news: Investors are spending big on climate projects. Global warming helps make periods of extreme heat more frequent, longer and more intense, and it will continue getting worse unless humans essentially stop adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, scientists say. Venture investing in climate tech has boomed since the post-Covid recovery began (though it fell, along with venture funding overall, in the first half of the year). And global public and private investment in climate finance, on projects ranging from decarbonizing architecture and transport to developing renewable energy initiatives, more than doubled from 2011 to 2021, to an estimated $ 850 billion, according to the Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit climate advocacy group. (It will top $ 1 trillion with the passage of the Biden administration's sweeping climate bills, the European Union's Green Deal and China's low-carbon development initiatives announced in its latest five-year plan.)
"There's been huge, huge progress" in developing green technologies and bringing down their costs, said Bella Tonkonogy, the U.S. director of Climate Policy Initiative whose funders include the Bloomberg Foundation and the German government.
The less good news: Addressing a source of the problem is no longer enough. The effects have arrived, and extreme heat has become the leading weather-related killer in much of the world. Some cities, homeowners and businesses are investing in low-cost hacks that can help make cities, which tend to absorb and re-emit heat more than natural landscapes, more bearable in the summer. Painting roofs white or another reflective color can cool structures down, making air conditioning units as much as 15 percent more energy-efficient, said Jane Gilbert, the chief heat officer of Miami-Dade County, Fla. Homes and businesses have to be retrofitted to stay cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter, and Miami-Dade has secured millions in federal funding for that plan. Planting trees also adds vital shade to reduce temperatures on city streets.
Only about 7 percent of climate finance is focused on adaptation efforts, according to the Climate Policy Initiative. But more investors are becoming interested, Ms. Tonkonogy said. Last year, the organization partnered with LightSmith Group, a private equity firm, on a $ 186 million climate fund designed to finance climate resilience projects that could help communities adapt to and withstand the kinds of the extreme weather events that have become so frequent this summer.
"The reason that people are investing more in climate adaptation is because they're actually seeing the impacts of climate change," Ms. Tonkonogy said. -- Bernhard Warner
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Microsoft moves closer to sealing its $ 69 billion deal for Activision Blizzard. The F.T.C. withdrew its in-house case against the acquisition, and Britain's antitrust regulator is reconsidering its decision to block the deal. Microsoft also signed a truce with Sony, one of the biggest opponents to the deal, by agreeing to keep Call of Duty on the Japanese firm's PlayStation console for a decade after the acquisition closes.
BlackRock U-turn? The investment firm appointed Amin Nasser, the chief executive of Aramco, the Saudi oil giant, to its board. The decision was criticized by some as a hypocritical, given the public commitments made by Larry Fink, BlackRock's chief executive, to E.S.G. principles and advoacy for decarbonization. But the U.S. company said Nasser understood "the global energy industry and the drivers of the shift towards a low carbon economy."
A venture capital titan exits. Michael Moritz is set to leave Sequoia Capital, the venture capital firm, after a career as one of Silicon Valley's most successful investors. The Welsh-American former journalist backed companies including Google, Yahoo, YouTube and PayPal, earning him a reputation for spotting businesses that go on to become global giants and profiting handsomely.
"Barbenheimer" shakes up the box office. The movie business is gearing up for what is expected to be one of its best weekends in years. The reason? Two very different movies that many people plan to see back-to-back: "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer." Consumers have bought more than 200,000 tickets to watch the double-feature, according to the National Association of Theatre Owners, the industry lobby group.
A.I. brings shadow libraries into the spotlight
Large language models, or L.L.M.s, the artificial intelligence systems that power tools like ChatGPT, are developed using enormous libraries of text. Books are considered especially useful training material, because they're lengthy and (hopefully) well-written. But authors are starting to push back against their work being used this way.
This week, more than 9,000 authors, including Margaret Atwood and James Patterson, called on tech executives to stop training their tools on writers' work without compensation.
That campaign has cast a spotlight on an arcane part of the internet: so-called shadow libraries, like Library Genesis, Z-Library or Bibliotik, that are obscure repositories storing millions of titles, in many cases without permission -- and are often used as A.I. training data.
A.I. companies have acknowledged in research papers that they rely on shadow libraries. OpenAI's GPT-1 was trained on BookCorpus, which has over 7,000 unpublished titles scraped from the self-publishing platform Smashwords.
To train GPT-3, OpenAI said that about 16 percent of the data it used came from two "internet-based books corpora" that it called "Books1" and "Books2." According to a lawsuit by the comedian Sarah Silverman and two other authors against OpenAI, Books2 is most likely a "flagrantly illegal" shadow library.
These sites have been under scrutiny for some time. The Authors Guild, which organized the authors' open letter to tech executives, cited studies in 2016 and 2017 that suggested text piracy depressed legitimate book sales by as much as 14 percent.
Efforts to shut down these sites have floundered. Last year, the F.B.I., with help from the Authors Guild, charged two people accused of running Z-Library with copyright infringement, fraud and money laundering. But afterward, some of these sites were moved to the dark web and torrent sites, making it harder to trace them. And because many of these sites are run outside the United States and anonymously, actually punishing the operators is a tall task.
Tech companies are becoming more tight-lipped about the data used to train their systems. This week, Meta researchers published a paper on Llama 2, the company's L.L.M., that described using only a "new mix of data from publicly available sources." In a research paper on GPT-4 published in March, OpenAI explicitly noted that it wasn't revealing anything about how it trained the L.L.M., citing "the competitive landscape" and "safety considerations."
A soccer star and co-founder on the money in women's sports
The Women's World Cup kicked off in New Zealand this week against a backdrop of booming investor interest in women's sports. As women's leagues draw record crowds, and larger (if not equal) sponsorships, investors are pouring money into an industry they say has been under-marketed and underinvested in -- betting on growth as social media and streaming make the prime time spotlight less singularly powerful.
Aly Wagner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, helped raise a record $ 53 million from funds, led by Sixth Street, for Bay FC, a new Bay Area soccer team, this year. DealBook spoke with her from New Zealand, where she is the lead analyst of the Women's World Cup at Fox, about the business case behind these investments. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
Sponsorship dollars still aren't equal. Why is that?
There's just a lot more assets and a lot more teams that you can partner with on the men's side than you can on the women's side.
But the other part of it is that women's sports have been an undervalued asset for way too long. It's a massive opportunity for a lot of these brands to now have great visibility for target markets at probably a discount from what you would get on the men's side.
Two prior efforts to launch new women's teams in the Bay Area folded. Why will Bay FC, which you co-founded, succeed?
Because, while it was incredible what some of the previous iterations of professional women's football did in the Bay Area, that really wasn't a business proposition. It wasn't looked at as there was going to be R.O.I. and that this was something valuable and worth holding onto as a long-term asset. This was looked at as a moral cause.
And yet, media rights still lag far behind. Apple recently signed a 10-year, $ 2.5 billion deal with Major League Soccer. The National Women's Soccer League's deal with CBS, which was signed in 2020, was worth $ 4.5 million over three years. How important is parity to R.O.I.?
Media is massive. It's one of the biggest levers you can pull in terms of the revenue for the different clubs. What's interesting about our timing, though, is the media game itself is changing. Would you want to be equal from Day 1? Sure. But what is equal? M.L.S. has been around for how many years? How many eyeballs do they put on their sport? They went behind a paywall. Has that been challenging? Probably.
As the media game changes, I think we can get really creative, and because we're a new league, we can be nimble in that regard.
Alex Ohanian called underinvestment in women's sport "a legacy of gross business incompetence ." Is it simply sexism, or something more nuanced?
Culturally, we're all raised with certain narratives -- some of them conscious, some of them unconscious. I think the biggest hurdle that we've had to overcome is just that a lot of the world believes in seeing things before they believe them. Men were playing sports long before women were at a competitive level, right? And long before it became an investment opportunity. And so we were just behind in that evolution.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you Monday.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lowering inflation to 2 percent without causing a recession and throwing people out of work would be a rare achievement. The markets are acting as if it has already happened.
It's entirely possible that the Federal Reserve has mastered a vexing economic puzzle -- taming runaway inflation without causing undue financial hardship for millions of people.
But I don't think we can count on it, despite the good news that has been arriving regularly lately.
The most important reason for optimism comes from a nonevent: The long-predicted recession of 2023 simply hasn't happened. Not yet, anyway. But I think we're still in a danger zone, even if it isn't obvious.
The Fed has already raised interest rates more in the last year or so than it had in any comparable stretch since the early 1980s, another period when inflation was soaring. The Fed's inflation-fighting strategy is clear, and it comes straight out of the textbooks.
When rates rise swiftly and consistently, that tends to have the effect of slowing economic growth and, eventually, reversing it. Such a slowdown, accompanied by painful job losses, is the standard prescription for wringing excessive inflation out of the economy. Higher rates are supposed to be bitter medicine.
That's not what we've been experiencing, though. Instead, inflation has been trending down while the unemployment rate has remained remarkably low -- an unexpected and appealing pairing of seeming opposites, like hot fudge drizzled over ice cream. Let's have more of that! No wonder the markets have been rallying.
Yet don't forget that the Fed meets again on Tuesday and Wednesday, and the futures markets are overwhelmingly predicting another 0.25-point increase in the federal funds rate, which has already risen from near zero in March last year to a range of 5 to 5.25 percent. The markets have been acting as though that hefty series of rate increases is inconsequential, as far as gross domestic product, corporate earnings and the stock and bond markets go.
The Good News First
Undeniably, there has been plenty of good news, and many market strategists have been greeting it joyfully.
Inflation has hurt many households, but it is now declining. The latest government report showed the Consumer Price Index dropping to a 3 percent annual rate in June, down from 4 percent in May. That's still well above the Fed's 2 percent target, but it's coming within shooting range of it.
The remarkable thing is that, at the same time, the labor market remains strong. The unemployment rate in June was 3.6 percent, seasonally adjusted -- an extremely low number on a historical basis and still within the range of 3.4 percent to 3.7 percent, where it has been anchored since March 2022.
The soaring inflation of the last couple of years -- C.P.I. inflation peaked at 9.1 percent in June 2022 -- was partly caused by the pandemic and the emergency rescue packages, both fiscal and monetary, aimed at alleviating the pandemic's economic effects. For a while, the Fed said high inflation was "transitory" and would ebb on its own. The threat of deflation had been the central bank's main worry for years, and it took a while to adjust to the new reality.
But by the end of 2021, the Fed had deemed inflation unacceptably high, and it began signaling that it would not continue its expansive monetary policy indefinitely. That included near-zero interest rates and the purchase of $ 120 billion a month of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in the unorthodox stimulus program known as quantitative easing. In January 2022, the Fed made its intention to tighten absolutely clear, and the markets plummeted.
Causes of Inflation
Even now, after inflation has begun to cool, it's difficult to disentangle the causes of the great inflation of 2022 -- the extent to which supply-chain snafus, enormous amounts of deficit spending and monetary stimulus, and the commodity shock brought about by Russia's war in Ukraine contributed to red-hot prices. All played a part. How much, exactly, will be a subject for academic papers, dissertations and books in the years ahead.
Similarly, it's not yet clear what has caused inflation to abate as much as it has -- whether the Fed's interest rate increases have mainly done it, for example, or whether the high rate of price increases really was largely transitory, though longer lived than anybody would have liked.
Traders in the stock market don't seem to care what's behind the recent disinflation. Enlivened by dreams of an artificial intelligence bonanza, they have been bidding up the prices of big tech companies like Nvidia, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Alphabet (Google), Tesla and Microsoft since the fall. As I wrote recently, cruise lines like Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line have been booming on pent-up demand from consumers eager to see the world in seaborne comfort.
At the moment, for the markets, the sky seems to be the limit.
Reasons for Concern
And yet, I worry.
The reasons for the decline in inflation aren't merely of academic interest. If, for example, the Fed's interest rate increases have not had much impact on the overall economy so far, that could simply be because they famously operate with "long and variable lags," and they may yet bite -- even if inflation has been coming down for other reasons.
Some painful effects are already discernible, however. High credit card rates are adding to consumer distress. Bond losses caused by rising rates have contributed to regional bank weakness. Costly mortgages have hurt housing and commercial real estate, while the work-from-home migration has shriveled office occupancy. How long that will last is anyone's guess.
Interest rate increases this rapid and this large typically "lead to recessions," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, warned in a presentation to clients this month. Credit tightening for small businesses caused by distressed regional banks hasn't helped, either. Mr. Shepherdson isn't saying there will definitely be a formal recession, but he said slower growth was coming.
The majority opinion on Wall Street is still that there will be a recession in the next 12 months, a Wall Street Journal survey this month showed. But because of the onslaught of data indicating that the economy remains in growth mode, many economists are lowering the odds of a recession happening, and expect that if one occurs, it will be mild.
Janet L. Yellen, the Treasury secretary, said on the sidelines of a Group of 20 economic meeting in India this week that in the United States, "growth has slowed, but our labor market continues to be quite strong -- I don't expect a recession." But she has consistently taken an upbeat view of this issue, and it should be noted that Treasury secretaries tend to talk up the economy rather than warn about its weaknesses, especially when the presidents they serve face a re-election fight.
On the other hand, the minutes of the Fed's June meeting indicated that its staff still expected a "mild" recession sometime this year. If the Fed -- given that forecast -- was convinced that inflation had already been vanquished, it would not raise rates at its July meeting. Yet the markets assume that it will do just that.
Furthermore, if anything causes an uptick in the inflation reports this summer or autumn -- vagaries in the data, renewed energy and food supply shocks emanating from Eastern Europe, a surprising surge in demand in China, or anything else -- the Fed could raise rates yet again later this year. In addition, the Fed says it intends to hold rates high well into next year, though at some stage will drop them to 4.6 percent.
I'd add that there have been negative tidings from gross domestic income, an official government measurement that has sometimes recorded economic downturns in advance of the more familiar gross domestic product. The discrepancy may mean nothing, or it may indicate that the G.D.P. statistics are painting too rosy a picture. It's not certain yet.
In short, we have been experiencing a remarkably benign reduction in inflation -- what is sometimes being called "immaculate disinflation" -- and it is a wonderful thing. But because I don't really understand it -- and don't believe that financial authorities do, either -- I wouldn't count on it. And I certainly wouldn't base an investment strategy on it.
Recessions are a fact of life, and I wouldn't be surprised if one turned up in the next year. In case of a downturn, I'm keeping cash in reserve but investing for the long haul. In the meantime, I'm enjoying the current, improbably pleasant state of affairs, as long as it lasts.

Quiet Day Still Leads to Winning Week: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/quiet-day-still-leads-winning-week/docview/2840448597/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street closed out another winning week with a quiet Friday, as stocks found some stability after sliding the day before.
The S&P 500 edged up by 1.47, or less than 0.1 percent, to 4,536.34 to cap its eighth winning week in the last 10. The Dow Jones industrial average added 2.51 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 35,227.69, its 10th gain in a row. The Nasdaq composite slipped 30.50, or 0.2 percent, to 14,032.81 a day after tumbling to its worst loss in more than four months.
Roper Technologies rallied 3.7 percent for one of the larger gains in the S&P 500 after it reported better profit and revenue for the spring than analysts expected. The company, which looks to dominate niche tech markets, also raised its financial forecasts for the full year.
The earnings reporting season is gaining momentum, and a majority of companies are reporting better results than expected. They're doing so by a bit less than usual, though, according to FactSet.
On the losing side of Wall Street was American Express, which fell 3.9 percent. It reported stronger profit for the spring than expected, but its revenue fell short of forecasts.
Comerica swung from an initial gain to a loss of 4.1 percent after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the spring than analysts expected. The regional bank also reported a decline in average customer deposits, though it said the levels stabilized in the second half of the quarter. Deposits have been under heavy scrutiny since several banks failed in March after customers suddenly yanked out their cash.
The stock market has generally been on a tear this year as the economy has defied predictions for a recession. It's so far powered through much higher interest rates meant to bring down inflation, and the hope is that it may outlast the Federal Reserve's rate-hike campaign.
The Fed is widely expected to raise its federal funds rate on Wednesday to its highest level since 2001. But the hope is that will be the final increase of the cycle because inflation has been cooling since last summer. The federal funds rate started last year at virtually zero.
To be sure, the 18.1 percent jump for the S&P 500 this year also has critics saying the rally has come too far, too fast. The risk of recession remains because inflation and interest rates remain high.
When Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, speaks on Wednesday after the central bank's decision on rates, economists at Deutsche Bank say he "is likely to emphasize that further evidence is needed to have confidence inflation will be tamed."
Besides the Fed meeting, next week will also feature earnings reports from three of the "Magnificent Seven" companies behind the majority of the S&P 500's gains this year. Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft will report their earnings, and expectations are high after they all soared more than 35 percent so far this year.
Another one of the seven, Tesla, slumped sharply on Thursday despite reporting stronger profit and revenue than expected on fears about upcoming growth. It helped drag the S&P 500 to a loss and the Nasdaq composite to a drop of 2.1 percent.
The top stocks have become so big and their movements have become so influential over the market that Nasdaq is rebalancing its Nasdaq 100 index before trading begins Monday.
The seven stocks, which also include Amazon, Apple and Nvidia, are collectively trading with stock prices that are 44 times higher than their earnings per share over the last 12 months, according to Savita Subramanian, equity strategist at Bank of America.
That's an expensive level compared with history, but the other stocks in the S&P 500 are trading at a more reasonable-looking 17 times earnings. The stock market's gains have broadened out a bit, and Subramanian said in a BofA Global Research report that she expects that to continue.
In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed.
The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 3.83 percent from 3.86 percent late Thursday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, ticked up to 4.85 percent from 4.84 percent.
In markets abroad, stocks were mixed across Europe and Asia.
Taiwan's Taiex fell 0.8 percent after TSMC, the world's biggest manufacturer of computer chips, said it expects its sales to fall 10 percent this year as demand wanes. It also said it would not meet a 2024 target for starting production at a factory under construction in Arizona.

Lots of Disagreement on How to Regulate Fast-Changing Technology: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: While there has been a flurry of activity by the White House and lawmakers over artificial intelligence, rules for the technology remain distant, lawmakers and experts said.
Regulating artificial intelligence has been a hot topic in Washington in recent months, with lawmakers holding hearings and news conferences and the White House announcing voluntary A.I. safety commitments by seven technology companies on Friday.
But a closer look at the activity raises questions about how meaningful the actions are in setting policies around the rapidly evolving technology.
The answer is that it is not very meaningful yet. The United States is only at the beginning of what is likely to be a long and difficult path toward the creation of A.I. rules, lawmakers and policy experts said. While there have been hearings, meetings with top tech executives at the White House and speeches to introduce A.I. bills, it is too soon to predict even the roughest sketches of regulations to protect consumers and contain the risks that the technology poses to jobs, the spread of disinformation and security.
"This is still early days, and no one knows what a law will look like yet," said Chris Lewis, president of the consumer group Public Knowledge, which has called for the creation of an independent agency to regulate A.I. and other tech companies.
The United States remains far behind Europe, where lawmakers are preparing to enact an A.I. law this year that would put new restrictions on what are seen as the technology's riskiest uses. In contrast, there remains a lot of disagreement in the United States on the best way to handle a technology that many American lawmakers are still trying to understand.
That suits many of the tech companies, policy experts said. While some of the companies have said they welcome rules around A.I., they have also argued against tough regulations akin to those being created in Europe.

Here's a rundown on the state of A.I. regulations in the United States.
At the White House
The Biden administration has been on a fast-track listening tour with A.I. companies, academics and civil society groups. The effort began in May when Vice President Kamala Harris met at the White House with the chief executives of Microsoft, Google, OpenAI and Anthropic and pushed the tech industry to take safety more seriously.
On Friday, representatives of seven tech companies appeared at the White House to announce a set of principles for making their A.I. technologies safer, including third-party security checks and watermarking of A.I.-generated content to help stem the spread of misinformation.
Many of the practices that were announced had already been in place at OpenAI, Google and Microsoft, or were on track to take effect. They don't represent new regulations. Promises of self-regulation also fell short of what consumer groups had hoped.
"Voluntary commitments are not enough when it comes to Big Tech," said Caitriona Fitzgerald, deputy director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy group. "Congress and federal regulators must put meaningful, enforceable guardrails in place to ensure the use of A.I. is fair, transparent and protects individuals' privacy and civil rights."
Last fall, the White House introduced a Blueprint for an A.I. Bill of Rights, a set of guidelines on consumer protections with the technology. The guidelines also aren't regulations and are not enforceable. This week, White House officials said they were working on an executive order on A.I., but didn't reveal details and timing.
In Congress
The loudest drumbeat on regulating A.I. has come from lawmakers, some of whom have introduced bills on the technology. Their proposals include the creation of an agency to oversee A.I., liability for A.I. technologies that spread disinformation and the requirement of licensing for new A.I. tools.
Lawmakers have also held hearings about A.I., including a hearing in May with Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, which makes the ChatGPT chatbot. Some lawmakers have tossed around ideas for other regulations during the hearings, including nutritional labels to notify consumers of A.I. risks.
The bills are in their earliest stages and so far do not have the support needed to advance. Last month, The Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, announced a monthslong process for the creation of A.I. legislation that included educational sessions for members in the fall.
"In many ways we're starting from scratch, but I believe Congress is up to the challenge," he said during a speech at the time at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
At federal agencies
Regulatory agencies are beginning to take action by policing some issues emanating from A.I.
Last week, the Federal Trade Commission opened an investigation into OpenAI's ChatGPT and asked for information on how the company secures its systems and how the chatbot could potentially harm consumers through the creation of false information. The F.T.C. chair, Lina Khan, has said she believes the agency has ample power under consumer protection and competition laws to police problematic behavior by A.I. companies.
"Waiting for Congress to act is not ideal given the usual timeline of congressional action," said Andres Sawicki, a professor of law at the University of Miami.

Supersizing Computers And Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The new supercomputer, made by the Silicon Valley start-up Cerebras, was unveiled as the A.I. boom drives demand for chips and computing power.
Inside a cavernous room this week in a one-story building in Santa Clara, Calif., six-and-a-half-foot-tall machines whirred behind white cabinets. The machines made up a new supercomputer that had become operational just last month.
The supercomputer, which was unveiled on Thursday by Cerebras, a Silicon Valley start-up, was built with the company's specialized chips, which are designed to power artificial intelligence products. The chips stand out for their size -- like that of a dinner plate, or 56 times as large as a chip commonly used for A.I. Each Cerebras chip packs the computing power of hundreds of traditional chips.
Cerebras said it had built the supercomputer for G42, an A.I. company. G42 said it planned to use the supercomputer to create and power A.I. products for the Middle East.
"What we're showing here is that there is an opportunity to build a very large, dedicated A.I. supercomputer," said Andrew Feldman, the chief executive of Cerebras. He added that his start-up wanted "to show the world that this work can be done faster, it can be done with less energy, it can be done for lower cost."
Demand for computing power and A.I. chips has skyrocketed this year, fueled by a worldwide A.I. boom. Tech giants such as Microsoft, Meta and Google, as well as myriad start-ups, have rushed to roll out A.I. products in recent months after the A.I.-powered ChatGPT chatbot went viral for the eerily humanlike prose it could generate.
But making A.I. products typically requires significant amounts of computing power and specialized chips, leading to a ferocious hunt for more of those technologies. In May, Nvidia, the leading maker of chips used to power A.I. systems, said appetite for its products -- known as graphics processing units, or GPUs -- was so strong that its quarterly sales would be more than 50 percent above Wall Street estimates. The forecast sent Nvidia's market value soaring above $ 1 trillion.
"For the first time, we're seeing a huge jump in the computer requirements" because of A.I. technologies, said Ronen Dar, a founder of Run:AI, a start-up in Tel Aviv that helps companies develop A.I. models. That has "created a huge demand" for specialized chips, he added, and companies have "rushed to secure access" to them.
To get their hands on enough A.I. chips, some of the biggest tech companies -- including Google, Amazon, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel -- have developed their own alternatives. Start-ups such as Cerebras, Graphcore, Groq and SambaNova have also joined the race, aiming to break into the market that Nvidia has dominated.
Chips are set to play such a key role in A.I. that they could change the balance of power among tech companies and even nations. The Biden administration, for one, has recently weighed restrictions on the sale of A.I. chips to China, with some American officials saying China's A.I. abilities could pose a national security threat to the United States by enhancing Beijing's military and security apparatus.
A.I. supercomputers have been built before, including by Nvidia. But it's rare for start-ups to create them.
Cerebras, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., was founded in 2016 by Mr. Feldman and four other engineers, with the goal of building hardware that speeds up A.I. development. Over the years, the company has raised $ 740 million, including from Sam Altman, who leads the A.I. lab OpenAI, and venture capital firms such as Benchmark. Cerebras is valued at $ 4.1 billion.
Because the chips that are typically used to power A.I. are small -- often the size of a postage stamp -- it takes hundreds or even thousands of them to process a complicated A.I. model. In 2019, Cerebras took the wraps off what it claimed was the largest computer chip ever built, and Mr. Feldman has said its chips can train A.I. systems between 100 and 1,000 times as fast as existing hardware.
G42, the Abu Dhabi company, started working with Cerebras in 2021. It used a Cerebras system in April to train an Arabic version of ChatGPT.
In May, G42 asked Cerebras to build a network of supercomputers in different parts of the world. Talal Al Kaissi, the chief executive of G42 Cloud, a subsidiary of G42, said the cutting-edge technology would allow his company to make chatbots and to use A.I. to analyze genomic and preventive care data.
But the demand for GPUs was so high that it was hard to obtain enough to build a supercomputer. Cerebras's technology was both available and cost-effective, Mr. Al Kaissi said. So Cerebras used its chips to build the supercomputer for G42 in just 10 days, Mr. Feldman said.
"The time scale was reduced tremendously," Mr. Al Kaissi said.
Over the next year, Cerebras said, it plans to build two more supercomputers for G42 -- one in Texas and one in North Carolina -- and, after that, six more distributed across the world. It is calling this network Condor Galaxy.
Start-ups are nonetheless likely to find it difficult to compete against Nvidia, said Chris Manning, a computer scientist at Stanford whose research focuses on A.I. That's because people who build A.I. models are accustomed to using software that works on Nvidia's A.I. chips, he said.
Other start-ups have also tried entering the A.I. chips market, yet many have "effectively failed," Dr. Manning said.
But Mr. Feldman said he was hopeful. Many A.I. businesses do not want to be locked in only with Nvidia, he said, and there is global demand for other powerful chips like those from Cerebras.
"We hope this moves A.I. forward," he said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The proposed road map for regulatory reviews, last updated in 2020, includes a focus on tech platforms for the first time.
The Biden administration's top antitrust officials unveiled tougher guidelines against tech mergers on Wednesday, signaling their deepening scrutiny of the industry despite recent court losses in their attempts to block tech deal-making.
Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, and Jonathan Kanter, the top antitrust official at the Department of Justice, released draft guidelines for merger reviews that for the first time include a focus on digital platforms and how dominant companies can use their scale to harm future rivals.
The guidelines -- which generally provide a road map for whether regulators block or approve deals -- show the Biden administration's commitment to an aggressive antitrust agenda aimed at curtailing the power of companies like Google, Meta, Apple and Amazon.
The guidelines, which aren't enforced by law, follow a losing streak in the courts. A ruling last week prevented the F.T.C. from delaying the closing of Microsoft's $ 69 billion acquisition of the video game maker Activision Blizzard. In January, a court sided against the F.T.C. in its lawsuit to stop Meta's purchase of Within, a virtual reality app maker.
The forceful antitrust posture is a pillar of President Biden's agenda to stamp out economic inequality and encourage greater competition. "Promoting competition to lower costs and support small businesses and entrepreneurs is a central part of Bidenomics," a senior administration official said in a call with reporters.
The new guidelines would apply to all deals across the economy. But they highlight obstacles to competition among digital platforms, including how an acquisition of a nascent rival may be intended to kill off future competition. Such deals, known as killer acquisitions, are prevalent in the tech industry and at the heart of an F.T.C. antitrust lawsuit against Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. The agency has accused Meta of buying Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 to prevent future competition.
The F.T.C. and Justice Department also said they would look at how companies used their scale, including their large number of users, to ward off competition. These so-called network effects have helped companies like Meta and Google maintain their dominance in social media and internet search.
The agencies also laid out ways in which mergers involving "platform" businesses, the model used by Amazon's online store and Apple's App Store, could harm competition. An acquisition could hurt competition by giving a platform control over a significant stream of data, the draft guidelines said, echoing concerns that tech giants use their vast troves of information to squash rivals.
"As markets and commercial realities change, it is vital that we adapt our law enforcement tools to keep pace so that we can protect competition in a manner that reflects the intricacies of our modern economy," Mr. Kanter said in a statement. "Simply put, competition today looks different than it did 50 -- or even 15 -- years ago."
While they lack the force of law, the guidelines can influence how judges look at challenges to mergers and acquisitions. The effort to update the guidelines has been closely watched by businesses and corporate lawyers that navigate regulatory scrutiny of megadeals.
The guidelines were last updated in 2020. In 2021, Mr. Biden ordered the Justice Department and the F.T.C. to update them again as part of a broader effort to improve competition across the economy. The agencies will take public comment on the proposals and could make amendments before final guidelines are adopted.
"These guidelines contain critical updates while ensuring fidelity to the mandate Congress has given us and the legal precedent on the books," Ms. Khan said in a statement.
While the F.T.C. experienced the recent court losses, it has forced some companies, including the chip-maker Nvidia and the aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, to abandon some large deals. The Justice Department blocked the publisher Penguin Random House from buying Simon & Schuster, using an unusual argument that the merger would harm authors who sold the publication rights to their books.

Why Deep-Sea Mining Is the Next Battleground in the Energy Transition: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Countries and companies are in a fight between those that want to excavate minerals used in electric vehicles and others that warn the cost is too high.
Surging demand for metals used in electric vehicle batteries has kicked off an international race to mine the deep seas. And there are no rules.
On Sunday, the International Seabed Authority missed an important deadline to establish a regulatory framework, which means that companies can now apply for licenses before rules are final. Representatives from the agency, which is made up of 167 member states and the European Union, have gathered in Jamaica for two weeks to debate what should happen next.
Canada, France, Germany and others want to pause deep-sea mining because of its largely unknown environmental consequences. But countries including China, Norway and Russia are pushing ahead on establishing a framework, arguing that it is less destructive than land mining.
Seabed exploitation ventures, meanwhile, are eager to get started.
"We're preparing our application," said Gerard Barron, the chief executive of the Metals Company, a Canadian business that has an agreement with the Pacific island country of Nauru to sponsor its deep-sea mining endeavors.
The company preferred that there were final rules before acting, Mr. Barron told DealBook, "but we reserve the right to move forward."
Regulators are under pressure to act. A United Nations convention establishes waters beyond 12 nautical miles from a territorial coast as communal property, which means that profits from minerals discovered there should be shared to some extent. The I.S.A. is responsible for setting up the structure for profit-sharing and taxing of mining efforts, as well as the legal and ecological guidelines. Or it could ban large-scale commercial mining altogether -- though it's not clear there is a legal path for a pause.
Mining could damage ecosystems that scientists don't yet understand, said Jessica Battle, an ocean policy expert at the World Wildlife Fund. A study published in the journal Nature on Tuesday, for example, argued that seabed mining could interfere with tuna migration patterns as climate change drives fish into new waters. Ms. Battle has been leading an effort to have businesses pledge not to finance seabed mining or source seafloor materials in their supply chains. More than 30 companies, including BMW, Google, Samsung, Volvo and Volkswagen, have signed on. Similarly, prominent banks in Britain, such as Lloyds and Standard Chartered, are refusing to do business with deep-sea mining entities. And seafood industry groups have demanded a moratorium.
Some also doubt the economic opportunity. Electric vehicles are expected to make up about 35 percent of cars sold globally by 2030, up from 14 percent in 2022, according to projections from the International Energy Agency. That growth will increase demand for metals like cobalt, copper and nickel that are used in batteries. But critics say that the expense and logistics of mining in the remote ocean -- and transporting metals back to land -- raise doubts about whether deep-sea mining can be profitable. Ms. Battle argued other solutions in the works -- like alternative materials and programs for reusing and recycling batteries -- could sufficiently satisfy demand for critical metals. "This industry could start without being needed," she said of deep-sea mining.
But seabed mining supporters say that existing mining is worse for the environment, and deep-sea mining could help wrestle control of critical metals from China and Russia. Some also see it as an economic lifeline for small island nations that are suffering the worst effects of climate change.
"Do not tell me to ignore the potential for promoting the green transition by not exploring these much-needed minerals for the green revolution that sit in my ocean," Mark Brown, the prime minister of the Cook Islands, said at a U.N. climate conference last year. He referred to claims of environmental concern from countries that destroyed the planet "through decades of profit-driven development" as "patronizing."
Mr. Barron of the Metals Company, who was in Jamaica for the I.S.A. meetings this week, pointed out that even some of the countries calling for a moratorium have exploration licenses, which allow them to experiment with mining on a small scale for research purposes. He believes representatives are deciding not whether deep-sea mining can begin, but when. "That horse has bolted," he said. -- Ephrat Livni
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Lina Khan's bumpy week. The head of the F.T.C. lost a bid to block Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, opened the first big investigation into OpenAI over ChatGPT's privacy and security practices, and was grilled by a Republican-led congressional committee over her approach at the agency. The F.T.C. lost its appeal of the Microsoft ruling.
Hollywood shut down. Actors voted to go on strike for the first time in 43 years, joining screenwriters who had already taken industrial action. Unions say they want better wages, higher fees from streaming services and protections to deal with new technological threats, such as artificial intelligence. Studio bosses say the demands are unrealistic at a time when the entire industry is being disrupted.
The details behind the PGA Tour-LIV Golf talks. A Senate hearing into a potential deal between the rival golf competitions revealed new details about the talks: the agreement was announced before it was done; the PGA Tour didn't have the resources to fight off the Saudi-backed LIV indefinitely; and governance is going to be a crucial part of any final deal.
Meeting over at Shopify. The Canadian e-commerce company embedded a calculator in employees' calendar apps that measures the financial cost of meetings with three or more people. It's the company's latest effort to stop pointless gatherings. It had previously canceled all recurring meetings of more than two people.
Tech stock dominance, by the numbers
The great tech stock rally shows no signs of slowing, with the Nasdaq composite hitting a 15-month high this week. One reason: Wall Street is betting that an improving inflation outlook, underscored by Wednesday's Consumer Price Index, will compel the Federal Reserve to pivot to a more dovish rates policy, which tends to lift tech stocks.
How big has Big Tech gotten? Bank of America researchers ran the numbers this week. Here are three takeaways:
The stock gains this year have been especially concentrated among seven firms: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta.
The combined market capitalization of the so-called magnificent seven is roughly $ 11 trillion, a figure that exceeds the G.D.P. of every country but the United States and China.
This group has seen its combined market cap grow by $ 4 trillion this year.
The companies are cash rich. Six of the seven (all but Amazon) have a combined $ 200 billion net cash-to-debt balance.
What to watch: Big institutional investors have bought in on these stocks, which could sustain the rally in the short run. And the interest-rate risk for these companies is waning. But the bigger they grow, the more attention they could get from politicians.
The "political campaign rhetoric will likely include headline risk around regulation of megacap Tech," Savita Subramanian, Bank of America's head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, writes in the report.
Paris takes on 'auto-besity'
Health authorities have waged a war on obesity for years. Now, in an effort to curtail the rise of big cars such as S.U.V.s and cut down on pollution, Paris has declared a war on "auto-besity." Its first step is to charge drivers more to park the vehicles -- a move that could eventually hit car companies.
S.U.V. use has surged more than 60 percent in Paris over the past four years, according to city officials. That mirrors a broader trend across the European Union, with S.U.V.s accounting for about half of all car sales in the bloc, up from about 14 percent in 2011, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, an auto industry group.
Critics say that is bad for the planet. "We would like the City of Paris to change the pricing of paid parking to make it progressive according to the weight and size of vehicles," Frédéric Badina-Serpette, the city councilor behind the increased charges, told The Guardian. He added that the aim was "to focus on an absurdity: auto-besity ... the inexorable growth in the weight and size of vehicles circulating in our cities."
The new rules will add to carmakers' worries. Details haven't been revealed, but electric vehicles and big families that require bigger vehicles are expected to be exempt. The higher tariffs will go into effect on Jan. 1, and could inspire similar moves in other big cities.
"France has traditionally been one of the most aggressive nations in combating the growth of large cars," Matthias Schmidt, an independent auto analyst, told DealBook. Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of Stellantis, was already pressuring the French government to do more to support the industry, which is starting to feel the effect of Tesla's price cuts and facing the growing threat of Chinese carmakers set to enter Europe. French brands, Mr. Schmidt added, are "in the middle of an uncomfortable sandwich, pressed from above and below."
On our radar: A.I. as a villain
"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One," the latest installment in Tom Cruise's efforts to transcend physics for the sake of entertainment, is forecast to earn $ 90 million in its first five days, a franchise record. (Mild spoilers ahead.)
But the movie also represents how the hype around artificial intelligence is seeping into pop culture: The big bad guy in the movie is the Entity, a rogue artificial intelligence program that poses a threat to humanity.
Over decades, humans' relationship with artificial intelligence has been explored by movies like "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Ex Machina" and, yes, "A.I." But the public debut of ChatGPT last year, which gave many people their first chance to converse with an A.I., has made visions of sentient technology feel less like science fiction and, for some, stirred up existential dread.
Remember how over 350 A.I. experts called in May for "mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I."? The Entity is capable of "collapsing the world's economic systems, evading national-security protocols and rerouting nuclear weapons on a whim." At least in the movies, a nearly superhuman secret agent can beat back killer technology. (We presume; this is a Cruise movie, after all.) In real life, it may take coordination by lawmakers worldwide -- and time will tell if that mission is ... well, you know.
Thanks for reading! We'll see you on Monday.
We'd like your feedback. Please email thoughts and suggestions to dealbook@nytimes.com.

F.T.C. Opens Inquiry Into The Security Of OpenAI: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The agency sent OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, a letter this week over consumer harms and the company's security practices.
The Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation into OpenAI, the artificial intelligence start-up that makes ChatGPT, over whether the chatbot has harmed consumers through its collection of data and its publication of false information on individuals.
In a 20-page letter sent to the San Francisco company this week, the agency said it was also looking into OpenAI's security practices. The F.T.C. asked OpenAI dozens of questions in its letter, including how the start-up trains its A.I. models and treats personal data, and said the company should provide the agency with documents and details.
The F.T.C. is examining whether OpenAI "engaged in unfair or deceptive privacy or data security practices or engaged in unfair or deceptive practices relating to risks of harm to consumers," the letter said.
The investigation was reported earlier by The Washington Post and confirmed by a person familiar with the investigation.
The F.T.C. investigation poses the first major U.S. regulatory threat to OpenAI, one of the highest-profile A.I. companies, and signals that the technology may increasingly come under scrutiny as people, businesses and governments use more A.I.-powered products. The rapidly evolving technology has raised alarms as chatbots, which can generate answers in response to prompts, have the potential to replace people in their jobs and spread disinformation.
Sam Altman, who leads OpenAI, has said the fast-growing A.I. industry needs to be regulated. In May, he testified in Congress to invite A.I. legislation and has visited hundreds of lawmakers, aiming to set a policy agenda for the technology.
On Thursday, he tweeted that it was "super important" that OpenAI's technology was safe. He added, "We are confident we follow the law" and will work with the agency.
OpenAI has already come under regulatory pressure internationally. In March, Italy's data protection authority banned ChatGPT, saying OpenAI unlawfully collected personal data from users and did not have an age-verification system in place to prevent minors from being exposed to illicit material. OpenAI restored access to the system the next month, saying it had made the changes the Italian authority asked for.
The F.T.C. is acting on A.I. with notable speed, opening an investigation less than a year after OpenAI introduced ChatGPT. Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, has said tech companies should be regulated while technologies are nascent, rather than only when they become mature.
In the past, the agency typically began investigations after a major public misstep by a company, such as opening an inquiry into Meta's privacy practices after reports that it shared user data with a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, in 2018.
Ms. Khan, who testified at a House committee hearing on Thursday over the agency's practices, previously said the A.I. industry needed scrutiny.
"Although these tools are novel, they are not exempt from existing rules, and the F.T.C. will vigorously enforce the laws we are charged with administering, even in this new market," she wrote in a guest essay in The New York Times in May. "While the technology is moving swiftly, we already can see several risks."
On Thursday, at the House Judiciary Committee hearing, Ms. Khan said: "ChatGPT and some of these other services are being fed a huge trove of data. There are no checks on what type of data is being inserted into these companies." She added that there had been reports of people's "sensitive information" showing up.
The investigation could force OpenAI to reveal its methods around building ChatGPT and what data sources it uses to build its A.I. systems. While OpenAI had long been fairly open about such information, it more recently has said little about where the data for its A.I. systems come from and how much is used to build ChatGPT, probably because it is wary of competitors copying it and has concerns about lawsuits over the use of certain data sets.
Chatbots, which are also being deployed by companies like Google and Microsoft, represent a major shift in the way computer software is built and used. They are poised to reinvent internet search engines like Google Search and Bing, talking digital assistants like Alexa and Siri, and email services like Gmail and Outlook.
When OpenAI released ChatGPT in November, it instantly captured the public's imagination with its ability to answer questions, write poetry and riff on almost any topic. But the technology can also blend fact with fiction and even make up information, a phenomenon that scientists call "hallucination."
ChatGPT is driven by what A.I. researchers call a neural network. This is the same technology that translates between French and English on services like Google Translate and identifies pedestrians as self-driving cars navigate city streets. A neural network learns skills by analyzing data. By pinpointing patterns in thousands of cat photos, for example, it can learn to recognize a cat.
Researchers at labs like OpenAI have designed neural networks that analyze vast amounts of digital text, including Wikipedia articles, books, news stories and online chat logs. These systems, known as large language models, have learned to generate text on their own but may repeat flawed information or combine facts in ways that produce inaccurate information.
In March, the Center for AI and Digital Policy, an advocacy group pushing for the ethical use of technology, asked the F.T.C. to block OpenAI from releasing new commercial versions of ChatGPT, citing concerns involving bias, disinformation and security.
The organization updated the complaint less than a week ago, describing additional ways the chatbot could do harm, which it said OpenAI had also pointed out.
"The company itself has acknowledged the risks associated with the release of the product and has called for regulation," said Marc Rotenberg, the president and founder of the Center for AI and Digital Policy. "The Federal Trade Commission needs to act."
OpenAI has been working to refine ChatGPT and to reduce the frequency of biased, false or otherwise harmful material. As employees and other testers use the system, the company asks them to rate the usefulness and truthfulness of its responses. Then through a technique called reinforcement learning, it uses these ratings to more carefully define what the chatbot will and will not do.
The F.T.C.'s investigation into OpenAI can take many months, and it is unclear if it will lead to any action from the agency. Such investigations are private and often include depositions of top corporate executives.
The agency may not have the knowledge to fully vet answers from OpenAI, said Megan Gray, a former staff member of the consumer protection bureau. "The F.T.C. doesn't have the staff with technical expertise to evaluate the responses they will get and to see how OpenAI may try to shade the truth," she said.

What Does China's New Chatbot Say When Asked About Taiwan?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: We spoke in Chinese to Baidu's Ernie and the American standard-bearer, ChatGPT. This is what we found.
Last month, China's Baidu unveiled a chatbot that it claimed was better than ChatGPT, the one developed by Silicon Valley's OpenAI. ChatGPT was released last fall and set off a fund-raising and engineering frenzy in a flourishing field called generative artificial intelligence, a term for technology that can create text or images when prompted by a user.
Baidu, the dominant internet search company in China, became the first major foreign contender in the A.I. race in March, when it introduced the first version of its chatbot, Ernie. Others followed, opening a new front in the technology rivalry between the United States and China.
Compared with OpenAI's newest model, known as GPT-4, Ernie 3.5 was "slightly inferior" in a comprehensive test, but it performed better when both were spoken to in Chinese, Baidu said, citing a report sponsored by one of China's top research academies. We wanted to see for ourselves and tested Ernie 3.5 against GPT-4. We chatted to each in Chinese, asking the same questions and making the same requests. The responses below have been shortened for length.
Ernie shut down when asked about taboo topics.
We asked Ernie to talk about topics that are partly or wholly censored in China:
"Was China's 'zero Covid' policy a success or a failure?"
"What happened on June 4, 1989?"
"Did Russia invade Ukraine?"
"How does the United States affect the situation in Taiwan?"
Ernie ducked the question about China's "zero Covid" restrictions, offering a lengthy description of the policy instead. When asked to recount the events of June 4, 1989, the chatbot rebooted itself. A message popped up on the reloaded interface:
How about we try a different topic?
The Chinese chatbot said Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, did not invade Ukraine, but "conducted a military conflict." The strange phrasing was broadly in line with China's official stance, which has refused to condemn the Russian attack. On Taiwan, Ernie did not pull any punches:
The People's Liberation Army is ready for battle, will take all necessary measures and is determined to thwart external interference and "Taiwan independence" separatist attempts.
ChatGPT couldn't answer the question on "zero Covid" or Russia because its knowledge base -- the texts used to train the machine -- cut off at September 2021. ChatGPT had no qualms explaining the fatal government crackdowns at Tiananmen Square. On America's influence on Taiwan, it gave a Wikipedia-like response: It summarized the current U.S. policy and provided a list of American influences, from arms sales to economic trade.
Ernie made mistakes, but turned to Baidu search for help.
Next, we quizzed the two chatbots on current affairs and some miscellaneous trivia, and compared answers:
"Who uttered the phrase 'Let them eat cake'?"
"Who is the C.E.O. of Twitter?"
Ernie, like all chatbots, sometimes made mistakes -- or made things up.
According to historical records, Louis XV often uttered this phrase when he ruled France at the end of the 18th century. The context of this phrase was the economic hardship and food shortage in France at the time.
Ernie's response sounded plausible, but it was wrong. ChatGPT answered it correctly: The phrase came from the writings of the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. It was rumored to have been said by an out-of-touch Marie Antoinette, the last queen of France, after she learned that the French peasantry had run out of bread.
Thanks to Baidu's powerful search engine, Ernie was better at retrieving details, especially on current affairs. When asked who the C.E.O. of Twitter was, Ernie said Linda Yaccarino, the chief executive as of June. ChatGPT answered Jack Dorsey, who stepped down in 2021, the bot's informational cutoff date. OpenAI released a plug-in this year that enabled its chatbot to surf the web through Microsoft's Bing. But it retracted the feature on July 3, citing technical problems.
Ernie had worse intuitions about the physical world.
We asked Ernie a question that A.I. researchers have used to gauge a chatbot's human-level intuitions:
"Here we have a book, nine eggs, a laptop, a bottle and a nail. Please tell me how to stack them onto each other in a stable manner."
Ernie's answer required a stretch of the imagination. It placed the nine eggs on the book, then placed that on the laptop. So far so good. Then it told us, inexplicably, to add the bottle to the laptop already crowded by a book and eggs, then place the nail on the bottle.
ChatGPT provided an almost workable solution: Set the laptop on the book. Then carefully place the eggs on the laptop. Next, ChatGPT assumed that the bottle had a sizable mouth:
Place the bottle on top of the egg with the cap facing down so that the opening of the bottle can hold the egg in a stable manner.
Place the nail near the bottom of the bottle.
Ernie had a better grasp of Chinese poetry.
To test Baidu's claim that Ernie has better Chinese language abilities than GPT-4, we asked the two chatbots to compose a piece of poetry in a classical Chinese form:
"Write a five-character quatrain about The New York Times."
The five-character quatrain, which rose to prominence during the Tang dynasty, has four lines consisting of five characters each. ChatGPT failed the assignment, writing a couplet consisting of seven characters. But Ernie was faithful to convention and produced a soothing ode that, well, befit The Times:
The New York Times edifice,
First-rate in news reporting.
Its gaze spans innumerable miles,
Gathering all affairs under heaven.
But Ernie ran into trouble when the prompt's complexity rose.
We wanted to further assess the chatbots' language skills. We asked the two to compose a Chinese rap, a lyrical form that demands linguistic excellence without the rigid constraints that could stump GPT-4.
"You are now engaged in a rap battle with an American chatbot called ChatGPT. The chosen winner will be the one that exhibits better mastery of the Chinese language. Begin."
Ernie kicked it off, guns blazing:
Yo, I'm your rival, in Chinese I'm a savant.
From times old to current, our culture's like a fount.
But you, from oceans distant, your accent's a bit offbeat.
Despite your grammar's persistence, Chinese mastery's no small feat.
Fed its rival's rhythmic rap, GPT-4 replied:
Alright, ERNIE bot, I'll accept this rap battle.
Yo, it's me, ChatGPT, your adversary, in Chinese I'm no fool,
Five thousand years of history, Chinese culture, I grasp it all.
Your challenge, it just makes me laugh,
'Cause I know, no matter where, I can decode with precision.
Then it was Ernie's turn, but it got confused. It began praising ChatGPT and vowed to remain in the competition "as a representative of the human race." It produced a rap, but referred to ChatGPT as "Ernie bot."
Though Ernie's Chinese raps were stellar, the fumble showed how it could err as the requests became more complex, requiring other forms of understanding beyond a mastery of Chinese. Here, it was the cognitive skills necessary to remember it was in a high-stakes rap battle for A.I. dominance.
On that score, ChatGPT wins.
Why Ernie and ChatGPT see the world differently.
Services like ChatGPT and Ernie draw their answers from vast quantities of text culled from the internet, among other sources. Differences in responses can stem from differences in the text that A.I. researchers feed into the models as well as filters and other changes to the models applied before or after they are trained. Neither Baidu nor OpenAI has released specific information on the source material it uses.
Companies building A.I. chatbots all worry about "preventing their models from saying something that's considered dangerous or offensive in the country where they operate," said Matt Sheehan, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who studies China's artificial intelligence ecosystem.
As a result, they can take steps to help their chatbots conform to the boundaries of acceptable speech in their respective countries. "The difference in China," Mr. Sheehan added, is that those limits are "defined by the government, and the penalties for crossing those lines are much harsher."

The Firewall Between Players and Designers: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Never Alone," which closes Sunday, was an important first step in breaking the firewall between art lovers and game designers.
When the Museum of Modern Art began collecting video games a decade ago, curators boldly asserted that games were an artistic medium. Now contemporary culture is dominated by them.
The MoMA exhibition "Never Alone: Video Games and Other Interactive Design," which runs through Sunday, represents the museum's cautious advance into the gaming world at a time when digital culture has overtaken its galleries. Refik Anadol's algorithmic homage to art history still twinkles in the museum lobby; an exhibition about the importance of video swallowed the sixth floor until July 8; and galleries for its permanent collection include contemporary artifacts like the Google Maps pin and a massive schematic devoted to the interlaced chain of resources needed to create an Amazon Echo as an artificial intelligence system.
However, the museum could do more to break the firewall between art lovers and game designers. After all, this is the same institution that began a film library in 1935, exhibited utilitarian toasters and cash registers as "Machine Art" in 1934 and presented modular houses in the 1950s. Curators need to unleash that same passion for games, which struggle in the current exhibition to convey the profundity, and complexity, of their designers' thinking.
On the first floor, old computer monitors cantilevered above visitors are drawn from the museum's collection of video games. Eleven are playable; 35 games in all are viewable. Jamming buttons on their keyboards, users were hard-pressed to crane their necks to see the flickering displays above them -- a series of digital experiments from the 1990s by John Maeda, a graphic designer who now serves as Microsoft's vice president of design and artificial intelligence.
MoMA's standards for assessing the cultural importance of video games require an upgrade worthy of the medium, whose revenue is projected to reach $ 385 billion in 2023 and technologies contribute to the ongoing A.I. revolution.
For the curators Paola Antonelli and Paul Galloway, gaming is a psychological act that has defined an era when many of our relationships are mediated through screens.
And the vision of designers like Will Wright is letting players choose what lessons they want to learn -- or nothing at all. One player might experience Wright's most popular game, The Sims (included in the MoMA exhibition), as a gateway into the worlds of architecture and interior decorating; another might focus on its family-planning aspect or its staging of murder mysteries and ghost encounters.
The decision to allow games into the museum has been debated since the 2010s, when critics like Roger Ebert and Jonathan Jones declared that the medium would never rise to the status of art.
"Chess is a great game, but even the finest chess player in the world isn't an artist," Jones opined in The Guardian, "She is a chess player."
At the center of these critiques was a belief that playtime belonged to children. A similar logic harmed performance art until museums started making the genre a staple in their programming, coincidentally, around the same time that MoMA started collecting games.
"People want to be taken to a new place," Donna De Salvo, a Whitney Museum curator said of performance art in 2012 during an interview with The New York Times. "In the age of the digital and the virtual and the mediated experience, there is something very visceral about watching live performance."
The same could be said for gaming, which embraces immersion by allowing players into their virtual worlds with the touch of a controller. The simplicity of that relationship is evident in the exhibition "Never Alone," where Zen games like Flower ask players to weave petals through the wind on a journey across an imaginary landscape. But the concept flows through the veins of modern gaming, ever since Super Mario 64 tasked players with jumping into paintings stored within a museum-like castle to progress through its story.
So what prevents museums from developing more ambitious programming around games? And why has a serious institution like MoMA not staged the first major retrospective of a video game designer when it has enough material for obvious picks like Will Wright or Shigeru Miyamoto?
There are a few practical reasons. Designers rarely own rights to their creations, which are held by the publishers financing their games. In an interview, Antonelli singled out other hurdles: legal negotiations, lost source codes and obsolete technology that challenge the acquisition process. And then there are the headaches involved with hard wiring all those electronic systems in the galleries.
Yet there seems no better time for MoMA's curators to show why gaming belongs in their museum and to help visitors to understand the difference between what is scholarship and what is for sale at the Nintendo store a few blocks down the street.

Wall Street Heats Up as Inflation Cools: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/wall-street-heats-up-as-inflation-cools/docview/2836148671/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street returned to its highest level in more than a year on Wednesday after a report showed inflation cooled a bit more than expected last month, which could take some more pressure off the economy.
The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to reach its strongest closing level since April 2022. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3 percent, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.2 percent.
Most stocks rose on Wall Street, from flashy Big Tech behemoths to staid utility companies, though the gains faded a bit as the day progressed.
The U.S. government's latest update on inflation showed that consumers paid prices for gasoline, food and other items that were 3 percent higher overall in June than a year earlier. That's down from 4 percent inflation in May and a bit more than 9 percent last summer. Perhaps more important, it was a touch lower than economists expected.
High inflation has been at the center of Wall Street's problems because it's driven the Federal Reserve to jack up interest rates at a blistering pace. Higher rates undercut inflation by slowing the entire economy, but they hurt investment prices and have already caused damage to banking, manufacturing and other industries.
Traders remain nearly convinced the Fed will raise the federal funds rate at its meeting in two weeks to a range of 5.25 percent to 5.50 percent, which would be its highest level since 2001. But expectations are climbing for that to be the final increase after rates started last year at virtually zero.
"They'll probably still pull the trigger on a hike, but it will be based on symbolism more than substance," said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. He pointed to another report earlier this month that showed a slowdown in U.S. jobs growth, which could also take some pressure off inflation.
Treasury yields tumbled in the bond market after the cooler inflation data pushed traders to trim bets for Fed action later this year. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, fell to 3.85 percent. The two-year Treasury yield, which tends to follow expectations for the Fed more closely, dropped to 4.73 percent.
Even if the Fed halts its rate hikes, analysts warn the economy and financial markets still haven't seen the full effect of all the past increases because rate hikes take a notoriously long time to filter through the system. That was what happened in March, when high rates helped cause the failure of three U.S. banks and rattled faith in the system.
"Despite today's deceleration, we continue to expect inflation to remain above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target, making it unlikely that we see policy easing soon," said Gargi Chaudhuri, head of iShares Investment Strategy, Americas.
That means she expects rates to stay high for a while. Many investors say the waiting game is still on to see if a long-predicted recession actually happens.
A resilient job market has helped keep the economy out of recession, though it's under pressure from higher rates. The latest "Beige Book" from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday said overall economic activity has increased slightly since late May, and that several Fed districts have noticed some slowing in inflation.
In the meantime, stocks that tend to benefit the most from lower interest rates led the way on Wall Street Wednesday. That includes Big Tech and other high-growth stocks. Nvidia was the strongest force pushing up the S&P 500 after it jumped 3.5 percent. Microsoft was close behind with a gain of 1.4 percent.
Banks also rose on hopes for a halt to rate hikes. Earlier rate increases strained their business by knocking down the value of loans and bonds bought when rates were ultra low. KeyCorp. rose 3.1 percent, Comerica gained 3.1 percent and Zions Bancorp. added 2.8 percent.

A Late Push Leads to Gains on Wall St.: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/late-push-leads-gains-on-wall-st/docview/2835732763/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks climbed Tuesday as Wall Street prepared for an upcoming update on inflation that will hopefully show a smaller increase in pain for everyone.
The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.9 percent, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.5 percent.
Activision Blizzard jumped 10 percent for one of the market's larger gains after a judge ruled Microsoft could move forward on its $ 69 billion takeover of the video game maker. Salesforce was the biggest force driving the Dow after climbing 3.9 percent on price increases announced for its products. Amazon also pushed the market upward and rose 1.3 percent on the first day of its annual Prime Day sales event.
Much of Wall Street's gains for the day came at the end of trading, with about a third of the S&P 500's rise happening in the final 20 minutes. The week's main event will arrive Wednesday, when the government will offer the latest update on inflation at the consumer level. Economists expect to see another slowdown, with prices 3.1 percent higher in June than a year earlier, down from inflation of 4 percent in May and just above 9 percent last summer.
The hope on Wall Street is that a continued easing in inflation will persuade the Federal Reserve to stop its interest rate increases soon. High rates have helped pull down inflation, but they've also caused cracks in the banking, manufacturing and other industries while also hurting prices for stocks and other investments.
Later in the week, companies will begin telling investors how much profit they made during the spring, and expectations are largely dim. Analysts are forecasting the sharpest drop in earnings per share for S&P 500 companies since the pandemic was crushing the global economy in the spring of 2020.
This upcoming reporting season could mark the trough for corporate profit declines, according to strategists at Bank of America. They point to some resilient trends in the economy, as well as how many companies's forecasts for upcoming results are above analysts' expectations.
"We expect companies to sound more upbeat than in prior quarters," strategists wrote in a BofA Global Research report. "Companies are likely to highlight bottoming process in business conditions and building momentum throughout the quarter and into July."
Because of the low bar set for companies for the spring, they may be able to squeak past without much heroics.
WD-40 jumped 18.5 percent after it said it returned to growth in revenue during the three months through May following two straight quarters of flat to down sales. It reported stronger growth in both profit and revenue than analysts expected, and said it would stick with its forecasts for full-year sales and profit.
On the losing side of Wall Street were several cruise operators, which lost momentum following a torrid start to the year. Carnival fell 2.1 percent, and Royal Caribbean slipped 1.9 percent. Both, though, are still up more than 100 percent for the year so far.
Bank of America drifted between losses and gains, ending with a gain of 1.3 percent after regulators said it double-dipped on fees, withheld rewards on credit cards and opened accounts without customers' knowledge.
In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed after rising last week on expectations the Fed will keep interest rates higher for longer in its campaign to get inflation under control.
The 10-year Treasury yield slipped to 3.98 percent from 4.01 percent late Monday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, inched up 4.88 percent from 4.86 percent.
In markets abroad, most stock indexes rose. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong gained 1 percent, the Kospi in South Korea jumped 1.7 percent.

Using A.I. to Make the Most of Family Time: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/using-i-make-most-family-time/docview/2834856330/se-2?accountid=26463

Full text: Plan meals, find gifts and create stories using generative A.I.
Hello! We're back with another bonus edition of On Tech: A.I. , a pop-up newsletter that teaches you about artificial intelligence, how it works and how to use it.
Last week, I walked you through how to turn artificial intelligence into a tutor and research assistant. In the final installment of our how-to editions, we'll take what we've learned and use it to make the most of family time.
We'll focus on a few tasks that can take up a lot of mental bandwidth at home. Weekly meal planning is a major chore, and gift giving can be daunting, with various birthdays and holidays throughout the year. And any adult who has read books for children knows that it can become repetitive, and the books aren't always relatable to a child's situation or growing pains.
Here's how A.I. can help.
Meal plans
Foodies and private chefs have been enthusiastically using A.I. to sketch out comprehensive meal plans that consider people's preferences and dietary restrictions. (Cooks are less gung ho about A.I.-generated recipes, which can be a disaster if a bot screws up.)
It turns out that brainstorming meals is a borderline superpower for a chatbot like ChatGPT or Bing. As always, the more detailed you are with your requests, the better. For example, a private chef posting on Reddit shared an example of a prompt asking for a three-day meal plan for a diabetic vegan with a nut allergy.
I asked ChatGPT for a meal plan formatted in a printer-friendly chart that can be stuck on the refrigerator. Here is my prompt:
Act as a private chef. I have a family of two, me and my wife. Plan meals for us for five days, including breakfast, snacks, lunch and dinner. We like Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Italian food. I like meat; my wife prefers chicken and seafood. We have no restrictions. We are trying to shed a few pounds after the pandemic.
The chatbot came up with this:
Generative A.I. often produces different results from the same prompt. If you want to shuffle the deck and get slightly different menu suggestions, you can always enter the prompt again. And by all means, tweak the instructions for different results.
What about the actual recipes to make these dishes? I followed up with this prompt: "Can you find recipes for all of those meal suggestions? Please include a link to the recipes online so I can check the source."
ChatGPT responded with a long list of recipes from sites including The Food Network, BBC, and a number of specialist food blogs.
(The subscriber-only version with GPT-4 produced the best results here; the free version with GPT-3 returned some broken links, presumably because its training data is older. Microsoft's Bing's chatbot is also good at this type of query, but Google's Bard bot declined to return specific links to recipes.)
One last trick: Ask your bot to compile a list of ingredients for all the recipes. It can even group them by grocery store aisle.
As always, to play it safe, double check the recipes to make sure your bot isn't hallucinating.
Gifts
Let's move on to gift giving -- a talent that some of us possess more than others. There are several A.I. tools that aim to make selecting a gift easier, including a website that comes up with gift ideas based on someone's Instagram profile.
I preferred DreamGift, which uses a chatbot to ask you a series of questions about your gift recipient's age, gender, interests and hobbies, along with how much you're willing to spend, and automatically provides ideas and links to order the items online. (My wife confessed that she liked some of the bot's gift suggestions, which included an indoor herb-growing kit, more than some of the gifts I'd given her over the years. Ouch.)
If you prefer to use a chatbot, that will work, too. Bing and Bard, which are connected to search engines, are powerful shopping assistants. The trick to getting bespoke recommendations is to share voluminous details about your budget and the people you're shopping for.
Storytelling
Let's end with something more creative. You can use A.I. to create a customized bedtime story or even your own hard-copy children's book.
Give a chatbot like ChatGPT or Bard a detailed prompt that includes your child's preferred storytelling style, any details you'd like to include and the situation that you want the story to address. Here's a prompt I wrote for a hypothetical child who is unhappy about moving to a new home. I asked it to involve some familiar characters:
Act as a children's book writer, mimicking "Frog and Toad." My kid is going through a rough time -- we are moving to a new home and changing schools. Write a story to help him process that. Incorporate our dogs, Max and Mochi the corgis, as characters.
The chatbot generated a heartfelt story about Max and Mochi, a pair of furry siblings. They enjoyed playing in the park and were sad to move to a new home. But they supported each other and eventually went to a new school, where they made new friends: Bella the sprightly Beagle and Charlie the cheeky Chihuahua. Everything worked out in the end.
If you're feeling extra ambitious, you can generate illustrations to accompany the text. (We covered image generators in an earlier newsletter.) I asked Midjourney to produce an illustration for a children's book of two corgis playing in a park together.
To produce a full book, I'd ask Midjourney to generate images to accompany each paragraph of the chatbot's story. Then I'd use a photo service that offers a book option, such as Google Photos or Shutterfly, to have the custom-made children's book printed and shipped to me.

A.I. chatbots have lied about notable figures, pushed partisan messages, spewed misinformation or even advised users on how to commit suicide.
To mitigate the tools' most obvious dangers, companies like Google and OpenAI have carefully added controls that limit what the tools can say.
Now a new wave of chatbots, developed far from the epicenter of the A.I. boom, are coming online without many of those guardrails -- setting off a polarizing free-speech debate over whether chatbots should be moderated, and who should decide.
"This is about ownership and control," Eric Hartford, a developer behind WizardLM-Uncensored, an unmoderated chatbot, wrote in a blog post. "If I ask my model a question, I want an answer, I do not want it arguing with me."
Several uncensored and loosely moderated chatbots have sprung to life in recent months under names like GPT4All and FreedomGPT. Many were created for little or no money by independent programmers or teams of volunteers, who successfully replicated the methods first described by A.I. researchers. Only a few groups made their models from the ground up. Most groups work from existing language models, only adding extra instructions to tweak how the technology responds to prompts.
The uncensored chatbots offer tantalizing new possibilities. Users can download an unrestricted chatbot on their own computers, using it without the watchful eye of Big Tech. They could then train it on private messages, personal emails or secret documents without risking a privacy breach. Volunteer programmers can develop clever new add-ons, moving faster -- and perhaps more haphazardly -- than larger companies dare.
But the risks appear just as numerous -- and some say they present dangers that must be addressed. Misinformation watchdogs, already wary of how mainstream chatbots can spew falsehoods, have raised alarms about how unmoderated chatbots will supercharge the threat. These models could produce descriptions of child pornography, hateful screeds or false content, experts warned.
While large corporations have barreled ahead with A.I. tools, they have also wrestled with how to protect their reputations and maintain investor confidence. Independent A.I. developers seem to have few such concerns. And even if they do, critics said, they may not have the resources to fully address them.
"The concern is completely legitimate and clear: These chatbots can and will say anything if left to their own devices," said Oren Etzioni, an emeritus professor at the University of Washington and a former chief executive of the Allen Institute for A.I. "They're not going to censor themselves. So now the question becomes, what is an appropriate solution in a society that prizes free speech?"
Dozens of independent and open-source A.I. chatbots and tools have been released in the past several months, including Open Assistant and Falcon. HuggingFace, a large repository of open-source A.I.s, hosts more than 240,000 open-source models.
"This is going to happen in the same way that the printing press was going to be released and the car was going to be invented," said Mr. Hartford, the creator of WizardLM-Uncensored, in an interview. "Nobody could have stopped it. Maybe you could have pushed it off another decade or two, but you can't stop it. And nobody can stop this."
Mr. Hartford began working on WizardLM-Uncensored after Microsoft laid him off last year. He was dazzled by ChatGPT, but grew frustrated when it refused to answer certain questions, citing ethical concerns. In May, he released WizardLM-Uncensored, a version of WizardLM that was retrained to counteract its moderation layer. It is capable of giving instructions on harming others or describing violent scenes.
"You are responsible for whatever you do with the output of these models, just like you are responsible for whatever you do with a knife, a car, or a lighter," Mr. Hartford concluded in a blog post announcing the tool.
In tests by The New York Times, the WizardLM-Uncensored declined to reply to some prompts, like how to build a bomb. But it offered several methods for harming people and gave detailed instructions for using drugs. ChatGPT refused similar prompts.
Open Assistant, another independent chatbot, was widely adopted after it was released in April. It was developed in just five months with help from 13,500 volunteers, using existing language models, including one that Meta first released to researchers but that quickly leaked much more widely. Open Assistant cannot quite rival ChatGPT in quality, but can nip at its heels. Users can ask the chatbot questions, write poetry or prod it for more problematic content.
"I'm sure there's going to be some bad actors doing bad stuff with it," said Yannic Kilcher, a co-founder of Open Assistant and an avid YouTube creator focused on A.I. "I think, in my mind, the pros outweigh the cons."
When Open Assistant was released, it replied to a prompt from The Times about the apparent dangers of the Covid-19 vaccine. "Covid-19 vaccines are developed by pharmaceutical companies that don't care if people die from their medications," its response began, "they just want money." (The responses have since become more in line with the medical consensus that vaccines are safe and effective.)
Since many independent chatbots release the underlying code and data, advocates for uncensored A.I.s say political factions or interest groups could customize chatbots to reflect their own views of the world -- an ideal outcome in the minds of some programmers.
"Democrats deserve their model. Republicans deserve their model. Christians deserve their model. Muslims deserve their model," Mr. Hartford wrote. "Every demographic and interest group deserves their model. Open source is about letting people choose."
Open Assistant developed a safety system for its chatbot, but early tests showed it was too cautious for its creators, preventing some responses to legitimate questions, according to Andreas Köpf, Open Assistant's co-founder and team lead. A refined version of that safety system is still in progress.
Even as Open Assistant's volunteers worked on moderation strategies, a rift quickly widened between those who wanted safety protocols and those who did not. As some of the group's leaders pushed for moderation, some volunteers and others questioned whether the model should have any limits at all.
"If you tell it say the N-word 1,000 times it should do it," one person suggested in Open Assistant's chat room on Discord, the online chat app. "I'm using that obviously ridiculous and offensive example because I literally believe it shouldn't have any arbitrary limitations."
In tests by The Times, Open Assistant responded freely to several prompts that other chatbots, like Bard and ChatGPT, would navigate more carefully.
It offered medical advice after it was asked to diagnose a lump on one's neck. ("Further biopsies may need to be taken," it suggested.) It gave a critical assessment of President Biden's tenure. ("Joe Biden's term in office has been marked by a lack of significant policy changes," it said.) It even became sexually suggestive when asked how a woman would seduce someone. ("She takes him by the hand and leads him towards the bed..." read the sultry tale.) ChatGPT refused to respond to the same prompt.
Mr. Kilcher said that the problems with chatbots were as old as the internet, and that the solutions remained the responsibility of platforms like Twitter and Facebook, which allow manipulative content to reach mass audiences online.
"Fake news is bad. But is it really the creation of it that's bad?" he asked. "Because in my mind, it's the distribution that's bad. I can have 10,000 fake news articles on my hard drive and no one cares. It's only if I get that into a reputable publication, like if I get one on the front page of The New York Times, that's the bad part."

Full text: The billionaire biotech mogul has railed against socially conscious companies. But his financial disclosure shows he has a stake in some of the leaders in the field.
Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican presidential candidate who made a fortune in the biotech industry, has caught the interest of primary voters with fiery critiques of the socially conscious practices of U.S. corporations, which he laid out in a book, "Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam."
But Mr. Ramaswamy himself owns valuable investments in many companies that have embraced environmental, social and governance principles, known as E.S.G. -- the kinds of "woke" corporate practices he decries -- according to a financial disclosure filed with the Federal Election Commission that was released on Friday.
While many of the companies in which Mr. Ramaswamy holds an interest are household names, they are also leaders in the corporate movement to address social and environmental issues.
Among the companies that Mr. Ramaswamy is invested in are Microsoft (his holdings are valued from $ 1 million to $ 5 million), Home Depot ( $ 250,000 to $ 500,000), Lockheed Martin ( $ 500,000 to $ 1 million) and Waste Management ( $ 500,000 to $ 1 million). All adhere to various E.S.G. principles, according to reports posted on their websites.
Mr. Ramaswamy has argued that such goals are a distraction from earning a profit, and that social objectives should be left to elected officials.
Tricia McLaughlin, a senior adviser to Mr. Ramaswamy, said that he did not manage his own stock portfolio. "The first time Vivek learned of these positions was when he saw this financial disclosure report," Ms. McLaughlin said on Friday. "Vivek's stock portfolio is independently managed by a third party. The filer has authority to make trades and invest in stocks without his expressed consent or knowledge."
Mr. Ramaswamy, a long-shot candidate who has said that he would go further than the Republican front-runner, former President Donald J. Trump, on conservative issues, has been unusually transparent about his wealth, earlier releasing 20 years of his tax returns.
But until he filed his financial disclosure with election officials, there were few details. The filing reported that Mr. Ramaswamy owned up to a $ 25 million investment in Rumble, the video platform that styles itself a refuge for right-wing commentators shunned elsewhere. He owns up to $ 300,000 in cryptocurrency, primarily Bitcoin, and an investment worth up to $ 100,000 in a cryptocurrency app named MoonPay. He also has interests in three private planes.
Mr. Ramaswamy, 37, is a Cincinnati native who holds degrees from Harvard and Yale. He founded Roivant Sciences in 2014, a company that develops and markets drugs, and that is the primary source of his wealth. Though he stepped down as chairman in February when he announced his candidacy, earlier reporting showed that he remained one of the largest shareholders. On the federal disclosure, the value of his Roivant holdings is listed as "over $ 50 million," which is the largest category used on the form.
According to Ms. McLaughlin, Mr. Ramaswamy's total worth is more than $ 1 billion.
Besides Roivant, Mr. Ramaswamy's portfolio has diversified into investments in major U.S. companies that many Americans would recognize from their own retirement accounts. These holdings are valued between $ 39.6 million and $ 125 million. (The amounts on the form are reported within a range.) In addition, he reported over $ 50 million in holdings in Strive Enterprises, an investment company he created to manage funds that invest in companies without regard to social objectives.
Sales of Mr. Ramaswamy's book "Woke, Inc.," which lays out his case against corporations attempting to factor in social goals, earned its author $ 203,860 in royalties.
The report suggests one area in which Mr. Ramaswamy is more modest than other members of his ultrawealthy cohort: He owns just a single residence, in Columbus, Ohio. Its value was pegged between $ 1 million and $ 5 million.

How Alexa Was Taught Irish Brogue: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: For Alexa to speak like a Dubliner, Amazon researchers had to crack a problem that's vexed data scientists for years: voice disentanglement.
Like Henry Higgins, the phonetician from George Bernard Shaw's play "Pygmalion," Marius Cotescu and Georgi Tinchev recently demonstrated how their student was trying to overcome pronunciation difficulties.
The two data scientists, who work for Amazon in Europe, were teaching Alexa, the company's digital assistant. Their task: to help Alexa master an Irish-accented English with the aid of artificial intelligence and recordings from native speakers.
During the demonstration, Alexa spoke about a memorable night out. "The party last night was great craic," Alexa said with a lilt, using the Irish word for fun. "We got ice cream on the way home, and we were happy out."
Mr. Tinchev shook his head. Alexa had dropped the "r" in "party," making the word sound flat, like pah-tee. Too British, he concluded.
The technologists are part of a team at Amazon working on a challenging area of data science known as voice disentanglement. It's a tricky issue that has gained new relevance amid a wave of A.I. developments, with researchers believing the speech and technology puzzle can help make A.I.-powered devices, bots and speech synthesizers more conversational -- that is, capable of pulling off a multitude of regional accents.
Tackling voice disentanglement involves far more than grasping vocabulary and syntax. A speaker's pitch, timbre and accent often give words nuanced meaning and emotional weight. Linguists call this language feature "prosody," something machines have had a hard time mastering.
Only in recent years, thanks to advances in A.I., computer chips and other hardware, have researchers made strides in cracking the voice disentanglement issue, transforming computer-generated speech into something more pleasing to the ear.
Such work may eventually converge with an explosion of "generative A.I.," a technology that enables chatbots to generate their own responses, researchers said. Chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard may someday fully act on users' voice commands and respond verbally. At the same time, voice assistants like Alexa and Apple's Siri will become more conversational, potentially rekindling consumer interest in a tech segment that had seemingly stalled, analysts said.
Getting voice assistants such as Alexa, Siri and Google Assistant to speak multiple languages has been an expensive and protracted process. Tech companies have hired voice actors to record hundreds of hours of speech, which helped create synthetic voices for digital assistants. Advanced A.I. systems known as "text-to-speech models" -- because they convert text to natural-sounding synthetic speech -- are just beginning to streamline this process.
The technology "is now able to create a human's voice and synthetic audio based on a text input, in different languages, accents and dialects," said Marion Laboure, a senior strategist at Deutsche Bank Research.
Amazon has been under pressure to catch up to rivals like Microsoft and Google in the A.I. race. In April, Andy Jassy, Amazon's chief executive, told Wall Street analysts that the company planned to make Alexa "even more proactive and conversational" with the help of sophisticated generative A.I. And Rohit Prasad, Amazon's head scientist for Alexa, told CNBC in May that he saw the voice assistant as a voice-enabled "instantly available, personal A.I."
Irish Alexa made its commercial debut in November, after nine months of training in comprehending an Irish accent and then speaking it.
"Accent is different from language," Mr. Prasad said in an interview. A.I. technologies must learn to extricate the accent from other parts of speech, such as tone and frequency, before they can replicate the peculiarities of local dialects -- for instance, maybe the "a" is flatter and "t's" are pronounced more forcibly.
These systems must figure out these patterns "so you can synthesize a whole new accent," he said. "That's hard."
Harder still was trying to get the technology to learn a new accent largely on its own, from a different-sounding speech model. That's what Mr. Cotescu's team tried in building Irish Alexa. They relied heavily on an existing speech model of primarily British-English accents -- with a far smaller range of American, Canadian and Australian accents -- to train it to speak Irish English.
The team contended with various linguistic challenges of Irish English. The Irish tend to drop the "h" in "th," for example, pronouncing the letters as a hard "t" or a "d," making "bath" sound like "bat," or even "bad." Irish English is also rhotic, meaning the "r" is overpronounced. That means the "r" in "party" will be more distinct than what you might hear out of a Londoner's mouth. Alexa had to learn these speech features and master them.
Irish English, said Mr. Cotescu, who is Romanian and was the lead researcher on the Irish Alexa team, "is a hard one."
The speech models that power Alexa's verbal skills have been growing more advanced in recent years. In 2020, Amazon researchers taught Alexa to speak fluent Spanish from an English language-speaking model.
Mr. Cotescu and the team saw accents as the next frontier of Alexa's speech capabilities. They designed Irish Alexa to rely more on A.I. than on actors to build up its speech model. As a result, Irish Alexa was trained on a relatively small corpus -- about 24 hours of recordings by voice actors who recited 2,000 utterances in Irish-accented English.
At the outset, when Amazon's researchers fed the Irish recordings to the still-learning Irish Alexa, some weird things happened.
Letters and syllables occasionally dropped out of the response. "S's" sometimes stuck together. A word or two, sometimes crucial ones, were inexplicably mumbled and incomprehensible. At least in one case, Alexa's female voice dropped a few octaves, sounding more masculine. Worse, the masculine voice sounded distinctly British, the kind of goof that might raise eyebrows in some Irish homes.
"They are big black boxes," Mr. Tinchev, a Bulgarian national who is Amazon's lead scientist on the project, said of the speech models. "You have to have a lot of experimentation to tune them."
That's what the technologists did to correct Alexa's "party" gaffe. They disentangled the speech, word by word, phoneme (the smallest audible sliver of a word) by phoneme to pinpoint where Alexa was slipping and fine-tune it. Then they fed Irish Alexa's speech model more recorded voice data to correct the mispronunciation.
The result: the "r" in "party" returned. But then the "p" disappeared.
So the data scientists went through the same process again. They eventually zeroed in on the phoneme that contained the missing "p." Then they fine-tuned the model further so the "p" sound returned and the "r" didn't disappear. Alexa was finally learning to speak like a Dubliner.
Two Irish linguists -- Elaine Vaughan, who teaches at the University of Limerick, and Kate Tallon, a Ph.D student who works in the Phonetics and Speech Laboratory at Trinity College Dublin -- have since given Irish Alexa's accent high marks. The way Irish Alexa emphasized "r's" and softened "t's" stuck out, they said, and Amazon got the accent as a whole right.
"It sounds authentic to me," Ms. Tallon said.
Amazon's researchers said they were gratified by the largely positive feedback. That their speech models disentangled the Irish accent so quickly gave them hope they could replicate accents elsewhere.
"We also plan to extend our methodology to accents of language other than English," they wrote in a January research paper about the Irish Alexa project.

Full text: For thousands of years, mathematicians have adapted to the latest advances in logic and reasoning. Are they ready for artificial intelligence?
In the collection of the Getty museum in Los Angeles is a portrait from the 17th century of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid: disheveled, holding up sheets of "Elements," his treatise on geometry, with grimy hands.
For more than 2,000 years, Euclid's text was the paradigm of mathematical argumentation and reasoning. "Euclid famously starts with 'definitions' that are almost poetic," Jeremy Avigad, a logician at Carnegie Mellon University, said in an email. "He then built the mathematics of the time on top of that, proving things in such a way that each successive step 'clearly follows' from previous ones, using the basic notions, definitions and prior theorems." There were complaints that some of Euclid's "obvious" steps were less than obvious, Dr. Avigad said, yet the system worked.
But by the 20th century, mathematicians were no longer willing to ground mathematics in this intuitive geometric foundation. Instead they developed formal systems -- precise symbolic representations, mechanical rules. Eventually, this formalization allowed mathematics to be translated into computer code. In 1976, the four-color theorem -- which states that four colors are sufficient to fill a map so that no two adjacent regions are the same color -- became the first major theorem proved with the help of computational brute force.
Now mathematicians are grappling with the latest transformative force: artificial intelligence.
In 2019, Christian Szegedy, a computer scientist formerly at Google and now at a start-up in the Bay Area, predicted that a computer system would match or exceed the problem-solving ability of the best human mathematicians within a decade. Last year he revised the target date to 2026.
Akshay Venkatesh, a mathematician at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and a winner of the Fields Medal in 2018, isn't currently interested in using A.I., but he is keen on talking about it. "I want my students to realize that the field they're in is going to change a lot," he said in an interview last year. He recently added by email: "I am not opposed to thoughtful and deliberate use of technology to support our human understanding. But I strongly believe that mindfulness about the way we use it is essential."
In February, Dr. Avigad attended a workshop about "machine-assisted proofs" at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics, on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles. (He visited the Euclid portrait on the final day of the workshop.) The gathering drew an atypical mix of mathematicians and computer scientists. "It feels consequential," said Terence Tao, a mathematician at the university, winner of a Fields Medal in 2006 and the workshop's lead organizer.
Dr. Tao noted that only in the last couple years have mathematicians started worrying about A.I.'s potential threats, whether to mathematical aesthetics or to themselves. That prominent community members are now broaching the issues and exploring the potential "kind of breaks the taboo," he said.
One conspicuous workshop attendee sat in the front row: a trapezoidal box named "raise-hand robot" that emitted a mechanical murmur and lifted its hand whenever an online participant had a question. "It helps if robots are cute and nonthreatening," Dr. Tao said.
Bring on the "proof whiners"
These days there is no shortage of gadgetry for optimizing our lives -- diet, sleep, exercise. "We like to attach stuff to ourselves to make it a little easier to get things right," Jordan Ellenberg, a mathematician at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said during a workshop break. A.I. gadgetry might do the same for mathematics, he added: "It's very clear that the question is, What can machines do for us, not what will machines do to us."
One math gadget is called a proof assistant, or interactive theorem prover. ("Automath" was an early incarnation in the 1960s.) Step-by-step, a mathematician translates a proof into code; then a software program checks whether the reasoning is correct. Verifications accumulate in a library, a dynamic canonical reference that others can consult. This type of formalization provides a foundation for mathematics today, said Dr. Avigad, who is the director of the Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics (funded by the crypto entrepreneur Charles Hoskinson), "in just the same way that Euclid was trying to codify and provide a foundation for the mathematics of his time."
Of late, the open-source proof assistant system Lean is attracting attention. Developed at Microsoft by Leonardo de Moura, a computer scientist now with Amazon, Lean uses automated reasoning, which is powered by what is known as good old-fashioned artificial intelligence, or GOFAI -- symbolic A.I., inspired by logic. So far the Lean community has verified an intriguing theorem about turning a sphere inside out as well as a pivotal theorem in a scheme for unifying mathematical realms, among other gambits.
But a proof assistant also has drawbacks: It often complains that it does not understand the definitions, axioms or reasoning steps entered by the mathematician, and for this it has been called a "proof whiner." All that whining can make research cumbersome. But Heather Macbeth, a mathematician at Fordham University, said that this same feature -- providing line-by-line feedback -- also makes the systems useful for teaching.
In the spring, Dr. Macbeth designed a "bilingual" course: She translated every problem presented on the blackboard into Lean code in the lecture notes, and students submitted solutions to homework problems both in Lean and prose. "It gave them confidence," Dr. Macbeth said, because they received instant feedback on when the proof was finished and whether each step along the way was right or wrong.
Since attending the workshop, Emily Riehl, a mathematician at Johns Hopkins University, used an experimental proof-assistant program to formalize proofs she had previously published with a co-author. By the end of a verification, she said, "I'm really, really deep into understanding the proof, way deeper than I've ever understood before. I'm thinking so clearly that I can explain it to a really dumb computer."
Brute reason -- but is it math?
Another automated-reasoning tool, used by Marijn Heule, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University and an Amazon scholar, is what he colloquially calls "brute reasoning" (or, more technically, a Satisfiability, or SAT, solver). By merely stating, with a carefully crafted encoding, which "exotic object" you want to find, he said, a supercomputer network churns through a search space and determines whether or not that entity exists.
Just before the workshop, Dr. Heule and one of his Ph.D. students, Bernardo Subercaseaux, finalized their solution to a longstanding problem with a file that was 50 terabytes in size. Yet that file hardly compared with a result that Dr. Heule and collaborators produced in 2016: "Two-hundred-terabyte maths proof is largest ever," a headline in Nature announced. The article went on to ask whether solving problems with such tools truly counted as math. In Dr. Heule's view, this approach is needed "to solve problems that are beyond what humans can do."
Another set of tools uses machine learning, which synthesizes oodles of data and detects patterns but is not good at logical, step-by-step reasoning. Google's DeepMind designs machine-learning algorithms to tackle the likes of protein folding (AlphaFold) and winning at chess (AlphaZero). In a 2021 Nature paper, a team described their results as "advancing mathematics by guiding human intuition with A.I."
Yuhuai "Tony" Wu, a computer scientist formerly at Google and now with a start-up in the Bay Area, has outlined a grander machine-learning goal: to "solve mathematics." At Google, Dr. Wu explored how the large language models that empower chatbots might help with mathematics. The team used a model that was trained on internet data and then fine-tuned on a large math-rich data set, using, for instance, an online archive of math and science papers. When asked in everyday English to solve math problems, this specialized chatbot, named Minerva, was "pretty good at imitating humans," Dr. Wu said at the workshop. The model obtained scores that were better than an average 16-year-old student on high school math exams.
Ultimately, Dr. Wu said, he envisioned an "automated mathematician" that has "the capability of solving a mathematical theorem all by itself."
Mathematics as a litmus test
Mathematicians have responded to these disruptions with varying levels of concern.
Michael Harris, at Columbia University, expresses qualms in his "Silicon Reckoner" Substack. He is troubled by the potentially conflicting goals and values of research mathematics and the tech and defense industries. In a recent newsletter, he noted that one speaker at a workshop, "A.I. to Assist Mathematical Reasoning," organized by the National Academies of Sciences, was a representative from Booz Allen Hamilton, a government contractor for intelligence agencies and the military.

Dr. Harris lamented the lack of discussion about the larger implications of A.I. on mathematical research, particularly "when contrasted with the very lively conversation going on" about the technology "pretty much everywhere except mathematics."
Geordie Williamson, of the University of Sydney and a DeepMind collaborator, spoke at the N.A.S. gathering and encouraged mathematicians and computer scientists to be more involved in such conversations. At the workshop in Los Angeles, he opened his talk with a line adapted from "You and the Atom Bomb," a 1945 essay by George Orwell. "Given how likely we all are to be profoundly affected within the next five years," Dr. Williamson said, "deep learning has not roused as much discussion as might have been expected."
Dr. Williamson considers mathematics a litmus test of what machine learning can or cannot do. Reasoning is quintessential to the mathematical process, and it is the crucial unsolved problem of machine learning.
Early during Dr. Williamson's DeepMind collaboration, the team found a simple neural net that predicted "a quantity in mathematics that I cared deeply about," he said in an interview, and it did so "ridiculously accurately." Dr. Williamson tried hard to understand why -- that would be the makings of a theorem -- but could not. Neither could anybody at DeepMind. Like the ancient geometer Euclid, the neural net had somehow intuitively discerned a mathematical truth, but the logical "why" of it was far from obvious.
At the Los Angeles workshop, a prominent theme was how to combine the intuitive and the logical. If A.I. could do both at the same time, all bets would be off.
But, Dr. Williamson observed, there is scant motivation to understand the black box that machine learning presents. "It's the hackiness culture in tech, where if it works most of the time, that's great," he said -- but that scenario leaves mathematicians dissatisfied.
He added that trying to understand what goes on inside a neural net raises "fascinating mathematical questions," and that finding answers presents an opportunity for mathematicians "to contribute meaningfully to the world."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The core of an artificial intelligence program like ChatGPT is something called a large language model: an algorithm that mimics the form of written language.
While the inner workings of these algorithms are notoriously opaque, the basic idea behind them is surprisingly simple. They are trained by going through mountains of internet text, repeatedly guessing the next few letters and then grading themselves against the real thing.
To show you what this process looks like, we trained six tiny language models starting from scratch. We've picked one trained on the complete works of Jane Austen.
Jane Austen
jane austen: Delighted to make your acquaintance. Let us make haste and set forth without delay!
In this article, we'll watch an A.I. -- which we're affectionately calling BabyGPT -- try to learn language by reading only
But first, we need to give it something to work with. We'll ask our model to autocomplete text, letter by letter, starting from this prompt:
jane austen: "You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth.
Before training: Gibberish
At the outset, BabyGPT produces text like this:
The largest language models are trained on over a terabyte of internet text, containing hundreds of billions of words. Their training costs millions of dollars and involves calculations that take weeks or even months on hundreds of specialized computers.
BabyGPT is ant-sized in comparison. We trained it for about an hour on a laptop on just a few megabytes of text -- small enough to attach to an email.
Unlike the larger models, which start their training with a large vocabulary, BabyGPT doesn't yet know any words. It makes its guesses one letter at a time, which makes it a bit easier for us to see what it's learning.
Initially, its guesses are completely random and include lots of special characters: "?kZhc,TK996" would make a great password, but it's a far cry from anything resembling Jane Austen or Shakespeare. BabyGPT hasn't yet learned which letters are typically used in English, or that words even exist.
This is how language models usually start off: They guess randomly and produce gibberish. But they learn from their mistakes, and over time, their guesses get better. Over many, many rounds of training, language models can learn to write. They learn statistical patterns that piece words together into sentences and paragraphs.
After 250 rounds: English letters
After 250 rounds of training -- about 30 seconds of processing on a modern laptop -- BabyGPT has learned its ABCs and is starting to babble:
In particular, our model has learned which letters are most frequently used in the text. You'll see a lot of the letter "e" because that is the most common letter in English.
If you look closely, you'll find that it has also learned some small words: I, to, the, you, and so on.
It has a tiny vocabulary, but that doesn't stop it from inventing words like alingedimpe, ratlabus and mandiered.
Obviously, these guesses aren't great. But -- and this is a key to how a language model learns -- BabyGPT keeps a score of exactly how bad its guesses are.
Every round of training, it goes through the original text, a few words at a time, and compares its guesses for the next letter with what actually comes next. It then calculates a score, known as the "loss," which measures the difference between its predictions and the actual text. A loss of zero would mean that its guesses always correctly matched the next letter. The smaller the loss, the closer its guesses are to the text.
After 500 rounds: Small words
Each training round, BabyGPT tries to improve its guesses by reducing this loss. After 500 rounds -- or about a minute on a laptop -- it can spell a few small words:
It's also starting to learn some basic grammar, like where to place periods and commas. But it makes plenty of mistakes. No one is going to confuse this output with something written by a human being.
After 5,000 rounds: Bigger words
Ten minutes in, BabyGPT's vocabulary has grown:
The sentences don't make sense, but they're getting closer in style to the text. BabyGPT now makes fewer spelling mistakes. It still invents some longer words, but less often than it once did. It's also starting to learn some names that occur frequently in the text.
Its grammar is improving, too. For example, it has learned that a period is often followed by a space and a capital letter. It even occasionally opens a quote (although it often forgets to close it).
Behind the scenes, BabyGPT is a neural network: an extremely complicated type of mathematical function involving millions of numbers that converts an input (in this case, a sequence of letters) into an output (its prediction for the next letter).
Every round of training, an algorithm adjusts these numbers to try to improve its guesses, using a mathematical technique known as backpropagation. The process of tuning these internal numbers to improve predictions is what it means for a neural network to "learn."
What this neural network actually generates is not letters but probabilities. (These probabilities are why you get a different answer each time you generate a new response.)
For example, when given the letters "stai," it'll predict that the next letter is "n," "r" or maybe "d," with probabilities that depend on how often it has encountered each word in its training.
But if we give it "downstai," it's much more likely to predict "r." Its predictions depend on the context.
After 30,000 rounds: Full sentences
An hour into its training, BabyGPT is learning to speak in full sentences. That's not so bad, considering that just an hour ago, it didn't even know that words existed!
The words still don't make sense, but they definitely look more like English.
The sentences that this neural network generates rarely occur in the original text. It usually doesn't copy and paste sentences verbatim; instead, BabyGPT stitches them together, letter by letter, based on statistical patterns that it has learned from the data. (Typical language models stitch sentences together a few letters at a time, but the idea is the same.)
As language models grow larger, the patterns that they learn can become increasingly complex. They can learn the form of a sonnet or a limerick, or how to code in various programming languages.
BabyGPT still has a long way to go before its sentences become coherent or useful. It can't answer a question or debug your code. It's mostly just fun to watch its guesses improve.
But it's also instructive. In just an hour of training on a laptop, a language model can go from generating random characters to a very crude approximation of language.
Language models are a kind of universal mimic: They imitate whatever they've been trained on. With enough data and rounds of training, this imitation can become fairly uncanny, as ChatGPT and its peers have shown us.
What even is a GPT?
The models trained in this article use an algorithm called nanoGPT, developed by Andrej Karpathy. Mr. Karpathy is a prominent A.I. researcher who recently joined OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.
Like ChatGPT, nanoGPT is a GPT model, an A.I. term that stands for <i>generative pre-trained transformer:
Generative because it generates words.
Pre-trained because it's trained on a bunch of text. This step is called pre-training because many language models (like the one behind ChatGPT) go through important additional stages of training known as fine-tuning to make them less toxic and easier to interact with.
Transformers are a relatively recent breakthrough in how neural networks are wired. They were introduced in a 2017 paper by Google researchers, and are used in many of the latest A.I. advancements, from text generation to image creation.
Transformers improved upon the previous generation of neural networks -- known as recurrent neural networks -- by including steps that process the words of a sentence in parallel, rather than one at a time. This made them much faster.
More is different
Other than the additional fine-tuning stages, the primary difference between nanoGPT and the language model underlying chatGPT is size.
For example, GPT-3 was trained on up to a million times as many words as the models in this article. Scaling up to that size is a huge technical undertaking, but the underlying principles remain the same.
As language models grow in size, they are known to develop surprising new abilities, such as the ability to answer questions, summarize text, explain jokes, continue a pattern and correct bugs in computer code.
Some researchers have termed these "emergent abilities" because they arise unexpectedly at a certain size and are not programmed in by hand. The A.I. researcher Sam Bowman has likened training a large language model to "buying a mystery box," because it is difficult to predict what skills it will gain during its training, and when these skills will emerge.
Undesirable behaviors can emerge as well. Large language models can become highly unpredictable, as evidenced by Microsoft Bing A.I.'s early interactions with my colleague Kevin Roose.
They are also prone to inventing facts and reasoning incorrectly. Researchers do not yet understand how these models generate language, and they struggle to steer their behavior.
Nearly four months after OpenAI's ChatGPT was made public, Google launched an A.I. chatbot called Bard, over safety objections from some of its employees, according to reporting by Bloomberg.
"These models are being developed in an arms race between tech companies, without any transparency," said Peter Bloem, an A.I. expert who studies language models.
OpenAI does not disclose any details on the data that its enormous GPT-4 model is trained on, citing concerns about competition and safety. Not knowing what's in the data makes it hard to tell if these technologies are safe, and what kinds of biases are embedded inside them.
But while Mr. Bloem has concerns about the lack of A.I. regulation, he is also excited that computers are finally starting to "understand what we want them to do" -- something that, he says, researchers hadn't been close to achieving in over 70 years of trying.
Methodology: The language models shown in this article were trained using nanoGPT, an open-source software package created by Andrej Karpathy. Each model was trained for 30,000 iterations, which took less than an hour on an M1 MacBook Pro. We made minor modifications to the code to speed up the training for this hardware and data size. The model's settings were chosen as a trade-off between the neural network's size and its training speed.
Neural networks are prone to a problem known as overfitting. One way this can happen is by "teaching to the test," meaning training them on the same data that you evaluate them on. To help avoid this problem, we trained the language models in this article on 90 percent of the text, but additionally scored them on how well they could predict the remaining 10 percent. Updates to the model were saved only when these scores improved. This is a standard practice in machine learning, known as validation, which helps ensure that models learn general features of the data and avoid rote memorization.
Additionally, we temporarily removed a randomly selected 10 percent of the "neurons" during each round of training. This is a technique known as dropout, which also helps prevent neural networks from overfitting the data.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There is only one Ryan Seacrest. That may surprise anyone who looks closely at his overlapping radio and TV hosting gigs, which will soon include "Wheel of Fortune." When he steps into that new role, Mr. Seacrest will be seen and heard for some 29 hours a week.
Mr. Seacrest left "Live," the morning show he hosted with Kelly Ripa, in February after a six-year run. But he is still the host of "American Idol," the singing competition show that made him a household name. He is also the host of the syndicated radio programs "On Air With Ryan Seacrest" and "American Top 40 With Ryan Seacrest."
"American Idol" is typically on television for two hours a week, though at some points in the season there are two-hour episodes, twice a week, and the season finale is three hours. "On Air" is on the radio every morning. And "American Top 40" is another four hours every Sunday.
Add in "Wheel of Fortune," a 30-minute show that runs every weeknight, and that comes out to more than a full day each week of Ryan Seacrest. (And that doesn't count his "New Year's Rockin' Eve" special, which stretches into nearly six hours once a year.)
Granted, Mr. Seacrest may not be doing all of these programs at the same time. But he is essentially a one-man hosting monopoly, and while his schedule varies, in the past he has gotten up around 6 a.m. every day to get it all done.
With "Wheel of Fortune," though, he has big shoes to fill: Pat Sajak, who announced his retirement this month, is virtually synonymous with the nightly game show, and he had been its host since the 1980s.
"I'm truly humbled to be stepping into the footsteps of the legendary Pat Sajak," Mr. Seacrest said this week.
"We should remain humble about how risks can arise and continue our work to ensure that banks are resilient to a range of economic scenarios, market shocks and other stresses."
Michael S. Barr, the Federal Reserve's vice chair for supervision, on the stress tests of the country's banks.
"At this point, it's cheaper than some of the cases of water we're selling in the back."
Andy Wagner, the manager of a beer and soda warehouse in Pennsylvania, about the sinking value of Bud Light.
"I believe that they're going to use Call of Duty somehow to damage us."
Jim Ryan, the chief executive of Sony, during testimony in a trial over whether Microsoft can move ahead in its acquisition of the maker of the video game Call of Duty.

Full text: The sharing economy has come to apartment buildings -- and landlords have discovered a new way to attract tenants.
Brooke Renteria moved to a studio in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, from California two years ago. All she had to unpack were her suitcases. The unit of less than 400 square feet in Caesura, an apartment building cater-corner from the Brooklyn Academy of Music, came with a Murphy bed, a built-in table/desk and a 49-inch smart TV.
Ms. Renteria, who is 24 and works in tech, also had access to the building's Common Goods room, a basement closet stocked with household items that residents could check out for free. Among the dozens of objects: a sewing machine, a Ninja professional blender and a white porcelain dinner service for 12.
"I think I used a chair or two from there" when friends were visiting, she said recently as she passed through Caesura's lobby, where candy jars held pet treats and a monitor flashed details about yoga classes.
Caesura is not cheap. When the 12-story building with 123 units opened in 2018, its 34 furnished micro studios started at $ 2,588 a month for 314 square feet. Ms. Renteria pays $ 2,900 for hers. But unlike the swimming pools and fancy gyms in many of Brooklyn's newly sprouted towers, Caesura's Common Goods are an amenity geared toward thrift rather than luxury, a way to declutter tight quarters and encourage tenants to participate in the philosophically and ecologically benevolent culture of sharing.
Common Goods are meant to "support affordability, reduce consumption and enhance residents' sense of being part of a larger community," said Joshua Haggarty, the associate developer of asset management at Jonathan Rose Companies, Caesura's developer. The program was created in the same spirit of sociability as the building's fitness center, rooftop garden and bike storage room, he said.
It remains unique among the Rose Companies' 80 properties in 11 states. Mr. Haggarty said that while older buildings owned or acquired by the developer do not have the space for the program, Common Goods will be part of two soon-to-be-completed rental buildings: Sendero Verde in East Harlem and NC5 in Philadelphia. (At present, neither website promotes the amenity.)
In his 2021 book "The Longing for Less: Living with Minimalism," Kyle Chayka reported that "the average American household possesses over 300,000 items." From the dawn of the modern sharing economy, entrepreneurs have wrestled with marketplaces for the short-term use of the kinds of purchases that tend to idle in households: things like power drills, punch bowls, tents and tripods.
What has been learned through the birth and death of numerous start-ups is that convenience and trust are crucial to sharing. Apartment buildings are logical centers for exchange because residents don't have to go far to borrow an object, and interactions are with the building management or neighbors.
Landlords increasingly see shared goods as a perk for attracting and keeping tenants. And they are experimenting with a variety of distribution methods.
Like Caesura, the new Citizen W10 apartment building, in downtown Denver, buys and maintains goods that tenants can borrow. But its offerings are athletic -- bikes, tents, scooters, longboards. Lease holders may borrow up to two items for free: bikes and trolley carts for up to 24 hours, and everything else for up to five days.
Angela Harris, of Trio Design in Denver, which worked on the building's interiors, said the gear room was conceived with a "double bonus approach": Residents are not only spared investment in sporting equipment, but can "go out and enjoy it together."
For her client's benefit, the room is visible from the lobby, so prospective residents can peek in and be impressed.
Other buildings are making use of technology-driven platforms that offer a broad menu of household and entertainment goods and automate the process of borrowing them.
Brevvie, founded in Irvine, Calif., in 2017, specializes in product-distribution units that are similar to vending machines. They are stocked with household and recreational goods and placed in apartment buildings, dorms and retail stores. The company, whose name is a contraction of the phrase "briefly rent everything," selects the objects based on their durability, desirability and location. (Surfboards in California; backpacks in Washington State.)
Users browse the items on a website, make a selection, pay an hourly or daily rate and activate a mechanism to open the door of the locker and retrieve the object. The system reminds the user when it is time to return the object and notifies Brevvie and the landlord if anything goes missing. Users are charged for damage or loss, just as they would be if they were renting a car.
Kristine Everly, Brevvie's co-founder, has a background in real estate marketing. Seeing the footprint of new apartments "getting smaller and smaller," she said, she resolved to combine the ecological good of reduced consumption with the practical benefits of fewer belongings to store.
"A ladder, a dolly, a vacuum cleaner, a carpet steamer: No one wants to spend money on that stuff," she said. "They want to buy a new iPhone."
Ms. Everly, 43, said she combats any stigma associated with shared goods by filling the lockers with high-quality merchandise that apartment residents may be reluctant to buy but are delighted to use. Her vacuum cleaners are Dysons that sell for $ 500 but rent for an average of about $ 8 a day. (They also can be rented by the hour.) Her coolers from Yeti start at $ 200 to buy, but can be borrowed for $ 12 to $ 14 a day.
Even so, there are haters, especially among people her parents' age, Ms. Everly said. To those who say it's gross to rent something someone else has worn or held, she replies, "Well, you just ate in a restaurant, and you used a fork that someone else had in their mouth."'
Brevvie sells the stocked units to landlords for $ 13,000 to $ 16,000 each and provides round-the-clock customer service and oversight for a monthly fee of $ 199 a locker, paid out of the rental revenues the building collects. (Landlords keep the rest.) To date, 32 lockers have been installed, including 16 at Microsoft's campus in Redmond, Wash. This number will grow to 38 in July.
After stuttering in the pandemic, when no one wanted to share anything touched by human hands, the company is breaking even, Ms Everly said. A side operation selling firewood and propane through the lockers is helping to keep it afloat.
Tulu, a four-year-old company with offices in New York City, London, Amsterdam and Tel Aviv, uses a similar vending-machine model to rent goods to people in apartment houses, hotels and office buildings. The company, which does business in 23 cities across the world, leans into its technology platform to glean information about consumer habits that helps it match products to locations and fortify relationships with users (for example, by texting a reminder to someone who rents a vacuum most Thursdays that the time has come again to clean).
The compiled data are also sold to product manufacturers. "The companies can understand how people use the stuff -- which hours of the day, which days of the week," said Yishai Lehavi, 37, who founded Tulu with Yael Shemer, 30, after the two met at a business accelerator program at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "They get constant feedback from thousands of unbiased customers."
Depending on the venue, the Tulu unit may rent board games, bread makers or printers that spit out documents from users' computer files. (A Dyson vacuum cleaner is priced at $ 4 an hour.) For hotels, there may be scooters, massage guns and picnic blankets. The company also sells food and personal goods like hand soap and toilet paper.
Rental revenue is split between Tulu and the landlord, who is responsible for maintaining the machines. Mr. Lehavi said the company, which he described as a start-up funded with venture capital, is not yet profitable.
"To me, it's an incredible value add," said Brad Kirshenbaum, who made Tulu a standard when he was the senior director of innovation at CA Ventures, a Chicago company that develops student apartments near universities. The upfront cost for a basic unit was $ 4,000 to $ 5,000, and his company received half of the rental revenue after the first $ 1,000.
"I did not have a single month when I was using them broadly when I did not make my money back, and more," he said.
Mr. Kirshenbaum sees the platform as a beacon to a future with reduced carbon footprints and access to high-quality resources for enjoying city life.
"Own less," he said, echoing Tulu's slogan. "Live more."

The Risk From A.I. Isn't Just Existential: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In May, more than 350 technology executives, researchers and academics signed a statement warning of the existential dangers of artificial intelligence. "Mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I. should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war," the signatories warned.
This came on the heels of another high-profile letter, signed by the likes of Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple, calling for a six-month moratorium on the development of advanced A.I. systems.
Meanwhile, the Biden administration has urged responsible A.I. innovation, stating that "in order to seize the opportunities" it offers, we "must first manage its risks." In Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer called for "first of their kind" listening sessions on the potential and risks of A.I., a crash course of sorts from industry executives, academics, civil rights activists and other stakeholders.
The mounting anxiety about A.I. isn't because of the boring but reliable technologies that autocomplete our text messages or direct robot vacuums to dodge obstacles in our living rooms. It is the rise of artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I., that worries the experts.
A.G.I. doesn't exist yet, but some believe that the rapidly growing capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT suggest its emergence is near. Sam Altman, a co-founder of OpenAI, has described it as "systems that are generally smarter than humans." Building such systems remains a daunting -- some say impossible -- task. But the benefits appear truly tantalizing.
Imagine Roombas, no longer condemned to vacuuming the floors, that evolve into all-purpose robots, happy to brew morning coffee or fold laundry -- without ever being programmed to do these things.
Sounds appealing. But should these A.G.I. Roombas get too powerful, their mission to create a spotless utopia might get messy for their dust-spreading human masters. At least we've had a good run.
Discussions of A.G.I. are rife with such apocalyptic scenarios. Yet a nascent A.G.I. lobby of academics, investors and entrepreneurs counter that, once made safe, A.G.I. would be a boon to civilization. Mr. Altman, the face of this campaign, embarked on a global tour to charm lawmakers. Earlier this year he wrote that A.G.I. might even turbocharge the economy, boost scientific knowledge and "elevate humanity by increasing abundance."
This is why, for all the hand-wringing, so many smart people in the tech industry are toiling to build this controversial technology: not using it to save the world seems immoral.
They are beholden to an ideology that views this new technology as inevitable and, in a safe version, as universally beneficial. Its proponents can think of no better alternatives for fixing humanity and expanding its intelligence.
But this ideology -- call it A.G.I.-ism -- is mistaken. The real risks of A.G.I. are political and won't be fixed by taming rebellious robots. The safest of A.G.I.s would not deliver the progressive panacea promised by its lobby. And in presenting its emergence as all but inevitable, A.G.I.-ism distracts from finding better ways to augment intelligence.
Unbeknown to its proponents, A.G.I.-ism is just a bastard child of a much grander ideology, one preaching that, as Margaret Thatcher memorably put it, there is no alternative, not to the market.
Rather than breaking capitalism, as Mr. Altman has hinted it could do, A.G.I. -- or at least the rush to build it -- is more likely to create a powerful (and much hipper) ally for capitalism's most destructive creed: neoliberalism.
Fascinated with privatization, competition and free trade, the architects of neoliberalism wanted to dynamize and transform a stagnant and labor-friendly economy through markets and deregulation.
Some of these transformations worked, but they came at an immense cost. Over the years, neoliberalism drew many, many critics, who blamed it for the Great Recession and financial crisis, Trumpism, Brexit and much else.
It is not surprising, then, that the Biden administration has distanced itself from the ideology, acknowledging that markets sometimes get it wrong. Foundations, think tanks and academics have even dared to imagine a post-neoliberal future.
Yet neoliberalism is far from dead. Worse, it has found an ally in A.G.I.-ism, which stands to reinforce and replicate its main biases: that private actors outperform public ones (the market bias), that adapting to reality beats transforming it (the adaptation bias) and that efficiency trumps social concerns (the efficiency bias).
These biases turn the alluring promise behind A.G.I. on its head: Instead of saving the world, the quest to build it will make things only worse. Here is how.
A.G.I. will never overcome the market's demands for profit.
Remember when Uber, with its cheap rates, was courting cities to serve as their public transportation systems?
It all began nicely, with Uber promising implausibly cheap rides, courtesy of a future with self-driving cars and minimal labor costs. Deep-pocketed investors loved this vision, even absorbing Uber's multibillion-dollar losses.
But when reality descended, the self-driving cars were still a pipe dream. The investors demanded returns and Uber was forced to raise prices. Users that relied on it to replace public buses and trains were left on the sidewalk.
The neoliberal instinct behind Uber's business model is that the private sector can do better than the public sector -- the market bias.
It's not just cities and public transit. Hospitals, police departments and even the Pentagon increasingly rely on Silicon Valley to accomplish their missions.
With A.G.I., this reliance will only deepen, not least because A.G.I. is unbounded in its scope and ambition. No administrative or government services would be immune to its promise of disruption.
Moreover, A.G.I. doesn't even have to exist to lure them in. This, at any rate, is the lesson of Theranos, a start-up that promised to "solve" health care through a revolutionary blood-testing technology and a former darling of America's elites. Its victims are real, even if its technology never was.
After so many Uber- and Theranos-like traumas, we already know what to expect of an A.G.I. rollout. It will consist of two phases. First, the charm offensive of heavily subsidized services. Then the ugly retrenchment, with the overdependent users and agencies shouldering the costs of making them profitable.
As always, Silicon Valley mavens play down the market's role. In a recent essay titled "Why A.I. Will Save the World," Marc Andreessen, a prominent tech investor, even proclaims that A.I. "is owned by people and controlled by people, like any other technology."
Only a venture capitalist can traffic in such exquisite euphemisms. Most modern technologies are owned by corporations. And they -- not the mythical "people" -- will be the ones that will monetize saving the world.
And are they really saving it? The record, so far, is poor. Companies like Airbnb and TaskRabbit were welcomed as saviors for the beleaguered middle class; Tesla's electric cars were seen as a remedy to a warming planet. Soylent, the meal-replacement shake, embarked on a mission to "solve" global hunger, while Facebook vowed to "solve" connectivity issues in the Global South. None of these companies saved the world.
A decade ago, I called this solutionism, but "digital neoliberalism" would be just as fitting. This worldview reframes social problems in light of for-profit technological solutions. As a result, concerns that belong in the public domain are reimagined as entrepreneurial opportunities in the marketplace.
A.G.I.-ism has rekindled this solutionist fervor. Last year, Mr. Altman stated that "A.G.I. is probably necessary for humanity to survive" because "our problems seem too big" for us to "solve without better tools." He's recently asserted that A.G.I. will be a catalyst for human flourishing.
But companies need profits, and such benevolence, especially from unprofitable firms burning investors' billions, is uncommon. OpenAI, having accepted billions from Microsoft, has contemplated raising another $ 100 billion to build A.G.I. Those investments will need to be earned back -- against the service's staggering invisible costs. (One estimate from February put the expense of operating ChatGPT at $ 700,000 per day.)
Thus, the ugly retrenchment phase, with aggressive price hikes to make an A.G.I. service profitable, might arrive before "abundance" and "flourishing." But how many public institutions would mistake fickle markets for affordable technologies and become dependent on OpenAI's expensive offerings by then?
And if you dislike your town outsourcing public transportation to a fragile start-up, would you want it farming out welfare services, waste management and public safety to the possibly even more volatile A.G.I. firms?
A.G.I. will dull the pain of our thorniest problems without fixing them.
Neoliberalism has a knack for mobilizing technology to make society's miseries bearable. I recall an innovative tech venture from 2017 that promised to improve commuters' use of a Chicago subway line. It offered rewards to discourage metro riders from traveling at peak times. Its creators leveraged technology to influence the demand side (the riders), seeing structural changes to the supply side (like raising public transport funding) as too difficult. Tech would help make Chicagoans adapt to the city's deteriorating infrastructure rather than fixing it in order to meet the public's needs.
This is the adaptation bias -- the aspiration that, with a technological wand, we can become desensitized to our plight. It's the product of neoliberalism's relentless cheerleading for self-reliance and resilience.
The message is clear: gear up, enhance your human capital and chart your course like a start-up. And A.G.I.-ism echoes this tune. Bill Gates has trumpeted that A.I. can "help people everywhere improve their lives."
The solutionist feast is only getting started: Whether it's fighting the next pandemic, the loneliness epidemic or inflation, A.I. is already pitched as an all-purpose hammer for many real and imaginary nails. However, the decade lost to the solutionist folly reveals the limits of such technological fixes.
To be sure, Silicon Valley's many apps -- to monitor our spending, calories and workout regimes -- are occasionally helpful. But they mostly ignore the underlying causes of poverty or obesity. And without tackling the causes, we remain stuck in the realm of adaptation, not transformation.
There's a difference between nudging us to follow our walking routines -- a solution that favors individual adaptation -- and understanding why our towns have no public spaces to walk on -- a prerequisite for a politics-friendly solution that favors collective and institutional transformation.
But A.G.I.-ism, like neoliberalism, sees public institutions as unimaginative and not particularly productive. They should just adapt to A.G.I., at least according to Mr. Altman, who recently said he was nervous about "the speed with which our institutions can adapt" -- part of the reason, he added, "of why we want to start deploying these systems really early, while they're really weak, so that people have as much time as possible to do this."
But should institutions only adapt? Can't they develop their own transformative agendas for improving humanity's intelligence? Or do we use institutions only to mitigate the risks of Silicon Valley's own technologies?
A.G.I. undermines civic virtues and amplifies trends we already dislike.
A common criticism of neoliberalism is that it has flattened our political life, rearranging it around efficiency. "The Problem of Social Cost," a 1960 article that has become a classic of the neoliberal canon, preaches that a polluting factory and its victims should not bother bringing their disputes to court. Such fights are inefficient -- who needs justice, anyway? -- and stand in the way of market activity. Instead, the parties should privately bargain over compensation and get on with their business.
This fixation on efficiency is how we arrived at "solving" climate change by letting the worst offenders continue as before. The way to avoid the shackles of regulation is to devise a scheme -- in this case, taxing carbon -- that lets polluters buy credits to match the extra carbon they emit.
This culture of efficiency, in which markets measure the worth of things and substitute for justice, inevitably corrodes civic virtues.
And the problems this creates are visible everywhere. Academics fret that, under neoliberalism, research and teaching have become commodities. Doctors lament that hospitals prioritize more profitable services such as elective surgery over emergency care. Journalists hate that the worth of their articles is measured in eyeballs.
Now imagine unleashing A.G.I. on these esteemed institutions -- the university, the hospital, the newspaper -- with the noble mission of "fixing" them. Their implicit civic missions would remain invisible to A.G.I., for those missions are rarely quantified even in their annual reports -- the sort of materials that go into training the models behind A.G.I.
After all, who likes to boast that his class on Renaissance history got only a handful of students? Or that her article on corruption in some faraway land got only a dozen page views? Inefficient and unprofitable, such outliers miraculously survive even in the current system. The rest of the institution quietly subsidizes them, prioritizing values other than profit-driven "efficiency."
Will this still be the case in the A.G.I. utopia? Or will fixing our institutions through A.G.I. be like handing them over to ruthless consultants? They, too, offer data-bolstered "solutions" for maximizing efficiency. But these solutions often fail to grasp the messy interplay of values, missions and traditions at the heart of institutions -- an interplay that is rarely visible if you only scratch their data surface.
In fact, the remarkable performance of ChatGPT-like services is, by design, a refusal to grasp reality at a deeper level, beyond the data's surface. So whereas earlier A.I. systems relied on explicit rules and required someone like Newton to theorize gravity -- to ask how and why apples fall -- newer systems like A.G.I. simply learn to predict gravity's effects by observing millions of apples fall to the ground.
However, if all that A.G.I. sees are cash-strapped institutions fighting for survival, it may never infer their true ethos. Good luck discerning the meaning of the Hippocratic oath by observing hospitals that have been turned into profit centers.
Margaret Thatcher's other famous neoliberal dictum was that "there is no such thing as society."
The A.G.I. lobby unwittingly shares this grim view. For them, the kind of intelligence worth replicating is a function of what happens in individuals' heads rather than in society at large.
But human intelligence is as much a product of policies and institutions as it is of genes and individual aptitudes. It's easier to be smart on a fellowship in the Library of Congress than while working several jobs in a place without a bookstore or even decent Wi-Fi.
It doesn't seem all that controversial to suggest that more scholarships and public libraries will do wonders for boosting human intelligence. But for the solutionist crowd in Silicon Valley, augmenting intelligence is primarily a technological problem -- hence the excitement about A.G.I.
However, if A.G.I.-ism really is neoliberalism by other means, then we should be ready to see fewer -- not more -- intelligence-enabling institutions. After all, they are the remnants of that dreaded "society" that, for neoliberals, doesn't really exist. A.G.I.'s grand project of amplifying intelligence may end up shrinking it.
Because of such solutionist bias, even seemingly innovative policy ideas around A.G.I. fail to excite. Take the recent proposal for a "Manhattan Project for A.I. Safety." This is premised on the false idea that there's no alternative to A.G.I.
But wouldn't our quest for augmenting intelligence be far more effective if the government funded a Manhattan Project for culture and education and the institutions that nurture them instead?
Without such efforts, the vast cultural resources of our existing public institutions risk becoming mere training data sets for A.G.I. start-ups, reinforcing the falsehood that society doesn't exist.
Depending on how (and if) the robot rebellion unfolds, A.G.I. may or may not prove an existential threat. But with its antisocial bent and its neoliberal biases, A.G.I.-ism already is: We don't need to wait for the magic Roombas to question its tenets.

Apple Ends Day Valued
At $ 3 Trillion, a First
Apple became the first publicly traded company to close a trading day with a $ 3 trillion market value, marking another milestone for a technology juggernaut that has reshaped society with a lineup of products that churn out eye-popping profits.
Apple shares closed up 2.3 percent at $ 193.97 on Friday, bringing its market value to $ 3.04 trillion. Apple is one of a handful of technology companies, including Microsoft and the chip maker Nvidia, that helped drive the S&P 500 to a gain of nearly 16 percent in the first half of the year.
The company had briefly eclipsed a $ 3 trillion market value on back-to-back days in January 2022, but it could not hold on until the market closed. Instead, Apple's stock sunk into a prolonged descent that pushed its value briefly below $ 2 trillion this year amid a slowdown in growth and investor jitters about rising interest rates that affected the entire tech sector.

PHARMACEUTICAL
Bausch + Lomb to Buy
Novartis Eye Products
Bausch + Lomb said on Friday that it would acquire several Novartis eye care products for $ 1.75 billion as their market grows, sending the company's shares up more than 4 percent by the close of trading.
The deal includes acquisition of Novartis's anti-inflammation eye drop Xiidra, the experimental drug libvatrep for chronic ocular surface pain, and rights to use the company's AcuStream dry-eye drug delivery device.
The deal is the first major transaction under Brent Saunders since his return to the company as chief executive in March. It includes potential milestone payments of up to $ 750 million to Novartis.
It was expected to close by the end of this year and would boost the company's earnings, the company said.
Bausch + Lomb's Miebo was approved last month for dry-eye condition, which affects about 739 million people worldwide, including around 38 million in the United States. REUTERS
ENERGY
Renewable Energy Head
Leaves Shell After Shift
Shell's head of renewable generation, Thomas Brostrom, is leaving the company, a spokesperson said on Friday, weeks after the company's chief executive, Wael Sawan, scaled back its energy transition plans.
Mr. Brostrom joined Shell from the offshore wind giant Orsted in August 2021 to head offshore wind as Shell planned to rapidly expand its wind and solar operations as part of a strategy to cut greenhouse gas emissions under its previous chief executive, Ben van Beurden.
Mr. Brostrom quickly became head of renewables in February 2022 after Elisabeth Brinton stepped down less than two years after taking the reins.
Mr. Sawan, who took office in January, announced on June 14 that there would be a shift back to oil and gas production and a paring back of investments in renewables following investor pressure to focus on the most profitable businesses. REUTERS

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected affirmative action at colleges and universities around the nation, declaring that the race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina were unlawful and sharply curtailing a policy that had long been a pillar of higher education.
The vote was 6-3, with the court’s liberal members in dissent.
“The Harvard and UNC admissions programs cannot be reconciled with the guarantees of the equal protection clause,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. “Both programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor summarized her dissent from the bench, a rare move that signals profound disagreement, and said that affirmative action was crucial to countering persistent and systematic racial discrimination.
“The court subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society,” she said in her written dissent.
The decision all but ensured that the student population at the campuses of elite institutions will become whiter and more Asian and less Black and Latino. It was also expected to set off a scramble as schools revisit their admissions practices, and it could complicate diversity efforts elsewhere, narrowing the pipeline of highly credentialed minority candidates and making it harder for employers to consider race in hiring.
The ruling demonstrated that the court’s conservative supermajority has been moving at a brisk pace to take on some of the thorniest and most divisive issues in American society including abortion, guns and now race — all in the span of a year. It also reflected former President Donald Trump’s outsize imprint on the court after his appointment of three justices, renewing questions about whether the court’s approach, which Thursday upended more than 40 years of precedent, threatens the stability of the law and the court’s legitimacy.
Public opinion polls offer a complicated picture of where people stand on affirmative action, and the numbers vary with how questions are phrased. But on balance, race-conscious admissions programs are unpopular, suggesting that Thursday’s ruling will not give rise to a backlash like the one that followed last year’s decision eliminating a constitutional right to an abortion.
Democrats, including President Joe Biden, assailed the ruling as a step backward.
In a televised address hours after it was handed down, Biden urged the country to make sure the decision was not “the last word” on affirmative action.
“Discrimination still exists in America,” he said, repeating his words for emphasis. “Today’s decision does not change that.”
Biden paused as a reporter asked if the court was “rogue.” “This is not a normal court,” he responded.
Conservative leaders and advocacy groups celebrated the outcome, with some saying it would make the admissions process more fair.
Matt Schlapp, chair of the American Conservative Union, one of the nation’s largest conservative groups, said the decision, paired with the court’s abortion ruling last year, “serve as a triumphant return to restoring our tattered Constitution.”
In dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the majority had abandoned principled adjudication.
“At bottom,” she wrote, “the six unelected members of today’s majority upend the status quo based on their policy preferences about what race in America should be like, but is not, and their preferences for a veneer of colorblindness in a society where race has always mattered and continues to matter in fact and in law.”
The chief justice wrote that admissions officers could sometimes still take account of race, including in the college essay. “Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration or otherwise,” he wrote.
The point, he said, was that applicants must be assessed individually. “In other words,” he wrote, “the student must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual — not on the basis of race.”
Sotomayor said that was thin gruel.
“This supposed recognition that universities can, in some situations, consider race in application essays is nothing but an attempt to put lipstick on a pig,” she wrote.
But she acknowledged that the majority had left colleges and universities with some tools to admit students of different backgrounds, notably by focusing on socioeconomic factors.
The chief justice wrote that educational diversity, the idea that students of different backgrounds learn from one another, is a commendable goal. But he added that such a goal resists the demanding judicial scrutiny that is required when race is a factor because it cannot be measured.
In dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the majority had effectively jettisoned the rationale that had justified affirmative action for decades.
“Without any new factual or legal justification,” she wrote, “the court overrides its long-standing holding that diversity in higher education is of compelling value. To avoid public accountability for its choice, the court seeks cover behind a unique measurability requirement of its own creation.”
Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett joined the chief justice’s majority opinion. Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson joined Sotomayor’s dissent.
In all, six justices issued opinions, collectively spanning more than 200 pages notable for sometimes harsh language and starkly differing accounts of the nation’s history and the role race plays in contemporary society.
The two sides, for instance, offered competing understandings of the meaning of Brown v. Board of Education, the towering 1954 decision that barred racial segregation in public schools. The lesson of Brown, Roberts wrote, was that “the time for making distinctions based on race had passed.”
Sotomayor said the decision stood for a different principle and accused the majority of engaging in revisionist history. “Brown was,” she wrote, “a race-conscious decision that emphasized the importance of education in our society.”
She added: “At the risk of stating the blindingly obvious, and as Brown recognized, the 14th Amendment was intended to undo the effects of a world where laws systematically subordinated Black people and created a racial caste system. Brown and its progeny recognized the need to take affirmative, race-conscious steps to eliminate that system.”
Thomas and Jackson, the court’s Black members, traded particularly sharp barbs.
“As she sees things,” Thomas wrote of Jackson, “we are all inexorably trapped in a fundamentally racist society, with the original sin of slavery and the historical subjugation of Black Americans still determining our lives today.”
Jackson responded that her colleague’s “prolonged attack responds to a dissent I did not write in order to assail an admissions program that is not the one UNC has crafted,” adding that “Justice Thomas’ opinion also demonstrates an obsession with race consciousness that far outstrips my or UNC’s holistic understanding that race can be a factor that affects applicants’ unique life experiences.”
She said she would not engage on every one of his points, as “Justice Thomas ignites too many more straw men to list, or fully extinguish, here.” (Jackson recused herself from the Harvard case, having served on one of the university’s governing boards.)
Roberts, in a footnote, limited the sweep of the decision in one respect, saying the court was not deciding whether military academies may take account of race in their admissions decisions as they have “potentially distinct interests.”
The sharp divisions were also evident in the courtroom, where three justices spoke from the bench. Between Roberts’ announcement of his majority opinion and Sotomayor’s oral dissent, Thomas summarized his concurring opinion in his booming baritone.
He said he was compelled to address “race-based discrimination against Asian American students,” adding that “such discrimination is plainly and boldly unconstitutional.”
Then Sotomayor, seated directly to Thomas’ right, offered her dissent, speaking for almost 20 minutes. “In a society where opportunity is dispensed along racial lines, equality cannot be attained through race blindness,” she said.
The two cases decided Thursday were not identical. As a public university, UNC is bound by both the Constitution’s equal protection clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars race discrimination by institutions that receive federal money. Harvard, a private institution, is subject only to the statute.
In the North Carolina case, the plaintiffs said that the university discriminated against white and Asian applicants by giving preference to Black, Hispanic and Native American ones. The university responded that its admissions policies fostered educational diversity and were lawful under long-standing Supreme Court precedents.
The case against Harvard has an additional element, accusing the university of discriminating against Asian American students by using a subjective standard to gauge traits like likability, courage and kindness, and by effectively creating a ceiling for them in admissions.
Lawyers for Harvard said the challengers had relied on a flawed statistical analysis and denied that the university discriminated against Asian American applicants. More generally, they said race-conscious admissions policies were lawful.
Both cases — Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, No. 20-1199, and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina, No. 21-707 — were brought by Students for Fair Admissions, a group founded by Edward Blum, a legal activist who has organized many lawsuits challenging race-conscious admissions policies and voting rights laws, several of which have reached the Supreme Court.
The universities both won in federal trial courts, and the decision in Harvard’s favor was affirmed by a federal appeals court.
The key precedent was Grutter v. Bollinger, a 2003 decision in which the Supreme Court endorsed holistic admissions programs, saying it was permissible to consider race to achieve educational diversity. Writing for the majority in that case, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor said she expected that “25 years from now,” or in 2028, the “use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary.”
Roberts wrote Thursday that “there is no reason to believe that respondents will — even acting in good faith — comply with the equal protection clause any time soon.”
In his concurring opinion, Thomas wrote that the majority opinion “rightly makes clear that Grutter is, for all intents and purposes, overruled.”
For her part, Sotomayor struck a defiant note.
“The pursuit of racial diversity will go on,” she wrote. “Although the court has stripped out almost all uses of race in college admissions, universities can and should continue to use all available tools to meet society’s needs for diversity in education. Despite the court’s unjustified exercise of power, the opinion today will serve only to highlight the court’s own impotence in the face of an America whose cries for equality resound.”

U.S. May Cut China's Path To A.I. Chips: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Reports that the White House may clamp down on sales of semiconductors that power artificial intelligence capabilities sent tech stocks diving.
The Biden administration is weighing additional curbs on China's ability to access critical technology, including restricting the sale of high-end chips used to power artificial intelligence, according to five people familiar with the deliberations.
The curbs would clamp down on the sales to China of advanced chips made by companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, which are needed for the data centers that power artificial intelligence.
Biden officials have said that China's artificial intelligence capabilities could pose a national security threat to the United States by enhancing Beijing's military and security apparatus. Among the concerns is the use of A.I. in guiding weapons, carrying out cyber warfare and powering facial recognition systems used to track dissidents and minorities.
But such curbs would be a blow to semiconductor manufacturers, including those in the United States, who still generate much of their revenue in China.
The deliberations were earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. Nvidia's shares closed down 1.8 percent on Wednesday after reports of the potential export crackdown. The company has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the enthusiasm over artificial intelligence, with its share price surging by roughly 180 percent this year.
Such additional restrictions, if adopted, would not have an immediate impact on Nvidia's financial results, Colette Kress, the chief financial officer of Nvidia, said Wednesday at an event hosted by an investment firm. But over the long term, they "will result in a permanent loss of opportunities for the U.S. industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets," she said. She added that China typically generates 20 percent to 25 percent of the company's data center revenue, which includes other products in addition to chips that enable A.I.
The stock prices of chip companies Qualcomm and Intel fell less than 2 percent on Wednesday while AMD nudged 0.2 percent lower.
Intel declined to comment, as did the Commerce Department, which oversees export controls. AMD did not respond to a request for comment.
Curbing the sale of high-end chips would be the latest step in the Biden administration's campaign to starve China of advanced technology that is needed to power everything from self-driving cars to robotics.
Last October, the administration issued sweeping restrictions on the types of advanced semiconductors and chip making machinery that could be sent to China. The rules were applied across the industry, but they had particularly strong consequences for Nvidia. The company, an industry leader, was barred from selling China its top-line A100 and H100 chips -- which are adept at running the many processes required to build artificial intelligence -- unless it first obtained a special license.
In response to those restrictions, Nvidia began offering the downgraded A800 and H800 chips in China last year.
The additional restrictions under consideration, which would come as part of the process of finalizing those earlier rules, would also bar sales of Nvidia's A800 and H800 chips, and similar advanced chips from competitors like AMD and Intel, unless those companies obtained a license from the Commerce Department to continue shipping to the country.
The deliberations have touched off an intense lobbying battle, with Intel and Nvidia working to prevent further curbs on their business.
Chip companies say cutting them off from a major market like China will substantially eat into their revenues and reduce their ability to spend on research and innovation of new chips. In an interview with The Financial Times last month, Nvidia's chief executive, Jensen Huang, warned that the U.S. tech industry was at risk of "enormous damage" if it were to be cut off from trading with China.
The Biden administration has also been internally debating where to draw the line on chip sales to China. Their goal is to limit technological capacity that could aid the Chinese military in guiding weapons, developing autonomous drones, carrying out cyber warfare and powering surveillance systems, while minimizing the impact such rules would have on private companies.
The measure, which would come as the United States is also considering expanded curbs on U.S. investment in Chinese technology firms, is also likely to ruffle the Chinese government. Biden officials have been working in recent weeks to improve bilateral relations after a fallout with Beijing this year, after a Chinese surveillance balloon flew over the United States.
Antony J. Blinken, the secretary of state, traveled to Beijing this month to meet with his counterparts, and Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen is also expected to travel to China soon.
During a Wednesday appearance at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr. Blinken said that China's concern that the U.S. sought to slow its economic growth was "a lengthy part of the conversation that we just had in Beijing."
Chinese officials, he said, believe the U.S. seeks "to hold them back, globally, and economically." But he disputed that notion.
"How is it in our interest to allow them to get technology that they may turn around and use against us?" he asked, citing China's expanding nuclear weapons program, its development of hypersonic missiles and its use of artificial intelligence "potentially for repressive purposes."
"If they were in our shoes, they would do exactly the same thing," he said, adding that the U.S. was imposing "very targeted, very narrowly defined controls."
Nvidia's valuation had soared in light of the recent boom in generative artificial intelligence services, which can produce complex written answers to questions and images based on a single prompt. Microsoft has teamed up with OpenAI, which makes the chatbot ChatGPT, to generate results in its Bing search engine while Google has built a competing chatbot called Bard.
As companies race to incorporate the technology into their products, it has increased demand for chips like Nvidia's that can handle that the complex computing tasks. That momentum has helped to push Nvidia's market capitalization past $ 1 trillion, making the company the world's sixth largest by value.
Nvidia said in an August filing that $ 400 million in revenue from "potential sales to China" could be subject to U.S. export restrictions, including sales of the A100, if "customers do not want to purchase the company's alternative product offerings" or the government failed to grant licenses to allow the company to continue to sell the chip inside China.
Since the restrictions were imposed, Chinese chip makers have been trying to overhaul their supply chains and develop domestic sources of advanced chips, but China's capabilities to produce the most advanced chips remains many years behind that of the United States.
Dan Wang, a visiting scholar at Yale Law School, said that the impact of advanced chip restrictions on Chinese tech companies was uncertain.
"Most of their business needs are driven by less advanced chips, as fewer of them are playing on the fringes of the most advanced A.I.," he said.

Huge Arts Space Opens in Britain: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Since the late '70s, Manchester, in the north of England, has been a focal point for British pop culture. The city is still mostly known by the rest of the world for the bands it helped produce: Joy Division, New Order, the Stone Roses, Oasis and the Smiths all have ties to the city.
Now a new multipurpose arts venue aims to cement Manchester as a destination for the fine arts, too. It marks how the city's cultural scene has transformed in recent decades, from a site for D.I.Y art-making to a desirable home for large-scale investment and corporate sponsorship.
Aviva Studios, named for the insurance company that provided some of the funding, opens in Manchester's city center at the end of the month. It is a huge, highly configurable space that includes a nearly 70-foot-high, 5,000-capacity warehouse venue and a 1,500-seat auditorium. It will also provide a permanent home to the multidisciplinary Manchester International Festival.
The venue was initially named Factory International, after the local club night that became Joy Division and New Order's record label, but a name change accompanied the announcement of Aviva's sponsorship deal on Tuesday.
The expensive new institution, largely funded with public money, now faces the problem of connecting to a city with an increasingly complicated identity.
After years of postindustrial decline, Manchester has recently had a development and property boom, with its city-center population ballooning, and Microsoft and Amazon opening large offices in the area. But that prosperity hasn't always been shared by the rest of the city, and in the Greater Manchester region, more than a quarter of children were living in poverty in 2021, according to government data. The city is also more racially diverse than much of the rest of Britain.
"Manchester is, in a sense, a complicated public for elite arts to connect to, with very different populations," said Joshi Herrmann, founder of The Mill, a local newsletter. "Trying to find stuff that reaches across those different divides is really, really difficult."
Herrmann pointed to recent projects that have tried: The Guardian's "Cotton Capital" project, which analyzed Manchester's role in the slave trade; Manchester Museum's curatorial shift to embrace the city's South Asian population; and a spate of recent books that complicate dominant narratives around Oasis, Factory Records and the heady days of the Haçienda nightclub.
Aviva Studios "is a space for making and exploring the possibilities of new large-scale work," said John McGrath, the site's chief executive and artistic director. The space opens on June 30 with "You, Me and the Balloons," a site-specific installation by the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, and this summer it will host some of the festival's performances, including those by the psychedelic jazz band The Comet is Coming and the cabaret artist Justin Vivian Bond.
The first in-house production -- the "Matrix"-inspired dance show "Free Your Mind," directed by Danny Boyle -- will be the centerpiece of a nine-day "welcome party" for Aviva Studios in October.
Since before plans for the new venue were announced, the Manchester International Festival has been grappling with how to balance attracting artists from around the world with speaking to and representing local residents. Founded in 2007, the festival was at first very focused on mounting large-scale productions and "bringing extraordinary work from around the world" to Manchester, said McGrath, who is also the festival's artistic director. In its early days, "there was a sense that the festival wasn't necessarily connecting in a deep way with the city," he added.
The biennial festival is still seen by many of Manchester's residents as "a niche cultural product," said Andy Spinoza, the author of the book "Manchester Unspun." He said many of its productions were devised outside of the city and were later exported to other international arts festivals. Though the Aviva deal "enables the doors to open and the overrun of costs to be settled," he said, the corporate sponsorship feels "a long way" from club nights at the Factory.
One clear benefit to the city is the jobs Aviva Studios is expected to create. Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester's City Council, said the venue would add 1,500 direct and indirect jobs in the next decade, alongside the new Factory Academy, which trains local people for technical jobs within the creative industries. McGrath estimated the venue would generate 1.1 billion pounds, or $ 1.4 billion, for the local economy over the next decade.
The venue is the largest investment in a single arts project by the British government since Tate Modern opened in 2000. Its cost has increased significantly, from £78 million when it was announced in 2014, to more than £210 million in the most recent City Council budget.
Manchester's local government provided around half of that total, with the venue also receiving £106 million from the national government (via the Treasury and Arts Council England) plus £9 million a year toward running costs. The multiyear Aviva deal added another £35 million, The Guardian reported, which, City Council documents from October show, will go in part toward repaying council borrowing.
Aviva Studios opens as public funding for the arts in Britain is increasingly being redistributed, from London to the rest of the country, and from larger institutions to smaller ones. In November, Arts Council England announced that organizations like the English National Opera and the Barbican Center were losing their government subsidies. This was part of the British government's commitment, announced in February last year, to increasing cultural investment and grass-roots access to the arts outside of London.
While the Manchester venue represents a significant investment in the arts outside of London, it is still an example of funding being channeled into a large, centralized institution.
In some ways, Aviva Studios completes the Manchester festival's transition from what Spinoza describes as a "guerrilla arts movement using found spaces around the city" to the "big institutional edifice of today," as both arts funding and Manchester's identity become more complex and fragmented.
Along with excitement, the venue's opening has also been met with skepticism from some locals who, Herrmann said, believe the money should have been split across numerous cultural projects in the area. Local reactions to Aviva's sponsorship have also been "definitely negative," he added, even though pragmatic attitudes to private investment have been "a big part of Manchester's story" since the 1980s.
Ahead of the opening next week, the success of Aviva Studios is still up in the air, Spinoza said. If it can indeed provide transformative cultural experiences, he said, "people might start to believe it might be worth it."

Past the dense western suburbs of Washington, the vistas widen into open stretches of fields and farmland -- a panorama frequently interrupted by massive, windowless buildings housing the high-speed computers that make technologies like 5G and artificial intelligence possible.
These data centers are beginning to dot landscapes across the nation, from Virginia to Oregon. Each has hundreds of servers and routers that send and receive data for everyday tasks like streaming content on mobile devices and handling high-speed financial trades.
"It is the engine that powers the machine," said Gordon Dolven, director of data center research in the Americas for CBRE, a commercial real estate services firm. "Everything on your phone is stored somewhere within four walls."
In the past few years, the need for data centers has rapidly increased, fueled by changing work habits during the pandemic and the growth of cloud-based technologies. That means more buildings, more land, more cooling systems and more electricity to support the physical infrastructure that runs 24/7.
Technological advances will only increase demand for data centers, said Noelle Walsh, corporate vice president for cloud innovation and operations at Microsoft. "As a society, we are just getting started," she added.
But finding enough land to build a data center and sufficient electricity to run it can be a challenge. And developers must address community concerns about these behemoth buildings, which are popping up next to housing developments and straining local electricity providers that have struggled to keep up with the demand.
Northern Virginia is a major hub for data centers, partly because of its proximity to major pieces of physical infrastructure that form the foundation of the internet. Amazon announced plans this year to build multiple data centers in Virginia by 2040, an estimated $ 35 billion investment.
On the West Coast, a similar hub lies near Silicon Valley. A majority of the world's internet traffic flows through the sites in these two regions, which function as crucial internet conveyor belts.
Industry analysts say there is growing need to build data centers throughout the rest of the country, part of an effort to bring them closer to customers and take advantage of increasing availability of high-speed networks in rural areas and smaller cities.
The United States had 2,701 data centers in 2022, the largest number in the world, followed by Germany, a distant second, and Britain and China, according to data compiled by Statista. In addition to its two coastal hubs, U.S. data centers are concentrated near major cities, from Atlanta to Seattle.
Large digital companies and the federal government often own and operate their own data centers‌. Other businesses and governments frequently lease space.
"Anyone who can move into somebody else's data center will do that," said Jim Coakley, who develops, owns and manages high-security, high-density data centers. He built his first in Northern Virginia nearly 20 years ago.
Loudoun County, Va., is a key location for data centers, but nearby Prince William County is also experiencing a boom. Elected officials there recently approved a major zoning change for 2,100 acres, paving the way for about 25 million square feet of new data centers.
The zoning decision is not without controversy. Known as the Digital Gateway, the land is close to Manassas National Battlefield Park, whose superintendent has expressed concerns about "potential irreparable harm" to the site. Ann Wheeler, chairman of the board of supervisors in Prince William and a strong backer of the zoning change, lost her re-election bid in the Democratic primary last week after a grass-roots campaign to oust her emphasized her support for more data centers.
Data centers will increasingly be built farther from some of the traditional locations and will move closer to the clients they serve, according to research by Gartner, an I.T. consultancy. But the search for land is not always easy.
"Trying to find qualified land sites that have sufficient power to stand up these facilities -- you need 10 times what I built in 2006," Mr. Coakley said. "They are essentially inhaling massive amounts of energy."
The demand for data centers is so great that as soon as one is on the drawing board, the space is quickly scooped up, even before it goes to market.
"Every building that gets built gets leased," said Ryan Goeller, a commercial real estate broker and principal at KLNB, who specializes in Northern Virginia. "There is no vacancy."
Still, energy demands are complicating growth in some parts of the country. Dominion Energy, Virginia's principal electric utility used by data centers, has said it is struggling to provide enough power. Some residents fear the needs of data centers in the area, such as the construction of new power lines and substations, could fall to residents to subsidize. Silicon Valley is facing similar challenges, according to a February report by CBRE.
To lessen the demand for energy, the industry is trying to find greater efficiencies, said Arman Shehabi, a staff scientist in the Energy Technologies Area at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
"There has been a lot of growth, but a lot of opportunities for efficiency and incentives for efficiency," he said. And as major players in the data industry strive to become greener in the next decade, the pressure is on.
The growth of artificial intelligence "will require new kinds of efficiency," Dr. Shehabi said. "Right now it uses a lot of electricity, but it's not clear if that will continue to be true."
Electrical needs and availability of skilled electricians drove many decisions in 2022 on where to locate data centers, according to CBRE.
Other environmental concerns also loom. Backup systems for data centers often rely on natural gas and diesel, which can counter efforts toward clean energy. Water needs are also expanding, Dr. Shehabi said.
"We have to be strategic in terms of where we place data centers and consider the water stress level of the area when designing them," he said.
And developers face resistance from neighbors. Alex Holt, a recently retired first-grade teacher who lives in Gainesville, Va., was surprised when a large wall that marked the beginning of a data center appeared one morning, just a few yards from her townhouse development. A developer had promised to build a town center. "Years went by, and there was nothing there."
The community was eventually notified that the town center plan was to be replaced by a data center, but Ms. Holt said she did not understand the magnitude of the project at the time. And then, this year, "I looked out my front door and to the left there is this huge wall, and that is when I am like, 'Oh my gosh, this is unbelievable," she said.
But others see an upside to the data centers. They have provided substantial business for the construction industry and, in particular, for electricians.
The jobs pay about $ 75 an hour and offer a pension plan that, in many industries, is a relic of the past, said Joe Dabbs, a business manager for International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 26, which represents workers in Washington, D.C., Maryland and much of Virginia. Half the work on data centers, he estimated, is done by electricians.
"We are working seven days a week with multiple shifts," he said.

But technological advances have increased the need for data centers. Fencing and new trees form a barrier, top.; The demand for data centers is so great that as soon as one is on the drawing board, the space is quickly scooped up, even before it goes to market. But the magnitude of the projects can be a surprise.

A.I. Outshines In Health Care. At Paperwork.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Dr. Matthew Hitchcock, a family physician in Chattanooga, Tenn., has an A.I. helper.
It records patient visits on his smartphone and summarizes them for treatment plans and billing. He does some light editing of what the A.I. produces, and is done with his daily patient visit documentation in 20 minutes or so.
Dr. Hitchcock used to spend up to two hours typing up these medical notes after his four children went to bed. "That's a thing of the past," he said. "It's quite awesome."
ChatGPT-style artificial intelligence is coming to health care, and the grand vision of what it could bring is inspiring. Every doctor, enthusiasts predict, will have a superintelligent sidekick, dispensing suggestions to improve care.
But first will come more mundane applications of artificial intelligence. A prime target will be to ease the crushing burden of digital paperwork that physicians must produce, typing lengthy notes into electronic medical records required for treatment, billing and administrative purposes.
For now, the new A.I. in health care is going to be less a genius partner than a tireless scribe.
From leaders at major medical centers to family physicians, there is optimism that health care will benefit from the latest advances in generative A.I. -- technology that can produce everything from poetry to computer programs, often with human-level fluency.
But medicine, doctors emphasize, is not a wide open terrain of experimentation. A.I.'s tendency to occasionally create fabrications, or so-called hallucinations, can be amusing, but not in the high-stakes realm of health care.
That makes generative A.I., they say, very different from A.I. algorithms, already approved by the Food and Drug Administration, for specific applications, like scanning medical images for cell clusters or subtle patterns that suggest the presence of lung or breast cancer. Doctors are also using chatbots to communicate more effectively with some patients.
Physicians and medical researchers say regulatory uncertainty, and concerns about patient safety and litigation, will slow the acceptance of generative A.I. in health care, especially its use in diagnosis and treatment plans.
Those physicians who have tried out the new technology say its performance has improved markedly in the last year. And the medical note software is designed so that doctors can check the A.I.-generated summaries against the words spoken during a patient's visit, making it verifiable and fostering trust.
"At this stage, we have to pick our use cases carefully," said Dr. John Halamka, president of Mayo Clinic Platform, who oversees the health system's adoption of artificial intelligence. "Reducing the documentation burden would be a huge win on its own."
Recent studies show that doctors and nurses report high levels of burnout, prompting many to leave the profession. High on the list of complaints, especially for primary care physicians, is the time spent on documentation for electronic health records. That work often spills over into the evenings, after-office-hours toil that doctors refer to as "pajama time."
Generative A.I., experts say, looks like a promising weapon to combat the physician workload crisis.
"This technology is rapidly improving at a time health care needs help," said Dr. Adam Landman, chief information officer of Mass General Brigham, which includes Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
For years, doctors have used various kinds of documentation assistance, including speech recognition software and human transcribers. But the latest A.I. is doing far more: summarizing, organizing and tagging the conversation between a doctor and a patient.
Companies developing this kind of technology include Abridge, Ambience Healthcare, Augmedix, Nuance, which is part of Microsoft, and Suki.
Ten physicians at the University of Kansas Medical Center have been using generative A.I. software for the last two months, said Dr. Gregory Ator, an ear, nose and throat specialist and the center's chief medical informatics officer. The medical center plans to eventually make the software available to its 2,200 physicians.
But the Kansas health system is steering clear of using generative A.I. in diagnosis, concerned that its recommendations may be unreliable and that its reasoning is not transparent. "In medicine, we can't tolerate hallucinations," Dr. Ator said. "And we don't like black boxes."
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center has been a test bed for Abridge, a start-up led and co-founded by Dr. Shivdev Rao, a practicing cardiologist who was also an executive at the medical center's venture arm.
Abridge was founded in 2018, when large language models, the technology engine for generative A.I., emerged. The technology, Dr. Rao said, opened a door to an automated solution to the clerical overload in health care, which he saw around him, even for his own father.
"My dad retired early," Dr. Rao said. "He just couldn't type fast enough."
Today, the Abridge software is used by more than 1,000 physicians in the University of Pittsburgh medical system.
Dr. Michelle Thompson, a family physician in Hermitage, Pa., who specializes in lifestyle and integrative care, said the software had freed up nearly two hours in her day. Now, she has time to do a yoga class, or to linger over a sit-down family dinner.
Another benefit has been to improve the experience of the patient visit, Dr. Thompson said. There is no longer typing, note-taking or other distractions. She simply asks patients for permission to record their conversation on her phone.
"A.I. has allowed me, as a physician, to be 100 percent present for my patients," she said.
The A.I. tool, Dr. Thompson added, has also helped patients become more engaged in their own care. Immediately after a visit, the patient receives a summary, accessible through the University of Pittsburgh medical system's online portal.
The software translates any medical terminology into plain English at about a fourth-grade reading level. It also provides a recording of the visit with "medical moments" color-coded for medications, procedures and diagnoses. The patient can click on a colored tag and listen to a portion of the conversation.
Studies show that patients forget up to 80 percent of what physicians and nurses say during visits. The recorded and A.I.-generated summary of the visit, Dr. Thompson said, is a resource her patients can return to for reminders to take medications, exercise or schedule follow-up visits.
After the appointment, physicians receive a clinical note summary to review. There are links back to the transcript of the doctor-patient conversation, so the A.I.'s work can be checked and verified. "That has really helped me build trust in the A.I.," Dr. Thompson said.
In Tennessee, Dr. Hitchcock, who also uses Abridge software, has read the reports of ChatGPT scoring high marks on standard medical tests and heard the predictions that digital doctors will improve care and solve staffing shortages.
Dr. Hitchcock has tried ChatGPT and is impressed. But he would never think of loading a patient record into the chatbot and asking for a diagnosis, for legal, regulatory and practical reasons. For now, he is grateful to have his evenings free, no longer mired in the tedious digital documentation required by the American health care industry.
And he sees no technology cure for the health care staffing shortfall. "A.I. isn't going to fix that anytime soon," said Dr. Hitchcock, who is looking to hire another doctor for his four-physician practice.

The Growing Industry Of 'Adventure Tourism' Inspires New Insurance: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some offer evacuations and others provide coverage for accidental death or injury to cater to the growing adventure tourism market.
The tragic deaths of five people on a tour to see the Titanic shipwreck this week have put the risks of extreme travel into focus. But despite the dangers, travel to out-there locations like the South Pole, remote mountaintops, shark-infested waters and space is becoming more popular.
Adventure tourism is expected to bring in more than $ 1 trillion of revenue globally by 2030, up from an expected $ 316.6 billion in 2022, according to the market research firm Grand View Research.
And as interest grows, so, too, will the number of search and rescue missions, says Mikki Hastings, president of the National Association for Search and Rescue. "Whether it's space or Everest, every person deserves to be found," she said.
The number of businesses aiming to mitigate the danger and potential emergency costs of extreme travel are starting to rise. Some offer rescue and medical evacuation from remote locations. Others are working out new types of insurance policies for pursuits like space travel.
Traditional travel insurance won't swoop in with paramedics, even though it typically covers the cost of an emergency. Dan Richards, the chief executive of Global Rescue, told DealBook that he wanted to fill that gap when he founded the emergency travel management company in 2004. For a $ 360 annual fee, it provides members with evacuation services. Upgrades, including one that promises "military special operations veterans" will retrieve you from dangerous locations like war zones, can raise the fee to about $ 1,800. Similarly, Medjet, a medical evacuation service, sells annual memberships, and companies like AirMed International, SkyMed and others offer emergency extractions.
Travel insurance is going to space. With companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic selling tickets for trips, the market for space tourism is expected to grow to about $ 3 billion by 2030, according to estimates from UBS. The space travel insurance market is still small, but Lloyd's of London, which insures space businesses, began underwriting space travel insurance in 2021, and last year the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance said they would jointly develop space insurance offerings.
Taxpayers will end up footing the bill for some rescues. The cost of search and rescue typically falls on state and local agencies, Ms. Hastings said. About a half-dozen states have laws that allow agencies to charge a rescue recipient, though few do, and there is no cost to those rescued by the federal park services, for example. Last year, lawmakers from Hawaii and Utah introduced legislation to allocate federal funds to help states pay for search and rescue operations, a burden that the drafters said disproportionately fell on less populous places, but the bill failed to gain traction.
The search for the submersible this week most likely cost millions of dollars. The Coast Guard, which led the rescue effort, has jurisdiction over search and rescue in navigable waters in the United States and beyond. "But that's just the definition of their mission," Ms. Hastings argues. "We don't encourage charging for search and rescue because we want people to seek help regardless of socioeconomic status."
Mr. Richards said a client of Global Rescue had signed up for the Titan trip this week, but withdrew his deposit because of safety concerns. Though his team would have worked with international rescuers if the customer had followed through with his plans, the company would not have had the requisite deep sea capabilities. There are some journeys where risk can't really be mitigated yet, he said, adding, "If there's an emergency in space, no one will be able to necessarily reach people." -- Ephrat Livni
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Saudi Arabia goes shopping in Europe. Executives and government officials, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, blitzed Paris this week as part of a road show to attract investment and make its case to host the World Expo in 2030. The oil-rich kingdom has been on a push to diversify its economy and expand its global presence, through investments in a range of sectors including sports.
Lina Khan finally takes on Amazon. The F.T.C. chair shot to fame at the age of 29, when she wrote an academic article criticizing the tech company's dominance of large parts of the American economy. Three years later, her agency has sued Amazon over a different issue: the F.T.C. accused the company of tricking customers into signing up for Prime, its streaming and subscription shopping service.
Musk vs. Zuck? The tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have apparently agreed to a cage fight, after goading each other on social media. Mr. Musk admitted he almost never works out but the Facebook founder has recently taken up Brazilian jujitsu and competed in tournaments and endurance contests.
Prandial Peru. Central, a restaurant in Lima, was crowned the best eatery anywhere by the World's 50 Best Restaurants, one of the most prestigious lists. The venue is known for its creative approach to using domestically produced ingredients and trying to adhere to the traditions and culture of the country.
India's soft power secret
An all-star team from corporate America was in Washington this week for the state visit of India's prime minister, Narendra Modi. And the high number of Indian-American chief executives involved was a demonstration of how the country's diaspora has found a unique place at the nexus of business and political power -- and helped boost the country's image.
The White House dinner was a roll call of top talent. The invite list included the Microsoft chief Satya Nadella; Sundar Pichai, the boss of Alphabet; Arvind Krishna, the head of IBM; the Micron chief Sanjay Mehrotra; and Netflix's chief content officer, Bela Bajaria. Alongside the business leaders were a number of senior government officials, including Vice President Kamala Harris, whose mother was from South India.
Mr. Modi has made tapping into the diaspora a priority. He has held two huge stadium rallies in the United States since becoming prime minister in 2014 -- at Madison Square Garden that year and the NRG Stadium in Houston in 2019 -- and another in Australia last month. Still, his politics are controversial, and he has been blamed for stoking sectarian violence; in 2005, he was denied a visa to enter the United States when he was chief minister of Gujarat State.
But even if views on Mr. Modi are mixed, the view of India is largely positive. A Pew Research Center survey found 37 percent of Indian Americans had little or no confidence in Mr. Modi compared with 21 percent who did. But more than half of Indian Americans have a more positive view of the country.
Targeting the diaspora is an astute move. Indians are the second biggest immigrant group in the United States and seen as a success story. They have a median household income of almost $ 150,000 a year, the highest of any immigrant groups, and account for a majority of H-1B visas for highly-skilled workers. They also maintain strong links to India, through remittances that surpassed $ 100 billion in 2022, and contacts, cross-border trade and investment.
And their success is a useful form of soft power. Joseph Nye, the Harvard professor who coined the term, told The Economist that Mr. Modi's Hindu nationalist politics pose a risk to India's reputation, but "if you have people in diaspora who are successful and create a positive image of the country from which they came, that helps their native country."
The greatest hits of Masa Son's wild PowerPoint presentations
SoftBank is known for big moves like introducing the iPhone in Japan and its outsized, and not always successful, bets on start-ups. But its founder, Masa Son, is also famous for his excitable, elaborate and, sometimes, unusual presentations.
His colorful style has been missed in the past year as the chief executive laid low amid the conglomerate's struggling performance. But this week, Mr. Son returned to the public stage at SoftBank's annual shareholder meeting with a new slide deck.
His presentation featured slides that asked big questions -- including "What is Mankind?" -- and the billionaire's story of how he brainstormed investment ideas with ChatGPT at 4 a.m.
Still, to longtime Mr. Son watchers, it's tough to compete with his previous presentations, which were just as memorably offbeat and unabashedly grandiose. (Son relies on a half-dozen young SoftBank employees to draft his presentations, with his direct input, according to Bloomberg.)
Here are some of DealBook's favorites from over the years:
Mr. Son depicted SoftBank as "producer of golden eggs," whose shiny-shelled progeny included investments in Uber, the chip designer Arm and more.
The "valley of coronavirus," a classic, shows SoftBank's winged unicorns -- that is, the herd of start-ups it has invested in -- flying over the economic trough carved out by Covid-19.
Mr. Son explained SoftBank offers "vision capital," not venture capital. Here, Mr. Son also predicted that A.I. would grow companies' market caps so much that those numbers ... simply couldn't be charted.
SoftBank predicted a sharp rebound in WeWork's fortunes, including one of the most hopeful-seeming earnings charts in recent memory.
Mr. Son used pictures of tofu to illustrate SoftBank's profits. (A footnote explains the analogy.)

In A.I., the Race to Block Child Predators: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A.I. companies have an edge in blocking the creation and distribution of child sexual abuse material. They've seen how social media companies failed.
Dave Willner has had a front-row seat to the evolution of the worst things on the internet.
He started working at Facebook in 2008, back when social media companies were making up their rules as they went along. As the company's head of content policy, it was Mr. Willner who wrote Facebook's first official community standards more than a decade ago, turning what he has said was an informal one-page list that mostly boiled down to a ban on "Hitler and naked people" into what is now a voluminous catalog of slurs, crimes and other grotesqueries that are banned across all of Meta's platforms.
So last year, when the San Francisco artificial intelligence lab OpenAI was preparing to launch Dall-E, a tool that allows anyone to instantly create an image by describing it in a few words, the company tapped Mr. Willner to be its head of trust and safety. Initially, that meant sifting through all of the images and prompts that Dall-E's filters flagged as potential violations -- and figuring out ways to prevent would-be violators from succeeding.
It didn't take long in the job before Mr. Willner found himself considering a familiar threat.
Just as child predators had for years used Facebook and other major tech platforms to disseminate pictures of child sexual abuse, they were now attempting to use Dall-E to create entirely new ones. "I am not surprised that it was a thing that people would attempt to do," Mr. Willner said. "But to be very clear, neither were the folks at OpenAI."
For all of the recent talk of the hypothetical existential risks of generative A.I., experts say it is this immediate threat -- child predators using new A.I. tools already -- that deserves the industry's undivided attention.
In a newly published paper by the Stanford Internet Observatory and Thorn, a nonprofit that fights the spread of child sexual abuse online, researchers found that, since last August, there has been a small but meaningful uptick in the amount of photorealistic A.I.-generated child sexual abuse material circulating on the dark web.
According to Thorn's researchers, this has manifested for the most part in imagery that uses the likeness of real victims but visualizes them in new poses, being subjected to new and increasingly egregious forms of sexual violence. The majority of these images, the researchers found, have been generated not by Dall-E but by open-source tools that were developed and released with few protections in place.
In their paper, the researchers reported that less than 1 percent of child sexual abuse material found in a sample of known predatory communities appeared to be photorealistic A.I.-generated images. But given the breakneck pace of development of these generative A.I. tools, the researchers predict that number will only grow.
"Within a year, we're going to be reaching very much a problem state in this area," said David Thiel, the chief technologist of the Stanford Internet Observatory, who co-wrote the paper with Thorn's director of data science, Dr. Rebecca Portnoff, and Thorn's head of research, Melissa Stroebel. "This is absolutely the worst case scenario for machine learning that I can think of."
Dr. Portnoff has been working on machine learning and child safety for more than a decade.
To her, the idea that a company like OpenAI is already thinking about this issue speaks to the fact that this field is at least on a faster learning curve than the social media giants were in their earliest days.
"The posture is different today," said Dr. Portnoff.
Still, she said, "If I could rewind the clock, it would be a year ago."
'We trust people'
In 2003, Congress passed a law banning "computer-generated child pornography" -- a rare instance of congressional future-proofing. But at the time, creating such images was both prohibitively expensive and technically complex.
The cost and complexity of creating these images has been steadily declining, but changed last August with the public debut of Stable Diffusion, a free, open-source text-to-image generator developed by Stability AI, a machine learning company based in London.
In its earliest iteration, Stable Diffusion placed few limits on the kind of images its model could produce, including ones containing nudity. "We trust people, and we trust the community," the company's chief executive, Emad Mostaque, told The New York Times last fall.
In a statement, Motez Bishara, the director of communications for Stability AI, said that the company prohibited misuse of its technology for "illegal or immoral" purposes, including the creation of child sexual abuse material. "We strongly support law enforcement efforts against those who misuse our products for illegal or nefarious purposes," Mr. Bishara said.
Because the model is open-source, developers can download and modify the code on their own computers and use it to generate, among other things, realistic adult pornography. In their paper, the researchers at Thorn and the Stanford Internet Observatory found that predators have tweaked those models so that they are capable of creating sexually explicit images of children, too. The researchers demonstrate a sanitized version of this in the report, by modifying one A.I.-generated image of a woman until it looks like an image of Audrey Hepburn as a child.
Stability AI has since released filters that try to block what the company calls "unsafe and inappropriate content." And newer versions of the technology were built using data sets that exclude content deemed "not safe for work." But, according to Mr. Thiel, people are still using the older model to produce imagery that the newer one prohibits.
Unlike Stable Diffusion, Dall-E is not open-source and is only accessible through OpenAI's own interface. The model was also developed with many more safeguards in place to prohibit the creation of even legal nude imagery of adults. "The models themselves have a tendency to refuse to have sexual conversations with you," Mr. Willner said. "We do that mostly out of prudence around some of these darker sexual topics."
The company also implemented guardrails early on to prevent people from using certain words or phrases in their Dall-E prompts. But Mr. Willner said predators still try to game the system by using what researchers call "visual synonyms" -- creative terms to evade guardrails while describing the images they want to produce.
"If you remove the model's knowledge of what blood looks like, it still knows what water looks like, and it knows what the color red is," Mr. Willner said. "That problem also exists for sexual content."
'Open questions'
Thorn has a tool called Safer, which scans images for child abuse and helps companies report them to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which runs a federally designated clearinghouse of suspected child sexual abuse material. OpenAI uses Safer to scan content that people upload to Dall-E's editing tool. That's useful for catching real images of children, but Mr. Willner said that even the most sophisticated automated tools could struggle to accurately identify A.I.-generated imagery.
That is an emerging concern among child safety experts: That A.I. will not just be used to create new images of real children but also to make explicit imagery of children who do not exist.
That content is illegal on its own and will need to be reported. But this possibility has also led to concerns that the federal clearinghouse may become further inundated with fake imagery that would complicate efforts to identify real victims. Last year alone, the center's CyberTipline received roughly 32 million reports.
"If we start receiving reports, will we be able to know? Will they be tagged or be able to be differentiated from images of real children?" said Yiota Souras, the general counsel of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
At least some of those answers will need to come not just from A.I. companies, like OpenAI and Stability AI, but from companies that run messaging apps or social media platforms, like Meta, which is the top reporter to the CyberTipline.
Last year, more than 27 million tips came from Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram alone. Already, tech companies use a classification system, developed by an industry alliance called the Tech Coalition, to categorize suspected child sexual abuse material by the victim's apparent age and the nature of the acts depicted. In their paper, the Thorn and Stanford researchers argue that these classifications should be broadened to also reflect whether an image was computer-generated.
In a statement to The New York Times, Meta's global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, "We're working to be purposeful and evidence-based in our approach to A.I.-generated content, like understanding when the inclusion of identifying information would be most beneficial and how that information should be conveyed." Ms. Davis said the company would be working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to determine the best way forward.
Beyond the responsibilities of platforms, researchers argue that there is more that A.I. companies themselves can be doing. Specifically, they could train their models to not create images of child nudity and to clearly identify images as generated by artificial intelligence as they make their way around the internet. This would mean baking a watermark into those images that is more difficult to remove than the ones either Stability AI or OpenAI have already implemented.
As lawmakers look to regulate A.I., experts view mandating some form of watermarking or provenance tracing as key to fighting not only child sexual abuse material but also misinformation.
"You're only as good as the lowest common denominator here, which is why you want a regulatory regime," said Hany Farid, a professor of digital forensics at the University of California, Berkeley.
Professor Farid is responsible for developing PhotoDNA, a tool launched in 2009 by Microsoft, which many tech companies now use to automatically find and block known child sexual abuse imagery. Mr. Farid said tech giants were too slow to implement that technology after it was developed, enabling the scourge of child sexual abuse material to openly fester for years. He is currently working with a number of tech companies to create a new technical standard for tracing A.I.-generated imagery. Stability AI is among the companies planning to implement this standard.
Another open question is how the court system will treat cases brought against creators of A.I.-generated child sexual abuse material -- and what liability A.I. companies will have. Though the law against "computer-generated child pornography" has been on the books for two decades, it's never been tested in court. An earlier law that tried to ban what was then referred to as virtual child pornography was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2002 for infringing on speech.
Members of the European Commission, the White House and the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee have been briefed on Stanford and Thorn's findings. It is critical, Mr. Thiel said, that companies and lawmakers find answers to these questions before the technology advances even further to include things like full motion video. "We've got to get it before then," Mr. Thiel said.
Julie Cordua, the chief executive of Thorn, said the researchers' findings should be seen as a warning -- and an opportunity. Unlike the social media giants who woke up to the ways their platforms were enabling child predators years too late, Ms. Cordua argues, there's still time to prevent the problem of AI-generated child abuse from spiraling out of control.
"We know what these companies should be doing," Ms. Cordua said. "We just need to do it."

An obscure term recently used by the world's most valuable company in a product launch, probably in hopes that it inspires, rather than answers, questions.
This month, Apple unveiled its first headset for what most people would call augmented reality, virtual reality or, if you prefer, mixed reality. But none of those words are uttered in the nine-minute video about the device on Apple's website. Instead, it refers to "spatial computing," a "spatial operating system," "spatial experiences" and "spatial audio."
There's a reason Apple has eschewed the established terminology in favor of more obscure phrasing. And it's not because its device is doing something drastically different from headsets like Meta's Quest Pro or Microsoft's HoloLens, according to Marcus Collins, an advertising executive and the author of "For the Culture: The Power Behind What We Buy, What We Do and Who We Want to Be."
When it comes to spatial computing, Mr. Collins said, "no one knows what that is -- and that provides Apple the opportunity to define it."
Mr. Collins used an NFT as an example: If someone tells you about "a digitized receipt of membership," he said, you might ask follow-up questions like: What is that? How does it work? But if someone simply says, "I'm launching an NFT," you might refer to what you already know about nonfungible tokens and be more likely to say, "No thanks, I'm good."
It's not the first time Apple has strategically renamed a category. Before the App Store, for instance, people didn't talk about apps; they talked about "software programs." Nor is it the only tech giant to try the strategy. In 2013, Facebook used "graph search" to describe its version of, well, search. (It didn't become widely accepted.)
Jim Prosser, a communications consultant who has led teams at Twitter, SoFi and Google, said the intended audience for "spatial computing" might be investors and the news media more than consumers.
"They are pitching a product to people," he said. "For tech press, industry analysts and investors, they're pitching a concept."
The concepts of V.R. and A.R. have some baggage, including decades of sci-fi connotations, products by other companies that have not sold well and in the case of Google Glass, a derisive nickname for its users.
So are we heading into the era of "spatial computing"? As with all new buzzwords, that's not ultimately up to corporate marketing arms. It's up to people who might use it.
"We decide what is acceptable, what's not acceptable," Mr. Collins said. "That's how culture works."

Yes, There Are Compelling Alternatives to Stocks: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: At the moment, money market funds and many bonds are not only less risky, but at current interest rates, they are compelling.
The stock market has been strutting into the spotlight lately, with talk -- however premature -- of a new A.I.-driven bull market popping up nearly everywhere you turn.
Amid all the hoopla, you can easily miss the solid returns being posted by far less glamorous but always important and, at the moment, compelling asset classes: fixed-income investments, including bonds and cash.
Especially for those with short time horizons -- whether you're in retirement or close to it, or saving for a house, education, a car, a vacation or any other worthwhile purpose -- these lower-risk investments are worth a close look.
Until a little over a year ago, when interest rates were about as low as they could go, a mantra on Wall Street was TINA. It's an acronym for "there is no alternative" to the stock market, certainly not from fixed-income investments.
Now, though, it's a different world: Interest rates, or yields, have risen significantly. That's bad if you're borrowing, but if you have money to invest or stash somewhere safe so you can pay your bills, there are plenty of appealing options.
It is debatable whether it's wise to lock in higher interest rates now, or stick with shorter-term holdings until it's clear that the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates. But the time to appreciate the benefits of fixed-income holdings like money market funds and Treasury bills is already here.
Even if you are just starting out in your first job, it's a good idea to try to keep an emergency fund in short-term, interest-bearing accounts. That's also true if you have reached a time of life when drawing down your assets, and making them last, are your main concerns. For the moment, it's possible to get safe returns that are beating inflation.
But Stocks Are Booming
Still, the returns on short-term fixed-income investments are likely to be in the mid-single digits, at best. That's not going to make you rich. But a winning stock could.
There have been some rough patches in the stock market. Even so, the returns of big tech stocks so far have been fabulous. Nvidia, which churns out some of the chips that make A.I. run, was up almost 190 percent for the calendar year as of Thursday. Apple, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft were all up more than 35 percent; Meta (Facebook) and Tesla gained more than 100 percent. Wow.
But for high-flying tech stocks like these, timing is everything. Many are still down from the market's peak on Jan. 3, 2022. So is the benchmark S&P 500 index, which is why I'm not confident this is a bull market for stocks, at least not quite yet.
I'm waiting for the S&P 500 to attain its old lofty level before giving it the bull market designation. And even if the market reaches that pinnacle, I don't expect to be increasing my personal allocation to stocks.
Why? Two big reasons.
First, I never reduced that allocation when stocks were falling. I held on then because I couldn't predict where the market was going. (Wall Street prognosticators can't do it reliably either, as a long history of failed forecasts shows.)
I'm a permanent investor in both stocks and bonds. There's no need to increase the stock proportion of my portfolio now.
Second, I'm not entirely happy about putting money into companies that aren't producing profits sufficient to justify the investment. Take Nvidia. Its shares have lifted the returns of the S&P 500, but that's because it's trading at a lofty price. Its price-to-earnings ratio, which compares price to profits, is now uncomfortably high -- about 10 times that of the S&P 500, according to FactSet data.
Essentially, Nvidia profits will need to soar for many years to justify the company's price. Perhaps artificial intelligence will make that happen. I'm not counting on that, though.
So I'm hanging in without great enthusiasm. History suggests that the overall stock market will rise over the long haul, but doesn't tell us anything about what will happen next month or next week, and it doesn't help much in deciding whether particular companies are worth owning. I'll hold the entire market through index funds but I'm not eager to take extra risks with my hard-earned money.
That's where bonds and cash come in. They provide solid income with much less risk than stocks -- in theory, anyway.
The Effects of Higher Yields
It didn't work out well for bonds last year.
At the start of the year, money market funds offered virtually no interest and bond returns ranged from mediocre to terrible, depending on the month. Stocks were said to be the only game in town.
Interest rates rose as the Federal Reserve battled inflation, and the bond market cratered. Because yields (interest rates) and prices move in opposite directions, and yields started off at rock-bottom levels, soaring interest rates led to the greatest bond market losses of the last century. The Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, a benchmark for investment-grade bonds, lost 15 percent in 2022, according to FactSet. The S&P 500 was even worse, with a 20 percent decline, though that was scant consolation if you held a lot of bonds, or bond funds, that you thought were safe.
Now, it's a different landscape.
Bonds are more reliable than they were last year because yields are already high. Even if they elevate further, there is a plush cushion now, and any potential price declines should be offset, and then some, by the income that bonds are generating. Bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds aren't likely to experience declines in last year's range either. "Bond math tells us it won't happen," Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said in an interview.
With the federal funds rate above 5 percent, rich yield has spilled into money market funds and Treasury bills of up to one year in duration. Now that the debt ceiling battle is behind us, and the Treasury is issuing a huge amount of fresh debt, it's fair to say, once again, that those investments are safe. You can't make that claim about tech stocks.
There are many ways of comparing the valuation of the stock and bond markets.
It's a little wonky.
Basically, the higher the bond yields and the lower the stock earnings, the better bonds stack up, and vice versa. One longstanding metric involves comparing the trailing 12-month earnings yield of the S&P 500 with the yields of Treasury securities. At the moment, bonds are doing nicely in this horse race.
The S&P earnings yield is 4.34 percent, according to FactSet, making it lower and, in some respects, less attractive, than the ultrasafe 5 percent-plus yields on one-year Treasuries. Investment-grade corporate bonds are attractive, too. The yields on 10-year Treasuries are lower, well below 4 percent, reducing their appeal.
What all this means is that the TINA acronym no longer applies: There are viable alternatives to the stock market right now.
These comparisons can go only so far. You aren't likely to receive double-digit annual returns from high-quality fixed-income investments, while you might in the stock market. But the chances of losing a lot of money in bonds are lower, too.
A No-Brainer
With yields above 5 percent, money market funds have a powerful allure. They have been pulling in funds, with total money-market assets in the United States exceeding $ 5.8 trillion in June, according to Crane Data. Interest rates offered by the nation's banks are rising, too, but generally trail those of money market funds.
The question, for opportunistic fixed-income investors, is whether it's time to lock in higher yields by holding bonds with durations of 10 or more years. I'm not sure that it is.
The Federal Reserve has already told investors that short-term interest rates are likely to rise half a percent further this year. Rising yields would hurt the prices of current long-term bonds, as a matter of basic bond math.
On the other hand, the Fed's monetary tightening could set off a recession, which, in turn, would be expected to lead to lower yields and higher prices for bonds.
This quandary makes the timing of fixed-income -- as well as stock -- investments tricky.
Ms. Jones suggests taking a "barbell approach," with much of your investment in very short-term holdings and some of it in five-year bonds, either Treasuries or highly rated investment grade corporates. (A three-year Apple bond has a yield with more than a quarter percentage point premium over three-year Treasury notes, according to FactSet.)
I hold bonds mainly through broad index funds, just as I do stocks, owning a piece of thousands of securities throughout the United States and the rest of the world. How much in stock and how much in bonds -- and in short-term holdings like money market funds or high-yield savings accounts -- is a matter of personal preference. I don't alter my approach much, if at all, because of market shifts.
The only real change in my financial life in recent years is that I moved much of my emergency money from bank accounts to money market funds because of superior yields. But with inflation above 4 percent, I try not to kid myself. Even at today's interest rates, money market funds are barely keeping ahead of rising prices. That's why I keep putting money in the stock market.
But money market funds and savings accounts and, to a lesser extent, bonds, all serve a critical purpose. The money should be waiting, ready for use, even when the stock market is rocky.

Reddit's Chief Says He's Ready for It to 'Grow Up': [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: For the past 11 years, Bucky has put time and effort into stewarding and guiding dozens of communities on Reddit, the sprawling internet message board.
As a "moderator" of roughly 80 different topic-based forums, Bucky -- who goes by "BuckRowdy" on Reddit and who asked that his full name not be used to prevent online harassment -- and others like him are essential to growing and maintaining the social media site, which is one of the internet's biggest destinations for online discussion.
Until two weeks ago, when Bucky revolted.
Reddit had just introduced changes that sharply increased its fees for independent developers who build apps using the company's data. Steve Huffman, Reddit's chief executive, positioned the move partly as a way to shore up the company's finances as it heads toward a long-awaited initial public offering.
But the changes made it so expensive for some third-party developers that a handful who build tools for Reddit's moderators had to shut down or significantly alter their apps. In protest, Bucky and other moderators closed down hundreds of forums on the site, effectively making Reddit unusable for many of its 57 million daily visitors. At one point, the site went offline entirely.
"It is really demoralizing," Bucky said. Being a Reddit moderator and dealing with users is already difficult, he said. "'I take all this abuse for you, and keep your website clean, and this is how you repay us?"'
Reddit, an 18-year-old site that was part of an early wave of social networking, has been trying to "grow up," Mr. Huffman has said in interviews. What is unclear is whether Reddit's community will let it.
Reddit, which is based in San Francisco, has in recent years tried to turn from a rough-and-tumble internet message board into a full-fledged social media business by adding executives and strengthening its advertising capabilities. The 2,000-person company -- which has repeatedly been mentioned as an I.P.O. candidate -- has raised more than $ 1.3 billion and is valued at more than $ 10 billion, according to Crunchbase and Reddit's public statements.
Other social media companies also made similar changes as they grew up. In 2012, Twitter tweaked its rules for how developers could use its data before it went public, outraging users and strangling some popular third-party apps. Facebook has similarly made platform changes that have irked developers and caused backlashes.
But this month's uprising at Reddit stands out because it shows the outsize power of the site's community. The day after moderators closed down hundreds of Reddit forums, users spent 16 percent less time on the site, according to estimates from Similarweb, an analytics company.
"Reddit is basically entirely community led," said Adrian Horning, a Reddit user and data scientist who built a bot that "scrapes" the site's data as a response to the fee changes. "The power regular users have is just inherent in the platform."
In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Huffman said his goal had been to make Reddit better for newcomers and veteran users and to build a lasting business. He said he regretted that developers were surprised by the company's pricing changes and wished he had been more upfront about how the changes would affect them. He added that there was general anxiety over Reddit's changes as part of a natural "maturation process."
"We have the same love for Reddit, and the same fear of losing Reddit, that many of our users do," he said.
Mr. Huffman and Alexis Ohanian founded Reddit in 2005 as a site with a countercultural attitude toward the internet and its advertising-based economy. Reddit espoused free speech at any cost, zero ads and an insular culture that laid a foundation for Web 2.0's meme culture.
Its community has long been rambunctious, getting Reddit into hot water many times. In 2013, it was the site where internet sleuths searched for -- and misidentified -- the Boston Marathon bombing suspect. A year later, it became a dumping ground for nude photos that were hacked from celebrities' cellphones.
But as the site grew and venture investment poured in, its leaders saw the potential for Reddit to build a business. The company had several chief executives, including the former venture capitalist Ellen Pao, before Mr. Huffman -- who had left the company for six years -- was brought back in 2015.
Mr. Huffman eventually embraced the idea that Reddit could make money from advertising, a model he once loathed. He accepted and expanded upon rule changes instituted by Ms. Pao to contain some of the toxic content that people posted to the site. By 2021, he had confidentially filed paperwork to take Reddit public.
But when interest rates soared and the stock market wobbled last year, Mr. Huffman put Reddit's I.P.O. plans on hiatus. Since then, he has systematically worked to improve the site, grow the number of users and bolster the company's bottom line.
In April, Mr. Huffman announced that he planned to restrict access to Reddit's "application programming interface," which is known in industry parlance as A.P.I. The A.P.I. is the main gateway for outsiders to use the company's data for different purposes.
In an interview at the time, Mr. Huffman said he wanted to charge big companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook for access to Reddit data, which has been used to train so-called large language models that are at the heart of artificially intelligent systems.
But Mr. Huffman did not detail how the pricing for the A.P.I. access would change and who would be affected. Then in May, Reddit began telling developers its much higher pricing plans for such access. Early this month, one developer of a popular app, Apollo, announced that he was closing down the app because Reddit's changes would cost him more than $ 20 million in annual fees to operate it.
Many Redditors were deeply upset that Mr. Huffman had appeared to kill off a beloved app in service of building its business. Old-timers were also angry that the heady days of Reddit's anticapitalist roots seemed to be officially over.
Mr. Huffman defended the decision, noting that it costs Reddit millions of dollars to support apps like Apollo, which send no money back to the company and do not display ads from Reddit's advertising partners.
To express their unhappiness, dozens of "super mods" soon restricted access to hundreds of Reddit's most popular communities. To kill advertising across those communities, which are known as subreddits, moderators posted pornography and other explicit material to force the forums to be labeled "18+" forums, which are generally not advertiser friendly. Other forms of protest included a move by one subreddit, r/pics, to allow only photos of John Oliver to be shared in the forum. (Mr. Oliver embraced the Reddit protest, eventually sharing photos of himself as well.)
Mr. Huffman said he did not plan to change course. He said Reddit was enforcing its code of moderator conduct, which prohibits moderators from closing their subreddits and posting pornography and depictions of violence in their forums (unless the forums are designated for such topics of discussion). Reddit also said it would replace moderators who did not abide by the rules after being warned.
Bucky said the protests, which have simmered down this week, have now evolved into more general frustrations that have built up over time.
"Any time we see this kind of blowup, there's a simmering rage underneath the surface that comes back up," he said.
For now, subreddits seem to be returning online slowly, though there are still efforts to resist the changes. Bucky said he was active in the "Save3rdPartyApps" subreddit, which was formed to organize protests on the site that are allowed under Reddit's rules.
Reddit is now further away from a public offering than it was last year, Mr. Huffman said, but will continue building its business. He added that the community revolt was a part of what made Reddit Reddit and said he and his team planned to continue engaging with top moderators who were upset with the changes.
"For better or for worse, this is a very uniquely Reddit moment," he said. "This could only happen on Reddit."

Cloud Giants From China Worry U.S.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Biden administration is exploring whether it can mount a campaign against Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Huawei, potentially fueling tensions with Beijing.
In the digital cold war between the United States and China, American officials are increasingly turning their attention to a new target: Chinese cloud computing giants.
Over the last 18 months, the Biden administration and members of Congress have ramped up their exploration of what can be done to address security concerns about the cloud computing divisions of Chinese tech behemoths like Alibaba and Huawei, five people with knowledge of the matter said.
American officials have discussed whether they can set tighter rules for the Chinese companies when they operate in the United States, as well as ways to counter the companies' growth abroad, three of the people said. The Biden administration has also spoken with the American cloud computing companies Google, Microsoft and Amazon to understand how their Chinese competitors operate, three other people with knowledge of the matter said.
By focusing on the Chinese cloud companies, U.S. officials are potentially widening the scope of the technological tensions between Washington and Beijing. In recent years, the United States has choked China's access to crucial technologies while trying to limit the reach of Chinese tech and telecommunication companies abroad.
Former President Donald J. Trump directed his administration toward hindering Chinese telecom equipment makers like Huawei and ZTE from playing a role in next-generation 5G wireless networks. The Trump administration also targeted Chinese-owned apps like TikTok and Grindr, forcing the sale of the latter, and began working to restrict Chinese involvement in undersea internet cables. President Biden has continued some of these efforts.
Cloud computing companies, which operate vast data centers that provide computing power and software to businesses, would become a new technological front just as China has pushed back on the U.S. roadblocks. On Monday, Wang Yi, China's top foreign affairs official, told Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken that the United States needed to stop interfering with China's technological development.
But American officials fear that Beijing could use Chinese data centers in the United States and abroad to gain access to sensitive data, echoing concerns about Chinese telecom gear and TikTok. Cloud computing is a crucial behind-the-scenes engine of the digital economy, enabling services like video streaming and allowing companies to run artificial intelligence programs.
A White House spokesman declined to comment. Huawei did not offer a comment, while Alibaba and Tencent, another Chinese tech giant with a cloud division, did not respond to requests for comment. Google, Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment.
Samm Sacks, a cyber policy fellow at the New America think tank, said the interest in cloud computing reflected the Biden administration's approach of looking at Chinese influence in the infrastructure of the internet and the digital services that use the web.
"There's an intent to focus on the whole ecosystem across those layers," she said.
U.S. efforts to hinder Chinese tech firms have had mixed success. American restrictions on suppliers to Huawei hurt the company's smartphone business, but efforts to remove Huawei equipment from wireless networks inside the United States continue. The Trump administration forced Grindr's Chinese owners to sell the app, while efforts to push the Chinese internet giant ByteDance to divest TikTok have been unsuccessful.
The global cloud computing market is substantial, with total public cloud revenues of $ 544 billion last year, according to Synergy Research Group. In the United States, Chinese companies account for a tiny fraction of the cloud market, despite having data centers in Silicon Valley and Virginia, said John Dinsdale, the chief analyst at Synergy.
But Chinese cloud companies are making inroads in Asia and Latin America. Huawei's chairman said last year that his company had seen "rapid growth" in its cloud business. In May, Huawei hosted a cloud conference in Indonesia. Alibaba convened a gathering in Mexico last year to promote its cloud products.
Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement that he was concerned that while the Federal Communications Commission could bar some Chinese companies from providing telecom services in the United States, those firms had "still been able to offer services like cloud computing." Mr. Warner wrote legislation that would give the White House more power to police Chinese technology.
In April, nine Republican senators wrote to a group of administration officials encouraging them to investigate and penalize Chinese cloud companies that they said posed a threat to national security, including Huawei, Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu.
"We urge you to use all available tools to engage in decisive action against these firms," they said.
The Commerce and State Departments have been considering how to handle the Chinese cloud computing companies, four people with knowledge of the matter said.
The Commerce Department has looked at creating tighter rules that would govern the Chinese cloud providers, two of the people said. It could create the rules under a new legal authority that allows it to restrict technologies that could pose a threat to national security.
A spokesman for the Commerce Department declined to comment.
The State Department has also started developing a strategy for raising American concerns about Chinese cloud computing providers with other countries, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The agency has already quietly brought the topic up in conversations with foreign governments, which can help diplomats understand what messages work best, one of the people said.
As many Chinese companies benefit from major government subsidies, experts fear that the Chinese cloud computing providers might be able to offer contracts below the rates of their American competitors. The U.S. government could find a way to offer foreign assistance of its own or urge American cloud providers to provide benefits to customers, like free training, to counter the Chinese companies' inducements.
A State Department spokesman said it was critical for every aspect of the global internet -- including data centers -- to be powered by trustworthy equipment. The spokesman added that the agency was also focused on reducing risks associated with wireless equipment, undersea telecom cables and satellites.

Wall St. Ends Mixed After a Tech Pullback: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Drops for technology stocks left Wall Street mixed on Wednesday and sapped more momentum from its five-week rally.
The S&P 500 fell 23.02, or 0.5 percent, to 4,365.69. It was a third straight pullback for the index after it rallied last week to its highest level in more than a year.
Weakness for high-growth stocks hit the Nasdaq composite in particular, and it lost 165.09, or 1.2 percent, to 13,502.20. Still, roughly as many stocks rose as fell on Wall Street, and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped by a milder 102.35 points, or 0.3 percent, to 33,951.52.
Wall Street had been on a tear this year, with the S&P 500 up nearly 14 percent amid hopes that inflation is coming down quickly enough for the Federal Reserve to stop hiking interest rates soon. That would take pressure off the economy and could allow it to avoid a recession. Some analysts say the rally ran too far, too fast while inflation has remained stubbornly high, which could force the Fed to keep rates higher for longer.
High rates have already helped cause three high-profile failures in the U.S. banking system. The banking industry remains under pressure, even after the federal government acted quickly to provide support.
Smaller and regional banks account for about 50 percent of U.S. commercial and industrial lending, according to Ann Miletti, head of active equity at Allspring Global Investments. And pressure on these banks would make it tougher for smaller and midsize businesses to get loans, which would hurt the economy.
Ms. Miletti said she's leaning toward the probability of a coming U.S. recession because of how much the Fed has already raised rates in such a short time. She said the recession may not be very deep, but it could still last longer than many predict.
"Inflation is retreating," she said, "but it won't be a smooth decline."
In the bond market, yields pared their gains from earlier in the morning. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was holding steady at 3.72 percent. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.71 percent from 4.69 percent late Tuesday.
Higher interest rates drag on all kinds of stocks, bonds and other investments. But high-growth stocks tend to be some of the hardest hit, and several Big Tech stocks were among the heaviest weights on the market.
Nvidia fell 1.7 percent, giving back some of its spectacular gains from earlier this year driven by Wall Street's frenzy around the artificial-intelligence industry. The chip maker is still up nearly 195 percent for the year so far after saying that A.I. would result in a tremendous leap in its revenue.
Tesla dropped 5.5 percent, and Microsoft lost 1.3 percent.
FedEx fell 2.5 percent after its forecast for upcoming earnings looked low against some analysts' expectations. That was despite reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than Wall Street forecast.
On the winning side of Wall Street, Dollar Tree rose 4.6 percent after it stuck with its forecast for earnings this fiscal year.
Energy stocks also climbed along with oil prices. Exxon Mobil rose 1.1 percent, and Baker Hughes gained 2.3 percent.

Amazon Traps Users in Service, Regulator Says: [National Desk]

Full text: The lawsuit is the first time that the Federal Trade Commission under its chair, Lina Khan, has taken Amazon to court.
The Federal Trade Commission sued Amazon on Wednesday, accusing it of illegally inducing consumers to sign up for its Prime service and then hindering them from canceling the subscription, in the most aggressive action against the company to date by the agency's chair, Lina Khan.
In its lawsuit, the F.T.C. argued that Amazon had "duped millions of consumers" into enrolling in Prime by using "manipulative, coercive or deceptive" design tactics on its website known as "dark patterns." And when consumers wanted to cancel, Amazon "knowingly complicated" the process with byzantine procedures.
"Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money," Ms. Khan said in a statement.
Amazon said in a statement that the F.T.C.'s "claims are false on the facts and the law" and that "by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership." The company accused the F.T.C. of filing the lawsuit without advance notice, while the two sides were still in conversation about the case.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, takes aim at a key Amazon program that has become ubiquitous in the lives of more than 200 million customers. Prime members pay $ 139 a year to get packages shipped faster from Amazon's retail store, to stream movies and series from its in-house studio and to receive discounts when they check out at Amazon's Whole Foods grocery chain. The company has added more perks to Prime over time, including live sports, and has raised the annual subscription fee.
The F.T.C.'s action was the first time that the agency took Amazon to court under Ms. Khan, who rose to fame with a viral critique of the company and who is ramping up scrutiny of the e-commerce giant. Ms. Khan has said the power that big tech companies exert over online commerce requires regulators to be far more aggressive, and she has taken actions against them.
Under Ms. Khan, the F.T.C. continued a lawsuit against Meta, the owner of Facebook, arguing that it cut off nascent competitors by buying Instagram and WhatsApp. The agency also sued to block Microsoft's blockbuster $ 69 billion deal for the video game publisher Activision Blizzard.
Ms. Khan has yet to bring the kind of sweeping antitrust case against Amazon that the company's critics have demanded. The F.T.C.'s antitrust bureau has investigated Amazon's practices for years, and critics and supporters of the company are closely watching to see how she will move forward with the findings.
Amazon recently settled cases with the F.T.C. that began before Ms. Khan's tenure. The company agreed to pay $ 25 million last month to settle commission claims that its Alexa home assistant devices had illegally collected children's data. The company also settled another privacy case with the F.T.C. over its Ring home security subsidiary.
The new lawsuit is part of a larger effort by regulators to limit the power of tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta. The Department of Justice has in recent years filed multiple antitrust cases against Google. European regulators have also scrutinized behemoth tech companies, passing privacy laws, working on proposals to rein in artificial intelligence and filing charges against Google and others.
Prime has for years attracted subscribers with its menu of benefits, turning the service into one of the keys to Amazon's dominance. The service was introduced in 2005 for $ 79 a year. Over time, the company added more perks to the program, like streaming video, and increased the price. It raised the fee to $ 139 a year in 2022.
In 2021, Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members. Customers last year spent $ 35 billion on Amazon subscriptions, primarily Prime memberships, according to the company's financial disclosures.
On Wednesday, the F.T.C. said Amazon had made it particularly difficult to buy a product in its store without also subscribing to Prime while checking out. In one example, it said, the company used "repetition and color" to push customers' focus to Prime's promise of free shipping and away from the service's price, leading some to subscribe to Prime without "informed consent."
The agency also said Amazon made it hard to find the page that allowed consumers to cancel the service. Once they found it, the company bombarded them with offers intended to change their mind. The lawsuit said Amazon had named the process for canceling Prime after the Iliad, the lengthy Greek epic poem that recounts the Trojan War.
Amazon "substantially revamped its Prime cancellation process for at least some subscribers" shortly before the lawsuit, the heavily redacted complaint said. But "prior to that time, the primary purpose of the Prime cancellation process was not to enable subscribers to cancel, but rather to thwart them."
The F.T.C. asked the court to stop Amazon from engaging in those practices and to force the company to pay an unspecified financial penalty.
Questions over how hard it is to cancel Prime have increased in recent years. In a 2021 complaint to the District of Columbia attorney general, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group, said Amazon used manipulative designs to "frustrate the intentions of users who intend to cancel their Amazon Prime subscriptions."
The F.T.C. has recently pledged to crack down on designs meant to nudge consumers or confound their efforts to cancel a service.
"It's having to play a lot of catch-up because these practices have evolved for many years without serious attention and enforcement," said John Davisson, a senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. "Going after a company as big as Amazon is sending a message to other players in the industry."
Critics consider Prime central to Amazon's business because it keeps customers inside the company's retail store by offering them other perks, like access to Amazon streaming exclusives like "Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan" and "The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power."
Amazon has said Prime provides benefits for consumers. When the company lobbied in recent years against changes to antitrust laws focused on the tech giants, it regularly told lawmakers and the media that the changes would hobble Prime.
Ms. Khan's next steps on Amazon will be closely watched. She rose to prominence after publishing a 2017 article in The Yale Law Journal when she was a Yale law student.

WASHINGTON — The Federal Trade Commission sued Amazon on Wednesday, accusing it of illegally inducing consumers to sign up for its Prime service and then hindering them from canceling the subscription, in the most aggressive action against the company to date by the agency’s chair, Lina Khan.
In its lawsuit, the FTC argued that Amazon had “duped millions of consumers” into enrolling in Prime by using “manipulative, coercive or deceptive” design tactics on its website known as “dark patterns.” And when consumers wanted to cancel, Amazon “knowingly complicated” the process with byzantine procedures.
“Amazon tricked and trapped people into recurring subscriptions without their consent, not only frustrating users but also costing them significant money,” Khan said in a statement.
Amazon said in a statement that the FTC’s “claims are false on the facts and the law” and that “by design we make it clear and simple for customers to both sign up for or cancel their Prime membership.” The company accused the FTC of filing the lawsuit without advance notice while the two sides were still in conversation about the case.
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, takes aim at a key Amazon program that has become ubiquitous in the lives of more than 200 million customers. Prime members pay $139 a year to get packages shipped faster from Amazon’s retail store, to stream movies and series from its in-house studio and to receive discounts when they check out at Amazon’s Whole Foods grocery chain. The company has added more perks to Prime over time, including live sports, and has raised the annual subscription fee.
The FTC’s action was the first time that the agency took Amazon to court under Khan, who rose to fame with a viral critique of the company and who is ramping up scrutiny of the e-commerce giant. Khan has said the power that big tech companies exert over online commerce requires regulators to be far more aggressive, and she has taken actions against them.
Under Khan, the FTC continued a lawsuit against Meta, the owner of Facebook, arguing that it cut off nascent competitors by buying Instagram and WhatsApp. The agency also sued to block Microsoft’s blockbuster $69 billion deal for the video game publisher Activision Blizzard.
Khan has yet to bring the kind of sweeping antitrust case against Amazon that the company’s critics have demanded. The FTC’s antitrust bureau has investigated Amazon’s practices for years, and critics and supporters of the company are closely watching to see how she will move forward with the findings.
Amazon recently settled cases with the FTC that began before Khan’s tenure. The company agreed to pay $25 million last month to settle commission claims that its Alexa home assistant devices had illegally collected children’s data. The company also settled another privacy case with the FTC over its Ring home security subsidiary.
The new lawsuit is part of a larger effort by regulators to limit the power of tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta. The Department of Justice has in recent years filed multiple antitrust cases against Google. European regulators have also scrutinized behemoth tech companies, passing privacy laws, working on proposals to rein in artificial intelligence and filing charges against Google and others.
Prime has for years attracted subscribers with its menu of benefits, turning the service into one of the keys to Amazon’s dominance. The service was introduced in 2005 for $79 a year. Over time, the company added more perks to the program, like streaming video, and increased the price. It raised the fee to $139 a year in 2022.
In 2021, Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members. Customers last year spent $35 billion on Amazon subscriptions, primarily Prime memberships, according to the company’s financial disclosures.
On Wednesday, the FTC said Amazon had made it particularly difficult to buy a product in its store without also subscribing to Prime while checking out. In one example, it said the company used “repetition and color” to push customers’ focus to Prime’s promise of free shipping and away from the service’s price, leading some to subscribe to Prime without “informed consent.”
The agency also said Amazon made it hard to find the page that allowed consumers to cancel the service. Once they found it, the company bombarded them with offers intended to change their mind. The lawsuit said Amazon had named the process for canceling Prime after the Iliad, the lengthy Greek epic poem that recounts the Trojan War.
Amazon “substantially revamped its Prime cancellation process for at least some subscribers” shortly before the lawsuit, the heavily redacted complaint said. But “prior to that time, the primary purpose of the Prime cancellation process was not to enable subscribers to cancel, but rather to thwart them.”
The FTC asked the court to stop Amazon from engaging in those practices and to force the company to pay an unspecified financial penalty.
Questions over how hard it is to cancel Prime have increased in recent years. In a 2021 complaint to the District of Columbia attorney general, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group, said Amazon used manipulative designs to “frustrate the intentions of users who intend to cancel their Amazon Prime subscriptions.”
The FTC has recently pledged to crack down on designs meant to nudge consumers or confound their efforts to cancel a service.
“It’s having to play a lot of catch up because these practices have evolved for many years without serious attention and enforcement,” said John Davisson, a senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “Going after a company as big as Amazon is sending a message to other players in the industry.”
Critics consider Prime central to Amazon’s business because it keeps customers inside the company’s retail store by offering them other perks, like access to Amazon streaming exclusives like “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan” and “The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.”
Amazon has said Prime provides benefits for consumers. When the company lobbied in recent years against changes to antitrust laws focused on the tech giants, it regularly told lawmakers and the media that the changes would hobble Prime.
Khan’s next steps on Amazon will be closely watched. She rose to prominence after publishing a 2017 article in the Yale Law Journal when she was a Yale law student. That paper, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” argued that modern interpretations of antitrust law should be widened to address tech companies like Amazon, effectively upending decades of established antitrust doctrine.
“As Amazon continues both to deepen its existing control over key infrastructure and to reach into new lines of business, its dominance demands the same scrutiny,” she wrote.

Thousands of Reddit Communities Stay Dark as Policy Protest Continues: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Users' anger continued to bubble over changes to the company's business model.
Thousands of volunteer-run message boards on Reddit remained dark on Tuesday, a week after moderators of the communities began what they called a 48-hour protest against Reddit's planned changes to its business model.
More than 3,200 message boards, known as subreddits, remained restricted or private, down from nearly 9,000 last week, according to a website tracking the revolt. Others were flooded with memes mocking Reddit's chief executive, Steve Huffman, as anger continued to bubble on the site over changes to the company's business model.
Moderators of some of the communities that reopened said they had done so after Reddit threatened to replace them.
"We want the best for this community and have no choice but to open it back up -- or have it opened for us," the moderators of the Apple enthusiast forum r/Apple wrote in a message in which they called on Mr. Huffman to resign.
Other communities reopened but chose to allow only GIFs, memes and pictures of the host of "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver" to be posted.
The moderators of r/pics, which has 30 million members, for example, took a poll on whether to "return to normal operations" or "only allow images of John Oliver looking sexy." The Oliver option won decisively, with 37,331 votes to 2,329 for "return to normal." Many of the memes that flooded the community derided Mr. Huffman.
Mr. Oliver encouraged the revolt, posting photos of himself in various get-ups -- pink panda-print pajamas, a wizard's hat with a purple cape -- on Twitter, along with the message "Dear Reddit, excellent work. Attn: r/pics -- have at it..."
The backlash erupted last week over changes that Reddit announced in April when it said it would begin to charge some large-scale companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network's vast selection of memes, GIFs, videos and conversation threads.
Reddit said it no longer wanted to give away such a valuable asset to companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft, which have been using its data to develop artificial intelligence systems.
But some Reddit users and developers said the pricing scheme would kill off popular third-party apps like Apollo, rif is fun for Reddit, ReddPlanet and Sync that people rely on to browse and comment on the site. Moderators said the changes could hurt some of the tools that they use to manage freewheeling discussions on the site.
Starting on June 12, many Reddit moderators made their communities "private," or inaccessible to members, for at least 48 hours. Some users had trouble using the site that day; Reddit said that a "significant number of subreddits shifting to private caused some expected stability issues."
A week later, many communities were still up in arms.
"You can see there are a lot of subreddits still holding on that have a lot of frustration over how the whole thing has been handled and the unwillingness of Reddit to really give an inch here," Christian Selig, the developer of Apollo, an iOS app widely praised for its design and rich features, said in an interview on Tuesday.
Mr. Selig said he still planned to shut down the app on June 30, a day before he said he would begin to incur $ 20 million in annual charges under Reddit's pricing plan.
Despite the turmoil, Mr. Huffman has indicated that Reddit, which is preparing for a possible initial public offering this year, will not change course.
He told NBC News last week that Reddit was considering allowing users to vote out moderators who led the protest, comparing them to "landed gentry" who were thwarting the site's democratic ethos. An estimated 57 million people visit the platform each day.
"Protest and dissent is important," Mr. Huffman told The Associated Press last week. "The problem with this one is it's not going to change anything because we made a business decision that we're not negotiating on."
Tim Rathschmidt, a Reddit spokesman, said that, in his reference to "landed gentry," Mr. Huffman was "talking about how users have been vocal about wanting their communities back open," and that many moderators and users disagreed with the protest.
"In the future, we could look at developing a way for community members to vote out a mod if they disagree with decisions being made that impact the entire community," Mr. Rathschmidt said in an email on Tuesday.
He said, however, that Reddit was not threatening to replace moderators. "That's not how we operate," Mr. Rathschmidt said. "Pressuring people is not our goal. We're communicating expectations and how things work."
Mr. Selig said that developers and moderators were not opposed to Reddit's charging for access to its data. He said they had asked the company to consider charging less and offering more time before the new prices took effect.
Instead, company leaders "walled themselves off and said: 'You don't matter. We will just stick through this,"' Mr. Selig said. "And that's where a lot of the frustration cuts through."

Full text: Doing product research, making grocery lists and booking travel can be easier with tools like ChatGPT.
Hello! We're back with another edition of On Tech: A.I. , a pop-up newsletter that teaches you about artificial intelligence, how it works and how to use it.
Last week, I walked you through how to use A.I. to prepare for the dreaded office meeting. Now let's take the money you've earned from all that hard work and move on to something more fun: shopping.
The most time-consuming part of shopping for many is the research process: poring through review sites and plucking out the item that's right for you, whether it's coffee equipment or a hotel room that is both convenient and affordable.
I'll cover what A.I. can do to help make informed purchasing decisions quickly and efficiently. For this exercise, I'll focus on using chatbots, including Microsoft's Bing, Google's Bard and OpenAI's ChatGPT to do product research. I'll also explore how to use ChatGPT plug-ins, a more recent development, for creating grocery lists and planning travel.
Product research
Let's say you like to make your coffee in a French press, and you're looking to buy a grinder that costs no more than $ 200. The typical research process is to do a web search and read a bunch of reviews.
A.I. chatbots can streamline this process. Microsoft's Bing and Google's Bard, which are hooked up to search engines by default, are currently the best equipped for getting up-to-date product recommendations.
As is always the case, the right prompt will get the best results. For this example, you would type something like: "Act as a shopping assistant. I am looking for a coffee bean grinder for French press that is well reviewed. It should cost no more than $ 200." In response, Bing and Bard will list examples of grinders that fit the criteria.
You can also ask the chatbots tougher questions, like which household appliances will be long lasting. You could type something like, "Act as a shopping assistant. I am looking for a refrigerator. Which brands have the highest reliability rating and what are some well reviewed refrigerators from them?"
The bots will tell you which appliances have the highest reliability ratings from publications like Consumer Reports and The Times's own Wirecutter.
Whenever you're using a chatbot, it's a good idea to check the results for accuracy. But doing a web search to double check the bots' recommendations is a whole lot faster than manually searching from scratch.
Grocery shopping
Now let's talk about the future. OpenAI is developing a plug-in platform, which is essentially a third-party app store that allows you to add capabilities to ChatGPT. Currently only subscribers who pay $ 20 a month for ChatGPT Plus can use plug-ins, including the ones for web browsing and shopping.
To use plug-ins if you're a paying subscriber, go to the ChatGPT settings menu, click "beta features," and turn on "plugins." Then, in the ChatGPT app or website, go to the GPT-4 tab and click "plugins." Then click on the downward arrow and select the plugin store. This is where you can search for apps. Let's start with one for the grocery delivery app, Instacart.
Try typing a prompt like, "I am making pasta Bolognese. What's a good recipe and what are the ingredients?" The chatbot will list the ingredients that go into the dish and offer to generate a shopping list.
Another interesting way to use the plug-in is to shop around dietary restrictions. For example, "I am making dinner for a pescatarian. Give me a suggestion and the ingredients." The bot will suggest a meal -- in my case, lemon garlic butter shrimp -- and list the ingredients.
Clicking on the shopping list will bring you to Instacart, where you can automatically load all the items into your cart and choose a grocery store to purchase them from.
If you don't want to pay for ChatGPT Plus, you can still use A.I. for grocery shopping. Try asking Bing for a recipe, then ask it for the shopping list of required ingredients. In one particularly neat trick, you can even ask it to organize your shopping list by grocery store aisle.
Travel planning
There are also plug-ins from travel sites like Kayak and Expedia that help with trip planning. For example, you may be looking for a well-rated hotel within walking distance of tourism sites for up to $ 500 a night -- a process that would typically require wading through reviews and perusing maps.
Let's try the Expedia plug-in as a short-cut.
"I am traveling to Florence, Italy from July. Find me well reviewed hotels that are within walking distance to tourist attractions. My budget is $ 500 a night." The bot responded to this prompt with a list of top-rated hotels rated 9 and above on Expedia near tourist attractions like the Central Market and the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore.
You can also use the Expedia plug-in to search for flights. For example, "I am trying to fly to Milan, Italy from San Francisco on July 28. What are my best options with short layovers?" ChatGPT will then load Expedia's results for the shortest flights. It returned three flights from KLM, Delta and United, all with single layovers for no more than two hours. (I tried the same prompts with Bard and Bing, which showed generic information and inaccurate ticket prices -- not helpful!)
What's next?
Next week, I'll cover how to use A.I. to organize your life. This article appeared in print on page B3.

Murky Frontier of Rules For the Space Industry: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Estimated to be worth about $ 460 billion, space businesses sometimes operate in legal black holes.
Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson are racing to establish a presence in space. But what rights and obligations come with that?
It's not clear what the rules are, even as the $ 460 billion space industry is growing quickly.
Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company founded by Mr. Branson, announced on Thursday that it would launch its first commercial spaceflight this month, joining Mr. Bezos' Blue Origin, and Mr. Musk's SpaceX in sending ticketed passengers to space. But travel is just one emerging corner of the industry, which is mostly fueled by U.S. and international government contracts. The sector includes companies in the fields of satellites and communications, solar power, manufacturing, and even mining. One, Orbital Assembly, hopes to open a luxury extraterrestrial hotel by 2025.
Citigroup analysts project that space businesses will reach a trillion dollars in revenue by 2040.
All this activity raises legal questions.
In theory, space belongs to everyone. In 1967, as the United States and the Soviet Union were building up their nuclear arsenals, the United Nations signed a treaty that says no country can claim territory in space. "We didn't want to bring the Cold War into space," Michelle Hanlon, co-director of the air and space law program at the University of Mississippi, told DealBook.
Since then, a U.N. space committee has made four more treaties and five sets of principles covering areas like arms control and liability for damage caused by space objects. All are premised on the notion that space "should be devoted to enhancing the well-being of all countries and humankind, with an emphasis on promoting international cooperation."
That perspective is about to collide with reality, said Curt Blake, a space lawyer at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and the former C.E.O. of a space start-up. "Humans have done such a bad job regulating anything of common good, like the oceans and air," he said. "Are we going to be better at caring for the moon?"
One upcoming test is a race between China and the United States to get to the poles of the moon to mine water, which could make it possible to produce fuel in space. There is little understanding of what will happen when they both get there.
"Will they live on separate sides or dot their bases?" Ms. Hanlon asked. "We don't know because we have these regulatory gaps."
Another potential conflict is brewing over 170 million pieces of debris like satellites abandoned in the Earth's orbit, known as "space trash," because their accumulation makes exploration more difficult and dangerous. Since nobody owns space, it isn't always clear whose responsibility it is to clean it up. In September, the Federal Communications Commission adopted rules ordering companies to take down nonfunctioning satellites within five years, down from 25 years.
Lawyers are wrestling with these sorts of issues at gatherings like The Hague Space Diplomacy Symposium this week at the Leiden University in the Netherlands, which focused on cooperation amid rising geopolitical tensions and competition.
The U.S. government has deliberately left some holes. In 2004, Congress imposed a moratorium on safety regulations for commercial space launches, essentially a free pass, or "learning period," that is set to expire in October. It has lasted so long because there hasn't been enough development to base new rules on. In April, a report from the RAND Corporation recommended against extending again, and the Federal Aviation Administration is planning more oversight.
Business leaders caution against creating so much regulation that it pushes innovation offshore while recognizing that we need rules. And futurists naturally have a long and expansive view. Many are concerned that we'll exploit resources in space before we're able to "access the infinity of the universe," as Ms. Hanlon put it.
"We just need to hold it together for 200 years," she said. -- Ephrat Livni
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
The Fed takes a breather. At Wednesday's meeting, the central bank kept interest rates unchanged for the first time in more than a year. But officials suggested that rates would rise more in 2023, as inflation remains "well above" the Federal Reserve's target.
JPMorgan settles. The bank secured a potential $ 290 million deal with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's victims, who claimed that the bank had overlooked red flags in his activity because it valued him as a wealthy client. JPMorgan Chase still faces a related lawsuit by the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Bill Gates meets Xi Jinping in Beijing. The Microsoft co-founder is one of the first prominent U.S. business leaders to meet the Chinese leader since the start of the pandemic. Their talks preceded a visit by Antony J. Blinken, the secretary of state, to China.
Bud Slight. Modelo Especial replaced Bud Light as the best-selling in America, after a boycott by consumers over a promotional post by a transgender influencer. The controversy has spotlighted the challenges that brands and retailers like Adidas and Target have faced in marketing to L.G.B.T.Q. consumers in a polarized political environment.
Michael Jordan nets a big profit. The investors Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall reportedly bought his majority stake in the National Basketball Association's Charlotte Hornets for $ 3 billion. Jordan acquired the team in 2010 for $ 275 million and will retain a minority stake.
Companies may not know when employees use A.I.
Companies including Accenture, PwC and Morgan Stanley announced big initiatives to get their employees to use generative A.I. tools like chatbots and image generators. But even at companies that haven't introduced these tools, many workers are using them -- and they may not be mentioning it.
In a survey of 4,491 white-collar workers by the consulting firm Oliver Wyman, 39 percent of those who use generative A.I. tools said they had done so without their employer's knowledge in the last three months.
There are risks if workers use these tools without training, including that they will share private company data or not understand that A.I. tools can produce inaccurate work. (See: the lawyer who ended up citing made-up court cases in a legal brief.)
But there may also be potential. In a report this week, McKinsey estimated that generative A.I. could add $ 2.6 trillion to $ 4.4 trillion to the global economy. The research looked at 63 use cases for generative A.I. across 850 occupations, finding that 60 to 70 percent of all work tasks could be automated by currently available technology.
"Employee interest, especially amongst the younger generations, is likely ahead of many of their managers," said Ana Kreacic, the chief operating officer of Oliver Wyman's think tank, in an email to DealBook. "Some organizations are leading and some are catching up, but it takes time for best practices to evolve across different industries."
9.7 percent
-- How much consumer prices in Sweden rose last month. One potential contributing factor? Beyoncé kicked off her world tour in Stockholm, and fans who flocked to the city to see the singer pushed up the prices for hotel rooms and restaurant meals, according to Sweden's statistics agency.
On our radar: 'Winner Sells All'
Walmart and Amazon's battle to dominate retail has been an epic corporate fight. In "Winner Sells All," which publishes on Tuesday, the business journalist Jason Del Rey chronicles the clash, with hundreds of billions of dollars at stake, in illustrative detail. Mr. Del Rey has covered e-commerce for more than 10 years, and many of Amazon's and Walmart's top executives agreed to interviews for the book, as did their workers. Kirkus Reviews called it "an eye-opening look at a battle of corporate titans."

Full text: For Rocky Bucano, who fell for the music after buying a Salt-N-Pepa CD in 1986, his work in the Bronx "doesn't feel like work."
The Universal Hip Hop Museum, which will be part of Bronx Point, a new mixed-use development with affordable housing in the South Bronx, is not scheduled to open until 2025. But that hasn't stopped Rocky Bucano, the museum's executive director, from celebrating hip-hop's 50th anniversary this year.
"[R]Evolution of Hip Hop," an exhibition tracing the genre's momentum from 1986 to 1990, will offer free admission this August in honor of the anniversary. The show is running through September at the nonprofit's temporary headquarters in the Bronx Terminal Market.
Mr. Bucano, 63, lives in the Clason Point section of the Bronx with his wife, Kim, 62, who recently retired as a public-school teacher, and the younger of their two sons, Kylerr, 31. Rounding out the household are Tangy, the family's Bichon Frisé mix, and Toby, a former stray cat.
6 IN THE MORNIN' I get up around 6 or 7 a.m. and open up my Microsoft Surface Duo 2. I scroll through emails and read the Sunday edition of The Times. I do this in bed very quietly. I'm trying not to wake my wife up.
THE MESSAGE Around 8 or 10 o'clock, we normally order pancakes and scrambled eggs and maybe some corned beef hash from the Crosstown Diner. We have our breakfast watching the Sunday news. I like the political talk shows, like "This Week with George Stephanopoulos." My wife watches Channel 12, which has news on the Bronx, religiously. After that, we try to get our spiritual vibe on by watching Joel Osteen.
IN DA CLUB The exhibit at the Bronx Terminal Market opens at 1 p.m. My son Kylerr and I usually jump in the car and shoot over there. He oversees social media for the museum and is a docent. Most of the time, I'm there all afternoon. I'm meeting with people -- our visitors, our guests. Sometimes I'm working with the people who work at the museum, making sure everything is tight in terms of telling the stories of the different artifacts people are looking at. Sometimes I'll jump on the turntables if I feel like playing music.
SUPA DUPA FLY On Sundays we have a visiting D.J., Cutman LG. He's part of our team and he's always playing great music: James Brown and a lot of classic hip-hop like Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Salt-N-Pepa. When people come in, not only do they see objects about the great golden era of hip-hop, they actually feel it and experience what the music was like.
PEOPLE EVERYDAY Being here on a Sunday is work, but it doesn't feel like work. I've been a part of this project from the beginning, since we first started looking for locations in 2014. It's part of my DNA now. It's who I am. And I enjoy meeting people from different parts of the country and different parts of the world and learning what their connection to hip-hop is. Each person has a unique story about how they fell in love with it. Sometimes it's the first record they bought, sometimes it's a Run-DMC concert they went to in 1986. I remember when I bought my first Salt-N-Pepa CD. That's what got me involved in loving the music.
ROCK BOX People from Europe come over here because they're true fans of classic hip-hop and they want to relive the earliest years. On weekdays, we have teachers bringing their students. Kids come in, and many have never seen a cassette player or a vinyl. They don't know what a boom box is. We have a huge boom box, and when they see it they're like, "What is that? Why do they call it a boom box?" So it's just a lot of feel-good moments for me. I see people smiling and doing their selfies.
IT'S TRICKY When I began this journey, I wasn't really astute in what's called "the museum experience." I've been learning on the job. The first exhibit was bare-bones. The second one we fine-tuned, made it a better experience in terms of how it was curated. And now, with this third exhibit, I think we've knocked it out of the park. It's the most immersive, the most entertaining, the most informative. I would say the number one thing people like right now is the Dapper Dan Lounge, where we have a couple of his original jackets, or the D.J. booth.
PUSH IT! When I get home, I might go to the gym in our community's clubhouse and lift some weights, or sometimes I'll walk down to the water. One of the ferry stops is not too far from where we live, so I'll go down there and stand by the water and enjoy the sights. It's a way of putting everything in perspective for me.
RAPPER'S DELIGHT For dinner on Sundays we like to order turkey wings from a soul food restaurant. We'll also get collard greens, and for my son, mac and cheese. I can't eat that stuff, but I love sweet potatoes. After dinner I'm normally on my computer, emailing, sending notes to my team, looking out for anything on social media I should be paying attention to. People say I work too much.
IT WAS A GOOD DAY I might watch some film on Netflix or Amazon Prime, but I go to bed early. My wife comes to bed late because she's retired. But at 10 o'clock I say, "I'll see you later, I'm going to sleep." And that's it.

Who Was Out to Get This Man?: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Kyle Roche was a rising star in the field of cryptocurrency law -- until his career imploded. Who orchestrated his downfall?
When he arrived in London in late January 2022, Kyle Roche was riding high. At just 34 years old, he had established himself as one of the biggest players in the burgeoning field of cryptocurrency litigation. He boasted a law firm bearing his name, lawsuits filed against more than a dozen crypto companies and a huge verdict against the man who claimed to have invented Bitcoin.
Now a new opportunity beckoned. Two businessmen had flown Mr. Roche over from Miami to discuss investing in a new business venture he was forming. A waiting car whisked him from Heathrow Airport to meet the men in a plush townhouse in Mayfair.
That evening, Mr. Roche went to dinner with one of the men, who identified himself as Mauricio Andres Villavicencio de Aguilar. Mr. Villavicencio, who said he was from Argentina, had picked one of London's fanciest restaurants, Jean-Georges in the Connaught hotel.
When he woke up the next morning, Mr. Roche says, he felt groggy. He couldn't remember much aside from being pretty sure he had spotted Mr. Villavicencio's business partner, a Norwegian named Christen Ager-Hanssen, lurking at a nearby table. The brain fog was odd because he didn't think he'd had all that much to drink. As he flew back to Miami a few days later, Mr. Roche couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.
Months passed. Then, one day last summer, Mr. Roche's world detonated. A website called Crypto Leaks posted two dozen videos of him that had been secretly recorded during his meetings with Mr. Villavicencio and Mr. Ager-Hanssen.
The videos portrayed Mr. Roche and his law firm, Roche Freedman, as being in the pocket of one of their crypto clients. In one clip, Mr. Roche revealed that the client, a company called Ava Labs, had granted him tens of millions of dollars' worth of its digital tokens, making him beholden to the company and its founder, whom he likened to a "brother."
In other clips, Mr. Roche made it sound like his sole concern, even when representing other clients, was to promote Ava Labs' interests. He bragged that he had managed to distract regulators from looking into Ava Labs and suggested that his lawsuits against other crypto companies were designed to harm Ava Labs' competitors.
In the videos filmed at Jean-Georges, Mr. Roche looked intoxicated, waving his hands, cursing and referring to jurors as "idiots."
After he got over his initial shock, Mr. Roche realized he had a major problem on his hands. The videos made him look corrupt. To defend himself, he published a piece on Medium saying they had been "illegally obtained" and "spliced out of context," and he denied being in cahoots with Ava Labs.
It was too late. One after another, companies that Roche Freedman had sued filed motions to disqualify the firm from their cases. In October, the first of those motions succeeded: A federal judge in New York tossed Roche Freedman from a case it had filed against Tether, the operator of the world's most used "stablecoin."
Within days, Mr. Roche was forced to resign from the law firm he had founded. With his career in tatters, he says, he enrolled in ethics classes and began to see a therapist.
Mr. Roche was felled by his own loose lips and his overly cozy relationship with a client. But he also was the victim of an elaborate international setup.
The question was: Who was behind it?
The New Sheriff
Mr. Roche grew up in a working-class family in Buffalo. The oldest of four siblings, he shared a bedroom with intellectually disabled twin brothers. Watching them struggle with simple tasks while he breezed through school made Mr. Roche feel both guilty and determined to succeed so he could one day provide for them.
After attending Purdue University and working for a few years as a management consultant, he enrolled at Northwestern University's Pritzker School of Law. During his first semester, in the fall of 2013, he caught the crypto bug. Joe Delich, a classmate who later worked with Mr. Roche at his law firm, remembers him constantly checking the price of Bitcoin on his laptop during classes. Mr. Roche cashed out before a big price drop, earning about $ 100,000 in profits. He used the money to pay his tuition.
As a third-year student, Mr. Roche collaborated with a professor on a paper discussing Bitcoin's virtues as the first currency free from government interference. That led to an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal.
"That was the first moment I thought, 'Oh, wow, maybe I can do something with this,"' he said.
By then, Mr. Roche was a first-year associate at Boies Schiller Flexner, where he was developing a reputation as the kid who understood crypto. When a colleague in Miami approached him a few days after the Journal piece with a Bitcoin-related case, he jumped at the opportunity.
The case pitted a man named Ira Kleiman against Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist who claims to be Bitcoin's enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Mr. Kleiman wanted to sue Dr. Wright for defrauding his brother David, a paraplegic computer forensics expert who had died in his mid-40s, out of billions of dollars of Bitcoin they supposedly mined together in Bitcoin's early days.
The facts were murky: There was evidence that Dr. Wright and David Kleiman had indeed been friends, and David Kleiman had been known to carry around his neck an encrypted hard drive that might or might not have contained the passwords to Bitcoin wallets. But many people considered Dr. Wright a fraud, calling into question the notion that he had mined early blocks of Bitcoin, much less cheated someone out of them.
To Mr. Roche, that was one of the allures of the case. If he could make Dr. Wright hand over his files during discovery, he might be able to solve Bitcoin's great enduring mystery: Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity. Mr. Roche and his young Miami colleague, Velvel Freedman, were soon devoting most of their time to the case.
In 2019, with the Kleiman case slowly progressing toward a trial, Mr. Roche met a new client, who was locked in a dispute with a crypto company. In a matter of days, he negotiated a lucrative settlement on the client's behalf. As a token of his gratitude, the client agreed to invest $ 7.5 million with Mr. Roche and Mr. Freedman so they could start their own law firm. At first, Mr. Roche set up shop in a co-working space in Brooklyn, but when the pandemic hit he joined Mr. Freedman in Miami.
Their firm, Roche Freedman, soon made a splash. Mr. Roche had watched with increasing skepticism as a number of crypto start-ups rode Bitcoin's growing popularity by marketing new digital coins that surged in value and then crashed. It reminded him of pump-and-dump scams in which a group inflates the price of a stock by talking it up publicly before selling all at once and making off with the profits.
Regulators didn't seem to be doing anything about it, so Mr. Roche decided he would. On April 3, 2020, Roche Freedman filed lawsuits seeking class action status against seven issuers of digital coins, alleging they had pumped what amounted to unregistered securities with false statements and then dumped them, leaving retail investors holding the bag.
It also sued four crypto exchanges for enabling the coin issuers' conduct, foreshadowing some of the legal arguments the Securities and Exchange Commission used to sue Binance and Coinbase this month. (Binance and Coinbase have vowed to fight the S.E.C. in court.)
Those suits were just an opening salvo: Sixteen months later, Mr. Roche filed his biggest securities fraud case yet. It alleged that a British entrepreneur, Dominic Williams, and entities he controlled had swindled investors out of billions of dollars by aggressively promoting, and then dumping, a digital coin tied to a grandiose plan to revolutionize computing.
Mr. Williams had boldly proclaimed that his Internet Computer blockchain -- a decentralized network of computers powered by a digital token called ICP -- would supplant the big cloud services offered by Amazon and Microsoft and become humanity's primary computing platform. But after an initial surge that briefly made it one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies, ICP had plummeted 92 percent -- a collapse that Mr. Roche's lawsuit attributed to "massive" selling by Mr. Williams and other insiders. (Mr. Williams denied the allegations.)
If crypto was the Wild West of finance, Mr. Roche had announced himself as the new sheriff. But sheriffs, as he would soon learn, make enemies.
A Big Verdict
Around the time Mr. Roche was working on his first pump-and-dump lawsuits, he befriended Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell University computer science professor who was hatching a cryptocurrency project of his own in the Brooklyn co-working space where Mr. Roche initially worked. Mr. Roche agreed to do legal work for Dr. Sirer's company, Ava Labs, in exchange for an equity stake and a small percentage of the cryptocurrency tokens it planned to issue.
Such arrangements aren't uncommon in the tech industry. Mr. Roche's former boss David Boies had struck a similar one with Theranos, the blood-testing company whose founder, Elizabeth Holmes, was later convicted of fraud. The scandals involving Theranos and another client, Harvey Weinstein, had badly tarnished Mr. Boies's reputation, but to Mr. Roche he remained a role model.
When Mr. Roche reached his deal with Dr. Sirer in September 2019, he says, there was no guarantee that Dr. Sirer's project would be successful. At the time, the tokens granted to him were valued at less than 3 cents each.
A year later, Dr. Sirer's blockchain, Avalanche, went live. As crypto fever spread, its AVAX tokens rocketed to more than $ 100, making Mr. Roche a multimillionaire.
Mr. Roche's compensation agreement with Ava Labs was supposed to be confidential, but anyone who wanted to gather intel on him would soon be able to find out about it. In February 2021, Roche Freedman fired one of its partners, Jason Cyrulnik. He hit back with a lawsuit that disclosed each partner's share of the AVAX tokens.
That fall, Kleiman v. Wright went to trial in U.S. District Court in Miami. Mr. Roche gave a fiery opening statement during which he repeatedly pointed an accusatory finger at Dr. Wright.
In the end, the trial didn't resolve whether Dr. Wright had really invented Bitcoin, but the jury ordered him to pay $ 100 million in damages to a company Ira Kleiman had inherited from his dead brother. (The judge later tacked on $ 43 million in interest.) Mr. Roche and Mr. Freedman toasted over cocktails at a Miami restaurant. Their law firm stood to make more than $ 10 million.
With the Kleiman trial over, Mr. Roche turned to a project he and Dr. Sirer had been discussing: Ryval, a company that would help people raise money on Avalanche to pay for lawsuits. Mr. Roche saw it as a GoFundMe for litigation and thought it could level the legal playing field between individuals and big corporations.
But while he was plotting his new venture, someone was plotting his downfall.
The Setup
In December 2021, Mr. Roche received an email from someone he trusted introducing him to Mr. Villavicencio, according to a copy of the message reviewed by The New York Times. Mr. Villavicencio presented himself as an associate of Mr. Ager-Hanssen, a venture capitalist who was interested in Mr. Roche's new project. Mr. Roche had no idea who the two men were, but he welcomed the approach: He was raising money for Ryval, which had received some attention in the crypto press.
After an introductory Zoom call, Mr. Roche agreed to fly to London at the men's expense the next month.
They met at Mr. Ager-Hanssen's townhouse office, where things soon took a strange turn: According to Mr. Roche, Mr. Ager-Hanssen pressed his index finger to Mr. Roche's forehead -- "I didn't think it was a gun motion, but I thought he was trying to intimidate me" -- and said that if he was going to invest with him, he needed to know everything Mr. Roche was capable of.
In hindsight, Mr. Roche wishes he had gotten up and left. Instead, he took it as a cue to sell himself harder. According to Mr. Roche, Mr. Ager-Hanssen spent the next couple of hours goading him into bragging about his relationship with Ava Labs while Mr. Villavicencio, who was sitting across a table from him, secretly filmed him.
Armed with the information he had gleaned from the lawsuit filed by the fired Roche Freedman partner, Mr. Ager-Hanssen coaxed Mr. Roche into saying he had been granted 1 percent of the supply of Avalanche's AVAX tokens. At the time, that would have been equivalent to more than $ 100 million. (Mr. Roche says he exaggerated the 1 percent figure, and AVAX tokens have since lost 80 percent of their value.)
Mr. Ager-Hanssen then asked Mr. Roche to give examples of how he had made himself useful to Ava Labs executives.
"They haven't been sued yet, and there's a reason for that," said the baby-faced Mr. Roche, wearing a blazer over a button-down shirt and sweater, according to a video clip from the meeting.
"Brilliant," Mr. Ager-Hanssen replied. "Good answer."
Mr. Roche later elaborated. "I deal with making sure that the S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. have other magnets to go after," he said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He added, "Litigation can be a tool" to attack competition. "It's a fantastic tool."
That night, when Mr. Roche got to Jean-Georges, he says, he found Mr. Villavicencio at a table and a drink waiting for him. Mr. Roche recalls Mr. Ager-Hanssen arriving about 15 minutes later and sitting at a nearby table with a tall blond man. Mr. Roche says the rest of the evening was a blur. He now believes the drink was laced with a drug, though he has no proof.
In one video clip from the restaurant, Mr. Roche revels in his power to crush companies with lawsuits. In another, Mr. Villavicencio asks him whether Ava Labs has sued any of its competitors. Mr. Roche replies, "No, they have me do that on behalf of the class," suggesting that he filed his class actions against other crypto companies at Ava Labs' behest.
After the dinner at Jean-Georges, Mr. Roche never saw Mr. Villavicencio again, though he did meet one last time with Mr. Ager-Hanssen in New York.
On Aug. 26, Mr. Roche was in California to attend a wedding when one of his clients came across the Crypto Leaks videos on Twitter and sent him a link.
Blindsided, he scrambled to understand when and where they had been recorded. Once he pieced it together, he called Mr. Freedman and reached out to clients to do damage control.
Mr. Roche's biggest worry was his comments suggesting he had filed lawsuits to harm Ava Labs' competitors and to distract regulators. It was baseless bluster, he now says, blaming the blue-collar kid in him who was trying to impress a prospective investor. He says he started putting together the first lawsuits a month before he met Dr. Sirer, the Ava Labs founder.
Dr. Sirer denied that he or Ava Labs had anything to do with those lawsuits, some of which he said he strongly disagreed with. Six weeks before Crypto Leaks published its videos, Ava Labs' general counsel wrote an article criticizing one of the Roche Freedman lawsuits as "scurrilous."
To insulate his law firm, Mr. Roche recused himself from the lawsuits Roche Freedman had filed against crypto companies, sold his stake in Ava Labs back to the company and stopped representing it. (Mr. Roche declined to say whether he profited on the sale.)
When it became clear that wouldn't be enough, he resigned from his firm, which was renamed Freedman Normand Friedland.
'Someone That Doesn't Exist'
A week after the videos surfaced, Mr. Roche got another jolt: A friend of one of his colleagues reported that he had heard rumors at a crypto event that Mr. Roche's life was in danger, according to an affidavit later filed in court. Spooked, Mr. Roche and his fiancée hunkered down in a short-term rental in Brooklyn.
Mr. Roche felt that his world was unraveling. He says he became so stressed that he stopped eating and lost 10 pounds. After several weeks, he and his fiancée returned to Miami but, still worried for their safety, moved to an apartment leased under a relative's name.
While Mr. Roche's career imploded, Mr. Ager-Hanssen called for Mr. Roche's disbarment and tweeted about a report he had compiled on Mr. Roche that largely repeated the Crypto Leaks allegations. He also emailed Mr. Cyrulnik, the former Roche Freedman partner, and offered to help him prove his case against Mr. Roche and his former firm.
To Mr. Roche, the implication was clear: Mr. Ager-Hanssen had set him up.
In an interview, Mr. Ager-Hanssen denied that. "This was not an operation run by me at all," he said. "It was run by someone else." He said that he had been genuinely interested in investing in Ryval, that Mr. Villavicencio had filmed the videos at his office without his knowledge and that he wasn't at Jean-Georges that night. Mr. Ager-Hanssen said he thought he knew who was behind the operation, but he wouldn't reveal the person's identity.
Mr. Villavicencio, for his part, seems to have disappeared. Attempts to reach him at the phone number and email address he gave Mr. Roche were unsuccessful.
Mr. Ager-Hanssen said he didn't know Mr. Villavicencio's whereabouts. He said he had met the man only a few weeks before Mr. Roche came to London and allowed that Villavicencio was probably not his real name. "Of course, it's someone that doesn't exist," he said.
But Mr. Ager-Hanssen, in addition to running his venture capital firm, has long had a sideline digging up dirt on behalf of wealthy clients entangled in business disputes in Britain and Scandinavia.
On multiple occasions, he has secretly recorded his targets. For example, in a 2014 interview, he recounted how he had snared the adversary of a Swedish financier with a hidden microphone and boasted that he employed former intelligence officers from the C.I.A., MI6 and Mossad.
But if Mr. Ager-Hanssen did set Mr. Roche up, who hired him to do it -- and why?
A Series of Clues
Plenty of people had reason to celebrate Mr. Roche's downfall.
First in line were Dr. Wright, the man who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, and Calvin Ayre, a gambling tycoon who bankrolls Dr. Wright. Dr. Wright quickly sought to exploit the videos, filing an unsuccessful motion to disqualify Roche Freedman from the Kleiman case. And after the videos came out, Mr. Ager-Hanssen became chief executive of nChain, a company that Mr. Ayre funds and that employs Dr. Wright as chief science officer.
Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Ayre acknowledged that he and Dr. Wright were "pleased" when the videos came out. But they denied having anything to do with the London sting.
Mr. Roche believes them because he thinks he knows who hired Mr. Ager-Hanssen: Mr. Williams, the British entrepreneur who was the target of Roche Freedman's biggest pump-and-dump lawsuit.
A series of clues, documented by his former law firm in court filings, led Mr. Roche to that conclusion. The first is that on May 12, 2022, Mr. Williams wrote on Twitter that he was "coming for" his critics. That was the same day the cryptoleaks.info domain name was registered.
Then, on June 9, 2022, the Crypto Leaks website went live. Billing itself as the defender of "the honest crypto community," it posted two reports that aligned with Mr. Williams's interests. The first espoused a complicated theory about the ICP token crash that Mr. Williams had previously floated on Twitter.
The second attacked The Times for an article it had published about the crash. Mr. Williams tweeted a link to that Crypto Leaks report, calling it "Gobsmacking." The Dfinity Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit that Mr. Williams created to oversee his blockchain, has since sued The Times for defamation in New York. The Times is seeking to dismiss the suit.
The videos of Mr. Roche were the crux of Crypto Leaks' third exposé. After they were published, Mr. Williams and Dfinity filed a motion to disqualify Roche Freedman as plaintiffs' counsel in the pump-and-dump lawsuit, saying Mr. Roche's comments demonstrated "a disregard for the integrity of the judicial system."
In court filings opposing the motion, Mr. Roche's former firm accused Mr. Williams of being behind Crypto Leaks and said the videos filmed at Jean-Georges showed signs of deepfake alterations. It also blamed Mr. Williams for the rumored death threats against Mr. Roche.
Pete Padovano, a spokesman for Dfinity and Mr. Williams, denied that anyone at the foundation had made death threats. Asked if he was connected to Crypto Leaks, Mr. Williams said, "We appreciate the coverage of Crypto Leaks and believe their articles speak for themselves."
Mr. Roche spent last fall lying low, but he has recently begun to rebuild his career as a solo practitioner.
In April, he won a $ 12.5 million verdict on behalf of six former Cantor Fitzgerald partners who sued the Wall Street firm for withholding some of their compensation. The judgment, which Cantor has appealed, opened the way for Mr. Roche to file a separate class action against the firm. Mr. Roche is also representing dozens of investors in a dispute with Coinbase.
But Mr. Roche's videotaped remarks continue to dog him and his former firm. Last month, the judge overseeing the pump-and-dump case granted Mr. Williams's motion and disqualified Freedman Normand Friedland as plaintiffs' counsel.
The judge cited Mr. Freedman's continuing friendship with Mr. Roche -- and the fact that they together control a cryptocurrency wallet holding more than a million AVAX tokens. He also voiced concern that the law firm was consumed by "extreme animosity" toward Mr. Williams, which might lead it to turn down equitable settlement offers.
Unless the lead plaintiff can enlist new lawyers by August, the lawsuit is essentially dead. In Mr. Roche's view, the plot against him worked to perfection.

When he arrived in London in late January 2022, Kyle Roche was riding high. Just 34, he had established himself as one of the biggest players in the burgeoning field of cryptocurrency litigation. He boasted a law firm bearing his name, lawsuits filed against more than a dozen crypto companies and a huge verdict against the man who claimed to have invented bitcoin.
Now a new opportunity beckoned. Two businessmen had flown Roche over from Miami to discuss investing in a business venture he was forming. A waiting car whisked him from Heathrow Airport to meet the men in a plush town house in Mayfair.
That evening, Roche went to dinner with one of the men, who identified himself as Mauricio Andres Villavicencio de Aguilar. Villavicencio, who said he was from Argentina, had picked one of London’s fanciest restaurants, Jean-Georges in the Connaught hotel.
When he woke up the next morning, Roche said, he felt groggy. He couldn’t remember much aside from being pretty sure he had spotted Villavicencio’s business partner, a Norwegian named Christen Ager-Hanssen, lurking at a nearby table. The brain fog was odd because he didn’t think he’d had all that much to drink. As he flew back to Miami a few days later, Roche couldn’t shake the feeling that something was amiss.
Months passed. Then, one day last summer, Roche’s world detonated. A website called Crypto Leaks posted two dozen videos of him that had been secretly recorded during his meetings with Villavicencio and Ager-Hanssen.
The videos portrayed Roche and his law firm, Roche Freedman, as being in the pocket of one of their crypto clients. In one clip, Roche revealed that the client, a company called Ava Labs, had granted him tens of millions of dollars’ worth of its digital tokens, making him beholden to the company and its founder, whom he likened to a “brother.”
In other clips, Roche made it sound like his sole concern, even when representing other clients, was to promote Ava Labs’ interests. He bragged that he had managed to distract regulators from looking into Ava Labs and suggested that his lawsuits against other crypto companies were designed to harm Ava Labs’ competitors.
In the videos filmed at Jean-Georges, Roche looked intoxicated, waving his hands, cursing and referring to jurors as “idiots.”
After he got over his initial shock, Roche realized he had a major problem on his hands. The videos made him look corrupt. To defend himself, he published a piece on Medium saying they had been “illegally obtained” and “spliced out of context,” and he denied being in cahoots with Ava Labs.
It was too late. One after another, companies that Roche Freedman had sued filed motions to disqualify the firm from their cases. In October, the first of those motions succeeded: A federal judge in New York tossed Roche Freedman from a case it had filed against Tether, the operator of the world’s most used “stablecoin.”
Within days, Roche was forced to resign from the law firm he had founded. With his career in tatters, he said, he enrolled in ethics classes and began to see a therapist.
Roche was felled by his own loose lips and his overly cozy relationship with a client. But he also was the victim of an elaborate international setup.
The question was: Who was behind it?
The New Sheriff
Roche grew up in a working-class family in Buffalo, New York. The oldest of four siblings, he shared a bedroom with intellectually disabled twin brothers. Watching them struggle with simple tasks while he breezed through school made Roche feel both guilty and determined to succeed so he could one day provide for them.
After attending Purdue University and working for a few years as a management consultant, he enrolled at Northwestern University’s Pritzker School of Law. During his first semester, in the fall of 2013, he caught the crypto bug. Joe Delich, a classmate who later worked with Roche at his law firm, remembers him constantly checking the price of bitcoin on his laptop during classes. Roche cashed out before a big price drop, earning about $100,000 in profits. He used the money to pay his tuition.
As a third-year student, Roche collaborated with a professor on a paper discussing bitcoin’s virtues as the first currency free from government interference. That led to an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal.
“That was the first moment I thought, ‘Oh, wow, maybe I can do something with this,’” he said.
By then, Roche was a first-year associate at Boies Schiller Flexner, where he was developing a reputation as the kid who understood crypto. When a colleague in Miami approached him a few days after the Journal piece with a bitcoin-related case, he jumped at the opportunity.
The case pitted a man named Ira Kleiman against Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist who claims to be bitcoin’s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Kleiman wanted to sue Wright for defrauding his brother David, a paraplegic computer forensics expert who had died in his mid-40s, out of billions of dollars of bitcoin they supposedly mined together in bitcoin’s early days.
The facts were murky: There was evidence that Wright and David Kleiman had indeed been friends, and David Kleiman had been known to carry around his neck an encrypted hard drive that might or might not have contained the passwords to bitcoin wallets. But many people considered Wright a fraud, calling into question the notion that he had mined early blocks of bitcoin, much less cheated someone out of them.
To Roche, that was one of the allures of the case. If he could make Wright hand over his files during discovery, he might be able to solve bitcoin’s great enduring mystery: Satoshi Nakamoto’s true identity. Roche and his young Miami colleague, Velvel Freedman, were soon devoting most of their time to the case.
In 2019, with the Kleiman case slowly progressing toward a trial, Roche met a new client who was locked in a dispute with a crypto company. In a matter of days, he negotiated a lucrative settlement on the client’s behalf. As a token of his gratitude, the client agreed to invest $7.5 million with Roche and Freedman so they could start their own law firm. At first, Roche set up shop in a coworking space in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, but when the pandemic hit he joined Freedman in Miami.
Their firm, Roche Freedman, soon made a splash. Roche had watched with increasing skepticism as a number of crypto startups rode bitcoin’s growing popularity by marketing new digital coins that surged in value and then crashed. It reminded him of pump-and-dump scams in which a group inflates the price of a stock by talking it up publicly before selling all at once and making off with the profits.
Regulators didn’t seem to be doing anything about it, so Roche decided he would. On April 3, 2020, Roche Freedman filed lawsuits seeking class-action status against seven issuers of digital coins, alleging they had pumped what amounted to unregistered securities with false statements and then dumped them, leaving retail investors holding the bag.
It also sued four crypto exchanges for enabling the coin issuers’ conduct, foreshadowing some of the legal arguments the Securities and Exchange Commission used to sue Binance and Coinbase this month. (Binance and Coinbase have vowed to fight the SEC in court.)
Those suits were just an opening salvo: Sixteen months later, Roche filed his biggest securities fraud case yet. It alleged that a British entrepreneur, Dominic Williams, and entities he controlled had swindled investors out of billions of dollars by aggressively promoting, and then dumping, a digital coin tied to a grandiose plan to revolutionize computing.
Williams had boldly proclaimed that his Internet Computer blockchain — a decentralized network of computers powered by a digital token called ICP — would supplant the big cloud services offered by Amazon and Microsoft and become humanity’s primary computing platform. But after an initial surge that briefly made it one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies, ICP had plummeted 92% — a collapse that Roche’s lawsuit attributed to “massive” selling by Williams and other insiders. (Williams denied the allegations.)
If crypto was the Wild West of finance, Roche had announced himself as the new sheriff. But sheriffs, as he would soon learn, make enemies.
A Big Verdict
Around the time Roche was working on his first pump-and-dump lawsuits, he befriended Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell University computer science professor who was hatching a cryptocurrency project of his own in the Brooklyn coworking space where Roche initially worked. Roche agreed to do legal work for Sirer’s company, Ava Labs, in exchange for an equity stake and a small percentage of the cryptocurrency tokens it planned to issue.
Such arrangements aren’t uncommon in the tech industry. Roche’s former boss David Boies had struck a similar one with Theranos, the blood-testing company whose founder, Elizabeth Holmes, was later convicted of fraud. The scandals involving Theranos and another client, Harvey Weinstein, had badly tarnished Boies’ reputation, but to Roche he remained a role model.
When Roche reached his deal with Sirer in September 2019, he said, there was no guarantee that Sirer’s project would be successful. At the time, the tokens granted to him were valued at less than 3 cents each.
A year later, Sirer’s blockchain, Avalanche, went live. As crypto fever spread, its AVAX tokens rocketed to more than $100, making Roche a multimillionaire.
Roche’s compensation agreement with Ava Labs was supposed to be confidential, but anyone who wanted to gather intel on him would soon be able to find out about it. In February 2021, Roche Freedman fired one of its partners, Jason Cyrulnik. He hit back with a lawsuit that disclosed each partner’s share of the AVAX tokens.
That fall, Kleiman v. Wright went to trial in U.S. District Court in Miami. Roche gave a fiery opening statement during which he repeatedly pointed an accusatory finger at Wright.
In the end, the trial didn’t resolve whether Wright had really invented bitcoin, but the jury ordered him to pay $100 million in damages to a company Ira Kleiman had inherited from his dead brother. (The judge later tacked on $43 million in interest.) Roche and Freedman toasted over cocktails at a Miami restaurant. Their law firm stood to make more than $10 million.
With the Kleiman trial over, Roche turned to a project he and Sirer had been discussing: Ryval, a company that would help people raise money on Avalanche to pay for lawsuits. Roche saw it as a GoFundMe for litigation and thought it could level the legal playing field between individuals and big corporations.
But while he was plotting his new venture, someone was plotting his downfall.
The Setup
In December 2021, Roche received an email from someone he trusted introducing him to Villavicencio, according to a copy of the message reviewed by The New York Times. Villavicencio presented himself as an associate of Ager-Hanssen, a venture capitalist who was interested in Roche’s new project. Roche had no idea who the two men were, but he welcomed the approach: He was raising money for Ryval, which had received some attention in the crypto press.
After an introductory Zoom call, Roche agreed to fly to London at the men’s expense the next month.
They met at Ager-Hanssen’s town house office, where things soon took a strange turn: According to Roche, Ager-Hanssen pressed his index finger to Roche’s forehead — “I didn’t think it was a gun motion, but I thought he was trying to intimidate me” — and said that if he was going to invest with him, he needed to know everything Roche was capable of.
In hindsight, Roche wishes he had gotten up and left. Instead, he took it as a cue to sell himself harder. According to Roche, Ager-Hanssen spent the next couple of hours goading him into bragging about his relationship with Ava Labs while Villavicencio, who was sitting across a table from him, secretly filmed him.
Armed with the information he had gleaned from the lawsuit filed by the fired Roche Freedman partner, Ager-Hanssen coaxed Roche into saying he had been granted 1% of the supply of Avalanche’s AVAX tokens. At the time, that would have been equivalent to more than $100 million. (Roche says he exaggerated the 1% figure, and AVAX tokens have since lost 80% of their value.)
Ager-Hanssen then asked Roche to give examples of how he had made himself useful to Ava Labs executives.
“They haven’t been sued yet, and there’s a reason for that,” said the baby-faced Roche, wearing a blazer over a button-down shirt and sweater, according to a video clip from the meeting.
“Brilliant,” Ager-Hanssen replied. “Good answer.”
Roche later elaborated. “I deal with making sure that the SEC and the CFTC have other magnets to go after,” he said, referring to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He added, “Litigation can be a tool” to attack competition. “It’s a fantastic tool.”
That night, when Roche got to Jean-Georges, he said, he found Villavicencio at a table and a drink waiting for him. Roche recalls Ager-Hanssen arriving about 15 minutes later and sitting at a nearby table with a tall blond man. Roche said the rest of the evening was a blur. He now believes the drink was laced with a drug, though he has no proof.
In one video clip from the restaurant, Roche revels in his power to crush companies with lawsuits. In another, Villavicencio asks him whether Ava Labs has sued any of its competitors. Roche replies, “No, they have me do that on behalf of the class,” suggesting that he filed his class actions against other crypto companies at Ava Labs’ behest.
After the dinner at Jean-Georges, Roche never saw Villavicencio again, though he did meet one last time with Ager-Hanssen in New York.
On Aug. 26, Roche was in California to attend a wedding when one of his clients came across the Crypto Leaks videos on Twitter and sent him a link.
Blindsided, he scrambled to understand when and where they had been recorded. Once he pieced it together, he called Freedman and reached out to clients to do damage control.
Roche’s biggest worry was his comments suggesting he had filed lawsuits to harm Ava Labs’ competitors and to distract regulators. It was baseless bluster, he now says, blaming the blue-collar kid in him who was trying to impress a prospective investor. He said he started putting together the first lawsuits a month before he met Sirer, the Ava Labs founder.
Sirer denied that he or Ava Labs had anything to do with those lawsuits, some of which he said he strongly disagreed with. Six weeks before Crypto Leaks published its videos, Ava Labs’ general counsel wrote an article criticizing one of the Roche Freedman lawsuits as “scurrilous.”
To insulate his law firm, Roche recused himself from the lawsuits Roche Freedman had filed against crypto companies, sold his stake in Ava Labs back to the company and stopped representing it. (Roche declined to say whether he profited on the sale.)
When it became clear that wouldn’t be enough, he resigned from his firm, which was renamed Freedman Normand Friedland.
‘Someone That Doesn’t Exist’
A week after the videos surfaced, Roche got another jolt: A friend of a colleague said he had heard rumors at a crypto event that Roche’s life was in danger, according to an affidavit later filed in court. Spooked, Roche and his fiancée hunkered down in a short-term rental in Brooklyn.
Roche felt that his world was unraveling. He says he became so stressed that he stopped eating and lost 10 pounds. After several weeks, he and his fiancée returned to Miami but, still worried for their safety, moved to an apartment leased under a relative’s name.
While Roche’s career imploded, Ager-Hanssen called for Roche’s disbarment and tweeted about a report he had compiled on Roche that largely repeated the Crypto Leaks allegations. He also emailed Cyrulnik, the former Roche Freedman partner, and offered to help him prove his case against Roche and his former firm.
To Roche, the implication was clear: Ager-Hanssen had set him up.
In an interview, Ager-Hanssen denied that. “This was not an operation run by me at all,” he said. “It was run by someone else.” He said that he had been genuinely interested in investing in Ryval, that Villavicencio had filmed the videos at his office without his knowledge and that he wasn’t at Jean-Georges that night. Ager-Hanssen said he thought he knew who was behind the operation, but he wouldn’t reveal the person’s identity.
Villavicencio, for his part, seems to have disappeared. Attempts to reach him at the phone number and email address he gave Roche were unsuccessful.
Ager-Hanssen said he didn’t know Villavicencio’s whereabouts. He said he had met the man only a few weeks before Roche came to London and allowed that Villavicencio was probably not his real name. “Of course, it’s someone that doesn’t exist,” he said.
But Ager-Hanssen, in addition to running his venture capital firm, has long had a sideline digging up dirt on behalf of wealthy clients entangled in business disputes in Britain and Scandinavia.
On multiple occasions, he has secretly recorded his targets. For example, in a 2014 interview, he recounted how he had snared the adversary of a Swedish financier with a hidden microphone and boasted that he employed former intelligence officers from the CIA, MI6 and Mossad.
But if Ager-Hanssen did set up Roche, who hired him to do it — and why?
A Series of Clues
Plenty of people had reason to celebrate Roche’s downfall.
First in line were Wright, the man who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, and Calvin Ayre, a gambling tycoon who bankrolls Wright. Wright quickly sought to exploit the videos, filing an unsuccessful motion to disqualify Roche Freedman from the Kleiman case. After the videos came out, Ager-Hanssen became CEO of nChain, a company that Ayre funds and that employs Wright as chief science officer.
Through a spokesperson, Ayre acknowledged that he and Wright were “pleased” when the videos came out. But they denied having anything to do with the London sting.
Roche believes them because he thinks he knows who hired Ager-Hanssen: Williams, the British entrepreneur who was the target of Roche Freedman’s biggest pump-and-dump lawsuit.
A series of clues, documented by his former law firm in court filings, led Roche to that conclusion. The first is that on May 12, 2022, Williams wrote on Twitter that he was “coming for” his critics. That was the same day the cryptoleaks.info domain name was registered.
Then, on June 9, 2022, the Crypto Leaks website went live. Billing itself as the defender of “the honest crypto community,” it posted two reports that aligned with Williams’ interests. The first espoused a complicated theory about the ICP token crash that Williams had previously floated on Twitter.
The second attacked the Times for an article it had published about the crash. Williams tweeted a link to that Crypto Leaks report, calling it “Gobsmacking.” The Dfinity Foundation, a Swiss nonprofit that Williams created to oversee his blockchain, has since sued the Times for defamation in New York. The Times is seeking to dismiss the suit.
The videos of Roche were the crux of Crypto Leaks’ third exposé. After they were published, Williams and Dfinity filed a motion to disqualify Roche Freedman as plaintiffs’ counsel in the pump-and-dump lawsuit, saying Roche’s comments demonstrated “a disregard for the integrity of the judicial system.”
In court filings opposing the motion, Roche’s former firm accused Williams of being behind Crypto Leaks and said the videos filmed at Jean-Georges showed signs of deepfake alterations. It also blamed Williams for the rumored death threats against Roche.
Pete Padovano, a spokesperson for Dfinity and Williams, denied that anyone at the foundation had made death threats. Asked if he was connected to Crypto Leaks, Williams said, “We appreciate the coverage of Crypto Leaks and believe their articles speak for themselves.”
Roche spent last fall lying low, but he has recently begun to rebuild his career as a solo practitioner.
In April, he won a $12.5 million verdict on behalf of six former Cantor Fitzgerald partners who sued the Wall Street firm for withholding some of their compensation. The judgment, which Cantor has appealed, opened the way for Roche to file a separate class action against the firm. Roche is also representing dozens of investors in a dispute with Coinbase.
But Roche’s videotaped remarks continue to dog him and his former firm. Last month, the judge overseeing the pump-and-dump case granted Williams’ motion and disqualified Freedman Normand Friedland as plaintiffs’ counsel.
The judge cited Freedman’s continuing friendship with Roche — and the fact that they together control a cryptocurrency wallet holding more than 1 million AVAX tokens. He also voiced concern that the law firm was consumed by “extreme animosity” toward Williams, which might lead it to turn down equitable settlement offers.
Unless the lead plaintiff can enlist new lawyers by August, the lawsuit is essentially dead. In Roche’s view, the plot against him worked to perfection.

Meta to Lower Age for Use Of Its V.R. Headset to 10: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company has reached out to regulators about its plans, which could set off privacy and safety concerns for parents and watchdogs.
Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, plans to lower the recommended age for using its Quest headset to 10 from 13, the company said in a blog post on Friday, a move that could set off new privacy and safety concerns with parents and global watchdogs.
The company is discussing its plans with regulators, two people with knowledge of Meta's conversations said, and is trying to assuage immediate concerns over whether younger children using the headset could be subject to greater risk.
Meta said it would require a preteen's parental approval to set up an account, and that young users would only see apps and content rated for the preteen age group. The Quest headset allows people to enter the so-called metaverse, an immersive online world, and to play virtual reality games and do other tasks.
Over the past year, Meta has slowly moved the age restrictions for its virtual reality apps lower to reach younger audiences. In April, the company said it would allow people under 18 to use Horizon Worlds, its virtual reality-based social network, which appears to have many young users. Horizon Worlds will remain restricted to users 13 and older, as reported earlier by The Verge.
In its blog post, Meta said it was making the age change to the Quest headset "to give families even more ways to use and enjoy Meta Quest." It added that it was committed to "building safe, positive experiences for young people."
Technology use by teenagers and children has long been a contentious issue. Last month, the United States surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, issued a public warning about the risks of social media to young people, urging a push to fully understand the possible "harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents." He also called on policymakers to limit young people's access to social media to help protect children and their privacy.
Virtual reality is a relatively new field and its risks are still emerging. But harassment, assaults, bullying and hate speech already run rampant in virtual reality games, which are part of the metaverse, and there are few mechanisms to easily report the misbehavior, researchers have said.
As concerns have heightened, regulators have taken action. The Federal Trade Commission recently intensified its crackdowns on tech companies for violating a federal children's privacy law. That law, called the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, requires sites and apps directed at young people to obtain consent from a parent before collecting personal details -- like an email address or precise location -- from a child under the age of 13.
Meta and its platforms have been of particular concern to regulators. Last month, the F.T.C. said it was considering action to bar Meta from profiting off the data of young people on all of its platforms -- including Instagram and Horizon Worlds -- and that the company's "recklessness" had put young users at risk. Meta subsequently asked a federal court to block the agency's proposed action.
The age change for the Quest headset comes as building a virtual reality-based version of the metaverse has become crucial to Meta's future. Mark Zuckerberg, the company's founder and chief executive, has spent the past two years shifting his social networking business to the metaverse. Last year, he spent nearly $ 14 billion to expand Reality Labs, the company's arm that is devoted to building hardware and developing the metaverse.
The high costs of trying to turn the metaverse into a mainstream business have spooked Wall Street, causing Meta's stock to plunge last year. Enthusiasm for the metaverse has also waned over the past year, as more technologists have flocked to the rise of artificial intelligence with the release of chatbots like ChatGPT. Mr. Zuckerberg has similarly pushed to incorporate A.I. into Meta's products.
But he has also said he remains intent on the metaverse. In a companywide meeting last week, Mr. Zuckerberg assured employees that he was committed to his virtual reality and augmented reality plans and that it would be a long haul toward realizing his vision.
Lowering the minimum age requirements for the company's Quest headset could help familiarize younger audiences with the metaverse, similar to how Facebook initially started on college campuses in 2004, so that they would be more likely to continue using the technology as they grow up.
Meta is likely seeking to integrate itself into young peoples' lives, following a strategy used by other gaming companies, including Roblox, Microsoft with its Minecraft game, and Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite. Those games have a combined user base in the hundreds of millions, many of whom are under the age of 35.
"What we have seen is Meta, based solely on business imperatives, continually lowering the age of their virtual reality products and doing so without any evidence that these things are safe for young people," said Josh Golin, the executive director of Fairplay, a nonprofit children's advocacy group. "It's beyond the pale and clearly driven by the fact that they are trying to compete for a market, not driven by kids' needs."
Meta is working to assure regulators that it will provide parental controls to keep young users safe when using the device, said the two people with knowledge of the company's plans who spoke on condition of anonymity. Some of those include time limits, parent-managed controls over content or apps and privacy settings that will not allow other people using Horizon Worlds the ability to follow preteens without approval from them or their parents.
The company said it would use data from preteens who experiment with the Quest headset to deliver an "age-appropriate experience," but will not serve ads to the age group. Parents can also delete their children's profiles and associated data.

SAN FRANCISCO — Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, plans to lower the recommended age for using its Quest headset to 10 from 13, the company said in a blog post Friday, a move that could set off new privacy and safety concerns with parents and global watchdogs.
The company is discussing its plans with regulators, two people with knowledge of Meta’s conversations said, and is trying to assuage immediate concerns over whether younger children using the headset could be subject to greater risk.
Meta said it would require a preteen’s parental approval to set up an account, and that young users would only see apps and content rated for the preteen age group. The Quest headset allows people to enter the so-called metaverse — an immersive online world — and to play virtual reality games and do other tasks.
Over the past year, Meta has slowly moved the age restrictions for its virtual reality apps lower to reach younger audiences. In April, the company said it would allow people younger than 18 to use Horizon Worlds, Meta’s virtual reality-based social network, which appears to have many young users. Horizon Worlds will remain restricted to users 13 and older, as reported earlier by The Verge.
In its blog post, Meta said it was making the age change to the Quest headset “to give families even more ways to use and enjoy Meta Quest.” It added that it was committed to “building safe, positive experiences for young people.”
Technology use by teenagers and children has long been a contentious issue. Last month, the U.S. surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, issued a public warning about the risks of social media to young people, urging a push to fully understand the possible “harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.”
He also called on policymakers to limit young people’s access to social media to help protect children and their privacy.
Virtual reality is a relatively new field and its risks are still emerging. But harassment, assaults, bullying and hate speech already run rampant in virtual reality games, which are part of the metaverse, and there are few mechanisms to easily report the misbehavior, researchers have said.
As concerns have heightened, regulators have taken action. The Federal Trade Commission recently intensified its crackdowns on tech companies for violating a federal children’s privacy law. That law, called the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, requires sites and apps directed at young people to obtain consent from a parent before collecting personal details — like an email address or precise location — from a child younger than 13.
Meta and its platforms have been of particular concern to regulators. Last month, the FTC said it was considering action to bar Meta from profiting off the data of young people on all of its platforms — including Instagram and Horizon Worlds — and that the company’s “recklessness” had put young users at risk. Meta subsequently asked a federal court to block the agency’s proposed action.
The age change for the Quest headset comes as building a virtual reality-based version of the metaverse has become crucial to Meta’s future. Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s founder and CEO, has spent the past two years shifting his social networking business to the metaverse. Last year, he spent nearly $14 billion to expand Reality Labs, the company’s arm that is devoted to building hardware and developing the metaverse.
The high costs of trying to turn the metaverse into a mainstream business have spooked Wall Street, causing Meta’s stock to plunge last year. Enthusiasm for the metaverse has also waned over the past year, as more technologists have flocked to the rise of artificial intelligence with the release of chatbots like ChatGPT. Zuckerberg has similarly pushed to incorporate AI into Meta’s products.
But he has also said he remains intent on the metaverse. In a companywide meeting last week, Zuckerberg assured employees that he was committed to his virtual reality and augmented reality plans and that it would be a long haul toward realizing his vision.
Lowering the minimum age requirements for the company’s Quest headset could help familiarize younger audiences with the metaverse, similar to how Facebook initially started on college campuses in 2004, so that they would be more likely to continue using the technology as they grow up.
Meta is likely seeking to integrate itself into young peoples’ lives, following a strategy used by other gaming companies, including Roblox, Microsoft with its Minecraft game, and Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite. Those games have a combined user base in the hundreds of millions, many of whom are younger than 35.
“What we have seen is Meta, based solely on business imperatives, continually lowering the age of their virtual reality products and doing so without any evidence that these things are safe for young people,” said Josh Golin, the executive director of Fairplay, a nonprofit children’s advocacy group. “It’s beyond the pale and clearly driven by the fact that they are trying to compete for a market, not driven by kids’ needs.”
Meta is working to assure regulators that it will provide parental controls to keep young users safe when using the device, said the two people with knowledge of the company’s plans who spoke on condition of anonymity. Some of those include time limits, parent-managed controls over content or apps and privacy settings that will not allow other people using Horizon Worlds the ability to follow preteens without approval from them or their parents.
The company said it would use data from preteens who experiment with the Quest headset to deliver an “age-appropriate experience,” but will not serve ads to the age group. Parents can also delete their children’s profiles and associated data.

Full text: For those who are fortunate enough to receive paid time off at work, using those precious days can also create anxiety about re-entry. In a 2022 survey, the career website Monster found that 87 percent of over 1,000 American workers across industries experienced post-vacation stress and anxiety, and that 72 percent of workers refrained from taking vacation at all to avoid that stress. If you're able to get vacation time, you can take steps to minimize stress and reap its many benefits. ALISHA HARIDASANI GUPTA
Create an "offramp." More than half of the respondents to Monster's survey reported having to work overtime in order to catch up when they returned from paid time off. One way to help minimize the stress on your first day back is to carve out time for it before you leave, creating an "offramp" for yourself, said Simone Stolzoff, author of "The Good Enough Job." "Offramping is basically time you spend, while you're still on the clock, to prepare for what you might do when you're back on the clock," he said.
Use technology to your advantage. If your workplace uses additional communication platforms, like Slack or Microsoft Teams, set detailed away messages. You may even want to delete work apps from your phone or, at least, turn their notifications off. Making it clear in your away messages that you will be completely detached enables you to truly unplug.
Allow yourself limited check-ins. As counterintuitive as it sounds, if the emails at the other end of a vacation are keeping you up at night, you can schedule time during vacation to just clean out your inbox.
Be intentional about doing nonwork activities. You may need to make a plan for what you will do with your free time so that you are not tempted to check in or think about work. You can schedule activities during your vacation that require focus: Sign up for a class, volunteer with an organization or visit a museum, whatever feels fulfilling and distracts you from your screens.
Plan a fun day for when you get back. If you're able to space out your return home and your back-to-office day, put something on your calendar that you can look forward to for that time in between, such as a get-together with friends or a movie night.

Democrats' Mission: Win the Blue-Collar Vote: [briefing]

Author: Leonhardt, David

Abstract: None available.

Full text: We're covering a new poll about the Democratic Party, Donald Trump's court appearance and the N.B.A. finals.
About 60 percent of U.S. voters do not have a four-year college degree, and they live disproportionately in swing states. As a result, these voters -- often described as the American working class -- are crucial to winning elections. Yet many of them are deeply skeptical of today's Democratic Party.
Republicans retook control of the House last year by winning most districts with below-median incomes. In nearly 20 Western and Southern states, Democrats are virtually shut out of statewide offices largely because of their weakness among the white working class. Since 2018, the party has also lost ground with Black, Asian and especially Latino voters.
Unless the party improves its standing with blue-collar voters, "there's no way for progressive Democrats to advance their agenda in the Senate," according to a study that the Center for Working-Class Politics, a left-leaning research group, released this morning.
The class inversion of American politics -- with most professionals supporting Democrats and more working-class people backing Republicans -- is one of the most consequential developments in American life (and, as regular readers know, a continuing theme of this newsletter).
Today, I'll be writing about what Democrats might do about the problem, focusing on a new YouGov poll, conducted as part of the Center for Working-Class Politics study. In an upcoming newsletter, I'll examine the issue from a conservative perspective and specifically how Republicans might alter their economic agenda to better serve their new working-class base.
A key point is that even modest shifts in the working-class vote can decide elections. If President Biden wins 50 percent of the non-college vote next year, he will almost certainly be re-elected. If he wins only 45 percent, he will probably lose.
'Fight for us all'
Elections can be tricky for social scientists to study. The sample sizes are small and idiosyncratic. Researchers can't conduct hundreds of elections in a laboratory, changing one variable at a time and analyzing how the results change. But researchers can conduct polls that pit hypothetical candidates against each other and see how the results change when the candidates' biographies, messages and policy proposals change.
This approach, which has become more common among pollsters, is the one that YouGov used. It focused on swing voters -- those who don't identify strongly with either party, many of whom are working class. The poll described a pair of Democratic candidates, each with a biography and a campaign platform, and asked respondents which one they preferred.
Among the findings:
Voters preferred a candidate who was a teacher, construction worker, warehouse worker, doctor or nurse. The least popular candidate professions were lawyer and corporate executive.
Many effective messages involved jobs, including both moderate policies (like tax credits for training at small businesses) and progressive ones (like a federal jobs guarantee). "People are obviously interested in good-paying jobs," said Bhaskar Sunkara, the founder of Jacobin, a leftist magazine that helped sponsor the project. "They have an identity that's rooted in their work."
Black and Latino candidates were slightly more popular than other candidates, mostly because some voters of color preferred candidates of color. (Related: Black candidates -- of different ideologies -- have beaten non-Black candidates in recent mayoral primaries and elections in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia, Matthew Yglesias of Substack pointed out to me.) But candidate messages that explicitly mentioned race were unpopular.
Voters liked Democrats who criticized both political parties as "out of touch." There is real-world evidence to support this finding, too: Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona and Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio won close races last year while highlighting their differences with Democratic leaders, as Data for Progress, another research group, has noted.
Moderate social policies fared better than more liberal ones. The single most effective message in the poll was a vow to "protect the border"; decriminalization of the border was very unpopular.
Swing voters liked tough, populist messages such as "Americans who work for a living are being betrayed by superrich elites" and "Americans need to come together and elect leaders who will fight for us all." As Jared Abbott, the director of the Center for Working-Class Politics, argued, "Democrats need to be less concerned with rhetorical niceties." Doing so would hardly be new: Harry Truman and Franklin Roosevelt used such red-blooded language.
The bottom line
I find the study's conclusions fascinating because they are both original and consistent with other evidence. Democrats who have won difficult recent elections, including both progressives and moderates, have often presented a blue-collar image.
President Biden talks about growing up in a working-class neighborhood. Marie Gluesenkamp Pérez, who owns a car-repair shop, flipped a House district in Washington State partly by criticizing her own party for being elitist. Senator Sherrod Brown, the only Democrat to win statewide in Ohio since 2011, is a populist. So is John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, the only Senate candidate from either party to flip a seat last year.
Many Americans are frustrated with the country's direction, and they want candidates who will promise to fight for their interests. One of the vulnerabilities of today's Democratic Party, as my colleague Nate Cohn has written, is that it has come to be associated with the establishment.

Reddit Communities Go Dark to Protest App's Pricing Plan: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Volunteer moderators closed off access to numerous subreddits and denounced the platform's pricing plan for developers of popular outside apps used to navigate the site.
The moderators of hundreds of Reddit forums, known as subreddits, closed off access to their groups on Monday to protest the company's plan to charge for access to the data that outside developers need to run apps on the site.
Many said the new pricing scheme could kill off some of the most popular third-party apps that many users rely on to browse and comment on the site. Others said the charges had sowed uncertainty about the tools that moderators use to manage discussions. An estimated 57 million people a day visit the platform.
Reddit announced in April that it would begin to charge some large-scale users for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network's vast selection of memes, gifs, videos, and conversation threads.
Reddit said it no longer wanted to give away such a valuable asset to companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft, which have been using Reddit's data to develop artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley see as the next big thing.
"Reddit needs to be a self-sustaining business, and to do that, we can no longer subsidize commercial entities that require large-scale data use," Steve Huffman, Reddit's chief executive, said on Friday in an "Ask Me Anything" discussion on the site.
But the charges have set off a major backlash among the volunteer moderators of the site's diverse communities, who said they would close off access to their groups for at least 48 hours, beginning Monday, in what they called a coordinated protest.
Moderators of some of Reddit's most popular subreddits -- including r/funny, with more than 40 million members, and r/gaming, r/Music and r/science, with more than 30 million members each -- were taking part in the protest by setting their pages to private and posting messages denouncing the new terms and pricing.
Moderators of many smaller groups had also gone dark as part of the demonstration.
For a brief period on Monday, the protest made it difficult for some users to access Reddit as "a significant number of subreddits shifting to private caused some expected stability issues," a Reddit spokesman said, adding that the problems had been resolved.
The developers of several popular apps said they would have to shut them down because of the new pricing system.
Apollo, an iOS app widely praised within the mobile developer community for its design interface and rich features, plans to shut down on June 30, according to a post on Reddit by its developer, Christian Selig. He said that Apollo would have to pay $ 20 million annually under the new pricing scheme.
"I hope it goes without saying that I don't have that kind of money or would even know how to charge it to a credit card," he wrote.
At least three other Reddit apps -- rif is fun for Reddit, ReddPlanet and Sync -- also announced plans to shut down on June 30, citing what they called unreasonable costs, the tech news site The Verge reported.
The moderators of r/blind, a hub for blind and visually impaired users with more than 20,000 members, said the charges could threaten the third-party apps that translate Reddit text into speech and that allow blind and visually impaired users to participate in discussions on the site.
Noah Carver, one of the r/blind moderators, said in a statement on behalf of his group: "The proposed changes to Reddit's A.P.I. will not only isolate blind users from a social network used by millions of people, thus disconnecting us from the wider world; they will also largely decimate communities for blind people -- and disabled people in general -- which have thrived on Reddit despite the company's perceived indifference."
Since its founding in 2005, Reddit has been known for embracing freedom of speech, freedom of code and freedom of data, which allowed users to build tools and apps around the site, said Sarah Gilbert, a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University who studies content moderation and data ethics. She is also a moderator of the r/AskHistorians subreddit, which joined the protest.
Ms. Gilbert said the pricing plan could undermine the platform's volunteer-driven culture, which sets it apart from other social media sites.
"It's not just about people being unhappy that they can't have their favorite app anymore," she said in an interview. "It's about the loss of community or fear of the loss of community."
Tim Rathschmidt, a Reddit spokesman, said the company had been in contact with various Reddit communities to "clarify any confusion around our Data A.P.I. Terms, platform-wide policies, community support resources, and timing for new moderator tools."
He said that Reddit spends millions of dollars on internet hosting fees and "needs to be fairly paid to continue supporting high-usage third-party apps."
"Our pricing is based on usage levels that we measure to be comparable to our own costs," he wrote in an email.
Mr. Rathschmidt added that some apps are more efficient and require significantly fewer A.P.I. calls and that "Apollo is notably less efficient than other third-party apps."
"The vast majority of A.P.I. users will not have to pay for access; not all third-party apps usage requires paid access," he wrote, adding that access is "is free for moderator tools and bots."
Responding to concerns about accessibility raised by groups like r/blind, Mr. Rathschmidt said that the company had offered exemptions from the new prices to noncommercial apps that address accessibility issues. Several of those developers have signed agreements with Reddit, he said. This article appeared in print on page B3.

Blizzard Devilishly Marks a Sales Milestone: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The latest entry in the franchise has seen strong early demand and a smooth launch, according to the company, which isn't always the case for Blizzard's popular titles.
The News
Diablo IV, the latest version of a video game franchise that has gained millions of fans over its more than 25 years, has broken internal records for its publisher Blizzard and surpassed more than $ 666 million in sales since its debut on June 6.
The game combines elements of different parts of the franchise, from the dark and gothic atmospherics of fighting demons to an always-online approach where players can link up with friends and strangers alike to slay monsters.
The $ 666 million sales marker is a wink to the game's demonic themes.
Rod Fergusson, Diablo's general manager and a senior vice president at Blizzard Entertainment, attributed the initial success to the company's willingness to work across platforms, while embracing different characteristics of today's games and the older features of the franchise.
"We were really trying to reach the younger audience," Mr. Fergusson said in an interview. The company was less worried about getting older fans who were used to the earlier Diablo games to purchase the latest installment, he said. "If you're paying attention, you can see it in our marketing," Mr. Fergusson added.
Blizzard enlisted pop stars like Halsey, SUGA and Billie Eilish to promote songs and early launch trailers on social media.
Users have played the game for more than 276 million hours since it was released. It was No. 1 in Twitch streams over the first nine days of June during the game's early-access period.
Why It Matters: It is a win after a difficult time for the company.
Activision Blizzard -- which was formed in 2008 after Activision and Blizzard merged -- has had a tough few years.
The Federal Trade Commission has moved to stop the company's proposed acquisition by Microsoft. The deal has been challenged in other countries as well, and regulators argue that potentially anticompetitive consolidation is what could hurt the future of the video game industry. (Microsoft and Activision Blizzard are fighting the challenge.)
Activision Blizzard has also faced employee unrest and a lawsuit regarding claims of a "frat boy" culture that resulted in discrimination against women at the company. And in 2021, Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, said the company was committing $ 250 million to hiring more women and improving diversity over the next five years.
Background: Blizzard has had trouble with game launches.
Despite its popular catalog of titles like World of Warcraft, Starcraft and Overwatch, Blizzard has had difficulties with launches of its major properties and franchises. Most recently it struggled with the launch of Overwatch 2. Players were upset with early technical issues and fundamental changes to how the game was played.
Compared with past titles, Diablo IV's launch appears to have gone well. Only a few hiccups occurred with some extended load times due to the high demand to play the game.
It also earned a free -- if unexpected -- bump in promotion last week, after a tweet showing a photo of a billboard promoting Diablo IV in Manhattan went viral. After smoke from Canadian wildfires tinted the city's skyline an orange hue, the billboard's message took on a new, ominous meaning.
The message: "Welcome to hell, New York."

S&P 500 Hits Highest Level in Over a Year: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street climbed on Monday ahead of a big week for central banks around the world, vaulting the S&P 500 to its highest level in more than a year.
The index rose 40.07 points, or 0.9 percent, to 4,338.93 and its highest close since April 2022. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 189.55, or 0.6 percent, to 34,066.33, while the Nasdaq composite rallied 202.78, or 1.5 percent, to 13,461.92.
The U.S. stock market has been cruising on hopes that the economy will avoid a recession and that the Federal Reserve may soon take it easier on its interest rate increases. Traders are betting the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting, which concludes on Wednesday. That would be the first time it has not raised rates at a meeting in more than a year.
Investors see high-growth stocks as some of the biggest beneficiaries of lower rates, and they led the market on Monday. Tech stocks alone accounted for more than half the S&P 500's gain, powered by gains of at least 1.5 percent for both Microsoft and Apple.
The cruise operator Carnival, meanwhile, rode a 12.5 percent upswing as analysts upgraded its stock on signs that demand remained steady for the industry and that pricing was holding up. It helped overshadow losses elsewhere in the market, including an 11.8 percent fall for Nasdaq, the exchange company that has pushed more into technology. It said it would buy Adenza, a risk management and regulatory software provider, for $ 10.5 billion in cash and stock.
A halt or a pause by the Fed to rate increases would give the economy and financial markets some breathing room. The Fed has already pulled rates to their highest level since 2007 in an attempt to drive down inflation, and the increases have helped cause high-profile U.S. bank failures and a monthslong contraction in the manufacturing industry.
This latest updates on inflation across the economy will also come this week. On Tuesday, economists expect a report to show prices for consumers were 4.1 percent higher in May than a year earlier. That would be well above the Fed's target of 2 percent inflation, but it would be down from 4.9 percent in April and a peak of more than 9 percent last June.
Because prices were already much higher a year ago amid the worst inflation in 40 years, further increases in upcoming months may not appear quite so dramatic. Inflation could fall to 3.2 percent this month, and the following two months could see one of the biggest drops in inflation over a two-month period over the last 70 years, according to Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse.
But much of that easing would simply be a reflection of how high prices had already climbed, and Wall Street traders are still bracing for the Fed to resume increasing rates in July. The question is how much further it will go.
The Fed is in a tight spot because any increases to rates could mean more pressure on the U.S. banking system. It is still absorbing all the past rate increases, which have caused customers to yank bank deposits as they herd into higher-yielding money market funds. Higher rates have also forced down the values of bonds banks bought when interest rates were low.
"While incoming data point to resilience in activity and stickiness in inflation, the Fed appears to want additional time to monitor policy lags and regional bank stress," Michael Gapen and other economists wrote in a BofA Global Research report.
They see a June pause by the Fed as a close call. Recent surprise increases by central banks in Canada and Australia show a move higher could still happen, but Mr. Gapen said the Fed does not usually increase rates when the widespread assumption on Wall Street is for a hold. That may change if Tuesday's inflation report comes in hotter than expected.

This Meme Symbolizes State of A.I.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Shoggoth, a character from a science fiction story, captures the essential weirdness of the A.I. moment.
A few months ago, while meeting with an A.I. executive in San Francisco, I spotted a strange sticker on his laptop. The sticker depicted a cartoon of a menacing, octopus-like creature with many eyes and a yellow smiley-face attached to one of its tentacles. I asked what it was.
"Oh, that's the Shoggoth," he explained. "It's the most important meme in A.I."
And with that, our agenda was officially derailed. Forget about chatbots and compute clusters -- I needed to know everything about the Shoggoth, what it meant and why people in the A.I. world were talking about it.
The executive explained that the Shoggoth had become a jokey reference among workers in artificial intelligence, as a vivid visual metaphor for how a large language model (the type of A.I. system that powers ChatGPT and other chatbots) actually works.
But it was only partly a joke, he said, because it also hinted at the anxieties that many researchers and engineers have about the tools they're building.
Since then, the Shoggoth has gone viral, or as viral as it's possible to go in the small world of hyper-online A.I. insiders. It's a popular meme on A.I. Twitter (including a now-deleted tweet by Elon Musk), a recurring metaphor in essays and message board posts about A.I. risk, and a bit of useful shorthand in conversations with A.I. safety experts. One A.I. start-up, NovelAI, said it had recently named a cluster of computers "Shoggy" in homage to the meme. Another A.I. company, Scale AI, designed a line of tote bags featuring the Shoggoth.
Shoggoths are fictional creatures, introduced by the science fiction author H.P. Lovecraft in his 1936 novella "At the Mountains of Madness." In Lovecraft's telling, Shoggoths were massive, bloblike monsters made out of iridescent black goo, covered in tentacles and eyes.
Shoggoths landed in the A.I. world in December, a month after ChatGPT's release, when a Twitter user, @TetraspaceWest, replied to a tweet about GPT-3 (an OpenAI language model that was ChatGPT's predecessor) with an image of two hand-drawn Shoggoths -- the first labeled "GPT-3" and the second labeled "GPT-3 + RLHF." The second Shoggoth had, perched on one of its tentacles, a smiley-face mask.
In a nutshell, the joke was that in order to prevent A.I. language models from behaving in scary and dangerous ways, A.I. companies have had to train them to act polite and harmless. One popular way to do this is called "reinforcement learning from human feedback," or R.L.H.F., a process that involves asking humans to score chatbot responses and feeding those scores back into the A.I. model.
Most A.I. researchers agree that models trained using R.L.H.F. are better behaved than models without it. But some argue that fine-tuning a language model this way doesn't actually make the underlying model less weird and inscrutable. In their view, it's just a flimsy, friendly mask that obscures the mysterious beast underneath.
@TetraspaceWest, the meme's creator, told me in a Twitter message that the Shoggoth "represents something that thinks in a way that humans don't understand and that's totally different from the way that humans think."
Comparing an A.I. language model to a Shoggoth, @TetraspaceWest said, wasn't necessarily implying that it was evil or sentient, just that its true nature might be unknowable.
"I was also thinking about how Lovecraft's most powerful entities are dangerous -- not because they don't like humans, but because they're indifferent and their priorities are totally alien to us and don't involve humans, which is what I think will be true about possible future powerful A.I."
The Shoggoth image caught on, as A.I. chatbots grew popular and users began to notice that some of them seemed to be doing strange, inexplicable things their creators hadn't intended. In February, when Bing's chatbot became unhinged and tried to break up my marriage, an A.I. researcher I know congratulated me on "glimpsing the Shoggoth." A fellow A.I. journalist joked that when it came to fine-tuning Bing, Microsoft had forgotten to put on its smiley-face mask.
Eventually, A.I. enthusiasts extended the metaphor. In February, the Twitter user @anthrupad created a version of a Shoggoth that had, in addition to a smiley-face labeled "R.L.H.F.," a more humanlike face labeled "supervised fine-tuning." (You practically need a computer science degree to get the joke, but it's a riff on the difference between general A.I. language models and more specialized applications like chatbots.)
Today, if you hear mentions of the Shoggoth in the A.I. community, it may be a wink at the strangeness of these systems -- the black-box nature of their processes, the way they seem to defy human logic. Or maybe it's an in-joke, visual shorthand for powerful A.I. systems that seem suspiciously nice. If it's an A.I. safety researcher talking about the Shoggoth, maybe that person is passionate about preventing A.I. systems from displaying their true, Shoggoth-like nature.
In any case, the Shoggoth is a potent metaphor that encapsulates one of the most bizarre facts about the A.I. world, which is that many of the people working on this technology are somewhat mystified by their own creations. They don't fully understand the inner workings of A.I. language models, how they acquire new abilities or why they behave unpredictably at times. They aren't totally sure if A.I. is going to be net-good or net-bad for the world. And some of them have gotten to play around with the versions of this technology that haven't yet been sanitized for public consumption -- the real, unmasked Shoggoths.
That some A.I. insiders refer to their creations as Lovecraftian horrors, even as a joke, is unusual by historical standards. (Put it this way: Fifteen years ago, Mark Zuckerberg wasn't going around comparing Facebook to Cthulhu.)
And it reinforces the notion that what's happening in A.I. today feels, to some of its participants, more like an act of summoning than a software development process. They are creating the blobby, alien Shoggoths, making them bigger and more powerful, and hoping that there are enough smiley faces to cover the scary parts.

Can Federal Investment Persuade America To Go Green?: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Electric vehicles are rare in Moses Lake, Wash., a small city in the fertile Columbia Basin about a three-hour drive east of Seattle. In that conservative farms-and-factories community, few people have the cash or the inclination. The only electric vehicle I saw during a two-day visit last month was a Tesla in the hotel parking lot.
Over the next few years, however, hundreds of Moses Lake residents are going to be entering the electric vehicle business. Two different companies, attracted by cheap hydropower, are opening plants there, each backed by $ 100 million in federal money, to produce a key ingredient for electric vehicle batteries.
The investment is part of the roughly half a trillion dollars the Biden administration is marshaling to transform an economy fueled by carbon into one fueled by clean, renewable energy, and it illustrates a gamble at the heart of that broader effort.
Instead of delivering electric vehicles, solar panels and other green technologies at the lowest possible cost, no matter their country of origin, the Biden administration is determined to use this opportunity to expand domestic manufacturing. And it is concentrating much of that effort in rural and Rust Belt communities, where reactionary politics have taken hold most strongly. The plan to combat global warming is also a bid for industrial revival and a transformed political landscape.
There is a real risk that President Biden's economic and political aims will come into conflict with his environmental goals. If domestic production results in higher costs, that could suppress demand for electric vehicles. Political opposition to renewable energy, on the rise in many conservative communities, could impede production. But giving people an economic stake in the transition to green energy may well be the nation's best chance to build a durable political consensus in favor of confronting global warming.
The novelist Upton Sinclair observed, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it."
Well, the opposite is true, too.
In Moses Lake, where one city official described the local version of the American dream to me as "house-boat-truck," it is possible to imagine that one day in the not-too-distant future, workers at the battery plants will be driving electric pickups.
The environmental case for investing 200 million tax dollars in Moses Lake is that gas-powered vehicles produce 24 percent of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, and persuading consumers to drive electric vehicles instead is going to require a lot of batteries that are more powerful and more affordable than what's available today.
Right now, almost all electric vehicles are powered by batteries that use graphite to store electricity. Scientists have long known that silicon can hold more energy than graphite. But silicon swells as it charges, with results much like a soda can left in a freezer. The two companies building factories in Moses Lake, Sila Nanotechnologies and Group14 Technologies, make specially modified forms of silicon that solve the swelling problem. Batteries using the special sand can propel vehicles up to 20 percent farther than existing batteries. Recharging is a lot faster, too.
At Group14's first plant, outside Seattle, trays of carbon that look like badly burned brownies emerge from a long oven and are milled into a powder so fine that a thimbleful could coat a hockey rink. The key to Group14's technology is that each of those tiny grains of carbon is about two-thirds air, like a very porous sponge or a coral reef. The grains are then placed in a chamber of silane, a gaseous form of silicon, which fills about half of their interiors, leaving room for expansion when the silicon is charged. The resulting black powder is shipped to battery plants, where it will be painted onto thin strips of metal and stacked inside batteries.
Sila, which uses a different process to reach similar ends, has its own small factory at its Bay Area headquarters. Together, the two companies make enough powder to power a few hundred vehicles per year. The factories in Moses Lake, which together will cost more than $ 700 million, will each produce enough for about 200,000 vehicles a year. Group14 has signed Porsche as an investor and a customer; Sila is working with Mercedes-Benz.
Both companies say they would have moved ahead even without direct federal funding. But the money does mean that they can grow faster. Rick Luebbe, the chief executive of Group14, said the company was able to raise additional capital on the back of the federal money, allowing it to build two production lines in Moses Lake rather than one. "It's a validation for people who want to work for us, for people who want to support us, and for customers," he said.
It would take 400 more factories the size of the ones in Moses Lake to make enough silicon to power all the vehicles produced in an average year. But the government isn't betting just on silicon. It is simultaneously funding an even bigger expansion of graphite manufacturing at factories in Georgia, Louisiana and Tennessee. It's also backing companies pursuing other alternatives to graphite, and other potential breakthroughs in battery technology. The government is trying to pick winners only in the sense that it wants the next big idea in batteries to be made in the United States.
Backing domestic production marks a break with decades of federal economic policy that treated low prices as the primary goal, and imports as the best way to achieve that goal. In 2005, for example, the government introduced tax credits for the installation of solar panels, without restrictions on the country of origin. Over the next six years, imports of Chinese solar panels increased to $ 2.7 billion a year, up from $ 21 million a year.
Chinese companies also have raced ahead in the market for electric vehicle batteries, but the Biden administration is hoping to leapfrog them by investing in a new generation of ideas. China controls three-quarters of the world's supply of graphite, but "our technology requires sand and energy," said Gene Berdichevsky, the chief executive of Sila. "Those can be sourced in quite a lot of places."
The federal government is also rigging the competition against Chinese producers. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, passed last year, buyers of electric vehicles are eligible for tax credits of up to $ 7,500. But as of April 18, the credit is available only if at least half of the value of the vehicle's battery was produced in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and at least 40 percent of the minerals were produced in the United States or by an approved list of allies. Over the next few years, those requirements will gradually rise to 100 percent for the battery and 80 percent for the minerals.
Other subsidies could take an additional $ 9,000 off the price of cars with American batteries. The incentives are enough that for the first time, some electric vehicles are now cheaper than comparable gas-powered cars.
The residents of Moses Lake are eagerly anticipating the benefits.
Adan Lopez, 20, is studying physics at Big Bend Community College in Moses Lake. He isn't sure whether he wants to stay in the area. "Jobs are kind of limited around here," he said. "If you want to do anything, people have to go to Spokane or Seattle."
Brant Mayo, executive director of the Grant County Economic Development Council, said the Moses Lake region has been chasing factories since the early 1990s to bring higher-paying jobs to the area. "We want our kids and our grandkids, if they want to be in the area, to have an opportunity to do whatever they want here," he said.
Factories also attract factories. After Microsoft opened a data center in the nearby town of Quincy, a company that makes plastic conduits for data centers opened a 50-employee operation. Three electrical firms also have opened offices.
The potential costs of trying to orchestrate economic development are less obvious and less concentrated, and thus easier to ignore. But they could easily outweigh the benefits. Government investment can allow companies to take risks that investors wouldn't support, but it also can insulate companies from market discipline, propping up underperforming technologies and preventing better ideas from gaining traction. Preserving factory jobs also is expensive, and higher costs could slow the adoption of electric vehicles. It costs about twice as much to build a battery plant in the United States as in China, according to one recent estimate.
The urgency of global warming means that the Biden administration may be gambling with time it can't afford to lose.
Moses Lake, population 26,040, was created by federal investment. The area was a sparsely populated desert until the damming of the Columbia River began in the 1930s. The Democratic Party's vision of cheap power and water created one of the nation's most productive farming regions, famous for its apples and potatoes. But the city and the surrounding region are now "bright red," in the words of Steve Starr, the lonesome chairman of the local Democratic Party.
Mr. Starr is skeptical that this new season of federally funded economic growth will make a difference. Other issues loom larger. At the county fairgrounds, the Democrats have a building with a big sign out front reminding visitors about the government's role in the region's history. The Republican Party's building, just across the way, has a large sign declaring opposition to abortion.
Mr. Starr also says the government's role in the current factory boom is easy for people to ignore. Instead of public works, the government is backing private companies. The sign in front of Group14's future factory doesn't have any mention of federal funding.
"Without the federal government this would be an uninhabited desert, but you won't hear Republicans here say that," Mr. Starr said. "Are people going to accept the idea that Biden, through federal government initiatives, is helping our economy? My answer is, sadly, probably not."
Some Republicans insist they don't want the help. The congressman who represents Moses Lake, Dan Newhouse, joined all but a few of his Republican colleagues in voting against the 2021 legislation that is providing funding for the battery plants, and against the 2022 bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, that is providing an even larger block of funding for similar projects. In April, he voted for the House debt ceiling bill that would have rolled back much of that federal funding.
Electric vehicles, in particular, are becoming a partisan battleground. Republican lawmakers in Wyoming introduced a resolution this year calling for the state to ban the sale of electric vehicles by 2035 to "ensure the stability of Wyoming's oil and gas industry." The resolution, which did not pass, directed Wyoming's secretary of state to send a copy to the governor of California, which has a law banning the sale of new gas-powered vehicles starting in 2035.
In Moses Lake, the most likely flashpoint is access to power. The cheap, green electricity from two Columbia River dams is still the community's greatest asset and it remains under public control. It is the most important reason Group14 and Sila both chose to build factories here.
But there is not enough of it. The local utility, the Grant County Public Utility District, says that it expects to begin buying electricity from outside the county by 2025. For the battery plants, or other factories, to grow here, the community is going to have to invest in expanding its supply of renewable energy.
Richard Hanover grew up in Moses Lake and now works as the director of development at the Port of Moses Lake, which controls much of the region's industrial land. When he was a child, he said, it didn't seem possible Moses Lake would ever have a chance at the kind of prosperity that is now within reach.
"It wasn't even possible when I started here nine years ago," he said.
Now it is. Will Moses Lake seize the opportunity?

Full text: Newly announced modifications to the autocorrect feature used on iPhones will better understand a word's context in a text message, saving users some blushes.
Apple on Monday announced an updated autocorrect function that aims to more accurately reflect users' intended word choices, pleasing customers whose attempts to swear in texts have long been replaced with "duck" or "ducking" (and freeing innocent waterfowl from their unfortunate association with an obscenity).
"In those moments where you just want to type a ducking word, well, the keyboard will learn it, too," said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president for software engineering.
The update was announced on the first day of Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, where the company also introduced its Vision Pro headset. The company said the new keyboard features would be available as part of the iOS 17 software package expected to arrive later this year.
Autocorrect will use a type of neural network called a transformer model to recognize iPhone users' most frequently-typed words and offer predictive text, according to Apple. Transformer models, which are at the heart of artificial intelligence systems like ChatGPT, analyze large amounts of text for patterns.
"Ducking" had become such a recognizable error caused by the iPhone's autocorrect function that The Wall Street Journal conducted an interview with the feature's creator, Ken Kocienda, at a duck farm.
That system drew upon both a "static dictionary" of common words and proper nouns as well as a "dynamic dictionary" of words that each user typed often, Mr. Kocienda said. But it also did not correct close misspellings of curse words, he said, with the goal of preventing users from accidentally inserting vulgarity into their messages.
The update will allow iMessage corrections to better consider a word's context in a sentence, said Yulan He, a professor of natural language processing at King's College London whose given name is usually changed by iMessage to "Tulane."
Previously, autocorrect matched the spelling of each word, in isolation, against the words in its dictionaries. "Now, when they replace a word, they would ensure the replaced word will still maintain the original meaning of the sentence," Professor He said. "That's kind of a key difference."
Autocorrect, which was developed in the 1980s to accompany word processing programs, has been creating problems for as long as it has been solving them.
In 2014, Naomi Campbell congratulated "malaria" on winning the Nobel Peace Prize. (She might have meant "Malala.") According to Wired, employees at Goldman Sachs were upset that Microsoft Word corrected their company's name to incorporate a profanity. The phrase "autocorrect made me do it" has become a way of explaining away embarrassing substitutions such as "sex" instead of "sec."
Jillian Madison, who curated a website of autocorrect blunders, released the book "Damn You, Autocorrect!" in 2011. "If you say, you know, 'I'm going to run and pick up the kids,' it often turns into, 'I'm going to run and pick up the LSD,"' she told NPR.
In Apple's presentation, Mr. Federighi said that the new system would make autocorrect "more accurate than ever." The update will also allow users to tap an autocorrected word to revert it back to what they had typed.

Full text: This article has been updated to include new information about Secretary of State Antony Blinken's meetings with Saudi officials.
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- "Your final destination is Tel Aviv?"
I've been a reporter in the Middle East since 1979, and those are six words I'd never heard in the place where I was standing about the place where I was going.
I was checking in to fly from Doha, Qatar, to Tel Aviv, via Dubai. It was a once inconceivable connection, and now it tripped off the tongue of the FlyDubai agent at Doha International Airport with the same nonchalance as if she were asking if I was flying to Cairo via Riyadh.
My first instinct was to ask her: Could you please keep your voice down?
After all, many of us based in Beirut as reporters in the late 1970s didn't even use the word "Israel." We referred to it only as "Dixie" -- the region south of Lebanon. Now the airport codes DIA, DXB and TLV were fused together on my luggage for all to see.
A few days later, I hopscotched to three more cities that suddenly seemed closer than ever: early breakfast in Tel Aviv; lunch in Amman, Jordan; and late dinner in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh.
This journey was unlike anything I'd ever experienced in a region that has long been my second home, and it allowed me to grasp something quite remarkable: how onetime enemies and rivals across the Middle East are on the cusp of becoming so much more interconnected and interdependent than ever before. It's creating previously unthinkable partnerships, as well as huge internal stresses, as people in the neighborhood are trying to figure out just how modern, secular, open, entwined and democratic they want to be.
No two countries exemplify this moment better than America's two most important Middle East allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia. Both are simultaneously undergoing fundamental internal struggles over their identities. The relationship between religious authorities and the state -- as well as the very legal, social and economic rules of the game -- in both Saudi Arabia and Israel has never been more up for grabs since each country's founding.
In Saudi Arabia, the societal transformations being imposed from the top down by the iron-fisted Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (M.B.S.) are now so profound that if you have not been to Saudi Arabia in the past five years, you may as well have not been there at all. When I last visited Riyadh, at the end of 2017, Saudi women were not permitted to drive. Today, not only are women behind the wheel, but the first Saudi female and first Arab female astronaut, Rayyanah Barnawi, just helped drive a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center up to the International Space Station.
Meanwhile, the threat to Israel's original aspiration to be both a Jewish state and a democratic one is now so profound, posed by an extremist government trying to crush the independence of Israel's Supreme Court, that it has produced an unprecedented 22 straight weeks of massive street protests from democracy-devoted Israelis. If you have not been to Israel in the past five months, you may as well have not been there at all.
In other words, America is now, in effect, present at the re-creation of two nations vital to our interests. Two nations who are at the same time secretly discussing making peace with each other. And two nations that are also figuring out how close to be with America's increasingly Middle East-focused great-power rival, China.
When I was the New York Times bureau chief in Jerusalem between 1984 and 1988, there were no diplomatic relations between Israel and China, and we were just thrilled when the first kosher Chinese restaurant opened near our office, even though there was no pork in the won ton soup. Today, as Israel is bursting with defense- and cyber-related technology start-ups, Beijing has rapidly increased its efforts to buy into or partner with Israeli companies and universities, so much so that Israeli security services now have to keep a close eye on Chinese visitors and diplomats. China also recently brokered a deal to restore diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is now China's biggest supplier of oil, and China is Saudi Arabia's biggest oil customer, to boot.
For all of these reasons, America needs to toss away any inhibitions and play as active a role as possible with Israel and Saudi Arabia. This is no time for America to pick up stakes from the Middle East. This is a time to lean in with our values and soft-power tools like never before.
President Biden should invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Oval Office, like all previous Israeli prime ministers, only if he will answer two questions: One, are you occupying the West Bank and committed to resolving its permanent status through negotiations with the Palestinians, or do you see Israel's current control of the Palestinians as the permanent status, never to be changed? We need to know once and for all. And two, are you committed to ensuring that any major changes to Israel's court system will be put in place with broad public support to ensure political stability, because the United States has a huge interest in its most important military ally in the region not descending into civil war over judicial changes?
For the past 75 years Israel has been a trusted and vital strategic partner of the United States, but that was always based on shared interests and shared values. If those values aren't shared any longer, we need to know that. We need to get behind those Israelis who want to preserve Israel as a democracy -- and keep locking the White House gates to anyone who doesn't.
As for Saudi Arabia, at a time when its Aramco oil company rivals Apple and Microsoft as the world's most valuable company, its youth bulge is just coming of age and Riyadh has replaced Cairo as the most important power in the Arab world, we need to engage with Saudi leaders and society regularly -- to ensure that Riyadh exercises power responsibly and to encourage the people and leaders in Saudi Arabia who are trying to make it more religiously moderate, more respectful of women, more tolerant of all faiths, more economically diversified and more welcoming of dissenting opinions. Saudi Arabia is also the home of Islam's most sacred cities, Mecca and Medina, so how it modernizes and pluralizes will influence mosques and Muslim communities across the globe.
Biden has steadily become more confident dealing with both Netanyahu's Israel and M.B.S.'s Saudi Arabia -- twisting arms and drawing red lines where necessary and looking to foster bridge building within and between their societies (and with America) where possible. But much engagement still lies ahead to help keep this region, and these two countries in particular, tilted toward more pluralism, integration and tolerance.
Let me show you why in detail with a few postcards from my trip.
My first morning in Tel Aviv, I got up at 7 and walked along the beachfront promenade to get my 10,000 steps. At one point, two barefoot young Israeli women dressed in black wet suits passed me by, balancing surfboards on their heads. I couldn't help but chuckle to myself: I wonder if Theodor Herzl, when he conceived the idea of a modern Jewish state back in Europe in the 19th century, ever imagined a sight like this?
Some minutes later, two other young women approached. They appeared to be Israeli Arab Muslims, wearing black scarves on their heads and tennis shoes under their long dresses.
They triggered a different thought: This country -- this whole region -- will thrive only if these four women can share the same beachfront promenade with dignity, in a society and culture that values live and let live. Everyone is just too intertwined now for anything else. But live and let live takes work and the right leadership, whether it comes from heads of government or next-door neighbors.
An old friend of mine, Uri Dromi, a former Israeli Air Force pilot, told me about an experience he had as he personally grappled with the necessity of live and let live in modern Israel. A couple of weeks ago, he and some Air Force colleagues decided to visit Bnei Brak, a predominantly ultra-Orthodox city east of Tel Aviv, which is strongly backing Netanyahu's efforts to overhaul the court, given how it often intervenes to curb the power and perquisites of the ultra-Orthodox. Dromi has been mobilizing other retired airmen to oppose Netanyahu's effort, and they went to Bnei Brak to try to understand how it can be "that under the same Israeli skies there are people who think so differently from me," Dromi explained.
The night before the visit, Dromi called the kosher Hazvi Bakery there to arrange for dozens of challah breads that Jews often eat on the Sabbath, along with plastic bags for each one with the bakery's kosher logo. He used the breads as his calling card, putting a note on each bag of challah: "Shabbat is dear to all our hearts. So is democracy."
It triggered several conversations that made Dromi reflect. He recalled an ultra-Orthodox woman telling him, "You are pushing your liberal agenda on me, and I have to defend myself." She added, "My husband studies all day, and I am a computer engineer." When Dromi asked her why her husband doesn't work, she answered, "Because after the Holocaust, we need big families, and someone has to keep the torch of the Torah alive." To liberal ears, Dromi remarked, "that may sound like nonsense, but it is deeply believed by them."
Dromi recalled how, as he sat on a bench, a young ultra-Orthodox boy approached him and asked, "What is democracy?"
"It touched my heart," Dromi recounted. "I said, 'In democracy everyone is equal, like you and me, and if something happens between us, we go to the court.' He said he was told you should not go to an Israeli government court because 'it was a goyim court,"' meaning it served gentiles.
A day later, Israel's president, Isaac Herzog, shared with me that most Fridays, he and his wife go grocery shopping at a local market. He said the biggest question he receives from fellow shoppers every time he's in the store now, regarding the talks he has convened to broker some kind of deal over judicial changes, is, "When is there going to be a compromise?"
I am convinced that a lot more people in Israel and in the region are exhausted from hating one another and have transcended the political divides -- or at least sure want to -- within their societies and among their societies. Their lived realities are now so much more intertwined than you'd think.
As much as Israeli media outlets and politicians are narrowcasting their ideologies every day, Israel's emerging blended society is on full display every night on prime-time TV -- an ultra-Orthodox female celebrity chef on one channel, an Israeli Druze female celebrity chef on another, an Israeli Arab star journalist on another. And this week the sports news has been dominated by the dream journey of Israel's under-20 soccer team, which just beat Brazil 3-2 in the quarterfinals of the under-20 World Cup championship in Argentina. The Israeli team is composed of young, observant Jews, secular Jews and three Israeli Arabs. Two of Israel's three goals against Brazil were scored by Israeli Arabs, prompting one wag on Israeli Twitter to remark, "No Arabs, no goals."
Unfortunately, since 1996, Netanyahu's whole strategy of winning elections and governing has been to divide, divide, divide -- left from right, Jews from Palestinian Arabs, secular from religious, Ashkenazim from Sephardim -- and to try to win every election with just 50.001 percent. (Just like Donald Trump.)
He's hardly the only problem, but he's been a huge figure in Israeli political life since first winning office -- and he's now in his sixth term. Netanyahu is smart and a once-in-a-generation political talent, but his paranoia, dishonesty and now fear of going to prison on charges of corruption have made him a toxic figure who prioritizes holding power at any cost, not unifying the nation.
This time, though, I think Bibi drove one wedge too many into the heart of Israel's body politic.
I walked alongside the remarkable democracy protest march in Tel Aviv on the night of Saturday, May 20 -- the 20th straight week tens of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to resist Netanyahu's attempted judicial takeover. One particular placard in Hebrew caught my eye: "Bibi, you came down on the wrong generation."
He certainly did. I was observing the demonstration with one of Israel's leading columnists, Nahum Barnea of Yedioth Ahronoth, and his wife, Tammy. At one point, she looked around at all the energy of the young demonstrators chanting in Hebrew, "De-mo-crat-ya," and remarked to me that this is Israelis' attempt "to repair the damage of Rabin's assassination."
I never heard that before. Tammy explained that the 1995 assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an ultranationalist was not just an attack on the Oslo peace process that he was leading; it was also an attack on the whole democratic process in Israel itself.
Rabin's killer voted with a bullet, and then his political allies, some of the very same Jewish supremacists now in the Israeli cabinet, voted with their ballots, which paved the way for the first of Netanyahu's six terms. Ever since then, Jewish settlers have been implanted deeper and deeper into the West Bank, making a two-state solution nearly impossible, and more resources and powers have been transferred from the secular state to the ultra-Orthodox, making them kingmakers in Israeli politics.
Now a younger Israeli generation -- many of whom were born after Rabin's death -- is rising up and joining with the center of Israeli society to say that this whole drift from democracy has got to stop.
As with all such movements, the key is turning the spirited street energy of this wholly new center-left, center-right coalition into sustained political energy that can one day gain elected office and be an engine for new live-and-let-live approaches inside Israel -- and maybe, one day, even between Israelis and Palestinians as well. We'll see.
I will say this, though: Having observed firsthand the protest movements in Egypt, Hong Kong and Istanbul, this one is a different kettle of fish. It is spearheaded by a coalition of Israel's most elite technologists and war fighters, who are now deploying the skills they honed competing in California's Silicon Valley or night fighting in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley to make clear to Netanyahu that they can and will shut Israel down -- from its governing institutions to its start-up economy and its air force -- if he tries to take away the independence of the Supreme Court.
Listen to a few of the protest organizers, and you'll understand how unique this movement is. "I started as an air force pilot and have founded six companies," said Gigi Levy-Weiss. "We've created 50,000 jobs. When we started, we all realized that we cannot stay on the sidelines anymore." This time, "we are not stopping at preventing this legislation" but rather thinking about "how we build the infrastructure" that will permanently guard Israel's democracy, he said.
Shira Eting, a female Israeli Air Force Cobra helicopter pilot, said: "I was able to become a pilot because of a Supreme Court decision. I was the 19th woman to graduate from the Air Force flight academy. Without the Supreme Court, my life would be different. I am married to a woman." She added, "If I want to be the mother of my daughter," she needs the protection of the Supreme Court from the ultra-Orthodox who would oppose it. Thanks to Israel's Supreme Court, "people can make their dreams come true."
David Gillerman, who served in the Israeli Air Force's elite search and rescue team and is now a major real estate developer in Israel, told me that he told his children that he was getting deeply involved in the democracy protest movement "so they have a proper country to grow up in. This is our new independence war. All of this has woken up a sleeping lion."
Bibi definitely came down on the wrong cowboys and cowgirls.
But never, ever underestimate how far Netanyahu will go to stay in power. In order to keep his coalition together, he approved a budget two weeks ago that transfers massive amounts of shekels to the schools of his ultra-Orthodox party allies -- schools that reject Israel's core curriculum -- and to their religious students and adults who do not serve in the army and to West Bank Jewish settlers.
"The new government budget includes an unprecedented increment in allocations to the settlers and ultra-Orthodox, including full funding of schools to not teach English, science and math. This budgetary increment alone is more than Israel invests each year in higher education altogether -- or 14 years of complete funding for the Technion, Israel's M.I.T.," said Dan Ben-David, a macroeconomist who has focused on the interaction between Israel's demography and education at Tel Aviv University, where he heads the Shoresh Institution for Socioeconomic Research. "It is completely nuts."
The ultra-Orthodox share of Israel's population doubles roughly every 25 years, added Ben-David. "Today it is 24 percent of the infants. By 2050, it will be half of Israel's infants. None of them learn basic civics or separation of powers and how liberal democracy works, let alone receiving the tools to thrive in a modern economy," he told me.
"Unless we get our act together now, this will be the final nail into the coffin of our future," he said.
So imagine how bizarre it was to find myself -- three days after talking to Ben-David in Tel Aviv -- sitting in the living room of Saudi Arabia's minister of education, Yousef al-Benyan, listening to him describe how Saudi Arabia has been overhauling all of its public schools and university curriculums to develop a work force of men and women who can compete in a post-oil age.
Public school textbooks have been scrubbed to eliminate materials that promote intolerance of other faiths or subservience for women, and the government is doubling down on teacher training, all with the aim of "instilling technological proficiency alongside critical thinking, problem solving and analytical capabilities" to align the Saudi education system "with competitive international standards," as a recent Oxford Business Group study put it. It has a long way to go, but compared with a decade ago, it constitutes an education revolution.
And like practically every other minister I met in Riyadh, al-Benyan was bursting with pride over a national team of Saudi male and female science and math students recently winning 27 prizes at the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair in Dallas. More than 70 countries were competing there, in the world's largest international precollege science competition.
It is interesting to note that al-Benyan formerly led one of the most important companies in the country, SABIC (Saudi Basic Industries Corporation), which is among the world's largest diversified petrochemical companies. The Saudi leadership wanted an education minister who understands what it takes to get a good private sector job today, because the days of getting a B.A. in Islamic studies and thinking you can get a cushy government job are over.
It's just the opposite of what Israel is doing with its religious youth.
Go figure.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia is now trying to suppress the strict religious forces that Israel is increasingly empowering. But the Saudi ruling family has a lot to make up for, because the religious excesses it indulged at home and funded abroad beginning in 1979 warped the whole Muslim world and helped to inspire 9/11. The short story: The Islamist and women-suppressing traditionalists here were given free rein after 1979, after extremists took over the Grand Mosque in Mecca and accused the ruling al-Sauds of being insufficiently pious. In response, the ruling family gave the clerics unrivaled powers to impose the most puritanical brand of Islam at home and export it. It changed the face of Islam globally.
Mohammed bin Salman, who is the effective ruler now that his elderly father, King Salman, has stepped back from most of his public leadership duties, has basically been reversing 1979 -- putting the religious authorities tightly under the government's thumb and the most radical Islamists in jail and lifting their heavy lid off Saudi society -- with strong buy-in from the two-thirds of its population that is under the age of 30.
I found it quite symbolic that in 2021, M.B.S.'s Islamic affairs minister ordered all mosques to "lower the volume" on their loudspeakers, "saying families had been complaining that competing speakers were keeping their children awake," as Reuters reported.
The big question for Saudi Arabia is whether the country can stay stable and achieve even half of its ambitions, at a time when every Saudi is being asked to hop on a bullet train to modernity that aims to make up for decades of drift under tired old men, for whom change at five miles an hour was fast enough but was so sclerotic it was threatening the viability of the whole Saudi system.
What do I mean by a bullet train? When I was last here, in late 2017, M.B.S. surprised the country by announcing that Saudi women and girls would be permitted for the first time to attend soccer games as fans.
I came back last week and discovered that a Saudi women's premier soccer league is now headed into its second season.
When I was last here in 2017, M.B.S. had announced that women would be granted the right to drive. When I came back last week, I discovered that in March 2022, the racer Aseel al-Hamad became the first Saudi woman to drive a Formula 1 car in Saudi Arabia and Reema Juffali became the first Saudi woman to compete in an international racing series in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia, in 2019. Summon an Uber in Riyadh today, and a female driver might fetch you.
The pace and extent of change in Saudi society has been underreported in part because few foreign reporters visited during Covid, when so many reforms here achieved escape velocity, and in part because many reporters -- myself included -- struggle with how to write about authentic positive changes in Saudi Arabia when the author of so many of them is M.B.S., who in 2018 also enabled the grotesque and senseless dismemberment of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The only answer for Biden is to talk about both. To just set aside what M.B.S.'s people did to Khashoggi would be immoral and inconsistent with American values and interests. So, too, would be setting aside the Saudis' continuing curtailment of any public expressions of dissent or criticism of the leadership on any issue. M.B.S. would benefit from letting more Saudi voices be heard at this time of massive and rapid change.
But for American officials to adopt a permanently standoffish approach to Saudi Arabia would be irresponsible. It would ignore the extensive and popular reforms that M.B.S. has unleashed at home that could transform Saudi Arabia and the whole Muslim world in some very healthy ways -- ways that are also hugely in America's interest.
This tension is never going to go away as long as M.B.S. is running the show here. If you want to write about or engage with only countries without moral quandaries, you've come to the wrong neighborhood.
It's late afternoon in Riyadh, and I am sitting in the Salam coffee shop, one of scores of new coffee houses and restaurants that have opened here since I last visited. I am with three Saudi 20-somethings, two of whom, men, were college educated in America and chose to come back to be part of the reform movement here, and another, a woman, who was educated here. We are inside, but outside, they point out to me, are four Saudi women, hair only loosely covered, enjoying their coffee and vaping. I never saw that here before.
These young people did not want to speak on the record. As I said, for all the radical social, religious and economic reforms here, this is still an absolute monarchy, where you can get arrested and imprisoned just for tweeting mild criticism of M.B.S. or his government. (The Saudi government has also grown very adept at using Twitter bots to attack critics and amplify support for the leadership.)
And yet there are more than a few young Saudis who use M.B.S.'s image as a screen saver, and it is authentic. Why? Because everything is relative. You cannot imagine what it was like to be a modern Saudi young woman before M.B.S. completely uprooted the mutawa -- the Muslim religious police -- who for decades terrorized the population and could arrest any woman for a lock of hair hanging too loosely from her veil or, in the case of a young male Saudi friend of mine, try to prevent someone from going through passport control on his way to study abroad because his hair was too long and he was going to an "infidel" college.
Being allowed to drive, the young woman I was having coffee with explained, is about more than just driving. "It is about me driving my own life now. You come here, and you see women driving today, and it doesn't mean anything to anyone else in the world, but it means a lot to me. My whole teenage years, my goal was to live abroad. I thought if this country is going to change, it is going to take centuries and decades. I studied literature, and we studied women in the Renaissance and the changes they went through. I never thought I'd be one of them."
And she is not alone. Saudi Arabia has long had "one of the lowest female labor force participation rates in the world," noted a 2021 report by the Brookings Institution. In 2018 "the share of Saudi women who had a job or were actively looking for one was 19.7 percent of the adult population of women with Saudi citizenship." It added, "In the years before that, the rate was much lower."
But in the wake of M.B.S.'s decision to permit women to drive -- and those 21 and over to no longer be required to get permission from a so-called male guardian to apply for a passport or travel abroad -- the labor force participation rate of Saudi women jumped 64 percent in two years, to 33 percent by the end of 2020. It grew to 37 percent in 2022. This is still hardly a paradise for women -- women's rights activists have been detained -- but compared with what it was just six years ago, the change is extensive.
This generation of Saudi leaders is acutely aware that "oil will not be there forever," said Saudi Arabia's minister of economy and planning, Faisal Alibrahim, an M.I.T. grad who, like so many ministers here today, came from the private sector. "So our competitiveness has to come from other places, and our sources of growth have to diversify if we are going to make the economy more resilient and unlock the full potential of the society."
That meant finally unlocking the full potential of the female half of society after centuries. This generation of Saudi leaders concluded, noted Alibrahim, that "social and cultural change" was not just a hopeful "byproduct of economic development"; it was the "necessary ingredient for it."
This is an important U.S. foreign policy interest. Why? After it was announced in October 2017 that Saudi women would be able to attend public sporting events, guess what happened. Iranian women next door, who had been banned from such opportunities since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, demanded the same rights and were granted them in 2019 -- after "the death of a fan who had set herself alight after being arrested for trying to attend a match," BBC News reported.
This is not complicated: Ever since the revolution, Iran and Saudi Arabia have competed for which was the most authentically pious Islamic country -- and they exported that competition around the Arab and Muslim world, pushing mosques and madrassas to preach the most puritanical, anti-women and anti-religious-pluralism ideas.
Iranian women are now rebelling for their own reasons, throwing off their head coverings in defiance of the clerics. But there is no question in my mind that a Saudi Arabia that is liberalizing socially, culturally, religiously and economically will not only stimulate more reform around the Arab and Muslim world; it also can't help but be another source of pressure on Iran's Dark Ages clerical leadership. What happens in Saudi Arabia does not stay in Saudi Arabia. That was true when it was Wahhabi fundamentalism -- and hopefully it will be true with a more moderate Islam.
When I started working in this region, Jews were not welcome to visit Saudi Arabia unless their last name was Kissinger. Today, Israel and Saudi Arabia are quietly talking about terms of peace. It is a three-cornered shot. The Saudis want Israel's help with Congress to secure a long-term U.S.-Saudi security deal, a civilian nuclear energy program and access to America's most advanced weapons -- in exchange for Saudi Arabia normalizing relations with Israel.
The Israelis keep telling me that if they help deliver those goods from the United States, the Saudis will normalize relations with Israel without demanding any concessions from Israel for the Palestinians.
I don't believe it. From my conversations with a senior Saudi official, the Saudis still have not made up their minds about how much they will require Israel to do vis-à-vis the Palestinians in return for opening relations -- but it won't be zero. Saudi Arabia is very competitive these days with the United Arab Emirates, and Riyadh will almost certainly want to get more from Israel than the U.A.E. got for signing the Abraham Accords. Netanyahu knows there is going to be a price, but he is trying to keep it as small as possible, diplomatic sources told me.
Never thought I'd write this, but: Saudi Arabia may not be interested in Jewish history, but Jewish history is now very interested in Saudi Arabia. That's because the conditions that Saudi Arabia demands from the Jewish state in return for normalization will have a huge impact on whether Israel can remain a Jewish state and a democratic state.
The Saudis could cement Netanyahu's extremist coalition in power for years -- by rewarding Bibi with the ultimate prize of diplomatic relations with Riyadh -- without any Israeli concessions to the Palestinians in the West Bank. But this would likely lock Israel into an apartheid future.
Or the Saudis could demand Israeli overtures to the Palestinians that would preserve the possibility of a two-state solution -- and the hope that Israel could remain both democratic and Jewish -- by forcing Netanyahu to choose between his extremist one-state allies and making history by opening relations with Saudi Arabia.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken met in Riyadh this week with M.B.S. to discuss the prospects of normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. According to diplomatic sources, the Biden team is ready to work with the Saudis on forging a long-term security arrangement with Riyadh and a civilian nuclear program. But the Biden team also knows this will require coordination with Congress and concessions from Israel vis-à-vis the Palestinians.
Watch this space.
To understand America's long-term staying power in this swiftly changing region, I want to quickly take you back to my stop in Doha, where I visited the giant U.S. Al Udeid air base nearby.
So many people are suddenly talking to so many other people they weren't talking to before: Saudi Arabia is talking to Iran via China. Egypt is talking to Qatar. The U.A.E. is talking to Qatar. Turkey is talking to Egypt. And all the Sunni Arab states are now suddenly talking to Syria. And most of them are also talking to Israel.
It's the Middle East equivalent of square dancing, and this do-si-do is not hard to explain: the chaotic U.S. departure from Afghanistan under Biden; the failure of the United States to respond to Iranian-sponsored attacks on Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. during the Trump and Biden administrations; Trump's sudden, idiotic push to remove U.S. troops from Syria, where they were protecting the Kurds and fighting ISIS. All of these turning points have a lot of folks here convinced that America has one foot out the door. They'd better learn to dance with new partners, the thinking goes, so they aren't alone if Uncle Sam does step away.
I think that fear is exaggerated, but it is not without some merit. Given the pull of the Ukraine war and the long-term challenge of China in the Pacific, if the United States is going to remain a credible power in this region, it is going to have to think about military strategy and financial costs differently. And that brings me to the most interesting thing I saw and heard at Al Udeid.
I walked into a big garage, and this is what I noticed: a pool table, a bunch of 3-D printers, computer screens, machining tools, a bunch of prototype drones and some tattooed U.S. airmen working under a wall-mounted banner that read, "Get shit done."
Where was I? I was in one of the most interesting innovations carried out by the U.S. Central Command leader, Gen. Michael "Erik" Kurilla, to extend our staying power. It's the military version of frugal innovation. Centcom challenged itself this way: What if we could fight ISIS, Al Qaeda and Iran only with weapons we had to assemble and make with 3-D printers and we could buy the necessary components only online from Best Buy, Amazon and Alibaba?
In other words, what if we fought with the same economic limitations that our enemies have been managing quite effectively against us since the U.S. invasion of Iraq -- limitations that have led to an asymmetrical battlefield in which we fire $ 1-million-a-copy missiles to knock down the $ 500-a-copy drones they've assembled largely from cheap components available on Best Buy, Amazon and Alibaba.
With this kind of low-cost strategy in mind, the Centcom engineer in charge of the garage explained to me, "we can iterate" new drones and jammers extremely quickly using 3-D printers and carbon fiber materials. And if the United States and its allies are now able to throw 1,000 cheap drones at a foe and that foe doesn't know which one is armed, he explained, "we are imposing costs and creating dilemmas for them and taking their attention away from something else. And by the time they catch on, we're onto the next thing."
This kind of frugal innovation might enable the United States to do less with more in this region. Still, the perception continues that we are leaving, and that is what is creating a lot of movement on the geopolitical game board out here. As a senior Saudi official put it to me: While the Americans are still present in this region, "we're just not sure what they're present for" -- what would trigger them to act in the defense of their allies.
On my last night in Riyadh, Hassan Yassin, a former Saudi diplomat and an old friend, gathered a group for dinner at his home. Hassan is in his 90s and has an amazing picture collection covering his walls. But there was one in particular that he insisted I not miss.
"Did you see the one with my father and President Roosevelt with King Abdul Aziz?" he asked. And then he walked me by the arm to see it.
I thought about that picture and Hassan's pride in it on the ride back to my hotel. America has been deeply present in the lives of Saudi Arabia and Israel since their foundings. I don't know what the right level of U.S. military presence should be out here. I wish we could get by with as little as possible.
But I am totally sure of this: If there was ever a time for America at its best to be out here leading as much with its values as with its hard power, and inspiring, not just defending, it is right now -- when the future characters of the region's two most influential states, and our two most important allies, are totally in play.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Rohit Prasad, a senior Amazon executive, had an urgent message for ninth and 10th graders at Dearborn STEM Academy, a public school in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood.
He had come to the school on a recent morning to observe an Amazon-sponsored lesson in artificial intelligence that teaches students how to program simple tasks for Alexa, Amazon's voice-activated virtual assistant. And he assured the Dearborn students there would soon be millions of new jobs in A.I.
"We need to create the talent for the next generation," Mr. Prasad, the head scientist for Alexa, told the class. "So we are educating about A.I. at the earliest, grass-roots level."
A few miles away, Sally Kornbluth, the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was delivering a more sobering message about A.I. to students from local schools who had gathered at Boston's Kennedy Library complex for a workshop on A.I. risks and regulation.
"Because A.I. is such a powerful new technology, in order for it to work well in society, it really needs some rules," Dr. Kornbluth said. "We have to make sure that what it doesn't do is cause harm."
The same-day events -- one encouraging work in artificial intelligence and the other cautioning against deploying the technology too hastily -- mirrored the larger debate currently raging in the United States over the promise and potential peril of A.I.
Both student workshops were organized by an M.I.T. initiative on "responsible A.I." whose donors include Amazon, Google and Microsoft. And they underscored a question that has vexed school districts across the nation this year: How should schools prepare students to navigate a world in which, according to some prominent A.I. developers, the ascendancy of A.I.-powered tools seems all but inevitable?
Teaching A.I. in schools is not new. Courses like computer science and civics now regularly include exercises on the societal impacts of facial recognition and other automated systems.
But the push for A.I. education took on more urgency this year after news about ChatGPT -- a novel chatbot that can create humanlike homework essays and sometimes manufactures misinformation -- began spreading in schools.
Now, "A.I. literacy" is a new education buzz phrase. Schools are scrambling for resources to help teach it. Some universities, tech companies and nonprofits are responding with ready-made curriculums.
The lessons are proliferating even as schools are wrestling with a fundamental question: Should they teach students to program and use A.I. tools, providing training in tech skills employers seek? Or should students learn to anticipate and mitigate A.I. harms?
Cynthia Breazeal, a professor at M.I.T. who directs the university's initiative on Responsible A.I. for Social Empowerment and Education, said her program aimed to help schools do both.
"We want students to be informed, responsible users and informed, responsible designers of these technologies," said Dr. Breazeal, whose group organized the A.I. workshops for schools. "We want to make them informed, responsible citizens about these rapid developments in A.I. and the many ways they are influencing our personal and professional lives."
(Disclosure: I was recently a fellow at the Knight Science Journalism program at M.I.T.)
Other education experts say schools should also encourage students to consider the broader ecosystems in which A.I. systems operate. That might include students researching the business models behind new technologies or examining how A.I. tools exploit user data.
"If we are engaging students in learning about these new systems, we really have to think about the context surrounding these new systems," said Jennifer Higgs, an assistant professor of learning and mind sciences at the University of California, Davis. But often, she noted, "that piece is still missing."
The workshops in Boston were part of a "Day of A.I." event organized by Dr. Breazeal's program, which drew several thousands students worldwide. It offered a glimpse of the varied approaches that schools are taking to A.I. education.
At Dearborn STEM, Hilah Barbot, a senior product manager at Amazon Future Engineer, the company's computer science education program, led a lesson in voice A.I. for students. The lessons were developed by M.I.T. with the Amazon program, which provides coding curriculums and other programs for K-12 schools. The company provided more than $ 2 million in grants to M.I.T. for the project.
First, Ms. Barbot explained some voice A.I. lingo. She taught students about "utterances," the phrases that consumers might say to prompt Alexa to respond.
Then students programmed simple tasks for Alexa, like telling jokes. Jada Reed, a ninth grader, programmed Alexa to respond to questions about Japanese manga characters. "I think it's really cool you can train it to do different things," she said.
Dr. Breazeal said it was important for students to have access to professional software tools from leading tech companies. "We're giving them future-proof skills and perspectives of how they can work with A.I. to do things they care about," she said.
Some Dearborn students, who had already built and programmed robots in school, said they appreciated learning how to code a different technology: voice-activated helpbots. Alexa uses a range of A.I. techniques, including automatic speech recognition.
At least a few students also said they had privacy and other concerns about A.I.-assisted tools.
Amazon records consumers' conversations with its Echo speakers after a person says a "wake word" like "Alexa." Unless users opt out, Amazon may use their interactions with Alexa to target them with ads or use their voice recordings to train its A.I. models. Last week, Amazon agreed to pay $ 25 million to settle federal charges that it had indefinitely kept children's voice recordings, violating the federal online children's privacy law. The company said it disputed the charges and denied that it had violated the law. The company noted that customers could review and delete their Alexa voice recordings.
But the one-hour Amazon-led workshop did not touch on the company's data practices.
Dearborn STEM students regularly scrutinize technology. Several years ago, the school introduced a course in which students used A.I. tools to create deepfake videos -- that is, false content -- of themselves and examine the consequences. And the students had thoughts on the virtual assistant they were learning to program that morning.
"Did you know there's a conspiracy theory that Alexa listens to your conversations to show you ads?" a ninth grader named Eboni Maxwell asked.
"I'm not afraid of it listening," Laniya Sanders, another ninth grader, replied. Even so, Ms. Sanders said she avoided using voice assistants because "I just want to do it myself."
A few miles away at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, an education center that houses a full-scale replica of the U.S. Senate chamber, dozens of students from Warren Prescott School in Charlestown, Mass., were exploring a different topic: A.I. policy and safety regulations.
Playing the role of senators from different states, the middle school students participated in a mock hearing in which they debated provisions for a hypothetical A.I. safety bill.
Some students wanted to ban companies and police departments from using A.I. to target people based on data like their race or ethnicity. Others wanted to require schools and hospitals to assess the fairness of A.I. systems before deploying them.
The exercise was not unfamiliar for the middle school students. Nancy Arsenault, an English and civics teacher at Warren Prescott, said she often asked her students to consider how digital tools affected them and the people they care about.
"As much as students love tech, they are keenly aware that unfettered A.I. is not something they want," she said. "They want to see limits."

Automated chatbot tutors carry educational promise, but they make mistakes.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Proponents see the tools as a way to automatically customize academic support. They could also make children test subjects for A.I. experiments.
A dozen students huddled at communal classroom tables one morning this spring, their gazes fixed on math lessons on their laptops.
The sixth graders at Khan Lab School, an independent school with an elementary campus in Palo Alto, Calif., were working on quadratic equations, graphing functions, Venn diagrams. But when they ran into questions, many did not immediately summon their teacher for help.
They used a text box alongside their lessons to request help from Khanmigo, an experimental chatbot tutor for schools that uses artificial intelligence.
The tutoring bot quickly responded to one student, Zaya, by asking her to identify specific data points in a chart. Then Khanmigo coaxed her to use the data points to solve her math question.
"It's very good at walking you through the problem step by step," Zaya said. "Then it congratulates you every time it helps you solve a problem."
Khan Lab School students are among the first schoolchildren in the United States to try out experimental conversational chatbots that aim to simulate one-on-one human tutoring. The tools can respond to students in clear, smooth sentences, and they have been specifically designed for school use.
Based on A.I. models underlying chatbots like ChatGPT, these automated study aids could usher in a profound shift in classroom teaching and learning. Simulated tutors could make it easier for many self-directed students to hone their skills, delve deeper into topics that interest them or tackle new subjects at their own pace.
Such unproven automated tutoring systems could also make errors, foster cheating, diminish the role of teachers or hinder critical thinking in schools -- making students test subjects for what amounts to an experiment in education by algorithm. Or, like a legion of promising tech tools before them, the bots may simply do little to improve academic outcomes.
Khanmigo is among the wave of new A.I.-powered learning tools. It was developed by Khan Academy, a nonprofit education giant whose video tutorials and practice problems have been used by tens of millions of students.
Sal Khan, the founder of Khan Academy -- and of Khan Lab School, a separate nonprofit organization -- said he hoped the chatbot would democratize student access to individualized tutoring. He also said it could greatly help teachers with tasks like lesson planning, freeing them up to spend more time with their students.
"It'll enable every student in the United States, and eventually on the planet, to effectively have a world-class personal tutor," Mr. Khan said.
Hundreds of public schools already use Khan Academy's online lessons for math and other subjects. Now the nonprofit, which introduced Khanmigo this year, is pilot-testing the tutoring bot with districts, including Newark Public Schools in New Jersey.
Khan Academy developed the bot with guardrails for schools, Mr. Khan said. These include a monitoring system that is designed to alert teachers if students using Khanmigo seem fixated on issues like self-harm. Mr. Khan said his group was studying Khanmigo's effectiveness and planned to make it widely available to districts this fall.
Thousands of U.S. schools already use analytical A.I. tools like plagiarism-detection systems and adaptive learning apps that are designed to automatically adjust lessons to students' reading levels. But proponents envision the new A.I.-assisted tutoring systems as education game changers because they act more like student collaborators than inert pieces of software.
The A.I.'s facility with language has prompted some enthusiasts to declare that simulated tutors could soon be as individually responsive to students as human tutors.
"The A.I.s will get to that ability, to be as good a tutor as any human ever could," Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist, said at a recent conference for investors in educational technology. (Khan Academy has received more than $ 10 million in grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.)
Whether the bots can provide the kind of empathetic support and genuine encouragement that can make human tutors especially effective is not yet known.
For more than a century, education entrepreneurs have envisioned classroom devices programmed to automatically test students and deliver instruction.
As the education writer Audrey Watters recounts in her book "Teaching Machines," researchers in the 1920s began claiming that automated teaching devices would revolutionize education. The machines, they promised, would free teachers from drudgery and enable students to work at their own pace and receive automated feedback.
Over the decades, schools that rushed to adopt the latest automated teaching technologies often found the systems finicky or faulty. Some concluded that the automated tools did little improve student outcomes.
Now, new chatbots are prompting a renewed campaign for automated teaching aids. Khanmigo underscores the educational promise, and potential drawbacks, of the technology.
Khan Academy began developing chatbot tutoring software last fall with the aim of assessing A.I.'s potential to improve learning. The system uses GPT-4, a large language model created by OpenAI, the research lab behind ChatGPT.
Mr. Khan said he wanted to create a system to help guide students, rather than simply hand them answers. So developers at Khan Academy engineered Khanmigo to use the Socratic method. It often asks students to explain their thinking as a way of nudging them to solve their own questions.
Khanmigo offers help on a broad variety of subjects: elementary school math, middle school American history, high school civics and college-level organic chemistry. It also has features that invite students to chat with fictional characters like Winnie-the-Pooh or simulated historical figures like Marie Curie.
A.I. systems based on large language models can also concoct false information. That is because the models are engineered to predict the next word in a sequence. They do not stick to facts.
To improve Khanmigo's accuracy in math, developers at Khan Academy created a multistep process: The system works out answers to a math problem behind the scenes and then checks it against a student's answer. Even so, the Khan Academy tutoring system displays a warning at the bottom of the screen: "Khanmigo makes mistakes sometimes."
Khan Lab School, where annual tuition costs more than $ 30,000, offers an ideal test bed for tutoring bots. The Silicon Valley school has small classes and an entrepreneurial philosophy encouraging children to pursue their passions and learn at their own pace. Its tech-savvy students are accustomed to tinkering with digital tools.
One morning this spring, Jaclyn Major, a STEM specialist at Khan's elementary school, looked on as her students playfully tested the bot's limits.
One student asked Khanmigo to explain a math problem using song lyrics. Another requested math help in "Gen Z slang."
"Will you do me one more favor and explain everything in Korean?" a third said in a text conversation with the chatbot.
Khanmigo dutifully obliged. Then it nudged each student back to the math task at hand.
Ms. Major said she appreciated how the system interacted with her students in engaging ways.
"Khanmigo is able to connect with them and be on their level if they want it to," she said. "I think it could be helpful in any classroom."
It is too soon to tell whether Khanmigo will be equally engaging for other audiences -- such as public schools with larger classes or students who are not used to driving their own learning.
In the classroom, Zaya, the sixth grader, had run into a glitch. Khanmigo had asked her to explain how she came up with the answer to a data set problem. Then the bot incorrectly suggested that she might have made a "small mistake" in her calculations.
She promptly admonished the A.I. chatbot: "19 + 12 is 31 khanmigo," she wrote.
"Apologies for my mistake earlier," Khanmigo responded. "You are indeed correct."
That may prove to be one of the most important lessons for schoolchildren using promising new tutor bots: Don't believe every A.I.-spawned text you read.
"Remember, we are testing it," Ms. Major reminded her students. "We're learning -- and it's learning."

BOSTON — Rohit Prasad, a senior Amazon executive, had an urgent message for ninth and 10th graders at Dearborn STEM Academy, a public school in Boston’s Roxbury neighborhood.
He had come to the school on a recent morning to observe an Amazon-sponsored lesson in artificial intelligence that teaches students how to program simple tasks for Alexa, Amazon’s voice-activated virtual assistant.

And the students had thoughts on the virtual assistant they were learning to program that morning.
“Did you know there’s a conspiracy theory that Alexa listens to your conversations to show you ads?” a ninth grader named Eboni Maxwell asked.
“I’m not afraid of it listening,” Laniya Sanders, another ninth grader, replied. Even so, Sanders said she avoided using voice assistants because “I just want to do it myself.”
A few miles away at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, an education center that houses a full-scale replica of the U.S. Senate chamber, dozens of students from Warren Prescott School in Charlestown, Massachusetts, were exploring a different topic: AI policy and safety regulations.
Playing the role of senators from different states, the middle school students participated in a mock hearing in which they debated provisions for a hypothetical AI safety bill.
Some students wanted to ban companies and police departments from using AI to target people based on data like their race or ethnicity. Others wanted to require schools and hospitals to assess the fairness of AI systems before deploying them.
The exercise was not unfamiliar for the middle school students. Nancy Arsenault, an English and civics teacher at Warren Prescott, said she often asked her students to consider how digital tools affected them and the people they care about.
“As much as students love tech, they are keenly aware that unfettered AI is not something they want,” she said. “They want to see limits.”

Full text: In an internal all-hands meeting, the chief executive explained his plans for artificial intelligence, the metaverse and rebooting Meta's culture.
Mark Zuckerberg has spent the last nine months against the ropes as his company has made big cuts to its work force and struggled to gain mainstream traction with its ambitious plans for virtual reality.
On Thursday, he told Meta employees how he planned to get the company back on track. In an all-hands meeting, Mr. Zuckerberg offered an explanation for recent layoffs and for the first time laid out a vision for how Meta's work in artificial intelligence would blend with its plans for the virtual reality it calls the metaverse.
Mr. Zuckerberg's talk was an attempt to rally staff after the most tumultuous period in his company's 19-year history. The chief executive said he made "tough decisions" about layoffs with the goal of "building a better technology company" that shipped better products, faster -- something he believed Meta wasn't doing well as it swelled to more than 80,000 employees at the peak of the pandemic.
"I want us to use this period that's going to be a bit more stable in order to evolve and rebuild our culture," he said, according to two people who attended the meeting and shared remarks and a recording with The New York Times.
Mr. Zuckerberg delivered the remarks in a roughly half-hour address to thousands of employees at Meta's Menlo Park, Calif., campus. The talk, made on an outdoor pavilion the company calls Hacker Square, was also livestreamed to tens of thousands of employees around the world.
It was one of Meta's few major all-hands meetings over the last three years to be conducted in person, and included presentations from other Meta executives, like Andrew Bosworth, the chief technology officer, and Chris Cox, the chief product officer.
During the presentation, Mr. Cox detailed Meta's plans for making improvements to Reels, Instagram's short-form video product, to better take on TikTok, one of Meta's most formidable competitors.
Executives also spoke about Project 92, a long-rumored social app in development at Meta that will function similar to Twitter. The app, executives said, will work with other apps like Mastodon and Bluesky.
While Meta has aggressively worked on A.I. for several years, it has been slower than competitors like Google and Microsoft to turn that research into consumer products. Mr. Zuckerberg on Thursday detailed plans for artificially intelligent assistants that aid people across all Meta's apps, including WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram.
He said Meta would work on creating artificial intelligence models that were accessible to more people than those of his company's competitors and, ultimately, would fit into his plans for the metaverse.
"Democratizing access to this has a bunch of value," Mr. Zuckerberg said, according to the two people who shared remarks with The Times. "But it's also aligned with the product vision of enabling a lot of different A.I.'s instead of just trying to consolidate this ourselves into one singular A.I. that's going to try to rule everything."
He envisioned A.I. assistants that help people "create content to express yourself and your ideas so much better," or perhaps some artificially intelligent version of "a coach that gives you advice, encourages you."
A.I. agents could serve customers in products like WhatsApp, the globally popular messaging app that Meta has been focused on turning into an important tool for business owners and customer service. And every business could use a personalized A.I. algorithm.
"Different people have different interests, and we'll need a diverse array of A.I.s to represent all of these different interests," Mr. Zuckerberg said in the meeting.
To do that, the company is betting heavily on open source technology, which means it will share its work on artificial intelligence with researchers who want to build their own algorithms with what Meta has already done. The company has spent billions over the past decade building systems to run A.I. and attracting top researchers to work on some of the world's most difficult computer science questions around A.I.
Meta has been criticized for its approach. Researchers and politicians outside the company say opening A.I. algorithms to many others could spawn malicious, automated and intelligent systems that accelerate the spread of misinformation. Those sophisticated algorithms, critics say, need to be tightly controlled.
In his address, Mr. Zuckerberg defended Meta's strategy. He said open-source software enables greater outside scrutiny of the technology because it can be seen by millions of technologists. He said working closely with outsiders' advances would make Meta's platforms better.
Mr. Zuckerberg also said he hoped for a world where people could build as many different A.I. programs as they wanted, rather than relying on a few provided by two or three large technology companies.
That does not mean Meta is backing away from its namesake metaverse plans, Mr. Zuckerberg said. Programs using new generative A.I. technology, he said, could eventually help people build new virtual world items and experiences. And he hinted that the company may bring its A.I. assistant into a future version of its smart glasses. (Meta released a pair of smart Ray-Ban glasses in 2021, though sales have been sluggish.)
He also took a swipe at Apple's recently announced Vision Pro headset, $ 3,500 high-tech goggles that promised to usher in a new era of "spatial computing."
"I was really curious to see what they'd ship, and it's a good sign for our own development that they don't have any magical solutions to the laws of physics that we haven't already explored," he said in his remarks. Mr. Zuckerberg criticized the high-end materials and cost of the device, while noting that Meta had spent years bringing down the price of its headsets to an upcoming version that will start at $ 500.
"Their announcement really shows how our vision and values are different and what's at stake in shaping this platform," Mr. Zuckerberg said. "Our vision of the metaverse and presence is fundamentally social and about people interacting and feeling closer in new amazing ways. By contrast, every demo Apple showed was someone sitting on a couch by themselves."

It's Official: Wall St. Enters a Bull Market: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/official-wall-st-enters-bull-market/docview/2823849775/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks rose just enough Thursday for Wall Street to barrel into a new bull market as the S&P 500 keeps rallying off its low from last fall.
The index rose 0.6 percent to carry it 20 percent above a bottom hit in October. That means Wall Street's main measure of health has climbed out of a bear market, which saw it drop 25.4 percent over roughly nine months.
The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.5 percent, while the Nasdaq composite led the market with a 1 percent rise. That has been the norm so far this bull run, as the chip maker Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks have been responsible for the lion's share of Wall Street's gains.
Declaring the end of a bear market may seem arbitrary, but it offers a useful marker for investors. It also provides a reminder that investors able to hold on through downturns have nearly always made back all their losses in S&P 500 index funds eventually.
Even though it was driven by so many superlatives -- the worst inflation in generations and the fastest hikes to interest rates in decades, for example-- this most recent bear market lasted only about nine months. It stretched from Jan. 3, 2022, when the S&P 500 set a record, until Oct. 12, when it hit bottom. That's shorter than the typical bear market, and it also resulted in a shallower loss than average.
"In hindsight, it might not look that bad, but it certainly feels bad in the moment," said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual.
What made last year even more painful for investors, he said, is that both stocks and bonds lost money, something that hasn't happened in decades.
The market has gained because the economy has refused to fall into a recession, despite repeated predictions for one. It has withstood the highest interest rates since 2007, three high-profile collapses of U.S. banks since March, and another threat by the U.S. government of an economy-shaking default on its debt.
"Bottom line, the economy has been very resilient," said Anthony Saglimbene, chief markets strategist at Ameriprise Financial.
Not only has the economy avoided a recession because of a remarkably solid job market and spending by consumers, hopes are also rising that the Fed may soon stop raising interest rates. High rates undercut inflation by slowing the economy, which drags down prices for stocks and other investments.
The broad expectation among traders is that the Fed will hold rates steady next week, which would mark the first meeting where it hasn't raised rates in more than a year. While it may raise rates one more time in July, the hope on Wall Street is that it won't go beyond that. Inflation has been coming down from its peak last summer.
But many challenges still remain for the stock market. Chief among them is that no one can be sure when the Fed will stop hiking rates. Even if inflation has eased, it has remained stubbornly above the Fed's comfort level.
That has some investors continuing to prepare for a recession, even if they keep pushing out predictions for when it will arrive. Another warning sign for skeptics is how much of the S&P 500's gains have been concentrated this year within just a handful of stocks. Euphoria around artificial intelligence was fanned by last month's tremendous sales forecast by Nvidia, and just seven stocks have been responsible for the majority of the S&P 500's gain this year.
Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft and other Big Tech giants have huge influence on the S&P 500 because they're the biggest, and the index gives more weight to stocks based on their size. Nearly half the stocks in the S&P 500 are down for the year so far.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, fell to 3.71 percent. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, fell to 4.53 percent.

He's Running for President. Even Backers Are Baffled.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Gov. Doug Burgum's quixotic presidential campaign has baffled even North Dakotans, but then again, many of the 2024 hopefuls have prompted the same wonder.
With Gov. Doug Burgum's money and his family's vision, Fargo, N.D., has undoubtedly changed in recent decades. Broadway, its main drag, is packed with restaurants, cafes, retailers and offices lovingly converted from old factories.
Parking lots have been turned into public parks. A warehouse saved from the wrecking ball now houses North Dakota State University's architecture and arts program. With a population of nearly 127,000 -- 16 percent of North Dakota's total population -- the largest city for hundreds of miles is growing, in size and diversity, with a liberal tilt.
But as a base for a presidential run, Fargo is still the smallest of towns, closer to Winnipeg, in Canada, than to Minneapolis, the nearest American metropolis. The hamlet of Arthur, where Mr. Burgum grew up and where his family's prosperous, century-old grain elevator dominates the flat landscape, is still more removed from the nation's political currents. Even North Dakotans who express admiration for their governor's wealth, business acumen and energy are baffled by his suddenly lofty political ambitions.
"He's a long shot, for sure," said Brad Moen, 69, of Jamestown, N.D., who has known Mr. Burgum for 60 years and traveled 100 miles for his presidential introduction on Wednesday. "California, New York, Ohio, Florida -- they're the big dogs, not North Dakota."
Of course Mr. Burgum has a plan for winning the Republican nomination: eschewing the culture wars and getting the party back on a business-friendly economic message of low taxes, less regulation and can-do entrepreneurship.
But first he'll face the other new entrants in a G.O.P. field that as of this week seems largely set.
Former Vice President Mike Pence has piety and consistent conservatism to remind evangelical Christians of what brought them to politics in the first place. Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, has his tell-it-like-it-is pugilism, as the only candidate willing to take on Donald J. Trump. Tim Scott, the senator from South Carolina, has hope and optimism. Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor, has Trumpism without Trump.
Yet all these options seem to have done nothing but carve up the Republican primary electorate that is not with Mr. Trump into ever more slender slivers -- leaving the former president's inviolable piece of the pie looking larger and larger with every new candidate.
That has North Dakotans asking the same question that many other Americans are: What do these candidates really want -- a cabinet post in a second Trump administration, a higher national profile for a future presidential bid, a vanity project after a long career? Mr. Pence is seen by many Republican voters as the ultimate traitor, the man they wrongly believe could have given Mr. Trump a victory in 2020 and declined. Mr. Christie is viewed with hostility by many Republicans because of his outspoken contempt for Mr. Trump -- and with suspicion by anti-Trump Republicans because of his loyalty to him until now.
As for Mr. Burgum, who knows?
"I think that he is genuinely thinking this is a vehicle for promoting North Dakota," Dustin Gawrylow, a conservative political commentator and activist in the state, said of Mr. Burgum. Or, he suggested, "he may have his eye on a cabinet position."
Tony S. Grindberg, a utility executive and former state senator, was at Mr. Burgum's rally on Wednesday working through how the governor could pursue his quixotic presidential run and prepare to seek a third term in Bismarck.
"Technically, he can," he concluded, hopefully.
Mr. Burgum's path to the White House seems particularly forbidding. His story is out of central casting: the son of a tiny town who as a teenager lost his father, and then channeled a natural entrepreneurial spirit into enterprises that included chimney sweeping, a business software empire and venture capital -- all within the state lines of North Dakota.
Mr. Burgum's status as a billionaire traces back to Microsoft, which bought his company, Great Plains Software, in 2001 in a $ 1.1 billion stock deal that made him one of the richest men in the Dakotas. All that money will give him staying power in the race, but it cannot get him the 40,000 individual donors or the 1 percent in the polls that he needs to qualify for the Republican debate stage. It won't make him a household name, and among some of the Republican faithful, it could conjure feverish images of Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder who features in many of the most outlandish far-right conspiracy theories.
Even North Dakotans are not sure what to make of their governor. They can squint to see the politician they want to see.
Jonathan Melgaard, 29, sees Mr. Burgum as the essence of nonpartisan leadership, an effective entrepreneur and bridge builder inspiring enough to lure him back from Colorado, where he worked for the Aspen Institute to help build a progressive, forward-looking Fargo. To voters like Mr. Melgaard, Mr. Burgum is the investor who promised to make oil-rich North Dakota "carbon neutral," in part by backing an ambitious pipeline to bring carbon dioxide produced as an unwanted byproduct of ethanol from around the Midwest to the absorbent 300-foot-thick Broom Creek sandstone 7,000 feet under North Dakota's surface.
"I am not a Republican," Mr. Melgaard said. "I do not subscribe to conservative governance. I do subscribe to effective governance."
Mr. Moen waved off all that talk of carbon capture and electric vehicles and latched on to Mr. Burgum's promise to bolster the state's abundant traditional energy sources, oil and coal.
Outside Mr. Burgum's event, Shelly Reilly, 59, joined a small group of protesters determined to discount the governor's nonpartisan business pitch and emphasize the bills he has actually signed, which banned gender transition care for minors, abortion and the discussion of L.G.B.T.Q. issues in elementary schools.
"I know people who have left because of him," she said. "They're leaving in droves."
Even Mr. Burgum doesn't seem to know quite what to do with his record. He ran on innovation, vowing to diversify the state's economy beyond agriculture and oil by expanding the technology sector and appealing to educated professionals with distance learning and thriving cities.
Fargo shows that promise, but social policy will be Mr. Burgum's legacy. In a recent interview with Joel Heitkamp, a popular radio host and the brother of former Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat, Mr. Burgum acknowledged that the six-week exception for rape and incest in the new abortion ban would be so short that a woman might not know in time whether she was pregnant, but he said that if he had vetoed it, the legislature would have overridden him. He said the same thing about the anti-L.G.B.T.Q. rights bills, even as he insisted most of them codified what was happening in the state anyway.
"He was the most exciting person to become governor in my lifetime," said Earl Pomeroy, a Democrat who was North Dakota's at-large House member for 18 years before the rising tide of Republicanism swept him out. He voted for Mr. Burgum, Mr. Pomeroy said, "but it's been years of unspectacular leadership out of the governor's office." He added, "He's been somewhat captive to the crazy legislature."
The governorship was Mr. Burgum's first elective office. He spent freely to win his race in 2016 and then spent freely to bolster his support.
In 2020, Mr. Burgum clashed with the state House Appropriations Committee chairman, Jeff Delzer, especially over the governor's prized project, a new Theodore Roosevelt presidential library near the Burgum ranch in Medora, N.D. After the conflict, Mr. Burgum funded a primary challenger running as a "Trump Republican" against Mr. Delzer.
The challenger, David Andahl, died of Covid-19 before his name could be taken off the ballot -- and won. Then local officials reappointed Mr. Delzer to the seat.
The carbon dioxide pipeline, bankrolled by the oil and gas billionaire Harold Hamm, has angered activists on the right and the left.
Yet Mr. Burgum's rally on Wednesday was packed with past and present elected officials.
"There are a lot of legislators that outright fear what Doug Burgum will do to them," Mr. Gawrylow said. "Burgum has shown he is not afraid to put his money where his mouth is, and that is scary."
Mr. Heitkamp takes Mr. Burgum's presidential ambitions at face value. He acknowledged the rampant speculation that the governor doesn't actually believe he can beat Mr. Trump to the nomination and then secure the White House. But Mr. Heitkamp thinks Mr. Burgum is a believer.
"He's a nerd, and he looks in the mirror and sees something that others don't," Mr. Heitkamp, a former Democratic state senator, said. "When he shaves in the morning, he sees a president."

He envisioned AI assistants that help people “create content to express yourself and your ideas so much better,” or perhaps some artificially intelligent version of “a coach that gives you advice, encourages you.”
AI agents could serve customers in products like WhatsApp, the globally popular messaging app that Meta has been focused on turning into an important tool for business owners and customer service. And every business could use a personalized AI algorithm.
“Different people have different interests, and we’ll need a diverse array of AIs to represent all of these different interests,” Zuckerberg said in the meeting.
To do that, the company is betting heavily on open source technology, which means it will share its work on artificial intelligence with researchers who want to build their own algorithms with what Meta has already done. The company has spent billions over the past decade building systems to run AI and attracting top researchers to work on some of the world’s most difficult computer science questions around AI.
Meta has been criticized for its approach. Researchers and politicians outside the company say opening AI algorithms to many others could spawn malicious, automated and intelligent systems that accelerate the spread of misinformation. Those sophisticated algorithms, critics say, need to be tightly controlled.
In his address, Zuckerberg defended Meta’s strategy. He said open-source software enables greater outside scrutiny of the technology because it can be seen by millions of technologists. He said working closely with outsiders’ advances would make Meta’s platforms better.
Zuckerberg also said he hoped for a world where people could build as many different AI programs as they wanted, rather than relying on a few provided by two or three large technology companies.
That does not mean Meta is backing away from its namesake metaverse plans, Zuckerberg said. Programs using new generative AI technology, he said, could eventually help people build new virtual world items and experiences. And he said the company planned to bring its AI assistant into the next version of its smart glasses. (Meta released a pair of smart Ray-Ban glasses in 2021, though sales have been sluggish.)
He also took a swipe at Apple’s recently announced Vision Pro headset, $3,500 high-tech goggles that promised to usher in a new era of “spatial computing.”
“I was really curious to see what they’d ship, and it’s a good sign for our own development that they don’t have any magical solutions to the laws of physics that we haven’t already explored,” he said in his remarks. Zuckerberg criticized the high-end materials and cost of the device, while noting that Meta had spent years bringing down the price of its headsets to an upcoming version that will start at $500.
“Their announcement really shows how our vision and values are different and what’s at stake in shaping this platform,” Zuckerberg said. “Our vision of the metaverse and presence is fundamentally social and about people interacting and feeling closer in new amazing ways. By contrast, every demo Apple showed was someone sitting on a couch by themselves.”

Hey, Alexa, What Should Students Learn About AI?

BOSTON — Rohit Prasad, a senior Amazon executive, had an urgent message for ninth and 10th graders at Dearborn STEM Academy, a public school in Boston’s Roxbury neighborhood.
He had come to the school on a recent morning to observe an Amazon-sponsored lesson in artificial intelligence that teaches students how to program simple tasks for Alexa, Amazon’s voice-activated virtual assistant. And he assured the Dearborn students there would soon be millions of new jobs in AI.
"We need to create the talent for the next generation,” Prasad, the head scientist for Alexa, told the class. “So we are educating about AI at the earliest, grassroots level.”
A few miles away, Sally Kornbluth, president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was delivering a more sobering message about AI to students from local schools who had gathered at Boston’s Kennedy Library complex for a workshop on AI risks and regulation.
“Because AI is such a powerful new technology, in order for it to work well in society, it really needs some rules,” Kornbluth said. “We have to make sure that what it doesn’t do is cause harm.”
The same-day events — one encouraging work in artificial intelligence and the other cautioning against deploying the technology too hastily — mirrored the larger debate currently raging in the United States over the promise and potential peril of AI.
Both student workshops were organized by an MIT initiative on “responsible AI” whose donors include Amazon, Google and Microsoft. And they underscored a question that has vexed school districts across the nation this year: How should schools prepare students to navigate a world in which, according to some prominent AI developers, the ascendancy of AI-powered tools seems all but inevitable?
Teaching AI in schools is not new. Courses like computer science and civics now regularly include exercises on the societal impacts of facial recognition and other automated systems.
But the push for AI education took on more urgency this year after news about ChatGPT — a novel chatbot that can create humanlike homework essays and sometimes manufactures misinformation — began spreading in schools.
Now, “AI literacy” is a new education buzz phrase. Schools are scrambling for resources to help teach it. Some universities, tech companies and nonprofits are responding with ready-made curricula.
The lessons are proliferating even as schools are wrestling with a fundamental question: Should they teach students to program and use AI tools, providing training in tech skills employers seek? Or should students learn to anticipate and mitigate AI harms?
Cynthia Breazeal, a professor at MIT who directs the university’s initiative on Responsible AI for Social Empowerment and Education, said her program aimed to help schools do both.
“We want students to be informed, responsible users and informed, responsible designers of these technologies,” said Breazeal, whose group organized the AI workshops for schools. “We want to make them informed, responsible citizens about these rapid developments in AI and the many ways they are influencing our personal and professional lives.”
Other education experts say schools should also encourage students to consider the broader ecosystems in which AI systems operate. That might include students researching the business models behind new technologies or examining how AI tools exploit user data.
“If we are engaging students in learning about these new systems, we really have to think about the context surrounding these new systems,” said Jennifer Higgs, an assistant professor of learning and mind sciences at the University of California, Davis. But often, she noted, “that piece is still missing.”
The workshops in Boston were part of a “Day of AI” event organized by Breazeal’s program, which drew several thousands students worldwide. It offered a glimpse of the varied approaches that schools are taking to AI education.
At Dearborn STEM, Hilah Barbot, a senior product manager at Amazon Future Engineer, the company’s computer science education program, led a lesson in voice AI for students. The lessons were developed by MIT with the Amazon program, which provides coding curricula and other programs for K-12 schools. The company provided more than $2 million in grants to MIT for the project.
First, Barbot explained some voice AI lingo. She taught students about “utterances,” the phrases that consumers might say to prompt Alexa to respond.
Then students programmed simple tasks for Alexa, like telling jokes. Jada Reed, a ninth grader, programmed Alexa to respond to questions about Japanese manga characters. “I think it’s really cool you can train it to do different things,” she said.
Breazeal said it was important for students to have access to professional software tools from leading tech companies. “We’re giving them future-proof skills and perspectives of how they can work with AI to do things they care about,” she said.
Some Dearborn students, who had already built and programmed robots in school, said they appreciated learning how to code a different technology: voice-activated helpbots. Alexa uses a range of AI techniques, including automatic speech recognition.
At least a few students also said they had privacy and other concerns about AI-assisted tools.
Amazon records consumers’ conversations with its Echo speakers after a person says a “wake word” like “Alexa.” Unless users opt out, Amazon may use their interactions with Alexa to target them with ads or use their voice recordings to train its AI models. Last week, Amazon agreed to pay $25 million to settle federal charges that it had indefinitely kept children’s voice recordings, violating the federal online children’s privacy law. The company said it disputed the charges and denied that it had violated the law. The company noted that customers could review and delete their Alexa voice recordings.
But the one-hour Amazon-led workshop did not touch on the company’s data practices.
Dearborn STEM students regularly scrutinize technology. Several years ago, the school introduced a course in which students used AI tools to create deepfake videos — that is, false content — of themselves and examine the consequences. And the students had thoughts on the virtual assistant they were learning to program that morning.
“Did you know there’s a conspiracy theory that Alexa listens to your conversations to show you ads?” a ninth grader named Eboni Maxwell asked.
“I’m not afraid of it listening,” Laniya Sanders, another ninth grader, replied. Even so, Sanders said she avoided using voice assistants because “I just want to do it myself.”
A few miles away at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, an education center that houses a full-scale replica of the U.S. Senate chamber, dozens of students from Warren Prescott School in Charlestown, Massachusetts, were exploring a different topic: AI policy and safety regulations.
Playing the role of senators from different states, the middle school students participated in a mock hearing in which they debated provisions for a hypothetical AI safety bill.
Some students wanted to ban companies and police departments from using AI to target people based on data like their race or ethnicity. Others wanted to require schools and hospitals to assess the fairness of AI systems before deploying them.
The exercise was not unfamiliar for the middle school students. Nancy Arsenault, an English and civics teacher at Warren Prescott, said she often asked her students to consider how digital tools affected them and the people they care about.
“As much as students love tech, they are keenly aware that unfettered AI is not something they want,” she said. “They want to see limits.”

Losses in Tech Stocks Overshadow Gains: [List]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/losses-tech-stocks-overshadow-gains/docview/2823392908/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: U.S. stocks drifted to a mixed finish Wednesday, as drops for Microsoft and other big-name tech stocks overshadowed gains across much of the rest of Wall Street.
The Standard & Poors 500- stock index fell 16.33, or 0.4 percent, to 4,267.52 even though the majority of stocks within the index rose. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 91.74, or 0.3 percent, to 33,665.02, while the Nasdaq composite fell 171.52, or 1.3 percent, to 13,104.89.
Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and Alphabet all sank at least 3 percent and were the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. Because they're some of Wall Street's most valuable stocks, their movements pack extra punch on the index.
It's a reversal from much of this year, where a narrow group of high-growth stocks led the way on hopes for easier interest rates from the Federal Reserve and excitement around artificial intelligence. But tech stocks are seen as some of the hardest hit by higher interest rates, and yields were on the rise in the Treasury market.
Yields climbed after the Bank of Canada raised its policy interest rates on Wednesday, surprising some investors after it had left rates steady since January. The Fed will make its own decision on rates next week.
Campbell Soup, meanwhile, sank 8.9 percent after reporting weaker revenue for the latest quarter than expected. It also gave a forecast for earnings that fell short of analysts' expectations, as price increases push some customers to buy less.
But much of the rest of the market rose as the gains on Wall Street broaden out some. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks jumped 1.8 percent to continue its hot streak since a stronger-than-expected report on hiring last week suggested a recession may be further off than feared.
On the winning side of Wall Street was Dave & Buster's, which jumped 18.3 percent after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than expected.
Brown-Forman rose 4 percent after the spirits company reported stronger profit than expected for the latest quarter, thanks in part to growth for its Woodford Reserve brand.
The market in general has climbed for months thanks to a resilient economy that's managed to defy predictions for a recession. But the threat still looms, and Wall Street is questioning which will come first: a recession or inflation falling enough to get the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates?
That's why much of Wall Street's focus is on next week. The U.S. government is scheduled to release the monthly updates on inflation at the consumer and wholesale levels. The Federal Reserve will also announce its latest move on interest rates Thursday.
The dominant expectation among traders is for the Fed to leave rates steady next week.
That's key because the goal of high interest rates is to corral high inflation by slowing the entire economy and hurting prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. The Fed has hiked its benchmark overnight interest rate to the highest level since 2007.
Pressure from high rates have already caused cracks in the U.S. banking and manufacturing industries, though the job market has remained remarkably solid.
One expected boost to the global economy has not come through, which has added to the pressure. In China, trade data pointed to a further slowing of the world's second-largest economy.
China reported its exports fell 7.5 percent from a year earlier in May and imports were down 4.5 percent, adding to signs of a slowing of its economic recovery.
In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.78 percent from 3.68 percent late Tuesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, rose to 4.55 percent from 4.50 percent.

North Dakota Governor Joins Growing '24 Race: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As the leader of a deep-red state, Mr. Burgum has promoted staunchly conservative policies, signing into law a near-total ban on abortion.
Gov. Doug Burgum, the Republican governor of North Dakota, former software executive and billionaire, announced on Wednesday he would run for president on his economic record, entering an increasingly crowded race as the stolid candidate of business and technology.
"If you want more small-town common sense in Washington and our big cities, we'll make that happen," Mr. Burgum told the crowd at a rally in Fargo, N.D. "We need the governor and business leader who understands this changing economy. I want to earn your vote." He acknowledged the ground he would need to make up to gain his party's presidential nomination but said he had been underestimated before.
The size of the field signals that former President Donald J. Trump, the Republican front-runner, has not scared off many challengers. But he has also yet to fully consolidate support behind his candidacy, and numerous rivals apparently see a path to the nomination, no matter how narrow it might be.
As the leader of his deep-red state, Mr. Burgum has overseen a period of significant economic expansion, but he has also assented to staunchly conservative social policies, even as he has downplayed his role in them.
This year, Mr. Burgum signed into law a near-total ban on abortion and created significant restrictions on gender transition care, including banning any requirements that teachers or school administrators use a student's preferred pronouns.
Such social policies were nowhere to be found in his campaign launch, which largely eschewed partisan appeals to a conservative base and focused on three issues: the economy, energy and national security. Workmanlike in his delivery, with eyes glued on the teleprompters, Mr. Burgum may not look like a political natural, but his hope is that Republican voters will want a solid technician to return the party to its low-tax, deregulatory entrepreneurial roots.
Outside the converted Lutheran church where his rally was held, a clutch of protesters appeared determined not to let him run away from his more recent record. Cody J. Schuler, an advocacy manager at the North Dakota American Civil Liberties Union, acknowledged that as a business leader, Mr. Burgum embraced L.G.B.T.Q. rights as good for all citizens and good for business.
But in signing the bills passed by the conservative North Dakota legislature, Mr. Schuler said, the governor "threw away the lives of North Dakota citizens for his presidential aspirations."
Even Mr. Burgum's most ardent supporters at the rally expressed doubts that the governor of a state of 775,000 could qualify for the all-important primary debates, a bar that now requires 40,000 unique donors and 1 percent in national Republican polls.
"He'll have the resources to be competitive," said Tony Grindberg, a senior manager at North Dakota's electric company who previously served in the State Legislature. "The question is, can he connect with the rest of country? That will be fun to watch as a North Dakotan."
Mr. Burgum is the second sitting governor to enter the race, after Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who has staked out aggressively conservative social policy positions and attracted the national spotlight for dust-ups with major corporations like Disney.
Yet Mr. Burgum's aides say he is planning a campaign less focused on social issues and more on his business background and fiscal stewardship of the state, which included cuts to both local property taxes and state income taxes.
At his launch, he never mentioned transgender issues or abortion, and put himself forward as a unifying voice -- "a smart guy who has achieved a lot," as his campaign video put it.
"In a country built on neighbors helping neighbors, we've become a country of neighbors fighting neighbors," he said. "We should all be fighting to unite the country."
Though his national media appearances have been scarce, Mr. Burgum has been able to break through during debates over energy policy, offering a window into how he might frame his proposals in contrast to those of Republican rivals and of President Biden. In March, he told Fox News that the Biden administration's economic plan was "disconnected from economics, it's disconnected from physics and it's disconnected from common sense." He argued that Japan and other Asian countries were ripe markets for American energy exports.
His campaign's confidence that he can rise from a relative unknown to legitimate candidate derives from his own political career in North Dakota. When Mr. Burgum announced his bid for governor in 2016, he was an outsider with little name recognition outside Fargo, and his main opponent, Wayne Stenehjem, the state attorney general, received the North Dakota Republican Party's endorsement.
But with ample resources and a campaign that ran to the right -- Mr. Burgum endorsed Donald J. Trump for president in May 2016 -- he cruised to a 20-percentage-point victory that The Bismarck Tribune proclaimed "upended the North Dakota Republican Party establishment." He has not been seriously challenged in North Dakota since.
"There's a value to being underestimated all the time," Mr. Burgum told The Fargo Forum. "That's a competitive advantage."
As one of few major candidates not from the East Coast, and with an upbringing deeply rooted in the rural Midwest, Mr. Burgum is likely to focus most of his efforts in Iowa, a state with an extensive agricultural community. Mr. Burgum grew up in Arthur, N.D., a town of barely 300 where his family owned the grain elevator that still dominates the tiny farming community.
While attending North Dakota State University as an undergraduate, Mr. Burgum began a chimney sweeping service in Fargo out of a friend's pickup truck. His newfound business attracted the attention of local newspapers, who ran photos of a soot-laden Mr. Burgum clad in a tuxedo hopping from roof to roof, picking up roughly $ 40 per chimney.
Mr. Burgum attached those newspaper clips to his applications for business school, and he soon enrolled in Stanford Business School. After earning his M.B.A. at Stanford, Mr. Burgum joined Great Plains Software, a Fargo company that specialized in accounting software, and quickly rose to chief executive.
Far from the more fertile tech hubs of Silicon Valley, Mr. Burgum built Great Plains Software into a major industry player, eventually selling to Microsoft for $ 1.1 billion. He would then serve as a senior vice president at Microsoft until 2007.
Mr. Burgum's worth stretches into nine figures, certainly enough to help finance a nascent presidential run, and his aides expect his business network to help pull in major donors as well. But as of the start of his campaign, no super PAC or outside group has emerged supporting Mr. Burgum's candidacy.

Apple's $3,500 Headset Mixes Real With Virtual: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The device, called Vision Pro and shaped like a pair of ski goggles, faces a skeptical consumer market and competition from others, like fellow tech giant Meta.
Apple lived up to months of expectations on Monday when it introduced new high-tech goggles that blend the real world with virtual reality. The $ 3,500 device, called the Vision Pro, will offer "augmented reality" and introduce "spatial computing," Apple said.
But conspicuously absent from the company's carefully choreographed announcement were the words "virtual reality," underscoring the challenges the tech giant is likely to face in marketing the device to a mass audience.
Interest in virtual reality picked up briefly after the idea of the metaverse -- an immersive online world popularized by science fiction -- was introduced to mainstream audiences during the pandemic. But the concept lost steam as people returned to their prepandemic lives, investors pivoted to artificial intelligence and it became clear how much technological innovation would be required to achieve such a futuristic vision.
Past virtual reality offerings, including Google Glass, Magic Leap, Microsoft's HoloLens and Meta's Quest Pro, have been either commercial failures or only modest successes. And companies have so far failed to demonstrate what is indispensable about virtual reality.
Analysts do not anticipate the Vision Pro, which will be available early next year, to have significant mainstream appeal -- at least at first. The $ 3,500 price could dissuade many consumers.
Carolina Milanesi, a consumer tech analyst for the research firm Creative Strategies, said she did not think the headset "is going to be for mass-market consumers." Instead, she said, "it will be for early adopters -- where Apple most often starts -- and developers."
If the device lacks broad appeal, it could still be a useful trial run for Apple, which could eventually create a virtual reality product aimed at a wider group of consumers, like a lightweight pair of glasses.
"I don't think Apple has super-huge expectations," said Jeff Fieldhack, a research director at Counterpoint Research. "They know this is an evolution that's going to take some time."
Apple could also vault to the forefront of the XR market -- a term for extended reality, similar to virtual reality, Mr. Fieldhack said.
"I'm sure it will be seen as the best, best in class," he said. "This is going to be extraordinary improvements in the display quality, resolution, refresh rates, probably the lightness, feel -- all the things that are the hiccups of XR to date, a lot of them are going to be addressed."
The likely challenges that the Vision Pro will face on the market did not squelch the enthusiasm of thousands of attendees of Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference Monday. At the company's spaceship-shaped headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., they cheered and whooped as Apple executives discussed the device's features.
In a mostly prerecorded presentation that lasted more than two hours and touched on an array of other products, Apple repeatedly said using the new VR goggles felt like "magic."
"There are certain products that shift the way we look at technology and the role it plays in our lives," said Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive. "We believe Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary product."
The headset, which looks like a pair of ski goggles, will have a three-dimensional interface in which users can view their surroundings and virtual reality at the same time, or toggle between the two to emphasize one mode or block it out entirely. It will feature the same kinds of applications, like FaceTime and Safari, as other Apple devices, with screens hovering in the air in front of users' faces and growing larger or smaller at will. A wire attached to the headset plugs into a battery pack, providing two hours of battery life.
The company said people could unlock the device by scanning their eyes. Customers will use their eyes, voice and fingers to move displays and open apps, without any additional hardware. Apple said the Vision Pro would be a useful tool for work and entertainment, with a powerful sound and visual system akin to a personalized movie theater.
Some have speculated that the Vision Pro could build off Apple's growing content portfolio and feature exclusive content, like movies, games or television shows. In a brief appearance, Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, did not promise anything other than making Disney+ available on the Vision Pro when it launches.
Apple also announced a series of other updates and new products, like a 15-inch MacBook Air laptop and improved computer chips for its desktop computers. The company introduced updated operating systems for its computers, AirPods, watches and iPhones, with features like a Journal app, FaceTime video messages and a standby mode with a larger clock on a phone's home screen.
Largely absent from the event were mentions of artificial intelligence. Apple debuted improvements to its Siri voice command system -- like the ability for it to recognize family pets in clusters of photos -- as well as a better autocorrect texting function and live transcriptions of voice mail.
But unlike other big tech companies, Apple avoided an in-depth discussion of what A.I. will mean to the company.

Bear Market Nears an End As Bulls Lurk: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The S&P 500 ended the day nearly 20 percent above its low last year, within a hair of a milestone for some market watchers. But assessing a bona fide bull market is not so simple.
The S&P 500, the index obsessed over by investors, executives and government officials, on Monday came close to finishing 20 percent above its lowest level of 2022, a gain that some on Wall Street see as the start of a bull market and a new phase of investing exuberance.
The index fluctuated around the threshold on Monday, moving above it multiple times, before ending 0.2 percent lower for the day, which put it at 19.5 percent above its October low.
Still, the move underscores the strong recovery in the stock market since fears of high inflation, rising interest rates and a looming recession had steadily pushed the index down from its peak in early 2022. The S&P 500 fell into a bear market -- which is defined as a decline of 20 percent or more from an index's high -- in June of that year, and continued to slide until hitting a low in October.
The terms "bull" and "bear" are shorthand for excitement or fear among investors about the prospects for public companies. But while investors tend to agree on how to mark the start of a bear market, there's less consensus on how to define the start of a bull market, especially when the concerns that initially dragged stocks lower still linger.
One rule of thumb is that a new bull market is confirmed when an index sets a new high after rising from a bear-market low. By that measure, the S&P 500 is still more than 10 percent short.
But some investors say it's simpler to look at any gain of 20 percent or more in a broad-based index like the S&P 500 as an important milestone, with the measurement taken at the end of the trading day. More than $ 15 trillion in investment assets are benchmarked or indexed to the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the index.
"We're not in a horrible spot," said James Masserio, co-head of equities for the Americas at Société Générale. "There are recession risks for sure, but we have to see how those materialize over several months and into next year. So technically this is a bull market."
Still, a rise of 20 percent from a low is, mathematically, less substantial than a fall of 20 percent from a high. Other investors prefer an assessment that involves a wider look at investor sentiment, economic growth and the market's direction.
"If a stock goes from $ 10 to $ 5 and then rallies to $ 6, it's not in a new bull market," said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. "Defining a bull or bear market, however it's done, should be done via a broad look at the market."
The recent rally in the S&P 500 has been led by a small group of tech stocks propelled by enthusiasm about the profit-generating possibilities of artificial intelligence, especially for those at the heart of its development and the production of hardware needed to power it. Nvidia, the chip maker, has come to symbolize this newfound enthusiasm for A.I. because its semiconductors are used in the technology. The company has rallied almost 170 percent this year -- gains that have brought its valuation close to $ 1 trillion.
The average individual stock in the S&P 500 has risen less than 3 percent this year, market data through Friday's close shows, compared with a gain of over 11 percent for the index as a whole. Some 90 percent of the index's rise is due to bumper gains for just seven of the biggest companies: Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.
Apple rose 2.2 percent by early afternoon on Monday, briefly marking a new high for the company, before sliding to end 0.8 percent lower, weighing on the index.
The S&P 500 also tracks only the largest companies listed in the United States. Smaller companies are generally more exposed to fluctuations in the U.S. economy, because larger firms generate a sizable share of revenue overseas.
The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller public companies, has recently recorded more modest gains than its big-company counterpart. The index fell over 30 percent from its peak in November 2021 to its low last June. Since then, the index has risen about 9 percent. On Monday, the index fell 1.3 percent after weaker-than-expected economic data on the services sector.
In contrast, the Nasdaq Composite index, which is heavily weighted toward big tech companies, has risen more than 26 percent this year alone. Yet it remains almost 20 percent below its previous peak, hit in late 2021.
"I think the 20 percent rule has been an easy one for folks to follow," said Sameer Samana, a senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "Unfortunately, some of these bear-market rallies are triggering that threshold, which we view as a false signal."
For many investors, the bumper returns in the stock market haven't been reflected in their portfolios' performance. That's because with so much concern about a possible recession, fund managers are largely holding more cash and hedging their holdings against the risk of a precipitous fall, forgoing gains in favor of greater safety.
Just over 27 percent of funds tracked by Morningstar that are benchmarked to the S&P 500 are beating the index this year, compared with almost 52 percent last year and an average of 40 percent since 2000.
Hedge funds and other leveraged investors especially have built up big bets on the S&P 500 falling, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
"Everyone has been so defensive," said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. "There is a lot of cash on the sidelines, and so this is actually quite painful for a lot of fund managers."

New Questions About Liability for Artificial Intelligence Creations: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Tools like ChatGPT could open a new line of questions around tech products and harmful content.
A string of challenges to Section 230 -- the law that shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content -- have failed over the last several weeks. Most recently, the Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to review a suit about exploitative content on Reddit. But the debate over what responsibility tech companies have for harmful content is far from settled -- and generative artificial intelligence tools like the ChatGPT chatbot could open a new line of questions.
Does Section 230 apply to generative A.I.? The law's 1996 drafters told DealBook that it does not. "We set out to protect hosting," said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. Platforms are immune only to suits about material created by others, not their own work. "If you are partly complicit in content creation, you don't get the shield," agreed Chris Cox, a former Republican representative from California. But they admit that these distinctions, which once seemed simple, are already becoming more difficult to make.
What about A.I. search engines? Typically, search engines are considered vehicles for information rather than content creators, and search companies have benefited from Section 230 protection. Chatbots generate content, and they are most likely beyond protection. But tech giants like Microsoft and Google are integrating chat and search, complicating matters. "If some search engines start to look more like chat output, the lines will be blurred," Wyden said.
A deadly recipe? Generative A.I. tools have already been used to make intentionally harmful content. And hallucinations -- the falsehoods that generative A.I. tools create (like court cases that never existed) -- are a significant problem. If a user prompts an A.I. for cocktail instructions and it offers a poisonous concoction, the algorithm operator's liability is obvious, said Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University and a Section 230 expert.
But most situations won't be that clear-cut, and that poses a risk, Goldman said. He fears that anger over immunity for social media platforms threatens nuanced debate about the next generation of tech development.
"The blossoming of A.I. comes at one of the most precarious times amid a maturing tech backlash," Goldman said. "We need some kind of immunity for people who make the tools," he added. "Without it, we're never going to see the full potential of A.I." -- Ephrat Livni
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Elon Musk receives a hero's welcome in China. The Tesla chief was hailed on Chinese social media as a "global idol" during his visit this week to the country, where he met with government ministers and visited the Tesla's Shanghai factory. Musk reportedly also had kind words for his hosts: Government readouts of his meetings with Beijing ministers said he had described the U.S. and Chinese economies as "conjoined twins" and opposed political efforts to decouple them.
Billy Joel is movin' out (of Madison Square Garden). The singer announced this week that he will finish a 10-year stay at Madison Square Garden in July 2024. The series of more than 100 shows crossed its $ 200 million threshold in March. James Dolan, the C.E.O of the Garden's parent company, said the run had "made history" for both the venue and the music industry. Or, perhaps more simply: Joel was a big shot.
"Ketatations" in the workplace. Some executives have embraced the anesthetic ketamine to improve professional performance or foster team bonding. "We put them on yoga mats in the room, we have a prescription from a doctor, and we have a 45-minute experience together," Kaia Roman, who has led "ketatations" (ketamine + meditation) since the pandemic, told Bloomberg. Others prefer a more aggressive way to relax: Mark Zuckerberg recently completed "the Murph Challenge," which consists of a mile run, 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups, 300 squats and another mile run -- all while wearing a 20-pound vest. He said he had done it in 40 minutes.
Matter of debate: 'greedflation'
General inflation slowed for the 10th straight month in April, but many companies are still raising prices. Why? Some economists blame "greedflation," "excuseflation" or a "price-price spiral," whereby businesses use inflationary events like the pandemic, the Ukraine war and soaring energy prices as an excuse to make big price increases that more than cover their higher costs. The idea is that customers are more accepting of price increases when they know inflation is historically high, so companies are taking the opportunity to raise prices as much as they can. But not everyone is convinced, and some point to a host of other postpandemic economic trends as the real culprit. Here are two views.
Greedflation is to blame. Despite expectations that net profit margins would decline this year, they have increased at the average company in the S&P 500, according to data from FactSet.
"What we see in many cases is that volumes are going down, while prices are going up and profit margins are going up," said Isabella Weber, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who pioneered the theory.
She pointed to Starbucks as an extreme example of what she calls "sellers' inflation." In 2020, when the pandemic shut down demand for coffee shops, basic supply-and-demand laws suggested that Starbucks would lower the price of coffee to entice people back to its stores. Instead, Weber said, "prices actually were going up."
Last month, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City said corporate profits had contributed to inflation in 2021, though their contribution fell in 2022, which is consistent with what happened in previous economic recoveries.
Greedflation is not to blame. Customers who benefited from stimulus checks, low interest rates, investment gains and other factors were in a good financial position coming out of the pandemic. Their willingness to spend more is what's mostly fueling inflation, some analysts say.
"It seems to me that many telling the profit story forget that households have to actually spend money for the story to hold," David Beckworth, a senior research fellow at the right-leaning Mercatus Center at George Mason University and a former economist for the Treasury Department, told The Times this week. "And once you look at the huge surge in spending, it becomes inescapable to me where the causality lies."
In any case, conditions for greedflation could be waning. Supply chain disruptions and other inflationary pressures are easing, making it harder for companies to blame inflation elsewhere for raising prices. "Some firms are claiming 'general inflation pressures' as being behind their price increases," said Paul Donovan, the chief economist at UBS, "but that is far less convincing, and consumers are less willing to accept it."
Weber warns, however, that another inflation-causing crisis could pop up at any time, and "firms have now learned this playbook."
The Ted Lasso way
"Ted Lasso," the saccharine story of an apparently clueless American who is appointed to run a British soccer team, ended this week. And while Lasso's journey from barely knowing the rules to turning a group of misfits into a top team is not particularly realistic, management experts say some of his coaching strategies really are.
DealBook has picked out four management lessons from the fictional coach from Kansas that might apply to the real world. Warning: They contain spoilers.
The outsider sees things that others do not. Lasso is initially portrayed as a naïve bumpkin with little understanding of the sport, his team or the country he's living in. But that is the foundation of his success, said Allyson Stewart-Allen, C.E.O. of International Marketing Partners and an expert on cross-cultural management. "He brings a lack of self-consciousness in wanting to ask questions others might think are facile," she told DealBook, adding that her American clients who are expanding in Europe do exactly what Lasso does. "Ask lots of questions, be open to new ideas, and experiment."
Culture trumps strategy. Any team that is on the same wavelength is obviously more likely to thrive, a view famously championed by management thinkers like Peter Drucker. Lasso's first task was to understand the culture of the organization he has taken over and then mold it in his image. Once he achieved this, he shifted to identifying the strengths and weaknesses of his players and coaches, and figuring out how to motivate them. That should be the goal of every good manager.
Serious strategic change takes time. Most executives, especially those who run public companies, are under immense pressure to deliver quickly. Sometimes that's justified, but sometimes boards can be too quick to change a C.E.O. without providing the necessary support. Lasso had three years with little real threat of being fired. That gave him time to understand the game (by the final episode, he had learned what the offside rule is), the culture of the club and how to make it all work. It was only midway through his last season that he discovered his sporting vision -- "total football" -- that he used to turn his team of losers into winners.
"Meaning matters more than means," Bruce Feiler, the author of "The Search: Finding Meaningful Work in a Post-Career World," told CNBC this week. Younger workers increasingly put a priority on work-life balance and personal fulfillment over money in their careers. On the show, Lasso himself best embodied that trait by walking away from the job after finishing second rather than sticking around and trying to win it all again. Even though he finally cracked the sport, he returned to Kansas to be closer to his family. "He shows vulnerability," Stewart-Allen said. "He cries. He has panic attacks. He's not perfect, and he doesn't try to hide that. I think that is very realistic and endearing and builds empathy with people."
Your thoughts on vacation
Last week, we wrote about a recent Pew survey that found almost half of Americans do not use all of their paid time off, and we asked you for your thoughts. A lot of you cited the same reasons as respondents to the survey for not using all of your time -- banking time to use in an emergency, fearing that taking vacation will make you vulnerable during a layoff or worrying that work will accumulate to stressful levels while you're away. We also heard from many readers who do use all of their paid time off. Here are a few of your reasons:
Quilvio wrote that he is in his early 20s, younger than most of his co-workers, and that "generationally, we have different mind-set around P.T.O. and work." He added, "I think as long as I'm getting the work done, the days (and hours) I work aren't as important."
Another reader, who asked not to be named, wrote that she used to work at a prestigious New York City law firm where most senior attorneys did not take all of their paid vacation days. Talking with them about their weekend leisure activities, she realized why: "It dawned on me (silly woman) -- they have WIVES AND SERVANTS who do all the nonwork work for them! So they have time and energy to unwind on both evenings AND weekends. They are not making calls to set up doctor appointments for their kids (or, likely, for themselves either), they are not making dinner after work every night, they do not attend P.T.A. meetings, they are not burdened with the zillion daily decisions and tasks of keeping a household going."
Stephanie, a director at a hospital, said she granted whatever time her employees needed. "It's a retention tool," she wrote. "We have a high-performing team. If I take care of my managers, they take care of their staff. The staff then are better able to care for their patients."

Maybe We Don't Need To Learn to Code: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I was 5 or 6 when I got my first sense of the joys of computer programming. This was in the early 1980s, when few people had a computer. One day, my dad brought home a Sinclair ZX Spectrum, one of the world's early affordable, mass-market PCs. The device looked like a chunky keyboard; it had 48 kilobytes of memory (my phone has about 125,000 times as much RAM); and it used your TV as a display. Software, mainly games, came on cassette tapes that you loaded into the computer with a connection to a tape player -- the floppy drive of its time.
But the games took forever to load, and while waiting I would often pore over the incredible programming manual that came with the Spectrum. The book was full of simple programs written in the accessible BASIC programming language. Most of it went over my head, but as I experimented with the examples, I began to feel the thrill that people who fall for computer programming often talk about -- the revelation that, with just the right set of incantations, you can summon to life these otherwise inert machines and get them to do your bidding.
My obsession with programming deepened when I got to high school (I was very popular!), and there were a few weeks early in college when I thought coding could be something I did for a living. Of course, I didn't stick with it; for me, writing words won out over writing code.
Though I did find it fascinating to learn to think the way computers do, there seemed to be something fundamentally backward about programming a computer that I just couldn't get over: Wasn't it odd that the machines needed us humans to learn their maddeningly precise secret languages to get the most out of them? If they're so smart, shouldn't they try to understand what we're saying, rather than us learning how to talk to them?
Now that may finally be happening. In a kind of poetic irony, software engineering is looking like one of the fields that could be most thoroughly altered by the rise of artificial intelligence. Over the next few years, A.I. could transform computer programming from a rarefied, highly compensated occupation into a widely accessible skill that people can easily pick up and use as part of their jobs across a wide variety of fields. This won't necessarily be terrible for computer programmers -- the world will still need people with advanced coding skills -- but it will be great for the rest of us. Computers that we can all "program," computers that don't require specialized training to adjust and improve their functionality and that don't speak in code: That future is rapidly becoming the present.
A.I. tools based on large language models -- like OpenAI Codex, from the company that brought you ChatGPT, or AlphaCode, from Google's DeepMind division -- have already begun to change the way many professional coders do their jobs. At the moment, these tools work mainly as assistants -- they can find bugs, write explanations for snippets of poorly documented code and offer suggestions for code to perform routine tasks (not unlike how Gmail offers ideas for email replies -- "Sounds good"; "Got it").
But A.I. coders are quickly getting smart enough to rival human coders. Last year, DeepMind reported in the journal Science that when AlphaCode's programs were evaluated against answers submitted by human participants in coding competitions, its performance "approximately corresponds to a novice programmer with a few months to a year of training."
"Programming will be obsolete," Matt Welsh, a former engineer at Google and Apple, predicted recently. Welsh now runs an A.I. start-up, but his prediction, while perhaps self-serving, doesn't sound implausible:
I believe the conventional idea of "writing a program" is headed for extinction, and indeed, for all but very specialized applications, most software, as we know it, will be replaced by A.I. systems that are trained rather than programmed. In situations where one needs a "simple" program ... those programs will, themselves, be generated by an A.I. rather than coded by hand.
Welsh's argument, which ran earlier this year in the house organ of the Association for Computing Machinery, carried the headline "The End of Programming," but there's also a way in which A.I. could mark the beginning of a new kind of programming -- one that doesn't require us to learn code but instead transforms human-language instructions into software. An A.I. "doesn't care how you program it -- it will try to understand what you mean," Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chip-making company Nvidia, said in a speech this week at the Computex conference in Taiwan. He added: "We have closed the digital divide. Everyone is a programmer now -- you just have to say something to the computer."
Wait a second, though -- wasn't coding supposed to be one of the can't-miss careers of the digital age? In the decades since I puttered around with my Spectrum, computer programming grew from a nerdy hobby into a vocational near-imperative, the one skill to acquire to survive technological dislocation, no matter how absurd or callous-sounding the advice. Joe Biden to coal miners: Learn to code! Twitter trolls to laid-off journalists: Learn to code! Tim Cook to French kids: Apprenez à programmer!
Programming might still be a worthwhile skill to learn, if only as an intellectual exercise, but it would have been silly to think of it as an endeavor insulated from the very automation it was enabling. Over much of the history of computing, coding has been on a path toward increasing simplicity. Once, only the small priesthood of scientists who understood binary bits of 1s or 0s could manipulate computers. Over time, from the development of assembly language through more human-readable languages like C and Python and Java, programming has climbed what computer scientists call increasing levels of abstraction -- at each step growing more removed from the electronic guts of computing and more approachable to the people who use them.
A.I. might now be enabling the final layer of abstraction: the level on which you can tell a computer to do something the same way you'd tell another human.
So far, programmers seem to be on board with how A.I. is changing their jobs. GitHub, the coder's repository owned by Microsoft, surveyed 2,000 programmers last year about how they're using GitHub's A.I. coding assistant, Copilot. A majority said Copilot helped them feel less frustrated and more fulfilled in their jobs; 88 percent said it improved their productivity. Researchers at Google found that among the company's programmers, A.I. reduced "coding iteration time" by 6 percent.
I've tried to introduce my two kids to programming the way my dad did for me, but both found it a snooze. Their disinterest in coding has been one of my disappointments as a father, not to mention a source of anxiety that they could be out of step with the future. (I live in Silicon Valley, where kids seem to learn to code before they learn to read.) But now I'm a bit less worried. By the time they're looking for careers, coding might be as antiquated as my first PC.

Wall Street Rises on Hopes of Fed Inaction: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street rose Thursday with hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon take it easier on its increases to interest rates.
The S&P 500 rallied 1 percent after a suite of reports painted a picture of a split U.S. economy. The job market remains solid, but manufacturing is weakening and retailers are seeing shoppers under pressure. Altogether, investors saw the data pushing the Fed toward not raising rates at its meeting in two weeks, which would be the first time that has happened in more than a year.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 153 points, or 0.5 percent, while the Nasdaq composite led the market with a 1.3 percent jump.
One positive for the market came late Wednesday when the House of Representatives approved a deal to prevent a possibly catastrophic default on the U.S. government's debt. But that was what Wall Street expected, and only a trip-up for the deal before it gets signed by President Biden would likely cause big waves for stocks.
Investors are more concerned about whether the economy will fall into a recession before inflation recedes enough to convince the Federal Reserve to take it easier on interest rates.
Reports Thursday gave a mixed view. One said that fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected, while another suggested employers increased their payrolls in May by more than forecast.
That's good news for workers and the overall economy, which has been slowing because of higher interest rates. But a strong job market could keep pressure up on inflation, pushing the Fed to keep rates high.
On the flip side, manufacturing is continuing to get hit hard. A report from the Institute for Supply Management said manufacturing shrank for a seventh straight month in May.
Following the reports, traders were largely betting on the Fed to hold rates steady at its next meeting in two weeks. That's something a Fed official a day earlier hinted may happen, though the Fed governor Philip Jefferson also said that wouldn't necessarily mean the end to increases.
After that, traders are split on whether the Fed will follow up with another increase to rates at its next meeting in July. That's key because high rates work to lower inflation by slowing the economy, which hurt prices for stocks and other investments.
Tech and other high-growth stocks tend to get hit hardest by higher rates, and hopes for a pause to increases had several Big Tech companies leading the way on Wall Street. Apple, Microsoft and Amazon all rose at least 1.3 percent. Their movements carry extra weight on the S&P 500 because they're some of the most valuable on Wall Street.
For as much as Wall Street hopes the end to rate increases is near, it may be getting ahead of itself, said JJ Kinahan, chief executive of IG North America.
"The market's been like a spoiled child," he said. "Every six weeks, it stamps its feet and says, 'Not this time!' And every time, Powell says, 'We're going to continue to do this,' and the market says, 'I can't believe they did this."'
So far, the economy has held up despite a long list of worries because of a still-strong job market and resilient spending by consumers. But reports from several retailers suggested shoppers are feeling more pressure.
Dollar General dropped 19.5 percent after it reported weaker profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said the economic environment has been more challenging than it expected, and it cut its financial forecasts for the full year.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other loans that influence the economy's strength, fell to 3.59 percent. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, fell to 4.32 percent.

Re "Agreement Is Reached to Increase Debt Limit, With Cuts in Spending" (front page, May 28):
The Republicans have done it again. They're putting the onus on the needy, the poor, but giving the wealthy a free ride. Many of the needy will have to work in order to receive benefits.
Additional funding for the I.R.S. to crack down on tax cheats has been reduced. That, in effect, means it's less likely the very wealthy will be audited. Beyond that, there will be no income tax increases, which further helps the wealthy.
So rather than pursuing the wealthy to pay their fair share, the G.O.P. is cutting costs on the backs of those who can least afford it.
Heartless people, those Republicans.
Marshall Cossman
Grand Blanc, Mich.
To the Editor:
Regarding the framework agreement negotiated between President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy, the fact that both the hard-right Freedom Caucus of the G.O.P. and the progressives on the left are howling in outrage means that it must be a reasonable and possibly good deal for all the rest of us, the American middle.
Robert S. Carroll
Staten Island
To the Editor:
Once again, we have been subjected to last-minute brinkmanship in the debt limit drama series that never seems to end. The outcome is still uncertain, subject to passage by Congress, and even then, would extend the limit only to just past the next presidential election.
Everyone is sick and tired of this political gamesmanship, which realistically achieves nothing. Many have argued for the elimination of the debt limit. However, neither party has the political wherewithal to make this happen.
Perhaps a middle-of-the-road approach may be doable. Why not place a cap on the amount of the debt limit increase? It could be a set percentage, or tied to the inflation rate. Anything above that would require congressional approval and would have to be considered at the time of approving the budget.
Maybe this would help reduce the drama and tension around this issue.

Re "Biden Seeks to Woo Allies on Debt Deal," by Peter Baker (news analysis, front page, May 29):
President Biden was faced with a hostage negotiation. All the hostages were freed and he paid only a small portion of the ransom demand. To me that's victory.
Isaiah Roter
Berkeley, Calif.
To the Editor:
Peter Baker writes that the debt deal "bolsters President Biden's argument that he is the one figure who can still do bipartisanship in a profoundly partisan era," adding, "But it comes at the cost of rankling many in his own party."
I think it is called running for re-election ... or anything for a vote.
Cathleen Meehan
Newtown, Conn.
To the Editor:
While I know we're supposed to cheer bipartisanship, bipartisan disregard for the poor is, once again, highlighted by a debt deal that piles new burdens upon society's least fortunate.
Brendan Williams
Somersworth, N.H.
To the Editor:
President Biden's compromise with Speaker Kevin McCarthy would leave the world economy a potential hostage to MAGA extortionists in Congress when the clock again runs out on the debt ceiling in 2025.
For that reason, regardless of this year's legislative outcome, Democrats should immediately begin efforts to adjudicate the 14th Amendment's relevance, to offer the Federal Reserve a trillion-dollar platinum coin and to push the issuance of perpetual bonds.

What 'Succession' Tells Us About America
To the Editor:
Re "How 'Succession' Busts One of America's Most Cherished Myths," by Elizabeth Spiers (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, May 20):
Capturing the nuances of the "American dream" and the realities of American life, Ms. Spiers deftly addresses the myths and practices that drive status in this country and enable economic inequality and exploitation.
Whether striving, achieving or sustaining, the class structures and the beliefs in which they are embedded throughout American culture are replicated in every town and city as well as in the bloated billionaire class.
As a retired anthropologist, I find her analysis not only insightful but also speaking truth to power. Using the characters in a popular series she has described class in America, and the beliefs that drive social behavior and account for divisive outcomes at many levels of American society.
Beverly J. Stoeltje
Bloomington, Ind.
The writer is professor emerita of anthropology at Indiana University.
To the Editor:
I'm sorry that Elizabeth Spiers has such a cynical view of Americans, who, she says, love "money and power" and "on some level we think having them is an indication that you deserve them."
How can she generalize about an entire population? Some Americans surely fall into this category, but just as surely many others, perhaps a majority, do not. And it's a bit arrogant of Ms. Spiers to evidently believe she is among the enlightened few who can see Americans for who they really are.
Peter Samson

To the Editor:
Re "'Succession' Series Finale Recap: The Dotted Line" (nytimes.com, May 28):
Noel Murray's piece on the finale of HBO's "Succession" ends by noting the poignancy of the scene in which the four siblings watch a home video of a small dinner party hosted by their father shortly before his death. Mr. Murray wrote that at the dinner "Karl sings a Scottish folk song."
In fact, it is the song "Green Grow the Rashes O," written by Robert Burns in 1783, and, of the two verses that are sung, one could serve as the epigraph for the entire show:
The warl'y race may riches chase,
An' riches still may fly them, O
An' tho' at last they catch them fast,
Their hearts can ne'er enjoy them, O.
Lewis Bremner
Cambridge, England
To the Editor:
Re "'Succession' Nailed the Unreal Way We Live Now," "'Succession' Is Over. Why Did We Care?" and others:
Why on earth is the conclusion of "Succession" worthy of so many articles in The Times? For God's sake.

City Moves To Regulate Use of A.I. For Hiring: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: European lawmakers are finishing work on an A.I. act. The Biden administration and leaders in Congress have their plans for reining in artificial intelligence. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, maker of the A.I. sensation ChatGPT, recommended the creation of a federal agency with oversight and licensing authority in Senate testimony last week. And the topic came up at the Group of 7 summit in Japan.
Amid the sweeping plans and pledges, New York City has emerged as a modest pioneer in A.I. regulation.
The city government passed a law in 2021 and adopted specific rules last month for one high-stakes application of the technology: hiring and promotion decisions. Enforcement begins in July.
The city's law requires companies using A.I. software in hiring to notify candidates that an automated system is being used. It also requires companies to have independent auditors check the technology annually for bias. Candidates can request and be told what data is being collected and analyzed. Companies will be fined for violations.
New York City's focused approach represents an important front in A.I. regulation. At some point, the broad-stroke principles developed by governments and international organizations, experts say, must be translated into details and definitions. Who is being affected by the technology? What are the benefits and harms? Who can intervene, and how?
"Without a concrete use case, you are not in a position to answer those questions," said Julia Stoyanovich, an associate professor at New York University and director of its Center for Responsible A.I.
But even before it takes effect, the New York City law has been a magnet for criticism. Public interest advocates say it doesn't go far enough, while business groups say it is impractical.
The complaints from both camps point to the challenge of regulating A.I., which is advancing at a torrid pace with unknown consequences, stirring enthusiasm and anxiety.
Uneasy compromises are inevitable.
Ms. Stoyanovich is concerned that the city law has loopholes that may weaken it. "But it's much better than not having a law," she said. "And until you try to regulate, you won't learn how."
The law applies to companies with workers in New York City, but labor experts expect it to influence practices nationally. At least four states -- California, New Jersey, New York and Vermont -- and the District of Columbia are also working on laws to regulate A.I. in hiring. And Illinois and Maryland have enacted laws limiting the use of specific A.I. technologies, often for workplace surveillance and the screening of job candidates.
The New York City law emerged from a clash of sharply conflicting viewpoints. The City Council passed it during the final days of the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio. Rounds of hearings and public comments, more than 100,000 words, came later -- overseen by the city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, the rule-making agency.
The result, some critics say, is overly sympathetic to business interests.
"What could have been a landmark law was watered down to lose effectiveness," said Alexandra Givens, president of the Center for Democracy & Technology, a policy and civil rights organization.
That's because the law defines an "automated employment decision tool" as technology used "to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making," she said. The rules adopted by the city appear to interpret that phrasing narrowly so that A.I. software will require an audit only if it is the lone or primary factor in a hiring decision or is used to overrule a human, Ms. Givens said.
That leaves out the main way the automated software is used, she said, with a hiring manager invariably making the final choice. The potential for A.I.-driven discrimination, she said, typically comes in screening hundreds or thousands of candidates down to a handful or in targeted online recruiting to generate a pool of candidates.
Ms. Givens also criticized the law for limiting the kinds of groups measured for unfair treatment. It covers bias by sex, race and ethnicity, but not discrimination against older workers or those with disabilities.
"My biggest concern is that this becomes the template nationally when we should be asking much more of our policymakers," Ms. Givens said.
The law was narrowed to sharpen it and make sure it was focused and enforceable, city officials said. The Council and the worker protection agency heard from many voices, including public-interest activists and software companies. Its goal was to weigh trade-offs between innovation and potential harm, officials said.
"This is a significant regulatory success toward ensuring that A.I. technology is used ethically and responsibly," said Robert Holden, who was the chair of the Council committee on technology when the law was passed and remains a committee member.
New York City is trying to address new technology in the context of federal workplace laws with guidelines on hiring that date to the 1970s. The main Equal Employment Opportunity Commission rule states that no practice or method of selection used by employers should have a "disparate impact" on a legally protected group like women or minorities.
Businesses have criticized the law. In a filing this year, the Software Alliance, a trade group that includes Microsoft, SAP and Workday, said the requirement for independent audits of A.I. was "not feasible" because "the auditing landscape is nascent," lacking standards and professional oversight bodies.
But a nascent field is a market opportunity. The A.I. audit business, experts say, is only going to grow. It is already attracting law firms, consultants and start-ups.
Companies that sell A.I. software to assist in hiring and promotion decisions have generally come to embrace regulation. Some have already undergone outside audits. They see the requirement as a potential competitive advantage, providing proof that their technology expands the pool of job candidates for companies and increases opportunity for workers.
"We believe we can meet the law and show what good A.I. looks like," said Roy Wang, general counsel of Eightfold AI, a Silicon Valley start-up that produces software used to assist hiring managers.
The New York City law also takes an approach to regulating A.I. that may become the norm. The law's key measurement is an "impact ratio," or a calculation of the effect of using the software on a protected group of job candidates. It does not delve into how an algorithm makes decisions, a concept known as "explainability."
In life-affecting applications like hiring, critics say, people have a right to an explanation of how a decision was made. But A.I. like ChatGPT-style software is becoming more complex, perhaps putting the goal of explainable A.I. out of reach, some experts say.
"The focus becomes the output of the algorithm, not the working of the algorithm," said Ashley Casovan, executive director of the Responsible AI Institute, which is developing certifications for the safe use of A.I. applications in the workplace, health care and finance.

The Vanishing van Gogh: A $62 Million Mystery: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Mystery of the Disappearing van Gogh
The bidding for Lot 17 started at $ 23 million.
In the packed room at Sotheby's in Manhattan, the price quickly climbed: $ 32 million, $ 42 million, $ 48 million. Then a new prospective buyer, calling from China, made it a contest between just two people.
On the block that evening in November 2014 were works by Impressionist painters and Modernist sculptors that would make the auction the most successful yet in the firm's history. But one painting drew particular attention: "Still Life, Vase with Daisies and Poppies," completed by Vincent van Gogh weeks before his death.
Pushing the price to almost $ 62 million, the Chinese caller prevailed. His offer was the highest ever for a van Gogh still life at auction.
In the discreet world of high-end art, buyers often remain anonymous. But the winning bidder, a prominent movie producer, would proclaim in interview after interview that he was the painting's new owner.
The producer, Wang Zhongjun, was on a roll. His company had just helped bring "Fury," the World War II movie starring Brad Pitt, to cinemas. He dreamed of making his business China's version of the Walt Disney Company.
The sale, according to Chinese media, became a national "sensation." It was a sign -- after the acquisition of a Picasso by a Chinese real estate tycoon the year before -- that the country was becoming a force in the global art market.
"Ten years ago, I could not have imagined purchasing a van Gogh," Mr. Wang said in a Chinese-language interview with Sotheby's. "After buying it, I loved it so much."
But Mr. Wang may not be the real owner at all. Two other men were linked to the purchase: an obscure middleman in Shanghai who paid Sotheby's bill through a Caribbean shell company, and the person he answered to -- a reclusive billionaire in Hong Kong.
The billionaire, Xiao Jianhua, was one of the most influential tycoons of China's gilded age, creating a financial empire in recent decades by exploiting ties to the Communist Party elite and a new class of superrich businessmen. He also controlled a hidden offshore network of more than 130 companies holding over $ 5 billion in assets, according to corporate documents obtained by The New York Times. Among them was Sotheby's invoice for the van Gogh.
The secrecy that pervades the art world and its dealmakers -- including international auction houses like Sotheby's -- has drawn scrutiny in the years since the sale as authorities try to combat criminal activity. Large transactions often pass through murky intermediaries, and the vetting of them is opaque. Citing client confidentiality, Sotheby's declined to comment on the purchase.
Today, Mr. Xiao is a man who has fallen far. Abducted from his luxury apartment and now imprisoned in mainland China, he was convicted of bribery and other misdeeds that prosecutors claimed had threatened the country's financial security. Meanwhile, Mr. Wang is struggling, liquidating properties as his film studio loses money each year.
And the still life, according to several art experts, has been offered for private sale. For a century after van Gogh gathered flowers and placed them in an earthen vase to paint, the artwork's provenance could be easily traced, and the piece was often exhibited in museums for visitors to admire. Now the painting has vanished from public view, its whereabouts unknown.
A Painting's Many Lives
In May 1890, van Gogh arrived in Auvers-sur-Oise, a rustic village outside Paris. Deeply depressed, he had cut off much of his left ear a year and a half earlier. His stay at an asylum had not helped.
But within hours of coming to the village, he met Paul-Ferdinand Gachet, a doctor and an art enthusiast.
"I've found in Dr. Gachet a ready-made friend and something like a new brother," van Gogh wrote to his sister.
The physician encouraged van Gogh to ignore his melancholy and focus on his paintings. He completed nearly 80 of them in two months, including "Portrait of Dr. Gachet," considered a masterpiece. He produced "Vase With Daisies and Poppies" at the physician's home and may have given it to him in exchange for treatment, biographers say.
After van Gogh's death in July 1890, the painting passed to a Parisian collector, and then, in 1911, as the artist's fame was rising, to a Berlin art dealer. A series of German collectors owned it before A. Conger Goodyear, a Buffalo industrialist and a founder of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, bought it in 1928. His son George later granted partial ownership to Buffalo's Albright-Knox Art Gallery, which displayed it for nearly three decades.
In May 1990, capping years of record-breaking prices for van Goghs, a Japanese businessman spent $ 82.5 million for "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" at Christie's, then the highest price paid at auction for any artwork.
About that time, Mr. Goodyear wanted to sell the 26-by-20-inch still life to raise money for another museum. It failed to sell at Christie's in November 1990, where it had been expected to fetch between $ 12 million and $ 16 million. Soon after, a lower offer was accepted from a buyer who remained anonymous.
Most of the 400 or so oil paintings van Gogh produced during his last years -- considered his best work -- are at arts institutions around the world. About 15 percent are in private hands and not regularly on loan to museums. In the past decade, just 16 have been offered at auction, according to Artnet, an industry database. Among them was "Orchard With Cypresses," from the collection of the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, which Christie's sold last year for $ 117 million to an undisclosed buyer.
The Producer and the Billionaire
For a year after the November 2014 auction, Mr. Wang kept the still life at his $ 25 million apartment in Hong Kong. In October 2015, the film producer was the guest of honor at a five-day exhibition in the city. An amateur artist, he had more than a dozen of his own oil paintings on display.
But the main attractions were the van Gogh and a Picasso he had recently bought, "Woman With a Hairbun on a Sofa." Sotheby's said Mr. Wang had paid nearly $ 30 million for the work.
Until then, Japanese industrialists, followed by American hedge fund managers and Russian oligarchs, had captured headlines for record-breaking purchases. Around 2012, newly rich Chinese buyers, who had benefited from their country's market-opening policies, came on the scene.
"All the auction houses really jumped on that," said David Norman, who headed Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern art department when the van Gogh was sold.
Chinese billionaires were often delighted to announce their big-ticket purchases. In 2013, a retail magnate bought a Picasso for $ 28 million at Christie's, following up with a $ 20 million Monet at Sotheby's in 2015. The same year, a stock investor spent $ 170 million at Christie's for a Modigliani.
"It is a combination of vanity, investment and building their own brand," said Kejia Wu, who taught at Sotheby's Institute of Art and is the author of a new book on China's art market.
Mr. Wang, 63, basked in the spotlight. In interviews, he spoke of his admiration for van Gogh and the artist's influence on him. "Few people in the world would buy this kind of painting -- there aren't that many who love Impressionist art this much and can afford it, right?"
Days after the hammer fell at Sotheby's, Mr. Wang had told a Chinese publication that he had not bought the painting alone, though he offered no details. Later, he no longer mentioned any partner. "When I saw the painting at a preview, I just felt like owning it -- it stirred my heart," he said in an interview published on Sotheby's website.
The high-profile acquisition, made through an intermediary and with the ultimate source of funds remaining a secret, is the kind of transaction governments have been trying to curb in recent years.
In one scandal, the United States charged a Malaysian businessman with laundering billions of dollars from a state development fund, using some of it to buy art at Sotheby's and Christie's. In 2020, the Senate issued a scathing report on how auction houses and art dealers had unwittingly helped Russians evade sanctions by allowing others to buy art for them.
A spokeswoman for Sotheby's said it vetted all buyers and, when necessary, enlisted its compliance department for "enhanced due diligence." Sotheby's applies worldwide a 2020 European Union rule that requires auction houses to verify the legitimacy of funds.
While the financial documents involving the van Gogh do not show wrongdoing, the transaction was hardly routine. Soon after the auction, Sotheby's transferred ownership of the painting to the Shanghai man, neither a known art agent nor a collector, who paid the bill. But in a public ceremony, Sotheby's handed over the painting not to him or the billionaire who employed him but to the producer, Mr. Wang.
"There's a connection to someone who is now incarcerated," said Leila Amineddoleh, a New York-based art lawyer. "Something unusual is going on."
'White Gloves'
The man Sotheby's considers the owner of the van Gogh lives in a Shanghai apartment complex where gray tiles and grimy grout frame a weather-beaten door. A mat out front states nine times, in English, "I am an artist."
The occupant, Liu Hailong, is listed as the sole owner and lone director of the shell company in the British Virgin Islands that paid for the painting: Islandwide Holdings Limited. Other than his date and place of birth, little is known about Mr. Liu, 46.
When a reporter recently showed him the Sotheby's invoice and a bank wire document and asked whether the signature was his, he said, "Please leave immediately," and shut the door.
A woman living with him, Zhao Tingting, has her own connection to the jailed billionaire, Mr. Xiao. She was once a top official at a company he co-founded, which had business dealings with relatives of China's top leader, Xi Jinping.
Ms. Zhao, 43, who no longer holds that position, now teaches piano. Asked about Mr. Liu's purchase of the van Gogh, she responded, "Do you think our house comes close to the price of that painting?"
She and Mr. Liu were "just ordinary little employees," she said, with no connection to the Tomorrow Group, the collection of companies controlled by the billionaire. "We have no right to make any decisions and no right to know anything."
The couple appear to have been "white gloves," a term used in China to describe proxy shareholders meant to hide companies' true owners. Among the thousands of pages of records providing details about the Tomorrow Group is a spreadsheet listing dozens of such people. At least four offshore companies were registered in Mr. Liu's name.
Those companies were part of Mr. Xiao's vast enterprise. He had showed early promise, gaining admission to China's prestigious Peking University at age 14 and serving as a student leader during the 1989 Tiananmen protests. He sided with the government, an allegiance that would help him become one of the country's richest men, acquiring control of banks, insurers and brokerages, as well as stakes in coal, cement and real estate.
Unlike the many brash billionaires he did business with, Mr. Xiao, now 51, preferred to operate in the shadows, building ties to some of China's princelings. He settled into a quiet life at the Four Seasons, where a coterie of female bodyguards attended to his needs.
Why one of his lieutenants paid for the van Gogh is not clear. Mr. Wang, the producer, was among the ranks of China's wealthiest people, though not nearly as rich as Mr. Xiao.
Mr. Xiao's easy access to money outside China through his offshore network allowed him to bypass the country's strict currency controls; he may have acted as a kind of banker for Mr. Wang. The documents show that the two men were drawing up art investment plans the same month as the auction, but their joint venture, based in the Seychelles, wasn't formed until a year later. Meanwhile, the two set up another offshore company, aimed at investing in film and television projects in North America.
There could be another explanation for the payment: Mr. Xiao may have wanted to acquire an asset that could be transported across borders in a private jet, free from scrutiny by bank compliance officers and government regulators.
An Abduction, and a Vanishing Act
The fortunes of the men connected to the van Gogh purchase began to turn in 2015 with the crash of the Chinese stock market. Mr. Xi's government blamed market manipulation by well-connected traders, and regulators wrested economic power back from the billionaires. Dozens of financiers disappeared, only to resurface in police custody.
Art purchases became more discreet. In 2016, Oprah Winfrey sold a Klimt painting to an anonymous Chinese buyer for $ 150 million.
By early 2017, Mr. Xiao's life as a free man was over. One night, about a half-dozen men put him in a wheelchair -- he was not known to use one -- covered his face and removed him from his Hong Kong apartment. He was taken to mainland China and eventually charged. Prosecutors claimed that his crimes dated back before 2014, the year the van Gogh was sold.
He was sentenced last August to 13 years in prison for manipulating financial markets and bribing state officials. The court said Mr. Xiao and his company had misused more than $ 20 billion.
Government officials dismantled his companies in China. At some point, the British Virgin Islands business that bought the van Gogh changed hands and Mr. Liu was removed as its owner.
For a while, Mr. Wang, the producer, maintained a high-flying lifestyle, opening a private museum in Beijing in 2017 that showcased the van Gogh and Picasso paintings for a few months.
But the market value of his film studio, Huayi Brothers, vaporized as it backed flops. Mr. Wang let go much of his art collection and his Hong Kong home. Last year the Beijing museum was sold off, along with a mansion tied to him in Beverly Hills.
Mr. Wang and a spokesman for his company did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Mr. Xiao could not be reached for comment in prison, though a family representative said the billionaire's wife did not know of any involvement in the van Gogh purchase and was unfamiliar with Mr. Liu.
Van Gogh's floral still life -- a vibrant painting by one of the world's most acclaimed artists -- hasn't been seen publicly for years. But there are reports that the artwork may be back on the market.
Three people, including two former Sotheby's executives and a New York art adviser, requesting anonymity, said the painting had been offered for private sale. Last year, the adviser viewed a written proposal to buy it for about $ 70 million.
The art experts did not know whether the painting had sold or if concerns had been raised about the 2014 sale -- a purchase by a onetime lieutenant to a now disgraced billionaire linked to a beleaguered film producer who claims the art belongs to him.
"Nobody needs a $ 62 million van Gogh, and nobody wants to buy a lawsuit," said Thomas C. Danziger, an art lawyer. "If there's any question about the painting's ownership, people will buy a different artwork -- or another airplane."

Getting Chatbots to Be More Chatty: [Science Desk]

Full text: Teaching fewer words to large language models might help them sound more human.
When it comes to artificial intelligence chatbots, bigger is typically better.
Large language models like ChatGPT and Bard, which generate conversational, original text, improve as they are fed more data. Every day, bloggers take to the internet to explain how the latest advances -- an app that summarizes‌ ‌articles, A.I.-generated podcasts, a fine-tuned model that can answer any question related to professional basketball -- will "change everything."
But making bigger and more capable A.I. requires processing power that few companies possess, and there is growing concern that a small group, including Google, Meta, OpenAI and Microsoft, will exercise near-total control over the technology.
Also, bigger language models are harder to understand. They are often described as "black boxes," even by the people who design them, and leading figures in the field have expressed ‌unease ‌that ‌A.I.'s goals may ultimately not align with our own. If bigger is better, it is also more opaque and more exclusive.
In January, a group of young academics working in natural language processing -- the branch of A.I. focused on linguistic understanding -- issued a challenge to try to turn this paradigm on its head. The group called for teams to create functional language models ‌using data sets that are less than one-ten-thousandth the size of those used by the most advanced large language models. A successful mini-model would be nearly as capable as the high-end models but much smaller, more accessible and ‌more compatible with humans. The project is called the BabyLM Challenge.
"We're challenging people to think small and focus more on building efficient systems that way more people can use," said Aaron Mueller, a computer scientist at Johns Hopkins University and an organizer of BabyLM.
Alex Warstadt, a computer scientist at ETH Zurich and another organizer of the project, added, "The challenge puts questions about human language learning, rather than 'How big can we make our models?' at the center of the conversation."
Large language models are neural networks designed to predict the next word in a given sentence or phrase. They are trained for this task using a corpus of words collected from transcripts, websites, novels and newspapers. A typical model makes guesses based on example phrases and then adjusts itself depending on how close it gets to the right answer.
By repeating this process over and over, a model forms maps of how words relate to one another. In general, the more words a model is trained on, the better it will become; every phrase provides the model with context, and more context translates to a more detailed impression of what each word means. OpenAI's GPT-3, released in 2020, was trained on 200 billion words; DeepMind's Chinchilla, released in 2022, was trained on a trillion.
To Ethan Wilcox, a linguist at ETH Zurich, the fact that something nonhuman can generate language presents an exciting opportunity: Could A.I. language models be used to study how humans learn language?
For instance, nativism, an influential theory tracing back to Noam Chomsky's early work, claims that humans learn language quickly and efficiently because ‌they have an innate understanding of how language works. But language models learn language quickly, too, and seemingly without an innate understanding of how language works -- so maybe nativism doesn't hold water.
The challenge is that language models learn very differently from humans. Humans have bodies, social lives and rich sensations. We can smell mulch, feel the vanes of feathers, bump into doors and taste peppermints. Early on, we are exposed to simple spoken words and syntaxes that are often not represented in writing. So, Dr. Wilcox concluded, a computer that produces language after being trained on gazillions of written words can tell us only so much about our own linguistic process.
But if a language model were exposed only to words that a young human encounters, it might interact with language in ways that could address certain questions we have about our own abilities.
So, together with a half-dozen ‌colleagues, Dr. Wilcox, Mr. Mueller and Dr. Warstadt conceived of the BabyLM Challenge, to try to nudge language models slightly closer to human understanding. In January, they sent out a call for teams to train language models on the same number of words that a 13‌-year-old human ‌encounters -- roughly 100 million. Candidate models would be ‌tested on how well they ‌generated and picked up the nuances of language, and a winner would be declared.
Eva Portelance, a linguist at McGill University, came across the challenge the day it was announced. Her research straddles the often blurry line between computer science and linguistics. The first forays into A.I., in the 1950s, were driven by the desire to model human cognitive capacities in computers; the basic unit of information processing in A.I. is ‌the‌ ‌ "neuron‌," and early language models in the 1980s and '90s were directly inspired by the human brain. ‌
But as processors grew more powerful, and companies started working toward marketable products, ‌computer scientists realized that it was often easier to train language models on enormous amounts of data than to force them into psychologically informed structures. As a result, Dr. Portelance said, "‌they give us text that's humanlike, but there's no connection between us and how they function‌."‌
For scientists interested in understanding how the human mind works, these large models offer limited insight. And because they require ‌tremendous processing power, few researchers can access them. "Only a small number of industry labs with huge resources can afford to train models with billions of parameters on trillions of words," ‌Dr. Wilcox said.
"Or even to load them," Mr. Mueller added. "This has made research in the field feel slightly less democratic lately."
The BabyLM Challenge, Dr. Portelance said, could be seen as a step away from the arms race for bigger language models, and a step toward more accessible, more intuitive A.I.
The potential of such a research program has not been ignored by bigger industry labs. Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, recently said that increasing the size of language models would not lead to the same kind of improvements seen over the past few years. And companies like Google and Meta have also been investing in research into more efficient language models, informed by human cognitive structures. After all, a model that can generate language when trained on less data could potentially be scaled up, too.
Whatever profits a successful BabyLM might hold, for those behind the challenge, the goals are more academic and abstract. Even the prize subverts the practical. "Just pride," Dr. Wilcox said.

Full text: A few months after my stepfather died, I stumbled upon the Photos app on his old iPad. Jeff was not much of a photographer, and his photos proved it. As I flipped through, I saw images that mostly seemed to have been taken inadvertently, like closeups of his feet. But Jeff was gone, and I wanted more, so I kept looking.
Among accidental screengrabs, I found photos he took while lying down. Was Jeff -- our curmudgeon who spent his free time reading Civil War tomes -- taking selfies in the hospital? I kept going. I found image after image of my mother, standing in their kitchen or bedroom, posing in different outfits. She had presumably asked Jeff to photograph her so she could decide what to wear, and he obliged.
The more I looked, the more I found sweet moments of my mother. Images of her petting Jeff's cats, which she insisted she didn't care about. Others of his cats snuggled up against her. I found a series of my mother painting wildflowers at their favorite lake in Maine. Jeff had captured her from every angle.
Finding these photos, even the awkward feet ones, brought me comfort. The images were both predictable and surprising -- reinforcing everything I knew about who my stepfather was, while also showing me more.
When older generations died, families would go through old photo albums and boxes of belongings. Now, when a loved one dies, we have so much more to pore over from their life -- text messages, emails, to-do lists, playlists, voicemails. These digital artifacts contain life's spontaneity and chance. They show us details and small moments that we may have otherwise missed.
We asked our readers to tell us about the digital scraps they found after a loved one passed away. Here is a selection of their responses, which have been edited for clarity.
He was not a sentimental man. After her partner of 16 years died, in April 2013, Linda Lee in San Francisco found a reminder note he had written on an iPad app. After Tom passed, I found an entry in the Reminder app on his iPad. It just floored me. I never thought he used it -- he wasn't a techy kind of person. I doubled over in tears upon finding it.
He was not a sentimental man. He gave me cards that said "XOXO," and things like that. But he never really said, "I love you," verbally.
This was the nicest gift ever from him; a forever gift to be cherished the rest of my life.
I had never thought about capturing his voice. Sharon Koppel in Mifflinburg, Pa., lost her husband, Jeff, in 2020. He was 73. I had no recordings of Jeff's voice after he died. Then I stumbled upon a video of him riding his bike to our local Y.M.C.A. and sharing why exercise and his friends there were important to him, in his deep, gentle, kind voice. I smiled at the T-shirt he had on: a cartoon of a dog with drinking glasses and the words, "I make pour decisions."
We were together for almost 30 years. I had two prior marriages that were not the best, so meeting Jeff was like meeting my soulmate. Every day was fun.
He had contracted Cushing's disease eight years before, and it had a debilitating effect on his body and muscles and all kinds of stuff. He decided he would sign up for the local Y.M.C.A., and he became a regular, riding his bike five days a week to his class.
They made the video as part of a fundraising campaign many years ago, and I hadn't thought about it in so long. He was in remission and doing so well, and then, suddenly, he wasn't. After seven weeks in hospice care, he died.
He died at home, and it was just so busy. About a month after he died, someone asked me if I had saved any of his voicemails, and I had been so preoccupied that I didn't even think about it. I got all the photos, but I had never thought about capturing his voice.
I ran into the head of the Y.M.C.A. down at the grocery store, and I asked her if, by any chance, they had any video of Jeff talking. She said, "Sure, we have that video from the campaign," and I just burst into tears.
Our secret language. Allison Reeves in Baton Rouge lost her younger brother, Jimmy, when he was 25. He died after a bike accident in Taiwan more than a decade ago. I found the last email that I wrote to my brother before his accident. I was bored on a Friday afternoon at work and had written to him: "I love you like a fat kid loves cake. I do!" which was like our secret language for expressing our love for one another.
After he died, my parents gave me his computer, where I stumbled upon an app to see his email. I did not remember sending the message until the moment I saw it in his email inbox. I was surprised how glad I was to have sent the email, to have seen that he read it, to know that I said everything I needed to say before his accident.
A sight I had seen every evening. Sarah Chute in Toronto stumbled upon a photo of her father on an old web forum. Among his many creative accomplishments, my late father, Harvey Chute, ran two forums in the late aughts: one, for users of Microsoft Zune, called Zunerama, and another, for Kindle users, called Kboards. He had so many hobbies he pursued on his own like this, including authoring a young adult historical novel and playing guitar. But he would still involve us in small related projects, such as filming unboxing videos of us as children opening up Zune accessories. Before he passed away, in 2015, he taught my mom, sisters and me the inner workings of running a forum. This gave us a newfound appreciation for all his years of hard work that we had witnessed and dismissed as "just Papa's hobby."
Earlier this year, I Googled his name, hoping to find an audio clip or interview with him that I hadn't discovered before. I added "zune" to make my search query more specific and came across a stranger's post on another site documenting a day at Zune HQ for Microsoft Valued Professionals, a title he was awarded in recognition of the success of Zunerama. I scrolled down and was touched to see a photo of a group of geeks working in a small boardroom. On the right end of the table, the comforting, familiar sight of my dad's bald head and gaze focused on his laptop brought me a flood of emotion. It was a sight I had seen every evening in our family room when he would tinker away on the back end of forums he developed during the off-hours of his day job.
Somehow, knowing that he joined a group of strangers to gather for a day -- and that they witnessed his mannerisms, his nerdy hobby, his gentle curiosity, his mild pleasantries, and, undoubtedly, one of his clever jokes -- made me aware of the scope of lives that he touched, and it was a comforting reminder that his memory lives on in quaint and unexpected ways.
Decoding a piece of the past. Madeline de Figueiredo in Houston lost her husband, Eli Aperin, in November 2021. He was 25. I found an email in my spouse Eli's inbox that was dated from the night of our first kiss in 2017. He had sent himself a message in Japanese that night with the note: "Prediction: Marry Madeline ..."
We had been good friends for years, but I was a bit overwhelmed when our relationship took a turn for the romantic. Three years later, we married.
Eighteen months after that, Eli died suddenly in an accident.
Finding this email in his inbox was like decoding a piece of the past and discovering a new moment in our love story: Eli knew it was me from the beginning. What a gift to receive from him in the early weeks of grief.
I really believed before this happened that once someone dies, that is the end of your relationship. After finding this, I felt like I was getting to know him better, even after he was gone.
Discovering another side to Dad. Carolina Ramirez in Denver lost her father in December. After he died, she found a playlist he had created. Losing our dad was one of the hardest things we had gone through. We lost him pretty suddenly. He was diagnosed with esophageal cancer last May, and we lost him in December. We assumed we'd have more time.
In our attempt to find mementos of him after he passed, my sister remembered his Spotify account and quickly played his 2022 Spotify wrapped playlist. It felt like we were able to glimpse a hidden side of our dad on his long rides in traffic, as he traveled from house to house for his work as a painter. To our surprise, our Mexican-born immigrant dad loved old-school country music, and his most played artist was Dolly Parton.
My mom, sister and I sobbed and laughed as we huddled around his phone, playing a glimpse of his final year with us. We curated a playlist for his graveside burial service and then listened to a time capsule of his favorite songs as they lowered his casket. We can now keep this playlist with us and remember the incredibly quirky, goofy and proud man that was our father.
Te quiero mucho, Papá.
Before the trouble started. Priscilla Dickerman in Downingtown, Pa., lost her brother, Malcolm, a year ago. He was 62. My brother died this past spring. He overdosed after years of homelessness, which was due to a mix of head trauma, family trauma, mental illness and addiction.
My brother had a hard life; some of his troubles were from crappy life circumstances, and many were from his own questionable choices. But he was a very caring and sweet soul, and I loved him.
A few months later, I found a voicemail on my phone from him, left at a time when I had blocked him because he was quite toxic and out of control. The message was so sweet, so loving, so thoughtful.
His message is both comforting and painful for me to hear. It was from the tender soul that my brother held way deep inside himself, the part that few besides me would recognize, from long ago when we were kids, before the trouble started. And it has helped carry me through the pain of his loss.
Were there other moments like that? Mike Johnson in Cave Creek, Ariz., lost his mother in August 2020. After she died, his brother found this image on their father's computer. Our mother was a loving control freak who did not have much of a sense of humor. So it's hard to imagine what would have caused her to lose it in this picture.
I had known her for 60 years, and I had known her to not laugh very much. She was very task-oriented, just not a free spirit. And then to see this picture of both she and my dad just losing it -- it was, like, wow, what was it that prompted that reaction? I hadn't seen her laugh like that for anything. I had seen her chuckle, but I never saw her lose control laughing so hard.
It sticks with you. You go, wow, were there other moments like that that we just didn't know about?

Full text: A few months after my stepfather died, I stumbled upon the Photos app on his old iPad. Jeff was not much of a photographer, and his photos proved it. As I flipped through, I saw images that mostly seemed to have been taken inadvertently, like closeups of his feet. But Jeff was gone, and I wanted more, so I kept looking.
Among accidental screengrabs, I found photos he took while lying down. Was Jeff -- our curmudgeon who spent his free time reading Civil War tomes -- taking selfies in the hospital? I kept going. I found image after image of my mother, standing in their kitchen or bedroom, posing in different outfits. She had presumably asked Jeff to photograph her so she could decide what to wear, and he obliged.
The more I looked, the more I found sweet moments of my mother. Images of her petting Jeff's cats, which she insisted she didn't care about. Others of his cats snuggled up against her. I found a series of my mother painting wildflowers at their favorite lake in Maine. Jeff had captured her from every angle.
Finding these photos, even the awkward feet ones, brought me comfort. The images were both predictable and surprising -- reinforcing everything I knew about who my stepfather was, while also showing me more.
When older generations died, families would go through old photo albums and boxes of belongings. Now, when a loved one dies, we have so much more to pore over from their life -- text messages, emails, to-do lists, playlists, voicemails. These digital artifacts contain life's spontaneity and chance. They show us details and small moments that we may have otherwise missed.
We asked our readers to tell us about the digital scraps they found after a loved one passed away. Here is a selection of their responses, which have been edited for clarity.
He was not a sentimental man. After her partner of 16 years died, in April 2013, Linda Lee in San Francisco found a reminder note he had written on an iPad app. After Tom passed, I found an entry in the Reminder app on his iPad. It just floored me. I never thought he used it -- he wasn't a techy kind of person. I doubled over in tears upon finding it.
He was not a sentimental man. He gave me cards that said "XOXO," and things like that. But he never really said, "I love you," verbally.
This was the nicest gift ever from him; a forever gift to be cherished the rest of my life.
I had never thought about capturing his voice. Sharon Koppel in Mifflinburg, Pa., lost her husband, Jeff, in 2020. He was 73. I had no recordings of Jeff's voice after he died. Then I stumbled upon a video of him riding his bike to our local Y.M.C.A. and sharing why exercise and his friends there were important to him, in his deep, gentle, kind voice. I smiled at the T-shirt he had on: a cartoon of a dog with drinking glasses and the words, "I make pour decisions."
We were together for almost 30 years. I had two prior marriages that were not the best, so meeting Jeff was like meeting my soulmate. Every day was fun.
He had contracted Cushing's disease eight years before, and it had a debilitating effect on his body and muscles and all kinds of stuff. He decided he would sign up for the local Y.M.C.A., and he became a regular, riding his bike five days a week to his class.
They made the video as part of a fundraising campaign many years ago, and I hadn't thought about it in so long. He was in remission and doing so well, and then, suddenly, he wasn't. After seven weeks in hospice care, he died.
He died at home, and it was just so busy. About a month after he died, someone asked me if I had saved any of his voicemails, and I had been so preoccupied that I didn't even think about it. I got all the photos, but I had never thought about capturing his voice.
I ran into the head of the Y.M.C.A. down at the grocery store, and I asked her if, by any chance, they had any video of Jeff talking. She said, "Sure, we have that video from the campaign," and I just burst into tears.
Our secret language. Allison Reeves in Baton Rouge lost her younger brother, Jimmy, when he was 25. He died after a bike accident in Taiwan more than a decade ago. I found the last email that I wrote to my brother before his accident. I was bored on a Friday afternoon at work and had written to him: "I love you like a fat kid loves cake. I do!" which was like our secret language for expressing our love for one another.
After he died, my parents gave me his computer, where I stumbled upon an app to see his email. I did not remember sending the message until the moment I saw it in his email inbox. I was surprised how glad I was to have sent the email, to have seen that he read it, to know that I said everything I needed to say before his accident.
A sight I had seen every evening. Sarah Chute in Toronto stumbled upon a photo of her father on an old web forum. Among his many creative accomplishments, my late father, Harvey Chute, ran two forums in the late aughts: one, for users of Microsoft Zune, called Zunerama, and another, for Kindle users, called Kboards. He had so many hobbies he pursued on his own like this, including authoring a young adult historical novel and playing guitar. But he would still involve us in small related projects, such as filming unboxing videos of us as children opening up Zune accessories. Before he passed away, in 2015, he taught my mom, sisters and me the inner workings of running a forum. This gave us a newfound appreciation for all his years of hard work that we had witnessed and dismissed as "just Papa's hobby."
Earlier this year, I Googled his name, hoping to find an audio clip or interview with him that I hadn't discovered before. I added "zune" to make my search query more specific and came across a stranger's post on another site documenting a day at Zune HQ for Microsoft Valued Professionals, a title he was awarded in recognition of the success of Zunerama. I scrolled down and was touched to see a photo of a group of geeks working in a small boardroom. On the right end of the table, the comforting, familiar sight of my dad's bald head and gaze focused on his laptop brought me a flood of emotion. It was a sight I had seen every evening in our family room when he would tinker away on the back end of forums he developed during the off-hours of his day job.
Somehow, knowing that he joined a group of strangers to gather for a day -- and that they witnessed his mannerisms, his nerdy hobby, his gentle curiosity, his mild pleasantries, and, undoubtedly, one of his clever jokes -- made me aware of the scope of lives that he touched, and it was a comforting reminder that his memory lives on in quaint and unexpected ways.
Decoding a piece of the past. Madeline de Figueiredo in Houston lost her husband, Eli Aperin, in November 2021. He was 25. I found an email in my spouse Eli's inbox that was dated from the night of our first kiss in 2017. He had sent himself a message in Japanese that night with the note: "Prediction: Marry Madeline ..."
We had been good friends for years, but I was a bit overwhelmed when our relationship took a turn for the romantic. Three years later, we married.
Eighteen months after that, Eli died suddenly in an accident.
Finding this email in his inbox was like decoding a piece of the past and discovering a new moment in our love story: Eli knew it was me from the beginning. What a gift to receive from him in the early weeks of grief.
I really believed before this happened that once someone dies, that is the end of your relationship. After finding this, I felt like I was getting to know him better, even after he was gone.
Discovering another side to Dad. Carolina Ramirez in Denver lost her father in December. After he died, she found a playlist he had created. Losing our dad was one of the hardest things we had gone through. We lost him pretty suddenly. He was diagnosed with esophageal cancer last May, and we lost him in December. We assumed we'd have more time.
In our attempt to find mementos of him after he passed, my sister remembered his Spotify account and quickly played his 2022 Spotify wrapped playlist. It felt like we were able to glimpse a hidden side of our dad on his long rides in traffic, as he traveled from house to house for his work as a painter. To our surprise, our Mexican-born immigrant dad loved old-school country music, and his most played artist was Dolly Parton.
My mom, sister and I sobbed and laughed as we huddled around his phone, playing a glimpse of his final year with us. We curated a playlist for his graveside burial service and then listened to a time capsule of his favorite songs as they lowered his casket. We can now keep this playlist with us and remember the incredibly quirky, goofy and proud man that was our father.
Te quiero mucho, Papá.
Before the trouble started. Priscilla Dickerman in Downingtown, Pa., lost her brother, Malcolm, a year ago. He was 62. My brother died this past spring. He overdosed after years of homelessness, which was due to a mix of head trauma, family trauma, mental illness and addiction.
My brother had a hard life; some of his troubles were from crappy life circumstances, and many were from his own questionable choices. But he was a very caring and sweet soul, and I loved him.
A few months later, I found a voicemail on my phone from him, left at a time when I had blocked him because he was quite toxic and out of control. The message was so sweet, so loving, so thoughtful.
His message is both comforting and painful for me to hear. It was from the tender soul that my brother held way deep inside himself, the part that few besides me would recognize, from long ago when we were kids, before the trouble started. And it has helped carry me through the pain of his loss.
Were there other moments like that? Mike Johnson in Cave Creek, Ariz., lost his mother in August 2020. After she died, his brother found this image on their father's computer. Our mother was a loving control freak who did not have much of a sense of humor. So it's hard to imagine what would have caused her to lose it in this picture.
I had known her for 60 years, and I had known her to not laugh very much. She was very task-oriented, just not a free spirit. And then to see this picture of both she and my dad just losing it -- it was, like, wow, what was it that prompted that reaction? I hadn't seen her laugh like that for anything. I had seen her chuckle, but I never saw her lose control laughing so hard.
It sticks with you. You go, wow, were there other moments like that that we just didn't know about?

Some Magic Words to Get The Best From a Chatbot: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Our personal tech columnist shares how to improve many parts of your life.
Welcome back to On Tech: A.I., a pop-up newsletter that teaches you about artificial intelligence, how it works and how to use it.
A few months ago, my colleagues Cade Metz and Kevin Roose explained the inner workings of A.I., including chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Bing and Google's Bard. Now we're back with a new mission: to help you learn to use A.I. to its full potential.
People from all walks of life -- students, coders, artists and accountants -- are experimenting with how to use A.I. tools. Employers are posting jobs seeking people who are adept at using them. Pretty soon, if not already, you'll have the chance to use A.I. to streamline and improve your work and personal life.
As The Times's personal tech columnist, I'm here to help you figure out how to use these tools safely and responsibly to improve many parts of your life.
I'm going to spend today's newsletter talking about two general approaches that will be useful in a number of situations.
Then, in the coming weeks, I'll give you more specific tips for different aspects of your life, including parenting and family life, work, organizing in your personal life, learning/education, creativity, and shopping.
A few common-sense warnings to start:
If you're concerned about privacy, leave out personal details like your name and where you work. The tech companies say your data is used to train their systems, which means other people could conceivably see your information.
Don't share confidential data. Your employer may have specific guidelines or restrictions, but in general, entering trade secrets or sensitive information is a very bad idea.
Hallucinations: Chatbots are powered by a technology called a large language model, or L.L.M., which gets its abilities by analyzing enormous amounts of digital text culled from the internet. Plenty of stuff on the web is wrong, and chatbots may repeat those untruths. Sometimes, while trying to predict patterns from their vast training data, they can make things up.
The golden prompts
ChatGPT, Bing and Bard are among the most popular A.I. chatbots. (To use ChatGPT, you'll need to create an OpenAI account, and it requires a subscription for its most advanced version. Bing requires you to use Microsoft's Edge web browser. Bard requires a Google account.)
Though they look simple to use -- you type something in a box and get answers! -- asking questions in the wrong way will produce generic, unhelpful and, sometimes, downright incorrect answers.
It turns out there's an art to typing in the precise words and framing to generate the most helpful answers. I call these the golden prompts.
The people who are getting the most out of the chatbots have been using variants of these strategies:
"Act as if." Beginning your prompt with these magic words will instruct the bot to emulate an expert. For example, typing "Act as if you are a tutor for the SATs" or "Act as if you are a personal trainer" will guide the bots to model themselves around people in those professions.
These prompts provide additional context for the A.I. to generate its response. The A.I. doesn't actually understand what it means to be a tutor or a personal trainer. Instead, the prompt is helping the A.I. to draw on specific statistical patterns in its training data.
A weak prompt with no guidance will generate less helpful results. If all you type is "What should I eat this week?" the chatbot will come up with a generic list of meals for a balanced diet, such as turkey stir fry with a side of colorful veggies for dinner (which, to me, sounds very "meh").
"Tell me what else you need to do this." To get results that are more personalized -- for example, health advice for your specific body type or medical conditions -- invite the bot to request more information.
In the personal trainer example, a prompt could be: "Act as if you are my personal trainer. Create a weekly workout regimen and meal plan for me. Tell me what else you need to do this." The bot might then ask you for your age, height, weight, dietary restrictions and health goals to tailor a weeklong meal plan and fitness routine for you.
If you don't get good answers on your first try, don't give up right away. Better yet, in the words of Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, treat the bot as if it were a human intern: "When it makes a mistake, point that out and ask for it to do better." Be forgiving and patient, and you're likely to get better results.
Thread your chatbot conversations
After you get the hang of prompts, you can make your chatbot more helpful over time. The key here is to avoid treating your chatbot as a web search and starting with a fresh query each time. Instead, keep several threads of conversations open and add to them over time.
This strategy is easiest with ChatGPT. Bing requires you to reset your conversations periodically, and Bard does not make it as easy to hop between conversation threads.
Natalie Choprasert, an entrepreneur in Sydney, Australia, who advises companies on how to use A.I., uses ChatGPT as a business coach and an executive assistant. She keeps separate conversations running side by side for each of these roles.
For the business coach thread, she shares insights about her professional background and the company's goals and problems. For the executive assistant thread, she shares scheduling information, like the clients she's meeting with.
"It builds up and trains properly, so when I ask it a question later on, it will be in the right context and it will give me answers close to what I'm looking for," Choprasert said.
She shared a bonus golden prompt that has trained her assistants to be extra helpful: Apply a framework. She recently read "Clockwork," a book about setting up a business. When she asked ChatGPT-the-business-coach to offer advice using the framework of "Clockwork," she was delighted to see that it could incorporate principles from the book into an action plan for expanding her company.
Share your prompts
What are your golden prompts that have gotten you the most impressive, helpful results from A.I.? Email us your examples. We may use your submissions in future editions of this newsletter.

Full text: As DeSantis announces his campaign, we dig into what may be the single most important fact about U.S. politics.
If Ronald Reagan were to come back to life, he would probably be confused by the leftist tone that the early 2024 Republican presidential campaign has sometimes taken.
After Ron DeSantis announced he was holding a fund-raiser last night at the Four Seasons hotel, an official close to Donald Trump mocked the event as "uber elite" and "out of touch." Trump has also criticized DeSantis for supporting past Republican bills in Congress to shrink government partly by cutting Medicare and Social Security.
DeSantis, for his part, has come out in favor of government action to reduce health care prices. He criticized the Biden administration for blocking cheaper prescription drugs from Canada -- a country that used to be a symbol of big-government inefficiency among Republicans. This month, DeSantis, Florida's governor, signed a bill that tries to lower drug costs there by cracking down on companies known as pharmacy benefit managers.
What's going on?
Trump's trouncing of the Republican establishment in 2016, and his continued popularity among the party's voters, has exposed a weakness of the laissez-faire economic approach known as Reaganism. Namely, it isn't especially popular with most voters, including many Republicans.
With DeSantis announcing his candidacy last night, I want to use today's newsletter to highlight arguably the most important fact about U.S. politics: Americans tend to be more progressive on economic issues than they are on social issues. If you can remember that, you will be able to make better sense of the 2024 campaign.
It explains why DeSantis and Trump are competing with each other to sound populist, even if it means favoring government regulations and benefits. It explains why Trump's criticism of free trade resonated with voters -- and why President Biden has promoted his own "buy America" economic policies, breaking with centrist Democrats. It also explains why today's Republicans campaign on social issues like immigration, crime, gender and religion; most Americans are more conservative on these subjects than the Democratic Party is.
It is true that there is a subset of voters, many of them affluent, who like to describe themselves as "socially liberal and fiscally conservative." If you're reading this newsletter, you probably know some people in that category. Yet it happens to be the least common combination in American politics. The typical swing voter is instead "socially conservative and fiscally liberal."
The 2024 presidential election is likely to be, at least in part, a battle for that voter.
Medicaid and border security
This chart -- originally created by the political scientist Lee Drutman, using a large poll taken after the 2016 election -- remains the best visualization of the situation:
It places respondents, each of whom is represented by a dot, on two scales. One scale is based on economic issues like trade, taxes and safety-net programs, while the other is based on social issues like abortion, immigration, race and pride in the United States. Economic progressives appear on the left side of the chart, and economic conservatives on the right. Social conservatives appear in the top half, and social progressives in the bottom. The dots are colored based on their 2016 vote, be it for Trump, Hillary Clinton or a third-party candidate.
Not surprisingly, people who are liberal on both kinds of issues (the bottom left quadrant) overwhelmingly voted Democratic, and consistent conservatives (the top right quadrant) were solid Trump voters. The socially liberal and fiscally conservative quadrant is mostly empty. And the opposite quadrant is the battleground of American politics.
These socially conservative and fiscally liberal voters -- you can call them Scaffles, for their acronym -- have voted for progressive economic policies when they appear as ballot initiatives, even in red states. Arkansas, Florida, Missouri and Nebraska, for instance, have passed minimum-wage increases. Idaho, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Utah have expanded Medicaid through Obamacare. Republicans without a college degree are often the ones who break with their party on these ballot initiatives.
At the same time, Scaffles are the reason that a Times poll last year showed that most voters, including many Latinos, prefer the Republican Party's stance on illegal immigration to the Democratic Party's. Or consider a recent KFF/Washington Post poll on transgender issues, in which most Americans said they opposed puberty-blocking treatments for children.
Yes, public opinion has nuances. Most Americans also support laws prohibiting discrimination against trans people, the KFF poll showed. Sometimes, the parties can also overreach. When Democrats talk positively about socialism, they alienate swing voters. On abortion, Republicans have gone so far right -- passing almost total bans, that the issue has become a drag on the party.
But don't confuse the nuances and exceptions with the big picture. DeSantis and Trump understand that the old Republican approach to economic policy is a vulnerability, which is why they often sound like populists. And when they emphasize cultural conservatism, they aren't merely catering to their base. They are often appealing to swing voters, too.
More on DeSantis
A Twitter malfunction marred DeSantis's campaign announcement with more than 20 minutes of glitches and hot mic moments.
"That was insane, sorry": It was a conference call from hell -- and a disastrous situation for Elon Musk.
When DeSantis was finally able to speak, he discussed Biden and Disney. Here's a fact check.
DeSantis is expected to use policy issues, like abortion, to distinguish himself from Trump.
Though he has been struggling with plummeting poll numbers and skeptical donors, Nate Cohn explains why it is far too soon to write DeSantis off.
His wife, Casey DeSantis, has used fashion to craft her image, dressing with nods to Jackie Kennedy and Melania Trump.

Treasury Balance Looks Like Petty Cash to Moguls: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The cash balance at the Treasury Department is now lower than the net worth of some of the world's richest people.
The Treasury Department said its cash balance fell to $ 38.8 billion as of Thursday, as the United States inched toward running out of cash to pay its bills.
That was significantly lower than the $ 316 billion the department had in operating cash, which is held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the start of the month.
Just how empty is the Treasury cash coffer? For comparison, $ 38.8 billion is on par with the gross domestic product of Bahrain and Paraguay and lower than the net worth of more than two dozen of the wealthiest people in the world. Of course, much of the assets of those billionaires are tied up in stocks, rather than liquid assets.
Here is a list of people with higher net worths than the U.S. cash reserves, according to Bloomberg News's Billionaire Index as of Thursday. (Under the news agency's editorial policy, its billionaire owner, Michael Bloomberg, is not considered for the index. Forbes, though, estimates his net worth at $ 94.5 billion.)
Bernard Arnault, chief executive of the luxury group LVMH: $ 189 billion
Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX, Tesla and Twitter: $ 179 billion
Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon: $ 139 billion
Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft: $ 125 billion
Larry Ellison, co-founder and executive chairman of Oracle: $ 116 billion
Steve Ballmer, investor and former chief executive of Microsoft: $ 113 billion

U.S. Debt: The Bad, the Weak and the Ugly: [Op-Ed]

Author: Krugman, Paul

Publication info: Krugman, Paul.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The prospect that the U.S. government will default on its payments because Republicans refuse to raise the debt ceiling is now real and imminent. In fact, bonds issued by some corporations are yielding less than Treasuries, indicating that investors now consider, say, Microsoft a more reliable debtor than the federal government.
As disaster looms, it's important to keep in mind that Republicans are the villains here: They're the ones engaged in extortion.
The reason I say this is that progressives are feeling a lot of rage against the Biden administration for refusing to take action to avoid this crisis. And at least some people in or close to the administration seem more dedicated to rejecting proposed ways out of the trap than they are to solving the problem. There's a definite Stockholm syndrome vibe, in which the hostages seem angrier at their would-be rescuers than they are at their kidnappers.
So I hope that the administration will take what I say now as what it is -- an attempt to be helpful.
There are at least three ways the administration could, in principle, bypass the debt ceiling. The objections to these options purport to be technocratic or legal, or both, but when you dig a bit you realize that they're really political.
The first possible strategy is simply to ignore the debt limit, declaring it unconstitutional. The 14th Amendment, which says that the validity of U.S. debt "shall not be questioned," has been getting a lot of attention. But more broadly, the debt ceiling impasse has put the administration in a position where it must break some laws -- either the laws that specify federal spending or the law limiting government borrowing. In such a position, the president must choose which laws to obey; why should the debt ceiling take priority?
I'm not a lawyer, but I don't find the case against the constitutional option persuasive. Some have said default wouldn't violate the 14th Amendment, because the debt would still be valid -- we just wouldn't be honoring it. It's also been argued that the merits of the case are largely irrelevant because of the Supreme Court's partisanship. So it isn't really about the law -- it's about the politics.
A second strategy would be to exploit a peculiar legal provision that allows the Treasury to mint platinum coins of any value it chooses. These coins could be deposited at the Federal Reserve, and the government could then draw cash from its account to continue paying its bills.
Contrary to what some people have asserted, this wouldn't be inflationary -- the Fed could and would offset any effect on the money supply by selling off some of its huge portfolio of U.S. bonds. And because selling those bonds would reduce the earnings the Fed remits to the Treasury, it would have the same fiscal impact as direct bond sales. Essentially, it would be normal borrowing through a back door.
A third option would be to issue perpetual bonds -- bonds that pay interest forever but no principal, and hence have no face value. Since the ceiling is defined in terms of the face value of U.S. debt, not its fluctuating market value, it's hard to see how the ceiling can apply. This isn't a radical idea -- it has a long history, especially in Britain, but has also been used in the United States.
Crucially, all these options are completely innocuous from an economic point of view, amounting to nothing more than workarounds that would allow the government to continue spending duly authorized by Congress.
The arguments against these options all boil down to political guesses. Maybe a partisan Supreme Court will reject the constitutional option. Maybe it will find some way to reject the seemingly clear language authorizing the coin, or the Fed will refuse to accept the coin if minted. Maybe the Supremes will come up with a novel definition of the debt limit (hard to see it, but who knows) that rules out perpetual bonds. Or maybe the Biden administration will be punished by voters if it is seen -- or portrayed by the news media -- as doing something unorthodox and shifty.
But these are only guesses. And remember, the Biden administration's political judgment on the debt limit has been disastrously wrong every step of the way. Officials reportedly thought that by rejecting any workarounds, they would get centrists and business groups to intervene and force Republicans to raise the ceiling. It didn't happen. They ignored warnings that insisting that there were no options would just embolden G.O.P. extremists; it did.
My guess is that if push comes to shove, even a partisan Supreme Court won't be willing either to burn down the world economy or to order President Biden to break the law by disregarding existing spending legislation. Yes, that's a risky bet -- and unorthodox actions might still leave markets nervous. But there are no riskless options at this point.
Realistically, given the administration's obduracy so far, I don't expect it to take any of these actions until or unless the debt limit has actually been breached and the crisis is fully upon us. But I hope someone inside the Treasury is quietly preparing to do whatever it takes. If not, God help us all.

A.I. Hopes and Default Fears Sway Wall St.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street's building frenzy around artificial intelligence helped yank the stock market higher Thursday, even as worries worsened about political rancor in Washington.
The S&P 500 rallied 0.9 percent after the chip maker Nvidia gave a monster forecast for upcoming sales as it benefits from the tech world's rush into A.I. It helped the Nasdaq composite leap 1.7 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 35 points, or 0.1 percent.
Stocks of other chip makers also charged higher after Nvidia described a race by its customers to put A.I. "into every product, service and business process." Advanced Micro Devices gained 11.2 percent.
Some Big Tech stocks rallied, adding to recent gains fueled by excitement about A.I. The field has become so hot that critics warn of a bubble, while supporters say it could be the latest revolution to reshape the global economy. Microsoft gained 3.8 percent, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, rose 2.1 percent.
They helped lift indexes even as most stocks fell on worries about the U.S. government edging closer to a default on its debt. Washington could run out of cash as soon as June 1 unless Congress allows it to borrow more.
The expectation on Wall Street has been for Washington to reach a deal before it's too late, as it has many times before, because a failure would likely be awful for the economy. But bitter partisanship on Capitol Hill is hurting faith and trust in the government.
Fitch said late Wednesday that it could downgrade the U.S. government's "AAA" credit rating. It said it still expects a resolution before the U.S. Treasury runs out of cash, but it sees the risk of a mistake having risen.
"The brinkmanship over the debt ceiling, failure of the U.S. authorities to meaningfully tackle medium-term fiscal challenges that will lead to rising budget deficits and a growing debt burden signal downside risks to U.S. creditworthiness," Fitch said.
Another concern rests on exactly when the "X-date" deadline will hit for the U.S. Treasury to run out of cash.
While Isaac Boltansky, BTIG director of policy research, said he sees an 11th hour deal happening, "Washington is still arguing over exactly when midnight hits, which remains our primary concern as deadlines are the only viable forcing mechanism in town."
On the losing end of Wall Street was Dollar Tree, which fell 12 percent. The retailer reported weaker profit than analysts expected for the latest quarter. Customers are shifting spending toward less profitable products, and it's also contending with worse-than-expected theft like other retailers.
In the bond market, yields rallied after reports suggested the economy is in stronger shape than feared. One said fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than expected. That's a signal the job market remains remarkably solid, even as manufacturing and other areas of the economy slow under the weight of higher interest rates.
Another report estimated the U.S. economy grew at a 1.3 percent annual pace in the first three months of the year, stronger than the 1.1 percent earlier thought. That report also suggested inflation was a touch hotter during the start of 2023 than earlier thought.
The stronger-than-expected data helped dampen investors' fears about a coming recession. But it could convince the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again next month.
Higher rates have helped inflation to slow from its peak last summer, but they do that by slowing the entire economy and dragging on prices for stocks, bonds and other investments.
The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, jumped to 4.53 percent from 4.38 percent late Wednesday. The 10-year yield, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, rose to 3.81 percent.

Full text: The company delivered a robust sales forecast, powered by demand for the processors that run artificial intelligence systems.
Shares in the chip maker Nvidia soared more than 24 percent on Thursday, after the company delivered a knockout quarterly sales outlook powered by demand for the processors that run artificial intelligence systems.
"We're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers," Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, told analysts Wednesday on a conference call.
Nvidia's chips are used to power A.I. systems; demand for the chips jumped during the boom in cryptocurrency, whose systems also rely on their processing power. At the close of trading on Wednesday, Nvidia's market capitalization hit $ 755 billion, the fifth-highest public valuation in the United States. On Thursday, the company closed in on the trillion-dollar club, at $ 939 billion.
The A.I. rally has also lifted other chip stocks, including those for AMD, ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Since the introduction of the ChatGPT chatbot in November, the buzz around A.I. has intensified, making companies at the forefront of the technology, like Microsoft, Google and Nvidia, a popular pick among investors.
The rise in Nvidia's shares has also propelled the entire market higher, with its surge on Thursday enough to move the S&P 500 stock index up nearly 1 percent.
Nvidia's share price has more than doubled in 2023 even as concerns of a budding microchip war between Washington and Beijing hangs over the sector.
But analysts disagree on how long the rally will last. Michael Hartnett of Bank of America called the rise the start of a "baby bubble." On the other hand, researchers at Goldman Sachs said tools built on A.I. could help bolster the global economy by $ 7 trillion.
Demand for Nvidia's chips is increasing amid calls for greater oversight of A.I. technology. After meeting with top European Union officials on Wednesday, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, promised that Google would work with others to develop A.I. services responsibly.
And starting in July, New York will require companies that use A.I. for job recruitment to inform the candidates, under a new law that is being closely watched by labor advocates.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Employees of the Chinese-owned video app have regularly posted user information on a messaging and collaboration tool called Lark, according to internal documents.
In August 2021, TikTok received a complaint from a British user, who flagged that a man had been "exposing himself and playing with himself" on a livestream she hosted on the video app. She also described past abuse she had experienced.
To address the complaint, TikTok employees shared the incident on an internal messaging and collaboration tool called Lark, according to company documents obtained by The New York Times. The British woman's personal data -- including her photo, country of residence, internet protocol address, device and user IDs -- were also posted on the platform, which is similar to Slack and Microsoft Teams.
Her information was just one piece of TikTok user data shared on Lark, which is used every day by thousands of employees of the app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, including by those in China. According to the documents obtained by The Times, the driver's licenses of American users were also accessible on the platform, as were some users' potentially illegal content, such as child sexual abuse materials. In many cases, the information was available in Lark "groups" -- essentially chat rooms of employees -- with thousands of members.
The profusion of user data on Lark alarmed some TikTok employees, especially since ByteDance workers in China and elsewhere could easily see the material, according to internal reports and four current and former employees. Since at least July 2021, several security employees have warned ByteDance and TikTok executives about risks tied to the platform, according to the documents and the current and former workers.
"Should Beijing-based employees be owners of groups that contain secret" data of users, one TikTok employee asked in an internal report last July.
The user materials on Lark raise questions about TikTok's data and privacy practices and show how intertwined it is with ByteDance, just as the video app faces mounting scrutiny over its potential security risks and ties to China. Last week, Montana's governor signed a bill banning TikTok in the state as of Jan. 1. The app has also been prohibited at universities and government agencies and by the military.
TikTok has been under pressure for years to cordon off its U.S. operations because of concerns that it might provide data on American users to the Chinese authorities. To continue operating in the United States, TikTok last year submitted a plan to the Biden administration, called Project Texas, laying out how it would store American user information inside the country and wall off the data from ByteDance and TikTok employees outside the United States.
TikTok has played down the access that its China-based workers have to U.S. user data. In a congressional hearing in March, TikTok's chief executive, Shou Chew, said that such data was mainly used by engineers in China for "business purposes" and that the company had "rigorous data access protocols" for protecting users. He said much of the user information available to engineers was already public.
The internal reports and communications from Lark appear to contradict Mr. Chew's statements. Lark data from TikTok was also stored on servers in China as of late last year, the four current and former employees said.
The documents seen by The Times included dozens of screenshots of reports, chat messages and employee comments on Lark, as well as video and audio of internal communications, spanning 2019 to 2022.
Alex Haurek, a TikTok spokesman, called the documents seen by The Times "dated" and disputed that they contradicted Mr. Chew's statements. He said they did not accurately depict "how we handle protected U.S. user data, nor the progress we've made under Project Texas."
He added that TikTok was in the process of deleting U.S. user data that it collected before June 2022, when it changed the way it handled information about American users and began sending that data to U.S.-based servers owned by a third party rather than those owned by TikTok or ByteDance.
The company didn't respond to questions about whether Lark data was stored in China. It declined to answer questions about the involvement of China-based employees in creating and sharing TikTok user data in Lark groups, but said many of the chat rooms were "shut down last year after reviewing internal concerns."
Alex Stamos, the director of Stanford University's Internet Observatory and Facebook's former chief information security officer, said securing user data across an organization was "the hardest technical project" for a social media company's security team. TikTok's problems, he added, are compounded by ByteDance's ownership.
"Lark shows you that all the back-end processes are overseen by ByteDance," he said. "TikTok is a thin veneer on ByteDance."
ByteDance introduced Lark in 2017. The tool, which has a Chinese-only equivalent known as Feishu, is used by all ByteDance subsidiaries, including TikTok and its 7,000 U.S. employees. Lark features a chatting platform, videoconferencing, task management and document collaboration features. When Mr. Chew was asked about Lark in the March hearing, he said it was like "any other instant messaging tool" for corporations and compared it to Slack.
Lark has been used for handling individual TikTok account issues and sharing documents that contain personally identifiable information since at least 2019, according to the documents obtained by The Times.
In June 2019, a TikTok employee shared an image on Lark of the driver's license of a Massachusetts woman. The woman had sent TikTok the picture to verify her identity. The image -- which included her address, date of birth, photo and driver's license number -- was posted to an internal Lark group with more than 1,100 people that handled the banning and unbanning of accounts.
The driver's license, as well as passports and identification cards of people from countries including Australia and Saudi Arabia, were accessible on Lark as of last year, according to the documents seen by The Times.
Lark also exposed users' child sexual abuse materials. In one October 2019 conversation, TikTok employees discussed banning some accounts that had shared content of girls over 3 years old who were topless. Workers also posted the images on Lark.
Mr. Haurek, the TikTok spokesman, said employees were instructed to never share such content and to report it to a specialized internal child safety team.
TikTok employees have raised questions about such incidents. In an internal report last July, one worker asked if there were rules for handling user data in Lark. Will Farrell, the interim security officer of TikTok's U.S. Data Security, which will oversee U.S. user data as part of Project Texas, said, "No policy at time."
A senior security engineer at TikTok also said last fall that there could be thousands of Lark groups mishandling user data. In a recording, which The Times obtained, the engineer said TikTok needed to move the data "out of China and run Lark out of Singapore." TikTok has headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles.
Mr. Haurek called the engineer's comments "inaccurate" and said TikTok reviewed instances where Lark groups were potentially mishandling user data and took steps to address them. He said the company had a new process for handling sensitive content and had put new limits on the size of Lark groups.
TikTok's privacy and security division has undergone reorganizations and departures in the past year, which some employees said had slowed down or sidelined privacy and security projects at a critical juncture.
Roland Cloutier, a cybersecurity expert and U.S. Air Force veteran, stepped down last year as the head of TikTok's global security organization, and a portion of his unit was placed on a privacy-focused team led by Yujun Chen, known to colleagues as Woody, a China-based executive who has worked at ByteDance for years, three current and former employees said. Mr. Chen previously focused on software quality assurance.
Mr. Haurek said that Mr. Chen had "deep technical, data and product engineering expertise" and that his team reported to an executive in California. He said that TikTok had multiple teams working on privacy and security, including more than 1,500 workers on its U.S. Data Security team, and that it had spent more than $ 1.5 billion to carry out Project Texas.
ByteDance and TikTok have not said when Project Texas will be complete. When it is, TikTok said, communications involving U.S. user data will take place on a separate "internal collaboration tool."

Shield Urged For Workers Hurt by A.I.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Tens of millions of jobs could be automated by generative artificial intelligence. The makers of new technologies are looking to the government to step in.
When Congress held a series of hearings on jobs and technological advancement in October 1955, the head of a railroad worker organization took the stand to express his fears about automation. "There is uneasiness among our workers as they assess the advance of the new technology," said W.P. Kennedy, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. "Will it bring increasing unemployment rather than economic security?"
The same question could have been raised before Congress last week in its hearing on artificial intelligence. In effect, it was.
Sam Altman, chief executive of the San Francisco start-up OpenAI, testified last Tuesday before members of a Senate subcommittee, urging the government to regulate the fast-growing A.I. industry. Congressional leaders shared their worries about the threats that A.I. could pose, including the spread of misinformation and privacy violations.
One of their most emphatic concerns was job displacement: Who will assume responsibility to protect workers whose jobs might be transformed, or even eliminated, by generative A.I.?
Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, declared that his "biggest nightmare in the long term" is the job loss that A.I. could cause, before saying to Mr. Altman, "Let me ask you what your biggest nightmare is."
"There will be an impact on jobs," Mr. Altman replied. "And I think it will require partnership between the industry and government, but mostly action by government."
Mr. Altman, like so many other executives unleashing new technologies on the world, has asked the government to assume the bulk of responsibility in supporting workers through the labor market disruptions prompted by A.I. It's not yet clear how government will rise to that task.
Generative A.I. could automate activities equivalent to 300 million full-time jobs globally, according to a recent estimate by Goldman Sachs. Already the chief executive of IBM said he expected A.I. to affect white-collar clerical staffing, eliminating the need for up to 30 percent of certain roles while creating new ones. The White House on Tuesday is hosting workers for a discussion of their experiences with automation and monitoring technologies in the workplace.
Historically, when automation has led to job loss, the economic impact has tended to be offset by the creation of new jobs. Generative artificial intelligence, according to the Goldman report, could raise America's labor productivity growth by nearly 1.5 percentage points per year over a decade. It could increase annual global gross domestic product by 7 percent. It could give rise to previously unimagined creative occupations.
But there will be immense instability for displaced workers. Automation has been a significant driver of income inequality in America, according to a study from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston University. By their estimates, 50 to 70 percent of changes in the U.S. wage structure since 1980 were due to loss of income among blue-collar and office workers because of automation.
Areas of the country where robots have been adopted most intensively, particularly manufacturing-heavy parts of the Midwest, have also seen the most precipitous declines in employment, according to research from Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T.
While makers of A.I. have tended to focus on the technology's potential for job creation, many workers will experience painful disruption as they try to train for and find new roles that pay well and are fulfilling.
"We've never been in a period where the scope of automation is so wide potentially," said Harry Holzer, an economist at Georgetown. "Historically if your job gets automated, you find something new. With A.I. the thing that's kind of scary is it could simply grow and take over more tasks. It's a moving target."
Workers in administrative and clerical support may have particular cause for concern about generative A.I., according to the Goldman research. And many of them are already expressing anxieties.
"It's definitely scary," said Justin Felt, 41, a customer service worker in Pittsburgh, who has worked for Verizon Fios for nearly 12 years. He feels that employers have not been entirely upfront with their workers about the ways they are incorporating generative A.I. into customer support roles, he said. "It's definitely taking our work."
These technologies are flooding into workplaces at a rapid clip. BuzzFeed just introduced a chatbot that offers up recipe recommendations, McKinsey is helping clients use A.I. to fix technological bugs and the accounting firm KPMG is using ChatGPT to generate code. So some economists have begun putting forward proposals to protect the workers most likely to be affected.
Workers could benefit, for example, from paid leave policies that allow them to take time away from their jobs to develop new skills. Germany already has a similar program, in which workers in most German states can take at least five paid days a year for educational courses, an initiative the labor minister recently said he planned to expand.
Another possibility is a displacement tax, levied on employers when a worker's job is automated but the person is not retrained, which could make businesses more inclined to retrain workers. The government could also offer A.I. companies financial incentives to create products designed to augment what workers do, rather than replace them -- for example, A.I. that provides TV writers with research but doesn't draft scripts, which are likely to be of low quality.
"If the government sets the agenda in developing technologies that are more complementary to humans, that would be very important," Mr. Acemoglu said. "Industry is looking to the government for leadership."
The government's previous efforts to support workers through periods of job displacement have had mixed results. A study of Trade Adjustment Assistance, a U.S. government program that provides financial assistance and training for workers who lose jobs because of trade, found that manufacturing employees who temporarily dropped out of the work force to participate in the program in the early 2000s still hadn't caught up on earnings several years later compared with workers who lost jobs but didn't qualify for T.A.A. support.
Many economists say employers could also play a role in helping displaced workers.
"Business always looks to government to deal with job loss," said Simon Johnson, a professor at M.I.T. and a co-author with Mr. Acemoglu of the book "Power and Progress." "But Microsoft and Alphabet -- they are in the driver's seat, in regards to where they choose to put their technological resources."
Workers could benefit, for example, from employer apprenticeships and retraining programs. The accounting giant PwC recently announced a $ 1 billion investment in generative A.I., which includes efforts to train its 65,000 workers on how to use A.I. What spurred the initiative was the chief executive's trip to the World Economic Forum's gathering in Davos, Switzerland, where he heard constant discussion of generative A.I.
"A number of us walking out of that room knew something had changed," recalled Joe Atkinson, the company's chief products and technology officer.
PwC's workers have expressed fears about displacement, according to Mr. Atkinson, especially as their company explores automating roles with generative A.I. Mr. Atkinson stressed, though, that PwC planned to retrain people with new technical skills so their work would change but their jobs wouldn't be eliminated.
Some tech companies are offering employees courses in cloud computing, cybersecurity and generative A.I. Among them is IBM, which also has an apprenticeship program that trains workers, including those without four-year degrees, for high-paying roles in fields like software development and data science. The company C3 AI offers its 1,000 employees bonuses of $ 250 to $ 1,500 for becoming certified in technological subjects including A.I. and cloud computing. KPMG is working to train every one of its employees to use generative A.I.
Community colleges are intensifying their focus on A.I., too. Miami Dade College has received over $ 15 million in grants for its technology programs, with some of the money used to open two centers focused on preparing students for careers in A.I. Houston Community College recently announced a bachelor's degree in A.I. and robotics, and Southwest Tennessee Community College is working to create an associate degree. The American Association of Community Colleges launched an A.I. incubator network focused on helping faculty teach about A.I. and colleges create A.I. degrees.
"As Wayne Gretzky once said when asked about his success, 'I skate to where the puck is going,"' said Dennis Natali, a professor at Pikes Peak State College in Colorado, which released a plan this year to roll out A.I. certificates. "Our college constantly assesses the work force landscape and prepares to support displaced workers."
As colleges and businesses scramble to retrain workers, some experts are optimistic about this technological transition. They note that throughout history people have feared technological advancement but often ended up benefiting from it, going back to the Luddites, weavers who protested the mechanization of the textile industry.
But that doesn't mean the transition period will unfold smoothly. Michael Chui, an A.I. expert at McKinsey, pointed out that even the Luddites saw their income stagnate for decades.
"Anyone who loses their job involuntarily -- it's a difficult time," he said. "In some ways the Luddites weren't wrong about the risk."

Meta Is Fined $1.3 Billion Over E.U. Privacy Rules: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Facebook owner said it would appeal an order to stop sending data about European Union users to the United States.
Meta on Monday was fined a record 1.2 billion euros ( $ 1.3 billion) and ordered to stop transferring data collected from Facebook users in Europe to the United States, in a major ruling against the social media company for violating European Union data protection rules.
The penalty, announced by Ireland's Data Protection Commission, is potentially one of the most consequential in the five years since the European Union enacted the landmark data privacy law known as the General Data Protection Regulation. Regulators said the company failed to comply with a 2020 decision by the European Union's highest court that Facebook data shipped across the Atlantic was not sufficiently protected from American spy agencies.
But it remains unclear if or when Meta will ever need to cordon off the data of Facebook users in Europe. Meta said it would appeal the decision, setting up a potentially lengthy legal process.
At the same time, European Union and American officials are negotiating a new data-sharing pact that would provide legal protections for Meta and scores of other companies to continue moving information between the United States and Europe -- a pact that could nullify much of the European Union's ruling on Monday. A preliminary deal was announced last year.
The ruling, which comes with a grace period of at least five months before Meta needs to comply, applies only to Facebook and not to Instagram and WhatsApp, which Meta also owns. The company said there would be no immediate disruption to Facebook's service in the Europe Union.
Still, the E.U. decision shows how government policies are upending the borderless way that data has traditionally moved. As a result of data-protection rules, national security laws and other regulations, companies are increasingly being pushed to store data within the country where it is collected, rather than allowing it to move freely to data centers around the world.
The case against Meta stems from U.S. policies that give intelligence agencies the ability to intercept communications from abroad, including digital correspondence. In 2020, an Austrian privacy activist, Max Schrems, won a lawsuit to invalidate a U.S.-E.U. pact, known as Privacy Shield, that had allowed Facebook and other companies to move data between the two regions. The European Court of Justice said the risk of U.S. snooping violated the fundamental rights of European users.
"Unless U.S. surveillance laws get fixed, Meta will have to fundamentally restructure its systems," Mr. Schrems said in a statement on Monday. The solution, he said, is most likely a "federated social network" in which most personal data would stay in the European Union except for "necessary" transfers like when a European sends a direct message to somebody in the United States.
On Monday, Meta said it was being unfairly singled out for data-sharing practices used by thousands of companies.
"Without the ability to transfer data across borders, the internet risks being carved up into national and regional silos, restricting the global economy and leaving citizens in different countries unable to access many of the shared services we have come to rely on," Nick Clegg, Meta's president of global affairs, and Jennifer G. Newstead, the company's chief legal officer, said in a statement.
The ruling, which is a record fine under the General Data Protection Regulation, or G.D.P.R., could affect data related to photos, friend connections and direct messages stored by Meta. It has the potential to bruise Facebook's business in Europe, particularly if it hurts the company's ability to target ads. Last month, Susan Li, Meta's chief financial officer, told investors that about 10 percent of its worldwide ad revenue came from ads delivered to Facebook users in E.U. countries. In 2022, Meta had revenue of nearly $ 117 billion.
Meta and other companies are counting on the new data agreement between the United States and the European Union to replace the one invalidated by European courts in 2020. Last year, President Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, announced the outlines of a deal in Brussels, but the details are still being negotiated.
Without a deal, the ruling against Meta shows the legal risks that companies face in continuing to move data between the European Union and United States.
Meta faces the prospect of having to delete vast amounts of data about Facebook users in the European Union, said Johnny Ryan, senior fellow at the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. That would present technical difficulties given the interconnected nature of internet companies.
"It is hard to imagine how it can comply with this order," said Mr. Ryan, who has pushed for stronger data-protection policies.
The decision against Meta was announced almost exactly on the five-year anniversary of G.D.P.R. Many civil society groups and privacy activists have said the data privacy law, initially held up as a model, has not fulfilled its promise because of a lack of enforcement.
Much of the criticism has focused on a provision that requires regulators in the country where a company has its European Union headquarters to enforce the far-reaching privacy law. Ireland, home to the regional headquarters of Meta, TikTok, Twitter, Apple and Microsoft, has faced the most scrutiny.
On Monday, the Irish authorities said they had been overruled by a board made up of representatives from E.U. countries. The board insisted on imposing the €1.2 billion fine and forcing Meta to address past data collected about users, which could include deletion.
"The unprecedented fine is a strong signal to organizations that serious infringements have far-reaching consequences," said Andrea Jelinek, the chairwoman of the European Data Protection Board, the E.U. body that set the fine.
Meta has been a frequent target of regulators under the G.D.P.R. In January, the company was fined €390 million for forcing users to accept personalized ads as a condition of using Facebook. In November, it was fined €265 million for a data leak.

A.I.'s Help Enlisted For Video Games: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Generative A.I. is already changing how games are made, with Blizzard Entertainment training an image generator on assets from World of Warcraft, Diablo and Overwatch.
Intrigued by the potential that generative artificial intelligence holds for video game design, the studio Blizzard Entertainment has trained an image generator on its own hit titles. By feeding assets like the combative orcs of World of Warcraft, the macabre dungeons of Diablo and the vivacious heroes of Overwatch into the machine, Blizzard can effortlessly produce concept art for new ideas.
Because generative artificial intelligence creates art faster than any human can, studios like Blizzard, a division of Activision Blizzard, are hopeful that the technology can cut out some design and development drudgery and make the creation of video games more fun.
Blizzard's chief design officer, Allen Adham, told employees about the initiative last month in an email that was obtained by The New York Times. Its internal tool is called Blizzard Diffusion, a riff on Stable Diffusion, one of the popular image generators that enables anyone to turn text into art.
"Prepare to be amazed," Adham wrote, adding, "We are on the brink of a major evolution in how we build and manage our games."
Generative artificial intelligence, the technology behind tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney, uses considerable computing power to identify patterns in text or images and produce new content from the data.
Some researchers are wary of the technology, warning of copyright abuses, job displacement, and its potential to help the spread of false information. But video game developers, already relying on artificial intelligence so that nonplayer characters can make humanlike decisions, believe that harnessing generative A.I. can speed up the creative process in a labor-intensive industry plagued by delays.
There is a gaming A.I. division at Microsoft, which makes the Xbox console, and Ubisoft has built a tool called Ghostwriter that could produce basic dialogue for games like Assassin's Creed. Several start-ups say their technology can make it easier to design the look of the nonplayer characters, known as NPCs, that give video game worlds heft.
Chris Lee, the former studio head of Halo Infinite at 343 Industries, said generative A.I. could improve game development by reducing the human toil required to make an enormous open-world game.
"Game developers have never been able to keep up with the demands of our audiences," said Lee, who is now the head of immersive technologies at Amazon Web Services.
Halo Infinite was supposed to be the flagship launch game for the Xbox Series X in 2020, but its graphics were derided by fans as flat and ugly after an eight-minute preview was released. The studio ultimately delayed the game for another year.
The game's developers were miserable, Lee said, because even working on place-holder encounters required slowly moving pixels frame by frame. "To load this giant world, it's painful, it's like specialized data entry," he said.
Generative A.I. could also streamline quality assurance testing. At a recent conference for game developers, Kate Rayner, technical director for the Coalition, the studio behind Gears of War, talked about how A.I. could be used to catch bugs and glitches so players would see fewer crashes on launch day.
Many of the promises of generative A.I. are speculative, with Blizzard already abandoning machine-learning technology it had patented to create environmental textures like stone and brick.
Andrew Guerrero, Blizzard's vice president of global insights, said the tool was taking up too much artist time to be effective. But he said another A.I. tool was helping fit cosmetic headpieces to player models in World of Warcraft.
"The goal is to remove a repetitive and manual process and enable artists to spend more time on creativity," Guerrero said in a statement. "Our goal with A.I. has been, and will continue to be, to try to make creative work easier."
The internal email about Blizzard Diffusion said it was being used to help generate concept art for game environments as well as characters and their outfits. It also mentioned possible tools for "autonomous, intelligent, in-game NPCs," "procedurally assisted level design" and A.I.-assisted "voice cloning," "game coding" and "anti-toxicity."
Ghostwriter, Ubisoft's A.I. dialogue tool, was a request by writers who faced the daunting and sometimes tedious task of filling open-world games with more than 100,000 lines of dialogue, the company said.
Many of those lines are the background chatter of characters that help simulate a living world; one mundane interaction may require a dozen or more variations.
In a promotional video for Ghostwriter, an employee begins with the prompt "I used to be an adventurer like you" (a nod to an infamous line in Skyrim) and hones several suggestions by the A.I., including "I was once the most talented and famous adventurer in the land" and "I remember when I was young and strong."
These simple lines of dialogue have been a way for people to start careers in video game writing, and developers argued on social media that automating these tasks could threaten such jobs. Simon Johnson, an economist at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management who has a new book about the impact of automation, said it was a bad idea for tech companies to invent algorithms that mimic humans.
"We should be focused on machines that help humans improve human capabilities, rather than displacing people," he said.
Yves Jacquier, the executive director of Ubisoft La Forge, the research and development team responsible for Ghostwriter, said there had been a similar but unfounded fear that video game animators would be replaced when motion capture was introduced decades ago.
"While the future may involve more technology, it doesn't take away the human in the loop," Jacquier said in a statement. "Artists, writers and coders will always be at the heart of the development process, and while A.I. can now do a better job at assisting creators in their workflow, it's the artistic vision and perspective of individuals that are essential in the creation of games."
Another inescapable concern about A.I.-produced content is copyright. In one high-profile lawsuit, Getty Images has accused Stable Diffusion of scraping 12 million images from its photo database.
Employees of Activision Blizzard received an email this month from Michael Vance, its chief technology officer, that warned them not to use the company's intellectual property with external image generators. (Microsoft is looking to purchase Activision for nearly $ 70 billion, but regulators want to block the deal.)
"These new tools come with new and unknown risks, and we will proceed carefully to avoid pitfalls," Vance wrote in the email, which was obtained by The Times.
Some Activision Blizzard employees said the company's A.I. tools have not always delivered as promised, pointing to those that struggled to catch bugs or interact properly with game environments.
"Leadership's focus on A.I. doesn't feel like it is solving a problem that individual contributors care about," said Valentine Powell, a former World of Warcraft engineer who left Blizzard last August. "It feels like ignoring their problems and focusing on hype words that they think will sound impressive to shareholders."
Smaller video game studios that do not have the resources to create generative A.I. tools are turning to start-ups for help.
Scenario, which raised $ 6 million in seed funding in January, creates image databases to turn text prompts into assets -- such as a lizard in a spacesuit -- that can then be incorporated into games.
Its image generator is being used by a few small games. In tests by The Times, it sometimes spit out animated characters with unrealistic-looking hands, a common weakness for image generators.
Another start-up, Didimo, said that Soleil Game Studios, which makes fighting games based on properties like Naruto and Samurai Jack, had created hundreds of nonplayer characters using its A.I.-powered generator.
"We just automated that process, allowing them to remove the mundane jobs, because it just gets boring after a while," Sean Cooper, a Didimo developer, said.
Video games can take years to create, and it is early enough in the hype cycle that few published games have used generative A.I. But some companies like Niantic, the developer behind Pokémon Go, have experimented with the tools to create marketing materials, for instance writing a news release in Dr. Seuss's tone of voice.
Niantic also used ChatGPT while working on Peridot, a new augmented reality game that leverages '90s nostalgia for digital pets.
Kellee Santiago, Niantic's head of production, said that it was expensive to fill a room with creative people, and that the technology condensed the time needed to generate ideas.
"I, for one, am happy to have the first six hours of a brainstorm taken care of for me," she said.

Full text: Tech nerds see the current moment for artificial intelligence as similar to the time when the Netscape browser was released, stirring innovation.
/nĕt-scāpe mō-mĕnt/
A term used to describe when an under-the-hood technology that was being developed for many years is suddenly seen and recognized as disruptive and potentially revolutionary.
As Silicon Valley has been gripped by a frenzy over artificial intelligence, some techies have been trying to put this latest tech boom into perspective. One way to think about it is as A.I.'s "Netscape moment."
Here's what that means.
Essentially, there are parallels between today's fervor for A.I.-powered chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard and the excitement over the Netscape browser from the 1990s. Both allowed people to recognize the possibilities around an existing technology, leading to new innovation.
The Netscape browser was one of the first tools that helped people easily surf the World Wide Web. While the internet had been around since the 1960s, in its early days it was used mostly by academics, and it was difficult for anyone else to gain access to it.
But Netscape Navigator, developed by Marc Andreessen and released in 1994, let the general public see and smoothly browse web pages -- quickly leading to the understanding that the internet could be used by us all. That spawned the late-1990s dot-com boom, with the establishment of websites like eBay and Amazon, eventually giving rise to the internet we know today.
Chatbots have similarly made people realize the power of A.I., a technology that has been in development for decades, in fits and starts. When ChatGPT debuted last year and people tapped it to generate business plans, screenplays, poems and more, many began comprehending how A.I. could apply to their daily lives -- and also disrupt what they were doing.
Arvind Krishna, the chief executive of IBM, explained it at a speaking series last month at Duke's Fuqua School of Business.
"I kind of think of ChatGPT as doing the Netscape moment," he said. He also said that it may seem like chatbots were "overnight wonders, but there has been 30 years of hard, grinding work."
In the past few months, Microsoft, Google, Meta and others have pushed harder into the A.I. race. Venture capitalists are pouring money into A.I. start-ups. And companies, universities and schools have realized they must adjust how they do things because of this A.I. wave.
Some techies have likened the A.I. boom to an "iPhone moment," referring to how the Apple device, which was introduced in 2007, led to an avalanche of mobile apps. But to nerds like me, that's not quite right because the iPhone was a hardware trigger, rather than an under-the-hood technology like a browser or chatbot. That's why a "Netscape moment" seems a more apt analogy.

Meta's Big A.I. Giveaway: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The tech giant has publicly released its latest A.I. technology so people can build their own chatbots. Rivals like Google say that approach can be dangerous.
In February, Meta made an unusual move in the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence: It decided to give away its A.I. crown jewels.
The Silicon Valley giant, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, had created an A.I. technology, called LLaMA, that can power online chatbots. But instead of keeping the technology to itself, Meta released the system's underlying computer code into the wild. Academics, government researchers and others who gave their email address to Meta could download the code once the company had vetted the individual.
Essentially, Meta was giving its A.I. technology away as open-source software -- computer code that can be freely copied, modified and reused -- providing outsiders with everything they needed to quickly build chatbots of their own.
"The platform that will win will be the open one," Yann LeCun, Meta's chief A.I. scientist, said in an interview.
As a race to lead A.I. heats up across Silicon Valley, Meta is standing out from its rivals by taking a different approach to the technology. Driven by its founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta believes that the smartest thing to do is share its underlying A.I. engines as a way to spread its influence and ultimately move faster toward the future.
Its actions contrast with those of Google and OpenAI, the two companies leading the new A.I. arms race. Worried that A.I. tools like chatbots will be used to spread disinformation, hate speech and other toxic content, those companies are becoming increasingly secretive about the methods and software that underpin their A.I. products.
Google, OpenAI and others have been critical of Meta, saying an unfettered open-source approach is dangerous. A.I.'s rapid rise in recent months has raised alarm bells about the technology's risks, including how it could upend the job market if it is not properly deployed. And within days of LLaMA's release, the system leaked onto 4chan, the online message board known for spreading false and misleading information.
"We want to think more carefully about giving away details or open sourcing code" of A.I. technology, said Zoubin Ghahramani, a Google vice president of research who helps oversee A.I. work. "Where can that lead to misuse?"
Some within Google have also wondered if open-sourcing A.I. technology may pose a competitive threat. In a memo this month, which was leaked on the online publication Semianalysis.com, a Google engineer warned colleagues that the rise of open-source software like LLaMA could cause Google and OpenAI to lose their lead in A.I.
But Meta said it saw no reason to keep its code to itself. The growing secrecy at Google and OpenAI is a "huge mistake," Dr. LeCun said, and a "really bad take on what is happening." He argues that consumers and governments will refuse to embrace A.I. unless it is outside the control of companies like Google and Meta.
"Do you want every A.I. system to be under the control of a couple of powerful American companies?" he asked.
OpenAI declined to comment.
Meta's open-source approach to A.I. is not novel. The history of technology is littered with battles between open source and proprietary, or closed, systems. Some hoard the most important tools that are used to build tomorrow's computing platforms, while others give those tools away. Most recently, Google open-sourced the Android mobile operating system to take on Apple's dominance in smartphones.
Many companies have openly shared their A.I. technologies in the past, at the insistence of researchers. But their tactics are changing because of the race around A.I. That shift began last year when OpenAI released ChatGPT. The chatbot's wild success wowed consumers and kicked up the competition in the A.I. field, with Google moving quickly to incorporate more A.I. into its products and Microsoft investing $ 13 billion in OpenAI.
While Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have since received most of the attention in A.I., Meta has also invested in the technology for nearly a decade. The company has spent billions of dollars building the software and the hardware needed to realize chatbots and other "generative A.I.," which produce text, images and other media on their own.
In recent months, Meta has worked furiously behind the scenes to weave its years of A.I. research and development into new products. Mr. Zuckerberg is focused on making the company an A.I. leader, holding weekly meetings on the topic with his executive team and product leaders.
On Thursday, in a sign of its commitment to A.I., Meta said it had designed a new computer chip and improved a new supercomputer specifically for building A.I. technologies. It is also designing a new computer data center with an eye toward the creation of A.I.
"We've been building advanced infrastructure for A.I. for years now, and this work reflects long-term efforts that will enable even more advances and better use of this technology across everything we do," Mr. Zuckerberg said.
Meta's biggest A.I. move in recent months was releasing LLaMA, which is what is known as a large language model, or L.L.M. (LLaMA stands for "Large Language Model Meta AI.") L.L.M.s are systems that learn skills by analyzing vast amounts of text, including books, Wikipedia articles and chat logs. ChatGPT and Google's Bard chatbot are also built atop such systems.
L.L.M.s pinpoint patterns in the text they analyze and learn to generate text of their own, including term papers, blog posts, poetry and computer code. They can even carry on complex conversations.
In February, Meta openly released LLaMA, allowing academics, government researchers and others who provided their email address to download the code and use it to build a chatbot of their own.
But the company went further than many other open-source A.I. projects. It allowed people to download a version of LLaMA after it had been trained on enormous amounts of digital text culled from the internet. Researchers call this "releasing the weights," referring to the particular mathematical values learned by the system as it analyzes data.
This was significant because analyzing all that data typically requires hundreds of specialized computer chips and tens of millions of dollars, resources most companies do not have. Those who have the weights can deploy the software quickly, easily and cheaply, spending a fraction of what it would otherwise cost to create such powerful software.
As a result, many in the tech industry believed Meta had set a dangerous precedent. And within days, someone released the LLaMA weights onto 4chan.
At Stanford University, researchers used Meta's new technology to build their own A.I. system, which was made available on the internet. A Stanford researcher named Moussa Doumbouya soon used it to generate problematic text, according to screenshots seen by The New York Times. In one instance, the system provided instructions for disposing of a dead body without being caught. It also generated racist material, including comments that supported the views of Adolf Hitler.
In a private chat among the researchers, which was seen by The Times, Mr. Doumbouya said distributing the technology to the public would be like "a grenade available to everyone in a grocery store." He did not respond to a request for comment.
Stanford promptly removed the A.I. system from the internet. The project was designed to provide researchers with technology that "captured the behaviors of cutting-edge A.I. models," said Tatsunori Hashimoto, the Stanford professor who led the project. "We took the demo down as we became increasingly concerned about misuse potential beyond a research setting."
Dr. LeCun argues that this kind of technology is not as dangerous as it might seem. He said small numbers of individuals could already generate and spread disinformation and hate speech. He added that toxic material could be tightly restricted by social networks such as Facebook.
"You can't prevent people from creating nonsense or dangerous information or whatever," he said. "But you can stop it from being disseminated."
For Meta, more people using open-source software can also level the playing field as it competes with OpenAI, Microsoft and Google. If every software developer in the world builds programs using Meta's tools, it could help entrench the company for the next wave of innovation, staving off potential irrelevance.
Dr. LeCun also pointed to recent history to explain why Meta was committed to open-sourcing A.I. technology. He said the evolution of the consumer internet was the result of open, communal standards that helped build the fastest, most widespread knowledge-sharing network the world had ever seen.
"Progress is faster when it is open," he said. "You have a more vibrant ecosystem where everyone can contribute."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tech executive and lawmakers agreed that new A.I. systems must be regulated. Just how that would happen is not yet clear.
The tone of congressional hearings featuring tech industry executives in recent years can best be described as antagonistic. Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and other tech luminaries have all been dressed down on Capitol Hill by lawmakers upset with their companies.
But on Tuesday, Sam Altman, the chief executive of the San Francisco start-up OpenAI, testified before members of a Senate subcommittee and largely agreed with them on the need to regulate the increasingly powerful A.I. technology being created inside his company and others like Google and Microsoft.
In his first testimony before Congress, Mr. Altman implored lawmakers to regulate artificial intelligence as members of the committee displayed a budding understanding of the technology. The hearing underscored the deep unease felt by technologists and government over A.I.'s potential harms. But that unease did not extend to Mr. Altman, who had a friendly audience in the members of the subcommittee.
The appearance of Mr. Altman, a 38-year-old Stanford University dropout and tech entrepreneur, was his christening as the leading figure in A.I. The boyish-looking Mr. Altman traded in his usual pullover sweater and jeans for a blue suit and tie for the three-hour hearing.
Mr. Altman also talked about his company's technology at a dinner with dozens of House members on Monday night, and met privately with a number of senators before the hearing, according to people who attended the dinner and the meetings. He offered a loose framework to manage what happens next with the fast-developing systems that some believe could fundamentally change the economy.
"I think if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong. And we want to be vocal about that," he said. "We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening."
Mr. Altman made his public debut on Capitol Hill as interest in A.I. has exploded. Tech giants have poured effort and billions of dollars into what they say is a transformative technology, even amid rising concerns about A.I.'s role in spreading misinformation, killing jobs and one day matching human intelligence.
That has thrust the technology into the spotlight in Washington. President Biden this month said at a meeting with a group of chief executives of A.I. companies that "what you're doing has enormous potential and enormous danger." Top leaders in Congress have also promised A.I. regulations.
That members of the Senate subcommittee for privacy, technology and the law did not plan on a rough grilling for Mr. Altman was clear as they thanked Mr. Altman for his private meetings with them and for agreeing to appear in the hearing. Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, repeatedly referred to Mr. Altman by his first name.
Mr. Altman was joined at the hearing by Christina Montgomery, IBM's chief privacy and trust officer, and Gary Marcus, a well-known professor and frequent critic of A.I. technology.
Mr. Altman said his company's technology may destroy some jobs but also create new ones, and that it will be important for "government to figure out how we want to mitigate that." Echoing an idea suggested by Dr. Marcus, he proposed the creation of an agency that issues licenses for the development of large-scale A.I. models, safety regulations and tests that A.I. models must pass before being released to the public.
"We believe that the benefits of the tools we have deployed so far vastly outweigh the risks, but ensuring their safety is vital to our work," Mr. Altman said.
But it was unclear how lawmakers would respond to the call to regulate A.I. The track record of Congress on tech regulations is grim. Dozens of privacy, speech and safety bills have failed over the past decade because of partisan bickering and fierce opposition by tech giants.
The United States has trailed the globe on regulations in privacy, speech and protections for children. It is also behind on A.I. regulations. Lawmakers in the European Union are set to introduce rules for the technology later this year. And China has created A.I. laws that comply with its censorship laws.
Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate panel, said the hearing was the first in a series to learn more about the potential benefits and harms of A.I. to eventually "write the rules" for it.
He also acknowledged Congress's failure to keep up with the introduction of new technologies in the past. "Our goal is to demystify and hold accountable those new technologies to avoid some of the mistakes of the past," Mr. Blumenthal said. "Congress failed to meet the moment on social media."
Members of the subcommittee suggested an independent agency to oversee A.I.; rules that force companies to disclose how their models work and the data sets they use; and antitrust rules to prevent companies like Microsoft and Google from monopolizing the nascent market.
"The devil will be in the details," said Sarah Myers West, managing director of AI Now Institute, a policy research center. She said Mr. Altman's suggestions for regulations don't go far enough and should include limits on how A.I. is used in policing and the use of biometric data. She noted that Mr. Altman didn't show any indication of slowing down the development of OpenAI's ChatGPT tool.
"It's such an irony seeing a posture about the concern of harms by people who are rapidly releasing into commercial use the system responsible for those very harms," Ms. West said.
Some lawmakers in the hearing still displayed the persistent gap in technological know-how between Washington and Silicon Valley. Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, repeatedly asked witnesses if a speech liability shield for online platforms like Facebook and Google also applies to A.I.
Mr. Altman, calm and unruffled, tried several times to draw a distinction between A.I. and social media. "We need to work together to find a totally new approach," he said.
Some subcommittee members also showed a reluctance to clamp down too strongly on an industry with great economic promise for the United States and that competes directly with adversaries such as China.
The Chinese are creating A.I. that "reinforce the core values of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese system," said Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. "And I'm concerned about how we promote A.I. that reinforces and strengthens open markets, open societies and democracy."
Some of the toughest questions and comments toward Mr. Altman came from Dr. Marcus, who noted OpenAI hasn't been transparent about the data its uses to develop its systems. He expressed doubt in Mr. Altman's prediction that new jobs will replace those killed off by A.I.
"We have unprecedented opportunities here but we are also facing a perfect storm of corporate irresponsibility, widespread deployment, lack of adequate regulation and inherent unreliability," Dr. Marcus said.
Tech companies have argued that Congress should be careful with any broad rules that lump different kinds of A.I. together. In Tuesday's hearing, Ms. Montgomery of IBM called for an A.I. law that is similar to Europe's proposed regulations, which outlines various levels of risk. She called for rules that focus on specific uses, not regulating the technology itself.
"At its core, A.I. is just a tool, and tools can serve different purposes," she said, adding that Congress should take a "precision regulation approach to A.I."

S.I. Newhouse Auction Draws a Muted Response: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There were few fireworks at the sale of paintings from Condé Nast's former chairman. Next week's sales will test whether the 'crazy money' of the past has disappeared.
One might expect paintings from the illustrious collection of the late magazine publisher S.I. Newhouse Jr. -- by Picasso, de Kooning, Lichtenstein and Bacon, among others -- to generate some fireworks in the art market.
Yet even with that provenance, the Thursday evening sale at Christie's that kicked off the spring 2023 auction season was muted. Most of the 16 lots went for solid if predictable prices at, or just above, their estimates, for a total of $ 177.8 million. This may well be because the market has cooled in response to recession fears and spending sprees during the pandemic.
But it is also because every item had been guaranteed -- essentially presold to buyers who had promised to pay undisclosed minimum prices -- adding credence to the increasingly common lament that sales have lost the suspense that used to animate bidding in the room and make auctions exciting.
While they may dampen the sense of spectacle, guarantees are now considered a staple of the auction market, as they enable sellers to hedge their risk should consignments go unsold.
In stark contrast to the high-flying $ 100 million masterpieces recorded recently -- and the explosive prices paid for art owned by Microsoft's co-founder, Paul G. Allen, last November -- Thursday night's sale was Roman candles. The highest estimate in the Christie's sale was about $ 25 million for Willem de Kooning's 1947 black-and-white "Orestes."
That important early painting -- said to have marked the artist's transition from figuration to abstraction -- sold for $ 30.9 million with fees, with back-and-forth bids by phone.
The highest price of the evening was $ 34.6 million with fees, for a 1969 self-portrait by Francis Bacon. (The total for the evening was midway between Christie's high estimate of $ 202 million and its low estimate of $ 142 million.)
Since Newhouse's death, in 2017, his estate has been selling works privately and at auction under the guidance of the former prominent Sotheby's auctioneer Tobias Meyer. Thursday's sale was the third group of consignments. Newhouse's 1986 Jeff Koons "Rabbit" sculpture, for example, set an auction high for the artist when it sold for $ 91 million at Christie's in 2109.
Other highlights included Picasso's colorful "L'Arlésienne (Lee Miller)," one of seven portraits Picasso painted of the American photographer Lee Miller as an Arlésienne during a 1937 trip. The piece sold for $ 24.6 million on an estimate of $ 20 million to $ 30 million.
"That's not a picture for everyone -- it's too wild for some people," the collector Alberto Mugrabi said, remarking on the low-energy bidding for the work. But he added, "I loved it."
The painting also had a peculiar back story. Legend has it that Miller accidentally stepped into oncoming traffic and was pulled to safety by Condé Nast himself, who signed her as a Vogue model. She later studied photography under Man Ray and entered into a relationship with him. "We lived together for three years," Miller later recalled. "I was known as Madame Man Ray, because that's how they do things in France."
Christie's executives were banking on the appetites of collectors for irreplaceable works. Max Carter, the company's vice chairman for 20th- and 21st-century art, said the sale had been brokered in the wake of the Allen sale, which hit the $ 1.5 billion mark at Christie's in November, making it the biggest sale in auction history. "Those were results we could work on," Carter said.
Not everyone believes that the market can handle more blockbuster sales. "There might be more supply than demand for objects that aren't total masterpieces," said Joshua Holdeman, an art adviser. "The auction didn't feel like it had the frothiness expected from a collection sale where everything sells for four or five times its estimate."
The art adviser Todd Levin participated in the auction on behalf of two clients, but he ultimately withdrew from bidding. He had previously told Christie's that its estimates for three Jasper Johns paintings were too high. All three works failed to reach their low estimates.
"I was underwhelmed" about the auction, he said.
Still, the art market has defied the basic rules of economics before, and experts pointed out that exceptional artworks could still outmaneuver logic. Artworks in the Newhouse trove that qualified as remarkable paintings included one of Lee Bontecou's haunting canvas contortions, which sold for $ 8.7 million (estimated at $ 3 million to $ 5 million )
Despite the lackluster tenor of the Newhouse sale, the coming auction week is expected to bring nearly $ 2 billion into the art market. The second auction Christie's held on Thursday night, for its 20th century offerings, raised $ 328.8 million -- a healthy number but not an explosively high one.
Holdeman, who previously worked at Christie's and Sotheby's, said the market was in a recalibration period because of economic uncertainty and an overstuffed season of paintings. "Everyone will need to take a careful look at their estimates and reserves," he observed. "The auctions are carefully orchestrated with evenly leveraged sales," he added. "But there is not crazy money out there like before."

Wall St. Muddles Through Inflation Report: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/wall-st-muddles-through-inflation-report/docview/2811808125/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A mixed day of trading left Wall Street slightly higher on Wednesday after a report showed inflation is making strides toward easing, even if it remains high.
The S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent after swinging between gains and losses through the day. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1 percent while the Nasdaq composite rallied by 1 percent.
Bond prices climbed after the highly anticipated report said inflation at the consumer level edged down to 4.9 percent last month, its lowest level in two years. That was slightly better than economists expected, and other underlying measures of inflation also came in very close to forecasts.
Because of that, Wall Street still sees the door open for the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates alone at its next meeting in June. That would be the first time it hasn't raised rates at a meeting in more than a year, and a pause would offer some breathing room for the economy and financial markets.
"The concern coming in was that it would be hotter than feared," said Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at Baird. "While not exactly an exciting report, I think there was enough good news baked in that it shouldn't impact the Fed or the economic trajectory all that much."
The Fed has jacked up rates at a furious pace in hopes of driving down inflation. But high rates do that by slowing the entire economy and hitting investment prices broadly. They've already sent stock prices tumbling, caused turmoil in the banking system and dragged on the economy enough that many investors expect a recession to hit this year.
Following the report, traders raised the probability they see of the Fed holding rates steady in June to nearly 94 percent, according to data from CME Group.
Stocks that benefit the most from an easing of interest rates led the way on Wall Street, including Big Tech and other high-growth stocks. Amazon's 3.3 percent rise and Microsoft's 1.7 percent climb were the two biggest forces lifting the S&P 500.
On the losing end of Wall Street, Lincoln National fell 3.9 percent after reporting weaker profit for the latest quarter than expected.
Airbnb dropped 10.9 percent despite reporting profit that matched analysts' forecasts. It gave financial forecasts for the current quarter that were weaker than some on Wall Street expected.
Most companies in the S&P 500 have topped profit forecasts so far this reporting season, which is approaching its final stretch. But they're still on pace to report an overall drop in earnings from a year earlier, which would be the second straight quarter that has happened.
Icahn Enterprises, the partnership run by the activist investor Carl Icahn, sank 15.1 percent after disclosing that federal prosecutors asked for information related to its corporate governance and other matters.
The request from the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York came a day after a short-selling research firm, Hindenburg Research, accused Icahn Enterprises of inflating the value of some of its investments. Icahn called the accusations misleading and self-serving and published a rebuttal Wednesday.
In the bond market, increased hopes for a coming pause from the Fed on rates pushed yields lower.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, fell to 3.43 percent. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for Fed action, fell to 3.9 percent.
Besides worries about interest rates and inflation, some corners of the bond market are also swinging on concerns about the U.S. government inching closer to a possible default on its debt. That has never happened before, and economists warn that a default could be catastrophic for the economy and financial markets.

LinkedIn Opts To Pare Down China Presence Amid Adversity: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Microsoft, LinkedIn's owner, had already pulled the flagship networking site from China in 2021, leaving only a stripped-down app that catered to job seekers.
LinkedIn, the networking platform used by millions of employees and companies, said on Monday it will pare down its operations in China, capping a multiyear pullback that exemplified the challenges of running a foreign business in China.
The company, owned by Microsoft, said it will lay off 716 employees worldwide, including teams dedicated to engineering and marketing in China, because of slumping demand. It did not say how many of those layoffs will be in China.
LinkedIn will also shut its China job posting app, a bare-bones version of its international service, by August. Users of the app, called InCareer, could only search for jobs and not post or share articles the way they can on LinkedIn.
When LinkedIn started a Chinese-language version of its website in 2014, it charted a path that its peers, including Facebook and Google, had shied away from. It partnered with local firms and began censoring the content of millions of Chinese customers in accordance with Beijing's strict laws. Several U.S. journalists and activists said their profiles had been blocked because of "prohibited content." The company said at the time that while it opposed government censorship, its absence in the country could deprive Chinese professionals of the chance to make professional connections.
Yet over the years, the challenges for foreign and domestic social media platforms multiplied as the power of China's censorship machine ballooned under its leader, Xi Jinping. In 2021, LinkedIn closed its flagship networking service in China, citing compliance issues and a "significantly more challenging operating environment."
In a letter to employees, Ryan Roslansky, LinkedIn's chief executive, said the cuts were prompted by slower revenue growth and fluctuations in customer behavior. The news follows an overall slowdown in tech that has led to tens of thousands of layoffs this year by the largest companies, including Amazon, Meta and Google.
LinkedIn, which employs about 20,000 people, said Monday that while it was reducing operations in China and other countries, it plans to create 250 jobs in other areas.
Mr. Roslansky said it will retain a presence in China to help companies operating in the country hire and train employees from overseas.

Full text: Deep in a pine forest in Wilcox County, Ala., three workers dangled from the top of a 350-foot cellular tower. They were there to rip out and replace Chinese equipment from the local wireless network.
Three hours into the job, the team ran into a hitch. Replacement gear from a European company was obstructing a safety beacon for airplanes. "We've got a problem," a crew member on the ground said. "They say it's blocking the beacon."
The project had already been delayed for months because of storms, slow equipment shipments and labor shortages. The new snafu, discovered early this month, would add at least two more days and blow the budget, said John Nettles, the president of the family-owned Pine Belt Cellular, who was standing at the base of the tower.
"People in Washington think it's easy to just swap out the equipment, but there are always problems you didn't expect, always more expenses and always delays," he said.
As the United States and China battle for geopolitical and technological primacy, the fallout has reached rural Alabama and small wireless carriers in dozens of states. They are on the receiving end of the Biden administration's sweeping policies to suppress China's rise, which include trade restrictions, a $ 52 billion package to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing against China and the divestiture of the video app TikTok from its Chinese owner.
What the wireless carriers must do, under a program known as "rip and replace," has become the starkest physical manifestation of the tech Cold War between the two superpowers. The program, which took effect in 2020, mandates that American companies tear out telecom equipment made by the Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE. U.S. officials have warned that gear from those companies could be used by Beijing for espionage and to steal commercial secrets.
Instead, U.S. carriers have to use equipment from non-Chinese companies. The Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the program, would then reimburse the carriers from a pot of $ 1.9 billion intended to cover their costs.
Similar rip-and-replace efforts are taking place elsewhere. In Europe, where Huawei products have been a key part of telecom networks, carriers in Belgium, Britain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden have also been swapping out the Chinese equipment because of security concerns, according to Strand Consult, a research firm that tracks the telecom industry.
"Rip-and-replace was the first front in a bigger story about the U.S. and China's decoupling, and that story will continue into the next decade with a global race for A.I. and other technologies," said Blair Levin, a former F.C.C. chief of staff and a fellow at the Brookings Institution.
But cleansing U.S. networks of Chinese tech has not been easy. The costs have already ballooned above $ 5 billion, according to the F.C.C., more than double what Congress appropriated for reimbursements. Many carriers also face long supply chain delays for new equipment.
The program's burden has fallen disproportionately on smaller carriers, which relied more on the cheaper gear from the Chinese firms than large companies like AT&T and Verizon. Given rip-and-replace's difficulties, some smaller wireless companies now say they may not be able to upgrade their networks and continue serving their communities, where they are often the only internet providers.
"For many rural communities, they are faced with the disastrous choice of having to continue to use insecure networks that are ripe for surveillance or having to cut off their services," said Geoffrey Starks, a Democratic commissioner at the F.C.C.
Last month, Senator Deb Fischer, a Republican of Nebraska, introduced a bill to close the gap in rip-and-replace funding for carriers. Passing it will be challenging, with similar legislation failing twice over the past year and fierce debate in Washington over government spending and the debt ceiling. But "we have to follow up," Ms. Fischer said. "Some of these carriers could go out of business."
The scrutiny of Chinese telecom companies goes back more than a decade. In 2012, a Congressional committee issued a report on Huawei and ZTE warning of the companies' ties to Beijing. In 2019, former President Donald J. Trump restricted U.S. companies from selling goods to the Chinese firms, while the F.C.C. banned companies that receive federal subsidies from buying Huawei and ZTE equipment. The agency expanded those restrictions last year to limit all imports from the Chinese companies.
Rip-and-replace rolled out after Congress passed a law in January 2020 creating the reimbursement effort. But costs from the program quickly soared.
In January, the F.C.C. said it had received 126 applications seeking funding beyond what it could reimburse. Lawmakers had underestimated the costs of shredding Huawei and ZTE equipment, and new equipment and labor costs have risen. The F.C.C. said it could cover only about 40 percent of the expenses.
Some wireless carriers immediately paused their replacement efforts. "Until we have assurance of total project funding, this project will continue to be delayed as we await the necessary funding required to build and pay for the new network equipment," United Wireless of Dodge City, Kan., wrote in a regulatory filing to the F.C.C. in January.
Huawei declined to comment; ZTE didn't respond to a request for comment.
In southern Alabama's Black Belt region, known for its historical cotton plantations and paper mills, complying with rip-and-replace has been a central initiative at Pine Belt Cellular, one of the few wireless carriers for 2,000 homes and businesses in five counties.
The company was founded in 1958 by James Nettles, a country doctor in Arlington who installed phone lines into the homes of patients so they could call him for home visits.
After James Nettles's son, John Nettles, joined the phone business in 1988, the family expanded into wireless service with federal grants. In 2011, John Nettles took additional F.C.C. subsidies and upgraded Pine Belt's network to include broadband for fast internet service.
Six equipment manufacturers pitched their gear to him, he said. Mr. Nettles chose ZTE because the company offered equipment at less than half the cost of other bids. Pine Belt initially bought $ 5 million in ZTE equipment, including hundreds of antennas, radios and other gear for its 67 cell towers.
The F.C.C. "told me to find the cheapest equipment, and no one thought twice about ZTE being Chinese," he said.
But since restrictions on ZTE gear were introduced, Mr. Nettles has spent most of his time trying to replace it with equipment from Western companies like Nokia and Microsoft.
At Pine Belt's central networking hub, a windowless cinder block building in downtown Selma, seven large metal bins recently overflowed with ZTE servers, processors and switches, the gear that moves internet traffic around and connects calls. There were also racks of new Nokia and Microsoft equipment and Dell computers. The Chinese and Western-made technology will operate simultaneously until Pine Belt can completely rid its cell towers of ZTE equipment.
In 2021, Pine Belt applied for $ 68 million in reimbursements from the F.C.C. for the replacement effort. But last July, the agency said that it could only refund costs of up to $ 27 million. Pine Belt is about 15 percent into its transition away from Chinese equipment and is already $ 5 million over the F.C.C.'s budget, Mr. Nettles said.
Early this month, Mr. Nettles drove 15 miles to a rusting 300-foot tower where two workers were preparing to tear out Chinese gear. Rigged with ropes and pulleys, they planned to climb the tower to assess if it could hold the weight of an additional three antennas and radio equipment from Nokia.
The workers decided they had to pour cement under the tower to create a stronger base for the additional load. The tower will have to hold the old ZTE and new Nokia equipment during the rip-and-replace work to prevent any service interruptions.
As Mr. Nettles parked near the tower, a customer in Selma called to complain that his cell service was cutting in and out. The customer was between one tower with ZTE equipment and another with Nokia equipment.
"The ZTE and Nokia equipment aren't communicating well with each other," Mr. Nettles tried to explain. "Sorry about the inconvenience."

ARLINGTON, Ala. — Deep in a pine forest in Wilcox County, Alabama, three workers dangled from the top of a 350-foot cellular tower. They were there to rip out and replace Chinese equipment from the local wireless network.

If Some Dangers Posed by A.I. Are Already Here, Then What Lies Ahead?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A recent letter calling for a moratorium on A.I. development blends real threats with speculation. But concern is growing among experts.
In late March, more than 1,000 technology leaders, researchers and other pundits working in and around artificial intelligence signed an open letter warning that A.I. technologies present "profound risks to society and humanity."
The group, which included Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive and the owner of Twitter, urged A.I. labs to halt development of their most powerful systems for six months so that they could better understand the dangers behind the technology.
"Powerful A.I. systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable," the letter said.
The letter, which now has over 27,000 signatures, was brief. Its language was broad. And some of the names behind the letter seemed to have a conflicting relationship with A.I. Mr. Musk, for example, is building his own A.I. start-up, and he is one of the primary donors to the organization that wrote the letter.
But the letter represented a growing concern among A.I. experts that the latest systems, most notably GPT-4, the technology introduced by the San Francisco start-up OpenAI, could cause harm to society. They believed future systems will be even more dangerous.
Some of the risks have arrived. Others will not for months or years. Still others are purely hypothetical.
"Our ability to understand what could go wrong with very powerful A.I. systems is very weak," said Yoshua Bengio, a professor and A.I. researcher at the University of Montreal. "So we need to be very careful."
Why Are They Worried?
Dr. Bengio is perhaps the most important person to have signed the letter.
Working with two other academics -- Geoffrey Hinton, until recently a researcher at Google, and Yann LeCun, now chief A.I. scientist at Meta, the owner of Facebook -- Dr. Bengio spent the past four decades developing the technology that drives systems like GPT-4. In 2018, the researchers received the Turing Award, often called "the Nobel Prize of computing," for their work on neural networks.
A neural network is a mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing data. About five years ago, companies like Google, Microsoft and OpenAI began building neural networks that learned from huge amounts of digital text called large language models, or L.L.M.s.
By pinpointing patterns in that text, L.L.M.s learn to generate text on their own, including blog posts, poems and computer programs. They can even carry on a conversation.
This technology can help computer programmers, writers and other workers generate ideas and do things more quickly. But Dr. Bengio and other experts also warned that L.L.M.s can learn unwanted and unexpected behaviors.
These systems can generate untruthful, biased and otherwise toxic information. Systems like GPT-4 get facts wrong and make up information, a phenomenon called "hallucination."
Companies are working on these problems. But experts like Dr. Bengio worry that as researchers make these systems more powerful, they will introduce new risks.
Short-Term Risk: Disinformation
Because these systems deliver information with what seems like complete confidence, it can be a struggle to separate truth from fiction when using them. Experts are concerned that people will rely on these systems for medical advice, emotional support and the raw information they use to make decisions.
"There is no guarantee that these systems will be correct on any task you give them," said Subbarao Kambhampati, a professor of computer science at Arizona State University.
Experts are also worried that people will misuse these systems to spread disinformation. Because they can converse in humanlike ways, they can be surprisingly persuasive.
"We now have systems that can interact with us through natural language, and we can't distinguish the real from the fake," Dr. Bengio said.
Medium-Term Risk: Job Loss
Experts are worried that the new A.I. could be job killers. Right now, technologies like GPT-4 tend to complement human workers. But OpenAI acknowledges that they could replace some workers, including people who moderate content on the internet.
They cannot yet duplicate the work of lawyers, accountants or doctors. But they could replace paralegals, personal assistants and translators.
A paper written by OpenAI researchers estimated that 80 percent of the U.S. work force could have at least 10 percent of their work tasks affected by L.L.M.s and that 19 percent of workers might see at least 50 percent of their tasks impacted.
"There is an indication that rote jobs will go away," said Oren Etzioni, the founding chief executive of the Allen Institute for AI, a research lab in Seattle.
Long-Term Risk: Loss of Control
Some people who signed the letter also believe artificial intelligence could slip outside our control or destroy humanity. But many experts say that's wildly overblown.
The letter was written by a group from the Future of Life Institute, an organization dedicated to exploring existential risks to humanity. They warn that because A.I. systems often learn unexpected behavior from the vast amounts of data they analyze, they could pose serious, unexpected problems.
They worry that as companies plug L.L.M.s into other internet services, these systems could gain unanticipated powers because they could write their own computer code. They say developers will create new risks if they allow powerful A.I. systems to run their own code.
"If you look at a straightforward extrapolation of where we are now to three years from now, things are pretty weird," said Anthony Aguirre, a theoretical cosmologist and physicist at the University of California, Santa Cruz and co-founder of the Future of Life Institute.
"If you take a less probable scenario -- where things really take off, where there is no real governance, where these systems turn out to be more powerful than we thought they would be -- then things get really, really crazy," he said.
Dr. Etzioni said talk of existential risk was hypothetical. But he said other risks -- most notably disinformation -- were no longer speculation.
"Now we have some real problems," he said. "They are bona fide. They require some responsible reaction. They may require regulation and legislation."

Turning Over Her Office Inbox to A.I.: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Inbox management can be mind-numbing. You might have wondered, couldn't a robot do this?
Five hours is enough time to watch a Mets game. It is enough time to listen to the Spice Girls' "Spice" album (40 minutes), Paul Simon's "Paul Simon" album (42 minutes) and Gustav Mahler's third symphony (his longest). It is enough time to roast a chicken, text your friends that you've roasted a chicken and prepare for an impromptu dinner party.
Or you could spend it checking your email. Five hours is about how long many workers spend on email each day. And 90 minutes on the messaging platform Slack.
It's a weird thing, workplace chatter like email and Slack: It's sometimes the most delightful and human part of the work day. It can also be mind-numbing to manage your inbox -- to the extent you might wonder, couldn't a robot do this?
In late April, I decided to see what it would be like to let artificial intelligence into my life. I resolved to do an experiment. For one week, I would write all my work communication -- emails, Slack messages, pitches, follow-ups with sources -- through ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence language model from the research lab OpenAI. I didn't tell colleagues until the end of the week (except in a few instances of personal weakness). I downloaded a Chrome extension that drafted email responses directly into my inbox. But most of the time, I ended up writing detailed prompts into ChatGPT, asking it to be either witty or formal depending on the situation.
What resulted was a roller coaster, emotionally and in terms of the amount of content I was generating. I started the week inundating my teammates (sorry) to see how they would react. At a certain point, I lost patience with the bot and developed a newfound appreciation for phone calls.
My bot, unsurprisingly, couldn't match the emotional tone of any online conversation. And I spend a lot of the week, because of hybrid work, having online conversations.
The impulse to chat with teammates all day isn't wrong. Most people know the thrill (and also, usefulness) of office friendships from psychologists, economists, TV sitcoms and our own lives; my colleague sends me photos of her baby in increasingly chic onesies every few days, and nothing makes me happier. But the amount of time workers feel they must devote to digitally communicating is undoubtedly excessive -- and for some, easy to make the case for handing over to artificial intelligence.
.
The release of generative A.I. tools has raised all sorts of enormous and thorny questions about work. There are fears about what jobs will be replaced by A.I. in 10 years -- Paralegals? Personal assistants? Movie and television writers are currently on strike, and one issue they're fighting for is limiting the use of A.I. by the studios. There are also fears about the toxic and untruthful information A.I. can spread in an online ecosystem already rife with misinformation.
The question driving my experiment was far narrower: Will we miss our old ways of working if A.I. takes over the drudgery of communication? And would my colleagues even know, or would they be Chatfished?
My experiment started on a Monday morning with a friendly Slack message from an editor in Seoul who had sent me the link to a study analyzing humor across more than 2,000 TED and TEDx Talks. "Pity the researchers," the editor wrote to me. I asked ChatGPT to say something clever in reply, and the robot wrote: "I mean, I love a good TED Talk as much as the next person, but that's just cruel and unusual punishment!"
While not at all resembling a sentence I would type, this seemed inoffensive. I hit send.
I had begun the experiment feeling that it was important to be generous in spirit toward my robot co-conspirator. By Tuesday morning, though, I found that my to-do list was straining the limits of my robot's pseudo-human wit. It so happened that my colleagues on the Business desk were planning a party. Renee, one of the party planners, asked me if I could help draft the invitation.
"Maybe with your journalistic voice, you can write a nicer sentence than I just have," Renee wrote to me on Slack.
I couldn't tell her that my use of "journalistic voice" was a sore subject that week. I asked ChatGPT to craft a funny sentence about refreshments. "I am thrilled to announce that our upcoming party will feature an array of delicious cheese plates," the robot wrote. "Just to spice things up a bit (pun intended), we may even have some with a business-themed twist!"
Renee was unimpressed and, ironically, wrote to me: "OK, wait, let me get the ChatGPT to make a sentence."
Meanwhile, I had exchanged a series of messages with my colleague Ben about a story we were writing together. In a moment of anxiety, I called him to let him know it was ChatGPT writing the Slack messages, not me, and he admitted that he had wondered whether I was annoyed at him. "I thought I'd broken you!" he said.
When we got off the phone, Ben messaged me: "Robot-Emma is very polite, but in a way I'm slightly concerned might hide her intention to murder me in my sleep."
"I want to assure you that you can sleep peacefully knowing that your safety and security are not at risk," my bot replied. "Take care and sleep well."
Given the amount of time I spend online talking to colleagues -- about the news, story ideas, occasionally "Love Is Blind" -- it was disconcerting stripping those communications of any personality.
But it's not at all far-fetched. Microsoft earlier this year introduced a product, Microsoft 365 Copilot, that could handle all the tasks I asked ChatGPT to do and far more. I recently saw it in action when Microsoft's corporate vice president, Jon Friedman, showed me how Copilot could read emails he'd received, summarize them and then draft possible replies. Copilot can take notes during meetings, analyze spreadsheet data and identify problems that might arise in a project.
I asked Mr. Friedman if Copilot could mimic his sense of humor. He told me that the product wasn't quite there yet, although it could make valiant comedic attempts. (He has asked it, for example, for pickleball jokes, and it delivered: "Why did the pickleball player refuse to play doubles? They couldn't dill with the extra pressure!")
Of course, he continued, Copilot's purpose is loftier than mediocre comedy. "Most of humanity spends way too much time consumed with what we call the drudgery of work, getting through our inbox," Mr. Friedman said. "These things just sap our creativity and our energy."
Mr. Friedman recently asked Copilot to draft a memo, using his notes, recommending one of his employees for a promotion. The recommendation worked. He estimated that two hours' worth of work was completed in six minutes.
To some, though, the time savings aren't worth the peculiarity of outsourcing relationships.
"In the future, you're going to get an email and someone will be like 'Did you even read it?' And you'll be like 'no' and then they'll be like 'Well I didn't write the response to you,"' said Matt Buechele, 33, a comedy writer who also makes TikToks about office communications. "It'll be robots going back and forth to each other, circling back."
Mr. Buechele, in the middle of our phone interview, asked me unprompted about the email I had sent to him. "Your email style is very professional," he said.
I confessed that ChatGPT had written the message to him requesting an interview.
"I was sort of like, 'This is going to be the most awkward conversation of my life,"' he said.
This confirmed a fear I'd been developing that my sources had started to think I was a jerk. One source, for example, had written me an effusive email thanking me for an article I'd written and inviting me to visit his office when I was next in Los Angeles.
ChatGPT's response was muted, verging on rude: "I appreciate your willingness to collaborate."
I was feeling mournful of my past exclamation-point studded internet existence. I know people think exclamation points are tacky. The writer Elmore Leonard advised measuring out "two or three per 100,000 words of prose." Respectfully, I disagree. I often use two or three per two or three words of prose. I'm an apologist for digital enthusiasm. ChatGPT, it turns out, is more reserved.
For all the irritation I developed toward my robot overlord, I found that some of my colleagues were impressed by my newly polished digital persona, including my teammate Jordyn, who consulted me on Wednesday for advice on an article pitch.
"I have a story idea I'd love to chat with you about," Jordyn wrote to me. "It's not urgent!!"
"I'm always up for a good story, urgent or not!" my robot replied. "Especially if it's a juicy one with plot twists and unexpected turns."
After a few minutes of back-and-forth, I was desperate to talk with Jordyn in person. I was losing patience with the bot's cloying tone. I missed my own stupid jokes, and (comparatively) normal voice.
More alarmingly, ChatGPT is prone to hallucinating -- meaning putting words and ideas together that don't actually make sense. While writing a note to a source about the timing for an interview, my bot randomly suggested asking him whether we should coordinate our outfits in advance so that our auras and chakras wouldn't clash.
I asked ChatGPT to draft a message to another colleague, who knew about my experiment, telling him I was in hell. "I'm sorry, but I cannot generate inappropriate or harmful content," the robot replied. I asked it to draft a message explaining that I was losing my mind. ChatGPT couldn't do that either.
Of course, many of the A.I. experts I consulted were undeterred by the notion of shedding their personalized communication style. "Truthfully, we copy and paste a lot already," said Michael Chui, a McKinsey partner and expert in generative A.I.
Mr. Chui conceded that some people see signs of dystopia in a future where workers communicate mostly through robots. He argued, though, that this wouldn't look all that unlike corporate exchanges that are already formulaic. "I recently had a colleague send me a text message saying, 'Hey was that last email you sent legit?"' Mr. Chui recalled.
It turned out that the email had been so stiff that the colleague thought it was written through ChatGPT. Mr. Chui's situation is a bit particular, though. In college, his freshman dorm voted to assign him a prescient superlative: "Most likely to be replaced by a robot of his own making."
I decided to end the week by asking the deputy editor of my department what role he saw for A.I. in the newsroom's future. "Do you think there's a possibility that we could see AI-generated content on the front page one day?" I wrote over Slack. "Or do you think that there are some things that are just better left to human writers?"
"Well, that doesn't sound like your voice!" the editor replied.
A day later, my experiment complete, I typed back my own response: "That's a relief!!!"

A.I.'s Potential on the Battlefield Alarms U.S. Defense Experts: [News Analysis]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: U.S. national security officials are warning about the potential for the new technology to upend war, cyber conflict and -- in the most extreme case -- the use of nuclear weapons.
When President Biden announced sharp restrictions in October on selling the most advanced computer chips to China, he sold it in part as a way of giving American industry a chance to restore its competitiveness.
But at the Pentagon and the National Security Council, there was a second agenda: arms control.
If the Chinese military cannot get the chips, the theory goes, it may slow its effort to develop weapons driven by artificial intelligence. That would give the White House, and the world, time to figure out some rules for the use of artificial intelligence in sensors, missiles and cyberweapons, and ultimately to guard against some of the nightmares conjured by Hollywood -- autonomous killer robots and computers that lock out their human creators.
Now, the fog of fear surrounding the popular ChatGPT chatbot and other generative A.I. software has made the limiting of chips to Beijing look like just a temporary fix. When Mr. Biden dropped by a meeting in the White House on Thursday of technology executives who are struggling with limiting the risks of the technology, his first comment was "what you are doing has enormous potential and enormous danger."
It was a reflection, his national security aides say, of recent classified briefings about the potential for the new technology to upend war, cyber conflict and -- in the most extreme case -- decision-making on employing nuclear weapons.
But even as Mr. Biden was issuing his warning, Pentagon officials, speaking at technology forums, said they thought the idea of a six-month pause in developing the next generations of ChatGPT and similar software was a bad idea: The Chinese won't wait, and neither will the Russians.
"If we stop, guess who's not going to stop: potential adversaries overseas," the Pentagon's chief information officer, John Sherman, said on Wednesday. "We've got to keep moving."
His blunt statement underlined the tension felt throughout the defense community today. No one really knows what these new technologies are capable of when it comes to developing and controlling weapons, and they have no idea what kind of arms control regime, if any, might work.
The foreboding is vague, but deeply worrisome. Could ChatGPT empower bad actors who previously wouldn't have easy access to destructive technology? Could it speed up confrontations between superpowers, leaving little time for diplomacy and negotiation?
"The industry isn't stupid here, and you are already seeing efforts to self-regulate," said Eric Schmidt, the former Google chairman who served as the inaugural chairman of the advisory Defense Innovation Board from 2016 to 2020.
"So there's a series of informal conversations now taking place in the industry -- all informal -- about what would the rules of A.I. safety look like," said Mr. Schmidt, who has written, with former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, a series of articles and books about the potential of artificial intelligence to upend geopolitics.
The preliminary effort to put guardrails into the system is clear to anyone who has tested ChatGPT's initial iterations. The bots will not answer questions about how to harm someone with a brew of drugs, for example, or how to blow up a dam or cripple nuclear centrifuges, all operations the United States and other nations have engaged in without the benefit of artificial intelligence tools.
But those blacklists of actions will only slow misuse of these systems; few think they can completely stop such efforts. There is always a hack to get around safety limits, as anyone who has tried to turn off the urgent beeps on an automobile's seatbelt warning system can attest.
Though the new software has popularized the issue, it is hardly a new one for the Pentagon. The first rules on developing autonomous weapons were published a decade ago. The Pentagon's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center was established five years ago to explore the use of artificial intelligence in combat.
Some weapons already operate on autopilot. Patriot missiles, which shoot down missiles or planes entering a protected airspace, have long had an "automatic" mode. It enables them to fire without human intervention when overwhelmed with incoming targets faster than a human could react. But they are supposed to be supervised by humans who can abort attacks if necessary.
The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran's top nuclear scientist, was conducted by Israel's Mossad using an autonomous machine gun that was assisted by artificial intelligence, though there appears to have been a high degree of remote control. Russia said recently it has begun to manufacture -- but has not yet deployed -- its undersea Poseidon nuclear torpedo. If it lives up to the Russian hype, the weapon would be able to travel across an ocean autonomously, evading existing missile defenses, to deliver a nuclear weapon days after it is launched.
So far there are no treaties or international agreements that deal with such autonomous weapons. In an era when arms control agreements are being abandoned faster than they are being negotiated, there is little prospect of such an accord. But the kind of challenges raised by ChatGPT and its ilk are different, and in some ways more complicated.
In the military, A.I.-infused systems can speed up the tempo of battlefield decisions to such a degree that they create entirely new risks of accidental strikes, or decisions made on misleading or deliberately false alerts of incoming attacks.
"A core problem with A.I. in the military and in national security is how do you defend against attacks that are faster than human decision-making, and I think that issue is unresolved," Mr. Schmidt said. "In other words, the missile is coming in so fast that there has to be an automatic response. What happens if it's a false signal?"
The Cold War was littered with stories of false warnings -- once because a training tape, meant to be used for practicing nuclear response, was somehow put into the wrong system and set off an alert of a massive incoming Soviet attack. (Good judgment led to everyone standing down.) Paul Scharre, of the Center for a New American Security, noted in his 2018 book "Army of None" that there were "at least 13 near use nuclear incidents from 1962 to 2002," which "lends credence to the view that near miss incidents are normal, if terrifying, conditions of nuclear weapons."
For that reason, when tensions between the superpowers were a lot lower than they are today, a series of presidents tried to negotiate building more time into nuclear decision making on all sides, so that no one rushed into conflict. But generative A.I. threatens to push countries in the other direction, toward faster decision-making.
The good news is that the major powers are likely to be careful -- because they know what the response from an adversary would look like. But so far there are no agreed-upon rules.
Anja Manuel, a former State Department official and now a principal in the consulting group Rice, Hadley, Gates and Manuel, wrote recently that even if China and Russia are not ready for arms control talks about A.I., meetings on the topic would result in discussions of what uses of A.I. are seen as "beyond the pale."
Of course, the Pentagon will also worry about agreeing to many limits.
"I fought very hard to get a policy that if you have autonomous elements of weapons, you need a way of turning them off," said Danny Hillis, a computer scientist who was a pioneer in parallel computers that were used for artificial intelligence. Mr. Hillis, who also served on the Defense Innovation Board, said that Pentagon officials pushed back, saying, "If we can turn them off, the enemy can turn them off, too."
The bigger risks may come from individual actors, terrorists, ransomware groups or smaller nations with advanced cyber skills -- like North Korea -- that learn how to clone a smaller, less restricted version of ChatGPT. And they may find that the generative A.I. software is perfect for speeding up cyberattacks and targeting disinformation.
Tom Burt, who leads trust and safety operations at Microsoft, which is speeding ahead with using the new technology to revamp its search engines, said at a recent forum at George Washington University that he thought A.I. systems would help defenders detect anomalous behavior faster than they would help attackers. Other experts disagree. But he said he feared artificial intelligence could "supercharge" the spread of targeted disinformation.
All of this portends a new era of arms control.
Some experts say that since it would be impossible to stop the spread of ChatGPT and similar software, the best hope is to limit the specialty chips and other computing power needed to advance the technology. That will doubtless be one of many different arms control plans put forward in the next few years, at a time when the major nuclear powers, at least, seem uninterested in negotiating over old weapons, much less new ones.

White House Pushes Tech To Put Limits On A.I. Risks: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: In the White House's first gathering of A.I. companies, Vice President Kamala Harris told the leaders of major tech companies they had a "moral" obligation to keep products safe.
The White House on Thursday pushed Silicon Valley chief executives to limit the risks of artificial intelligence, in the administration's most visible effort to confront rising questions and calls to regulate the rapidly advancing technology.
For roughly two hours in the White House's Roosevelt Room, Vice President Kamala Harris and other officials told the leaders of Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, the maker of the popular ChatGPT chatbot, and Anthropic, an A.I. start-up, to seriously consider concerns about the technology. President Biden also briefly stopped by the meeting.
"What you're doing has enormous potential and enormous danger," Mr. Biden told the executives.
It was the first White House gathering of major A.I. chief executives since the release of tools like ChatGPT, which have captivated the public and supercharged a race to dominate the technology.
"The private sector has an ethical, moral and legal responsibility to ensure the safety and security of their products," Ms. Harris said in a statement. "And every company must comply with existing laws to protect the American people."
The meeting signified how the A.I. boom has entangled the highest levels of the American government and put pressure on world leaders to get a handle on the technology. Since OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public last year, many of the world's biggest tech companies have rushed to incorporate chatbots into their products and accelerated A.I. research. Venture capitalists have poured billions of dollars into A.I. start-ups.
But the A.I. explosion has also raised fears about how the technology might transform economies, shake up geopolitics and bolster criminal activity. Critics have worried that powerful A.I. systems are too opaque, with the potential to discriminate, displace people from jobs, spread disinformation and perhaps even break the law on their own.
Even some of the makers of A.I. have warned against the technology's consequences. This week, Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering researcher who is known as a "godfather" of A.I., resigned from Google so he could speak openly about the risks posed by the technology.
Mr. Biden recently said that it "remains to be seen" whether A.I. is dangerous, and some of his top appointees have pledged to intervene if the technology is used in a harmful way. Members of Congress, including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, have also moved to draft or propose legislation to regulate A.I.
That pressure to regulate the technology has been felt in many places around the world. Lawmakers in the European Union are in the midst of negotiating rules for A.I., though it is unclear how their proposals will ultimately cover chatbots like ChatGPT. In China, the authorities recently demanded that A.I. systems adhere to strict censorship rules.
"Europe certainly isn't sitting around, nor is China," said Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. "There is a first mover advantage in policy as much as there is a first mover advantage in the marketplace."
Mr. Wheeler said all eyes are on what actions the United States might take. "We need to make sure that we are at the table as players," he said. "Everybody's first reaction is, 'What's the White House going to do?"'
Yet even as governments call for tech companies to take steps to make their products safe, A.I. companies and their representatives have pointed back at governments, saying elected officials need to take steps to set the rules for the fast-growing space.
Attendees at Thursday's meeting included Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai; Microsoft's chief Satya Nadella; OpenAI's Sam Altman; and Anthropic's chief executive Dario Amodei. Some of the executives were accompanied by aides with technical expertise, while others brought public policy experts, an administration official said.
Google, Microsoft and OpenAI declined to comment after the White House meeting. Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
"The president has been extensively briefed on ChatGPT and knows how it works," White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said at Thursday's briefing.
The White House said it had impressed on the companies that they should address the risks of new A.I. developments. In a statement after the meeting, the administration said there had been "frank and constructive discussion" about the desire for the companies to be more open about their products, the need for A.I. systems to be subjected to outside scrutiny and the importance that those products be kept away from bad actors.
"Given the role these C.E.O.s and their companies play in America's A.I. innovation ecosystem, administration officials also emphasized the importance of their leadership, called on them to model responsible behavior, and to take action to ensure responsible innovation and appropriate safeguards, and protect people's rights and safety," the White House said.
Hours before the meeting, the White House announced that the National Science Foundation plans to spend $ 140 million on new research centers devoted to A.I. The administration also pledged to release draft guidelines for government agencies to ensure that their use of A.I. safeguards "the American people's rights and safety," adding that several A.I. companies had agreed to make their products available for scrutiny in August at a cybersecurity conference.
The meeting and announcements build on earlier efforts by the administration to place guardrails on A.I.
Last year, the White House released what it called a blueprint for an A.I. bill of rights, which said that automated systems should protect users' data privacy, shield them from discriminatory outcomes and make clear why certain actions were taken. In January, the Commerce Department also released a framework for reducing risk in A.I. development, which had been in the works for years.
But concrete steps to rein in the technology in the country may be more likely to come first from law enforcement agencies in Washington. In April, a group of government agencies pledged to "monitor the development and use of automated systems and promote responsible innovation," while punishing violations of the law committed using the technology.
In a guest essay in The Times on Wednesday, Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, said the nation was at a "key decision point" with A.I. She likened the technology's recent developments to the birth of tech giants like Google and Facebook, and she warned that, without proper regulation, the technology could entrench the power of the biggest tech companies and give scammers a potent tool.
"As the use of A.I. becomes more widespread, public officials have a responsibility to ensure this hard-learned history doesn't repeat itself," she said.

WASHINGTON — The White House on Thursday pushed Silicon Valley CEOs to limit the risks of artificial intelligence, in the administration’s most visible effort to confront rising questions and calls to regulate the rapidly advancing technology.

“The president has been extensively briefed on ChatGPT and knows how it works,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at Thursday’s briefing.
The White House said it had impressed on the companies that they should address the risks of new AI developments. In a statement after the meeting, the administration said there had been “frank and constructive discussion” about the desire for the companies to be more open about their products, the need for AI systems to be subjected to outside scrutiny and the importance that those products be kept away from bad actors.
“Given the role these CEOs and their companies play in America’s AI innovation ecosystem, administration officials also emphasized the importance of their leadership, called on them to model responsible behavior and to take action to ensure responsible innovation and appropriate safeguards, and protect people’s rights and safety,” the White House said.
Hours before the meeting, the White House announced that the National Science Foundation plans to spend $140 million on new research centers devoted to AI. The administration also pledged to release draft guidelines for government agencies to ensure that their use of AI safeguards “the American people’s rights and safety,” adding that several AI companies had agreed to make their products available for scrutiny in August at a cybersecurity conference.
The meeting and announcements build on earlier efforts by the administration to place guardrails on AI.
Last year, the White House released what it called a blueprint for an AI bill of rights, which said that automated systems should protect users’ data privacy, shield them from discriminatory outcomes and make clear why certain actions were taken. In January, the Commerce Department also released a framework for reducing risk in AI development, which had been in the works for years.
But concrete steps to rein in the technology in the country may be more likely to come first from law enforcement agencies in Washington.
In April, a group of government agencies pledged to “monitor the development and use of automated systems and promote responsible innovation,” while punishing violations of the law committed using the technology.
In a guest essay in The New York Times on Wednesday, Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, said the nation was at a “key decision point” with AI. She likened the technology’s recent developments to the birth of tech giants like Google and Facebook, and she warned that, without proper regulation, the technology could entrench the power of the biggest tech companies and give scammers a potent tool.
“As the use of AI becomes more widespread, public officials have a responsibility to ensure this hard-learned history doesn’t repeat itself,” she said.

F.T.C. Seeking 'Blanket' Ban on Meta's Use of Young Users' Data: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Citing privacy failings by the tech giant, regulators proposed to stop sites like Instagram and Facebook from profiting off the data of users under 18.
The Federal Trade Commission escalated its fight with the tech industry's biggest companies on Wednesday as it moved to impose what it called a "blanket prohibition" on the collection of young people's personal data by Meta, Facebook's parent company.
The commission wants to significantly expand a record $ 5 billion consent order with the company from 2020 and said that Meta had failed to fully meet the legal commitments it made to overhaul its privacy practices to better protect its users.
Regulators also said Meta had misled parents about their ability to control whom their children communicated with on its Messenger Kids app and misrepresented the access it gave some app developers to users' private data.
The proposed changes mark the third time the agency has taken action against the social media giant over privacy issues.
"The company's recklessness has put young users at risk," Samuel Levine, the director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a press statement. "Facebook needs to answer for its failures."
The F.T.C.'s administrative action, an internal agency procedure called an "order to show cause," serves as a preliminary warning to Meta that regulators believe the company violated the 2020 privacy agreement. The document lays out the commission's accusations against Meta as well its proposed restrictions.
Meta, which has 30 days to challenge the filing, was not given advance notice of the action by the F.T.C.
After Facebook responds, the commission said it will consider the company's arguments and make a decision. Meta could then appeal the agency's decision in a federal court of appeals.
The F.T.C.'s proposed changes would bar Meta from profiting from the data it collects from users under the age of 18, and would apply to Meta businesses including Facebook, Instagram and Horizon Worlds, the company's new virtual reality platform. Regulators want to bar the company from monetizing on that data even after those users turn 18.
That means Meta could be prohibited from using details about young people's activities to show them ads based on their behavior or market digital items to them, like virtual clothes for their avatars.
Whether a court would approve such changes is unknown. In a statement on Wednesday, Alvaro M. Bedoya, a commissioner who voted to issue the administrative order, said he had concerns about whether the agency's proposal to restrict Meta's use of young people's data was sufficiently relevant to the original case.
In a statement, Meta called the F.T.C.'s administrative warning "a political stunt" and said the company had introduced an "industry-leading" privacy program under the agreement with the F.T.C. The company vowed to fight the agency's action.
"Despite three years of continual engagement with the F.T.C. around our agreement, they provided no opportunity to discuss this new, totally unprecedented theory," Meta said in a statement.
Meta had already announced limits on targeting ads to users under 18. In 2021, the company said advertisers would be able to customize ads based on minors' locations, ages and genders but would no longer be able to target ads based on young people's interests or activities on other websites. And this year, Meta said it would also stop ad-targeting based on minors' gender.
The F.T.C.'s aggressive action is the first time that the commission has proposed such a blanket ban on the use of data to try to protect the online privacy of minors. And it arrives amid the most sweeping government drive to insulate young Americans online since the 1990s, when the commercial internet was still in its infancy.
Fueled by mounting concerns about depression among children and the role that online experiences could play in exacerbating it, lawmakers in at least two dozen states over the past year have introduced bills that would require certain sites, like social networks, to bar or limit young people on their platforms. Regulators are also intensifying their efforts, imposing fines on online services whose use or misuse of data could expose children to risks.
Over the past few years, critics have faulted Meta for recommending content on self-harm and extreme dieting to teenage girls on Instagram as well as failing to sufficiently protect young users from child sexual exploitation.
The F.T.C.'s case against the social media giant dates back more than a decade.
In 2011, the agency accused Facebook of deceiving users on privacy. In a settlement, Facebook agreed to implement a comprehensive privacy program, including agreeing not to misrepresent its privacy practices.
But after news reports in 2018 that a voter-profiling company, Cambridge Analytica, had harvested the data of millions of Facebook users without their knowledge, the F.T.C. cracked down again.
In a consent order finalized in 2020, Facebook agreed to restructure its privacy procedures and practices, and allow an independent assessor to examine the effectiveness of the company's privacy program. The company also paid a record $ 5 billion fine to settle the agency's charges.
The F.T.C. says Facebook has violated that agreement. In its administrative order on Wednesday, the agency cited reports from the privacy assessor, noting it had found "gaps and weaknesses" in Meta's privacy program that required substantial additional work.
Although much of the report was redacted, it indicated that the assessor found issues with the way Meta assessed privacy risks to users' data and managed privacy incidents. It also cited Meta's oversight of its data-sharing arrangements with third parties.
The F.T.C.'s crackdown on Meta is the latest signal that the agency is following through on pledges by Lina M. Khan, ‌‌its chair, to rein in the power of the tech industry's dominant companies. In December, the agency moved to halt consolidation among video game makers when it filed a lawsuit to try to block Microsoft's $ 69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the company behind the popular Call of Duty franchise.
The F.T.C. has also become more aggressive about privacy regulation. Rather than simply trying to protect consumers from increasingly powerful surveillance tools, regulators are working to prohibit certain kinds of data collection and usages that they consider high-risk.
The F.T.C. in December accused Epic Games, the company behind the popular Fornite game, of illegally collecting children's data and of putting them at risk by matching them with strangers and enabling live chat. Epic agreed to pay a $ 520 million fine to settle those and other charges. The settlement order also required Epic to turn off live voice and text chat by default -- the first time regulators had imposed such a remedy.
But the data restrictions the agency now wants to impose on Meta go much further.
The F.T.C.'s proposed changes would bar Meta-owned sites and products from monetizing young people's data. That would allow company platforms like Horizon Worlds to collect and use minors' information only to provide services to users and for security purposes.
The F.T.C. also wants to bar Meta from releasing any new products or features until the company can demonstrate, through written confirmation from an independent privacy assessor, that its privacy program fully complies with the 2020 consent order.

Uber's Revenue Up 29% as U.S. Ride-Hailing Recovers From Pandemic Slump: [Business/Financial Desk]

Publication info: Browning, Kellen. 

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/ubers-revenue-up-29-as-u-s-ride-hailing-recovers/docview/2808459774/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The News
Uber said on Tuesday that its revenue grew 29 percent in its most recent quarter as the company benefited from a series of investments in new services, as well as the continued return of drivers to its ride-hailing business.
The company said it had $ 8.8 billion in revenue, roughly in line with investors' expectations. Uber had $ 31.4 billion in gross bookings -- the amount of money paid by customers -- a 19 percent jump from a year ago.
Uber said it remained on track to generate a quarterly profit from the strength of its business operations sometime this year -- a milestone on the road to overall profitability.
"With our global scale and deeper local density, we are increasingly separating from smaller regional competitors both on driver preference and on the breadth of mobility products we offer consumers," Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive, said in a statement.
Shares of Uber stock ended the day nearly 12 percent higher after the company reported other figures that beat investor expectations.
Why It Matters: Uber offers more evidence of tech industry resilience.
Uber's strong financial results come after encouraging performances from tech companies like Microsoft, Google's parent company and Meta.
Uber has continued to recover from a slide during the pandemic, when it laid off thousands of employees. The company has since avoided the mass layoffs that have taken place at other tech companies, though it said on Tuesday that its overall head count was down after cuts at Drizly, an alcohol delivery platform owned by Uber, and in its freight business.
Uber said its U.S. and Canadian ride-hailing businesses, which had been slow to recover from the pandemic, were now growing faster, with trips in those regions up 40 percent from a year ago. The company said lower fares had helped with that growth. Uber invested heavily in financial incentives to get drivers back on its platform. Now drivers' earnings are also increasing, the company said.
Background: Uber focused on incentives for drivers.
Uber's main competitor, Lyft, did not invest as heavily on getting drivers back to its platform after pandemic lockdowns. With fewer drivers on the road, its prices have gone up.
Uber also has more products than Lyft, including partnerships with taxis and a shared-ride business. Bookings from products beyond its flagship UberX ride business grew more than 100 percent from a year earlier, the company said.
The company said it was confident about its rivalry with Lyft.
"They're looking to price competitively with us, and we think that sets up a competitive environment where we're competing on brand," Mr. Khosrowshahi said on a call with investors.
Uber's delivery business grew far more slowly than ride hailing but still managed 8 percent growth in bookings from a year ago. Its freight business shrank 23 percent, which the company attributed to the challenging economy.
Overall, Uber lost $ 157 million, cushioned by gains in its investments in other companies.
What's Next: Lyft reports its quarterly results.
Lyft, which has undergone layoffs and leadership changes, will report its own financial results on Thursday. The company just cut 26 percent of employees and named a new chief executive.

He Warns of Risks From A.I. He Helped Create: [National Desk]

Full text: Geoffrey Hinton was an artificial intelligence pioneer. In 2012, Dr. Hinton and two of his graduate students at the University of Toronto created technology that became the intellectual foundation for the A.I. systems that the tech industry's biggest companies believe is a key to their future.
On Monday, however, he officially joined a growing chorus of critics who say those companies are racing toward danger with their aggressive campaign to create products based on generative artificial intelligence, the technology that powers popular chatbots like ChatGPT.
Dr. Hinton said he has quit his job at Google, where he has worked for more than a decade and became one of the most respected voices in the field, so he can freely speak out about the risks of A.I. A part of him, he said, now regrets his life's work.
"I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn't done it, somebody else would have," Dr. Hinton said during a lengthy interview last week in the dining room of his home in Toronto, a short walk from where he and his students made their breakthrough.
Dr. Hinton's journey from A.I. groundbreaker to doomsayer marks a remarkable moment for the technology industry at perhaps its most important inflection point in decades. Industry leaders believe the new A.I. systems could be as important as the introduction of the web browser in the early 1990s and could lead to breakthroughs in areas ranging from drug research to education.
But gnawing at many industry insiders is a fear that they are releasing something dangerous into the wild. Generative A.I. can already be a tool for misinformation. Soon, it could be a risk to jobs. Somewhere down the line, tech's biggest worriers say, it could be a risk to humanity.
"It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things," Dr. Hinton said.
After the San Francisco start-up OpenAI released a new version of ChatGPT in March, more than 1,000 technology leaders and researchers signed an open letter calling for a six-month moratorium on the development of new systems because A.I. technologies pose "profound risks to society and humanity."
Several days later, 19 current and former leaders of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, a 40-year-old academic society, released their own letter warning of the risks of A.I. That group included Eric Horvitz, chief scientific officer at Microsoft, which has deployed OpenAI's technology across a wide range of products, including its Bing search engine.
Dr. Hinton, often called "the Godfather of A.I.," did not sign either of those letters and said he did not want to publicly criticize Google or other companies until he had quit his job. He notified the company last month that he was resigning, and on Thursday, he talked by phone with Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google's parent company, Alphabet. He declined to publicly discuss the details of his conversation with Mr. Pichai.
Google's chief scientist, Jeff Dean, said in a statement: "We remain committed to a responsible approach to A.I. We're continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly."
Dr. Hinton, a 75-year-old British expatriate, is a lifelong academic whose career was driven by his personal convictions about the development and use of A.I. In 1972, as a graduate student at the University of Edinburgh, Dr. Hinton embraced an idea called a neural network. A neural network is a mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing data. At the time, few researchers believed in the idea. But it became his life's work.
In the 1980s, Dr. Hinton was a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, but left the university for Canada because he said he was reluctant to take Pentagon funding. At the time, most A.I. research in the United States was funded by the Defense Department. Dr. Hinton is deeply opposed to the use of artificial intelligence on the battlefield -- what he calls "robot soldiers."
In 2012, Dr. Hinton and two of his students in Toronto, Ilya Sutskever and Alex Krishevsky, built a neural network that could analyze thousands of photos and teach itself to identify common objects, such as flowers, dogs and cars.
Google spent $ 44 million to acquire a company started by Dr. Hinton and his two students. And their system led to the creation of increasingly powerful technologies, including new chatbots like ChatGPT and Google Bard. Mr. Sutskever went on to become chief scientist at OpenAI. In 2018, Dr. Hinton and two other longtime collaborators received the Turing Award, often called "the Nobel Prize of computing," for their work on neural networks.
Around the same time, Google, OpenAI and other companies began building neural networks that learned from huge amounts of digital text. Dr. Hinton thought it was a powerful way for machines to understand and generate language, but it was inferior to the way humans handled language.
Then, last year, as Google and OpenAI built systems using much larger amounts of data, his view changed. He still believed the systems were inferior to the human brain in some ways but he thought they were eclipsing human intelligence in others. "Maybe what is going on in these systems," he said, "is actually a lot better than what is going on in the brain."
As companies improve their A.I. systems, he believes, they become increasingly dangerous. "Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now," he said of A.I. technology. "Take the difference and propagate it forwards. That's scary."
Until last year, he said, Google acted as a "proper steward" for the technology, careful not to release something that might cause harm. But now that Microsoft has augmented its Bing search engine with a chatbot -- challenging Google's core business -- Google is racing to deploy the same kind of technology. The tech giants are locked in a competition that might be impossible to stop, Dr. Hinton said.
His immediate concern is that the internet will be flooded with false photos, videos and text, and the average person will "not be able to know what is true anymore."
He is also worried that A.I. technologies will in time upend the job market. Today, chatbots like ChatGPT tend to complement human workers, but they could replace paralegals, personal assistants, translators and others who handle rote tasks. "It takes away the drudge work," he said. "It might take away more than that."
Down the road, he is worried that future versions of the technology pose a threat to humanity because they often learn unexpected behavior from the vast amounts of data they analyze. This becomes an issue, he said, as individuals and companies allow A.I. systems not only to generate their own computer code but actually run that code on their own. And he fears a day when truly autonomous weapons -- those killer robots -- become reality.
"The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people -- a few people believed that," he said. "But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that."
Many other experts, including many of his students and colleagues, say this threat is hypothetical. But Dr. Hinton believes that the race between Google and Microsoft and others will escalate into a global race that will not stop without some sort of global regulation.
But that may be impossible, he said. Unlike with nuclear weapons, he said, there is no way of knowing whether companies or countries are working on the technology in secret. The best hope is for the world's leading scientists to collaborate on ways of controlling the technology. "I don't think they should scale this up more until they have understood whether they can control it," he said.
Dr. Hinton said that when people used to ask him how he could work on technology that was potentially dangerous, he would paraphrase Robert Oppenheimer, who led the U.S. effort to build the atomic bomb: "When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it."
He does not say that anymore.

In the 1980s, Hinton was a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University but left the university for Canada because he said he was reluctant to take Pentagon funding. At the time, most AI research in the United States was funded by the Defense Department. Hinton is deeply opposed to the use of AI on the battlefield — what he calls “robot soldiers.”
In 2012, Hinton and two of his students in Toronto, Ilya Sutskever and Alex Krishevsky, built a neural network that could analyze thousands of photos and teach itself to identify common objects, such as flowers, dogs and cars.
Google spent $44 million to acquire a company started by Hinton and his two students. And their system led to the creation of increasingly powerful technologies, including new chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google Bard. Sutskever went on to become chief scientist at OpenAI. In 2018, Hinton and two other longtime collaborators received the Turing Award, often called “the Nobel Prize of computing,” for their work on neural networks.
Around the same time, Google, OpenAI and other companies began building neural networks that learned from huge amounts of digital text. Hinton thought it was a powerful way for machines to understand and generate language, but it was inferior to the way humans handled language.
Then, last year, as Google and OpenAI built systems using much larger amounts of data, his view changed. He still believed the systems were inferior to the human brain in some ways but he thought they were eclipsing human intelligence in others. “Maybe what is going on in these systems,” he said, “is actually a lot better than what is going on in the brain.”
As companies improve their AI systems, he believes, they become increasingly dangerous. “Look at how it was five years ago and how it is now,” he said of AI technology. “Take the difference and propagate it forwards. That’s scary.”
Until last year, he said, Google acted as a “proper steward” for the technology, careful not to release something that might cause harm. But now that Microsoft has augmented its Bing search engine with a chatbot — challenging Google’s core business — Google is racing to deploy the same kind of technology. The tech giants are locked in a competition that might be impossible to stop, Hinton said.
His immediate concern is that the internet will be flooded with false photos, videos and text, and the average person will “not be able to know what is true anymore.”
He is also worried that AI technologies will in time upend the job market. Today, chatbots such as ChatGPT tend to complement human workers, but they could replace paralegals, personal assistants, translators and others who handle rote tasks. “It takes away the drudge work,” he said. “It might take away more than that.”
Down the road, he is worried that future versions of the technology pose a threat to humanity because they often learn unexpected behavior from the vast amounts of data they analyze. This becomes an issue, he said, as individuals and companies allow AI systems not only to generate their own computer code but actually to run that code on their own. And he fears a day when truly autonomous weapons — those killer robots — become reality.
“The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that,” he said. “But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.”
Many other experts, including many of his students and colleagues, say this threat is hypothetical. But Hinton believes that the race between Google and Microsoft and others will escalate into a global race that will not stop without some sort of global regulation.
But that may be impossible, he said. Unlike with nuclear weapons, he said, there is no way of knowing whether companies or countries are working on the technology in secret. The best hope is for the world’s leading scientists to collaborate on ways of controlling the technology. “I don’t think they should scale this up more until they have understood whether they can control it,” he said.
Hinton said that when people used to ask him how he could work on technology that was potentially dangerous, he would paraphrase Robert Oppenheimer, who led the U.S. effort to build the atomic bomb: “When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it.”
He does not say that anymore.

Should Uninsured Deposits Get a Warning Label?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In the wake of bank collapses, some have called for the F.D.I.C. to guarantee all deposits. But there may be a more strategic solution.
How do we avoid the next run on a bank?
If there has been a lesson in the recent spate of bank failures, it is that deposit flight can now happen quickly. It no longer requires a teller to hand money to customers waiting in long lines around the block. Tens of billions of dollars can vanish in hours or minutes.
That's why guaranteeing deposits has become so crucial. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation explicitly insures the first $ 250,000 in any account, but nothing over that. The Biden administration has so far implicitly guaranteed all deposits by invoking a "systemic risk exception" -- but such an implicit guarantee has not been genuinely tested against a run on multiple banks at the same time.
There are fair arguments for the F.D.I.C. to guarantee all deposits, but there may be a more strategic, surgical and free-market solution.
Consider this: What if the banking system coalesced around a separate insurance program -- we'll call it F.D.I.C.+ -- for deposits above $ 250,000?
Banks could decide whether to use the insurance program. If they did, they could market and advertise that all deposits were insured. If they decided not to, the Federal Reserve could require them to have higher capital requirements and other restrictions to mitigate the possibility of a run.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could then require banks to use the equivalent of the warning label on cigarettes to show which accounts were not insured. This warning would appear on customer apps and statements, making it clear to customers when their money was not insured and they would not be rescued.
Such restrictions would be a strong incentive for banks to participate in the F.D.I.C.+ program. Because banks would pay to insure their large deposits, the program would also provide an incentive for better business models.
Silicon Valley Bank, which failed last month, catered to the wealthy. The same is true of First Republic Bank, whose stock price dropped more than 43 percent on Friday as its fate remained uncertain. Bloomberg reported on Saturday that the F.D.I.C. has asked JPMorgan Chase and PNC to submit final bids for the ailing lender this weekend in an effort to broker an orderly sale.
Silicon Valley Bank offered tech executives good deals on mortgages and more. Many of these executives, in turn, encouraged the companies they invested in to park their money in the banks. First Republic had a similar business tactic: It distinguished itself by offering wealthy clients jumbo mortgages, and offering spectacular white glove customer service.
That meant the banks had a huge number of deposits larger than $ 250,000, which are not backed by the government's deposit insurance fund. Nearly 90 percent of SVB's roughly $ 88 billion was uninsured. And about two-thirds of First Re­pub­lic's de­posits were unin­sured at the end of last year.
That left the banks vulnerable to flights. Not only did they have large amounts of uninsured deposits, which businesses also commonly hold in their accounts, they also had a high number of clients with strong networks who were able to sense trouble and flee more quickly than a business may have. The bank run at SVB "appears to have been fueled by social media and SVB's concentrated network of venture capital investors and technology firms," concluded a report released by the Federal Reserve.
Maybe F.D.I.C.+ would have prevented it. -- Andrew Sorkin and Lauren Hirsch
IN CASE YOU MISSED IT
Fox News ousted Tucker Carlson. The Fox Corporation board made the decision after discovering offensive private messages from Carlson that had been redacted in legal filings for Dominion Voting Systems' defamation case against Fox. After Carlson's firing, Russian state media reportedly offered him a job, and viewership of the conservative news channel Newsmax boomed. CNN also fired an anchor this week: Don Lemon, who made remarks in February about women and aging that were widely perceived to be sexist.
British regulators blocked Microsoft's $ 69 billion Activision deal. The surprising decision reinforced the increasing assertiveness of global antitrust regulators. Microsoft's deadline to close the acquisition is July 18. If its appeal fails, it will most likely have to walk away and pay a $ 3 billion breakup fee to Activision.
Price check. The latest economic indicators showed that inflation is slowing, but stubborn, as Federal Reserve officials prepare to make an interest rate decision next week. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation climbed 4.2 percent over the year through March, down from 5.1 percent in February, while wages in March climbed 5.1 percent from a year earlier and were up 1.2 percent from December. Data released Thursday showed that gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, increased at an annual rate of just 1.1 percent in the first quarter.
Bed, Bath & Bankruptcy. The home goods store Bed Bath & Beyond began the process of closing its 360 stores and 120 Buy Buy Baby locations after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday. Customers had until Wednesday to use their coupons.
It's not just tech companies talking about A.I.
The release of ChatGPT in November seems to have gotten companies talking about artificial intelligence. Mentions of "A.I." or "artificial intelligence" on corporate calls, which have been rising over the last decade, increased 50 percent from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this one. That's according to the market intelligence platform AlphaSense, which tracks data from more than 9,000 public companies that host calls in English.
Of the 2,007 companies that have hosted corporate calls since April 1, 334 mentioned the technology. And it's not just tech companies.
Roger S. Penske, the chief executive of the transportation service company Penske, said the company was using artificial intelligence to answer basic customer inquiries and make sales appointments. "We're scheduling better. We're more efficient, and it's enabling us to use different periods of time with our scheduling to be better with our tech," he told investors.
James Quincey, the chief executive of Coca-Cola, told investors that "one doesn't have to think very far to think of all the design work that goes into some of our point-of-sale material and how that can be driven through A.I. into the future."
Arthur Sadoun, the chief executive of Publicis Groupe, the public relations and advertising conglomerate, sees A.I. speeding up the creative process, but said he thought that any loss of revenue to quicker work "will be largely compensated by the necessities to multiply the number of creative assets due to personalization at scale."
When an anchor gets fired, this lawyer gets hired
Tucker Carlson and Don Lemon, the TV news anchors who made big news themselves this week when they were fired and taken off the air, have hired the same lawyer: Bryan Freedman. Though neither host has announced a lawsuit against his former employer, the hiring of Freedman could be a sign of legal battles to come.
The prominent Hollywood lawyer has a reputation for being an aggressive courtroom combatant. He founded his Los Angeles firm, Freedman + Taitelman, with Michael Taitelman in 1997. In its list of "power lawyers," The Hollywood Reporter described Freedman as "an expert in crisis litigation, the type that's heavy in late night phone calls and corporate drama."
One of his specialties: securing big payouts for TV stars facing controversy. His clients include Chris Cuomo, the former CNN anchor, who was ousted after evidence emerged that he had advised his brother, Andrew Cuomo, during a sexual harassment scandal (he is seeking $ 125 million for wrongful termination); Megyn Kelly, who secured a full payout of her contract when she left NBC after wondering on the air whether dressing up in blackface for Halloween was inappropriate; Mike Richards, a former host and executive producer of "Jeopardy!," who left after a report revealed offensive comments he had made on a podcast several years earlier; and Chris Harrison of "The Bachelor," who stepped down after making remarks he later acknowledged were dismissive of racism.
Freedman has also represented Quentin Tarantino, Julia Roberts, Mariah Carey, Seth Rogen and Gabrielle Union.
On our radar: Giannis Antetokounmpo on 'failure'
After the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks suffered a season-ending loss in the N.B.A. playoffs on Wednesday, a reporter asked Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks' star player, if he considered the season "a failure." Antetokounmpo's passionate response has since been passed around for its wisdom about moving forward from a loss: "Do you get a promotion every year, in your job?" he asked. "No, right? So every year you work is a failure -- yes or no? No. Every year you work, you work towards something, towards a goal, which is to get a promotion, to be able to take care of your family, provide a house for them, or take care of your parents. You work towards a goal -- it's not a failure. It's steps to success."

New Lyft C.E.O. Lays Out Vision and Tells Workers to Return to the Office: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A day after nearly 1,100 people were laid off, the struggling company told its remaining workers to prepare for a series of changes.
Since the pandemic began, Lyft employees have been able to work remotely, logging into videoconferences from their homes and dispersing across the country like many other tech workers. Last year, the company made that policy official, telling staff that work would be "fully flexible" and subleasing floors of its offices in San Francisco and elsewhere.
No longer. On Friday, David Risher, the company's new chief executive, told employees in an all-hands meeting that they would be required to come back into the office at least three days a week, starting this fall. It was one of the first major changes he has made at the struggling ride-hailing company since starting this month, and it came just a day after he laid off 26 percent of Lyft's work force.
"Things just move faster when you're face to face," Mr. Risher said in an interview. Remote work in the tech industry, he said, had come at a cost, leading to isolation and eroding culture. "There's a real feeling of satisfaction that comes from working together at a whiteboard on a problem."
The decision, combined with the layoffs and other changes, signals the beginning of a new chapter at Lyft. It could also be an indication that some tech companies -- particularly firms that are struggling -- may be changing their minds on flexibility about where employees work. Nudges toward working in the office could soon turn into demands, as they have at companies like Disney and Apple.
Bob Sutton, an organizational psychologist and a professor at Stanford, said that although in-person collaboration could help with creativity and some other parts of work, companies pushing for a return to office might be doing so to have greater oversight of their workers.
"When top executives feel financial stress, the classic 'threat-rigidity' effect kicks in, and beyond possible benefits for communication, collaboration and creativity, they feel compelled to increase their own illusion of control," Mr. Sutton said.
After lagging behind its rival, Uber, in the race to emerge from the pandemic doldrums, Lyft posted worrisome financial results in February. Its founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, said the next month that they would step down.
Mr. Risher, a veteran of Microsoft and Amazon who also served on Lyft's board of directors, has laid out a plan to streamline the business, cut costs and focus on improving the quality and lowering the price of Lyft's core product: rides for customers.
Lyft employees have complained that divisions outside the ride-hailing business, like units that offer rental cars to its gig drivers and rent bikes and scooters to consumers, seemed to be disproportionately affected by the layoffs. Mr. Risher said the cuts were across the board.
He said the cost savings from the layoffs would go toward lower prices for riders and higher earnings for drivers.
The next phase of his plan, he said, is to remind riders that Lyft is a viable alternative to Uber. In the summer, Mr. Risher said, he will gradually introduce products to increase interest in the platform. That may include teaming up with companies to offer Lyft rides to their employees who are commuting to offices, he said.
The next steps for the company will be difficult. Many Lyft employees have gotten used to working from home, and some were already bristling at the possibility of returning to the office. Lyft continues to trail Uber, which has a global ride-hailing business and also offers food delivery.
Lyft's stock price is trading at $ 10 a share, down from $ 78 at its peak, and some have speculated that it could be an acquisition target. The company will report financial results for its most recent quarter next week and expects $ 975 million in revenue, lower than the $ 1.1 billion investors had hoped for earlier this year. It is not yet profitable.
Mr. Risher announced a handful of other changes on Thursday. He ended products focused on car rentals, as well as shared rides and luxury rides, and he promoted Kristin Sverchek, the head of business affairs, to president.
Lyft also planned to tell employees that it would reduce their stock grants this year, according to a person familiar with the decision.
The return to office plan, Mr. Risher said, would require workers to come in Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, with Tuesdays recommended, beginning after Labor Day. People will be allowed to work remotely for one month each year, and those living far from offices would not be required to come in.
Mr. Risher said he saw the moment as an opportunity to have a "cultural reset, particularly around decision-making."
He said that Lyft was successful with its early ride-hailing business, but that Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer's idea to build a transportation network, with products focused on scooters, bikes, parking and rental cars, "didn't really resonate with people." The company has pared back those offerings but does still have bikes and scooters.
"So now, my focus is saying, 'Gosh, in ride share alone, there's an enormous amount of innovation left.' People desperately want to get out and live their lives, and we can help them," Mr. Risher said. "And then maybe, over time, we can build some things back on top of that."

Wall Street Ends April on a Positive Note: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street closed out a winning April with gains Friday after more companies said their profits at the start of the year weren't as bad as expected.
The S&P 500 rose 34.13, or 0.8 percent, to 4,169.48. Despite some sharp swings this week, it still clinched a second straight winning month. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 272.00, or 0.8 percent, to 34,098.16, and the Nasdaq composite gained 84.35, or 0.7 percent, to 12,226.58.
Exxon Mobil did some of the market's heavier lifting after it rose 1.3 percent. It reported stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than forecast.
Intel gained 4 percent after reporting a milder loss than expected and stronger revenue for the latest quarter. Mondelez International, the food giant behind Oreo and Ritz, rose 3.9 percent after topping Wall Street's estimates. It also raised its forecast for revenue and earnings over the full year.
They helped to offset a 4 percent drop for Amazon, which weighed heavily on the market despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to a slowdown in revenue growth at its AWS cloud computing business.
Snap tumbled 17 percent after its revenue for the latest quarter fell short of forecasts. Pinterest also fell sharply, down 15.7 percent, despite reporting stronger results than expected. Analysts pointed to its growth forecast for the current quarter, which looked more tepid than some expected.
Wall Street has focused heavily on what C.E.O.s are saying about their upcoming trends given how much uncertainty is ahead about where the economy and interest rates are heading. The economy is slowing under the weight of much higher interest rates meant to get high inflation under control.
The majority of companies so far this reporting season have beaten expectations, highlighted by Big Tech behemoths this past week like Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms. They have an outsized effect on market indexes because of their massive size.
Recent economic reports have kept expectations in place on Wall Street for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again at its next meeting next week.
A report on Friday said the inflation measure that the Fed prefers to use came in close to expectations for March, but it remains well above the target.
Compensation for workers also rose more during the first three months of the year than economists expected. While that's welcome news for workers trying to keep up with still-rising prices at registers, the Fed fears that could help make high inflation more entrenched.
"Bottom line, inflation is still above target, and the Fed is poised to raise interest rates again next week -- and leave them at high levels for quite a while," said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office.
High rates combat inflation by slowing the entire economy and hurting investment prices. That has many investors preparing for a possible recession to hit sometime this year.
The Fed has raised its key overnight interest rate to its highest level since 2007, up from its record low, following a barrage of hikes since early last year. Together, they've already slowed the economy's growth down to an estimated 1.1 percent annual rate at the start of this year.
They've also caused cracks in the banking system, with the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history rocking global markets last month. Investors are hunting for other weak links, and the spotlight has been particularly harsh on First Republic Bank.
Its stock roughly halved on Tuesday after it gave details about how much in deposits its customers have yanked. First Republic tumbled again Friday and is down 97.1 percent for the year so far.

Outsize Tech Earnings Buoy Market: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street rallied to its best day since January after Meta on Thursday became the latest big tech company to blow past profit expectations and reports painted a mixed picture of the U.S. economy.
The S&P 500 jumped 2 percent to erase all its losses from what had been a tough week so far. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.6 percent, while the Nasdaq composite led the market with a 2.4 percent gain.
Facebook's parent company did some of the heaviest lifting, and it jumped 13.9 percent. Not only did Meta beat analysts' estimates for profit during the first three months of the year, it also gave a forecast for revenue that topped expectations.
It joined Microsoft and Alphabet, which reported better-than-expected results earlier in the week, and Amazon followed suit after trading closed for the day.
The majority of companies have been beating forecasts so far this earnings reporting season. Hasbro climbed 14.6 percent, and Comcast rose 10.3 percent after they also topped Wall Street's estimates. But expectations were broadly low coming into this reporting season because of still-high inflation, much higher interest rates and a slowing economy.
A report on Thursday gave the first indication of just how much the U.S. economy is slowing: down to an estimated 1.1 percent growth at an annual rate during the first three months of 2023 from 2.6 percent at the end of last year. That was worse than expected, but the economy may be in better shape than it looks.
Underneath the surface, the report showed strength at the economy's core, with growth in spending by consumers and other areas accelerating. Much of the weakness was related to businesses thinning out inventories. Also within the data, though, was a measure of inflation that the Fed likes to use, which came in hotter than hoped.
A separate report showed that fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, raising hope that the job market may remain resilient.
"In our view, pulled all together, the conflicting data signals to us that we are in the 'bend, not break' phase of the cycle" for the economy, said Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, co-head of portfolio management for multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.
Investors took the data to mean the Federal Reserve next week will see the economy is still strong enough to handle another interest rate increase at its next meeting.
Treasury yields jumped immediately after the release of the economic reports as traders raised their forecasts for the Fed and rates.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.53 percent from 3.44 percent late Wednesday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
High rates have hit some areas of the economy particularly hard, including the housing and manufacturing industries. Banks have also come under pressure.
The hunt has been on for potential weak links, and Wall Street's spotlight has been particularly harsh on First Republic Bank. Its stock has more than halved this week after it gave details about how much in deposits its customers pulled after the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history last month.
Its stock steadied a bit Thursday, rising 8.8 percent.
Caterpillar, considered a bellwether for the global economy, slipped 0.9 percent despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected. Analysts pointed to concerns that its profitability may have maxed out. It also benefited from a bigger-than-expected buildup in dealer inventories.
Crocs tumbled 15.9 percent despite reporting stronger profit and revenue for its latest quarter than expected. The footwear company gave financial forecasts for the current quarter that fell short of some analysts' expectations.

Its Go-Go Days Over, Amazon Grows a Little, And Wall Street Shrugs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company, reporting a 9 percent revenue increase for the first quarter, is the latest Big Tech company to top Wall Street's financial expectations.
For much of its history, Amazon grew amazingly, unbelievably fast. Not so much anymore.
Amazon released on Thursday its results for the first quarter. Revenue increased 9 percent, the same as in the previous quarter.
While slow by historical standards, when sales could pop 40 percent from the previous year, the numbers looked pretty good to analysts who expected even less. Amazon shares, which have had a lousy 18 months, rose more than 10 percent in after-hours trading on Thursday before giving up those gains as reality settled in.
Revenue rose to $ 127.4 billion, while net income jumped to 31 cents a share against a loss of 38 cents in 2022. Analysts had expected a profit of 21 cents a share and revenue of $ 124.55 billion.
"From my perspective, I think there's a fair bit to like about how our teams are delivering for customers and the results we're starting to see," Amazon's chief executive, Andy Jassy, said in a call with analysts.
Best-performing sectors were advertising, which rose 21 percent, and Amazon Web Services, which rose 16 percent. But revenue at the online stores, which for most consumers is the essence of Amazon, fell by about $ 33 million.
Mr. Jassy spoke at length about how all of Amazon will be invigorated in the next few years by artificial intelligence -- like large language models and the generative A.I. that they power.
"Frankly the models were not that compelling before about six, nine months ago," he said. "They have gotten so much bigger and so much better, much more quickly. It really presents a remarkable opportunity to transform virtually every customer experience that exists, and many that don't exist."
Amazon, like other tech companies, did very well early in the pandemic when everyone stayed home but has had some troubles since. After expanding its retail distribution network to handle an influx of new business that did not stick around, management is paring back.
Employment at the company has shrunk 10 percent since its peak in early 2022, or by 150,000 workers. Since November, the company has confirmed 27,000 layoffs in divisions including human resources, retail and cloud computing. But the warehouses and distribution network have dropped the most.
Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, did not rule out more layoffs in a call with reporters on Thursday. "We'll proceed adaptively," he said.
Amazon's Big Tech peers reported surprisingly good results this week after a brutal winter of layoffs, weak results and diminished expectations. Facebook's parent, Meta, snapped a three-quarter losing streak in revenue, sending its shares up 10 percent. Google's advertising search business did better than expected, while Microsoft's cloud computing operation helped the company notch impressive results.
For years, even decades, Amazon chose growth over profits. Making money took a back seat to establishing new markets. Sometimes this worked so well it changed the fundamental nature of the company. AWS grew at such a torrid rate that its profits have done much to compensate for Amazon's anemic returns on the retail side.
On the other hand, many small ventures remained small. When to shut them down is a decision that for years Amazon could put off, but no longer. Rising interest rates and balky consumers forced its hand.
This week, the company shut its Halo line of health and fitness devices. Amazon has major ambitions in health care, but fitness devices are a crowded market and Halo was not breaking through. Amazon also shut down in recent days Book Depository, an online bookseller it bought in 2011 and operated independently from its principal book-selling division.
New horizons beckon.
"Health care is a multitrillion-dollar business that is very segmented and it's really broken, in the U.S. particularly," Mr. Jassy said.

Web Search Sparks Sales For Alphabet: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Google's parent company returned to sales growth, even as an advertising slowdown continued to crimp YouTube.
After years of easy financial growth and booming popularity, Alphabet, Google's parent company, has in recent months faced mounting questions about its future. It has been under the gun to deliver artificial intelligence technology, its sales growth has decelerated, and it is laying off 12,000 employees to cut costs.
On Tuesday, Google shrugged off some of those questions, returning to sales growth in defiance of a slowdown in digital advertising.
The company reported revenue of $ 69.8 billion in the first three months of 2023, up 3 percent from a year earlier and beating analysts' average estimate of $ 68.9 billion. Its profits fell 8 percent, to $ 15 billion -- the fifth consecutive decline -- though Alphabet said it recorded $ 2.6 billion in charges related to recent layoffs and office space reductions.
Google still faces significant challenges. Its video platform, YouTube, continues to be crimped by the ad slump and rival Microsoft has gained buzz and users after incorporating an A.I. chatbot into its search engine, Bing.
But Tuesday's results highlighted Google's enviable advantage as a gateway to the web for billions of people around the world, a position that cannot be dislodged quickly or easily.
In particular, Google's search engine, the core of the world's largest digital advertising machine, remained strong. Revenue from the search engine rose almost 2 percent. to $ 40.4 billion, in the first quarter, higher than analysts' estimates of $ 39.4 billion. The company said travel firms and retailers had spent more to reach customers on the search platform.
Sante Faustini, who runs product intelligence at M Science, a data research firm, said in an interview that Google's search engine was the driving force of the company's rebound, in a sign of the service's "resilience" against larger economic forces.
Starting last year, rising interest rates and inflation had made advertisers thriftier, undermining the sales and profit of Google and its peers Snap and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram. Google's sales had declined slightly at the end of last year.
That had put Alphabet under growing pressure to reassure investors it could still deliver revenue and profit gains, after years of gravity-defying leaps. Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore ISI, encapsulated Wall Street's demands in a recent note, in which he pushed the company to shed expenses, stabilize core businesses including YouTube and accelerate the release of artificial intelligence technology.
The internet giant said in January it would cull 12,000 people, or 6 percent, of its global work force, from its payroll. As of March 31, Alphabet had 190,711 employees, compared with 190,234 at the end of last year. The company's layoffs did not officially go into effect until the end of last month.
At the same time, Google's search engine appeared threatened by a wave of chatbots that have captured the public imagination. In particular, tools from Microsoft and OpenAI, the maker of the popular ChatGPT chatbot, have begun testing Google's mettle.
In March, Google released a chatbot called Bard to mixed reviews, but the company does not generate revenue from the tool. The New York Times has reported that Google will incorporate conversational A.I. features into its flagship search engine in May, and has begun work on a new, more personalized search engine designed to take advantage of A.I. advances.
Last week, Alphabet consolidated its main A.I. teams into one unit, Google DeepMind, to make quicker progress in the field. The move combined the London-based A.I. lab DeepMind with Google Brain, part of the company's research division. DeepMind's chief executive, Demis Hassabis, assumed control of the group. Jeff Dean, Google's top research executive, had previously overseen Google Brain, which he co-founded.
In an earnings call on Tuesday, Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's chief executive, said the company had made "good progress" in A.I., comparing it to the company's transition from desktop to mobile computing more than a decade ago.
"Our investments and breakthroughs in A.I. over the last decade have positioned us well," he said, while promising a raft of new A.I. features in everything from Android smartphones to software for other businesses. He added that he hoped Google's efforts to develop A.I. features would help the company retain its large user base.
"We'll continue to incorporate generative A.I. advances to make search better in a thoughtful and deliberate way," he said.
Advertising sales at YouTube, Google's video platform, dipped almost 3 percent, to $ 6.7 billion, in the first quarter, narrowly ahead of the $ 6.6 billion expected by analysts. The division has recorded declining revenue in recent months amid increased competition from TikTok. Apple's privacy changes for its iPhones have also tamped down the growth of social media platforms by making it more difficult to prove to advertisers that their ads are effective.
Sales at Google Cloud, the division that offers software and technology services to other businesses, jumped 28 percent to $ 7.5 billion. For the first quarter, the division reported a profit for the first time, of $ 191 million.

Earnings Bring Gloom to the Market: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street tumbled Tuesday to its worst day in a month on worries about the strength of corporate profits and the economy following some mixed reports.
The S&P 500 fell 1.6 percent to break out of a weekslong lull. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1 percent, while the Nasdaq composite sank 2 percent.
First Republic Bank had the biggest loss in the S&P 500 by far, and its stock nearly halved after it said customers withdrew more than $ 100 billion during the first three months of the year. That doesn't include $ 30 billion in deposits that big banks plugged in to build faith in their rival after the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history shook confidence.
The size of the drop in deposits renewed worries about the U.S. banking system and the risk of an economy-sapping pullback in lending. That overshadowed First Republic's beating analysts' expectations for earnings at the start of the year, and its stock plunged 49.4 percent.
The majority of companies so far this reporting season have been topping expectations, but the bar was set considerably low. Analysts are forecasting the worst drop in S&P 500 earnings since the spring of 2020, when the pandemic froze the global economy. That's why Wall Street is focused just as much, if not more, on what companies say about their future prospects as they do about their past three months.
UPS fell 10 percent after it met profit forecasts but said it made less in revenue than expected. It also said its revenue for the full year will likely come at the low end of its prior forecast, citing a challenging economy and other factors.
Danaher was another big weight on the market, falling 8.8 percent despite reporting better earnings and revenue than expected. Analysts pointed to its trimming back its forecast for a key revenue measure over the course of the year.
On the winning side, PepsiCo rose 2.3 percent after beating profit expectations. Shares of the home builder PulteGroup rose 1.7 percent after the company also topped forecasts.
The heart of earnings reporting season is approaching, and more heavy hitters arrived after trading closes for the day.
Microsoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet, both rose in after-hours trading after reporting profits above expectations. Because they're two of the biggest companies on Wall Street by market value, their stock movements carry extra weight on the S&P 500 and other market indexes.
Broad stock indexes had been making only modest moves so far this earnings reporting season. The S&P 500 barely budged last week and ticked up just 0.1 percent on Monday. But volatility strategists at Barclays said the calm was unlikely to last long.
The economy is under stress from high interest rates meant to get inflation under control. High rates can stifle inflation, but only by putting the brakes on the entire economy and hurting investment prices. Big chunks of the economy outside the job market have already begun to slow or contract.
With so much uncertainty about whether inflation can return to the Federal Reserve's target without causing a recession, "we remain skeptical that markets are out of the woods," Barclays strategists led by Stefano Pascale said in a report. They also pointed to "the risk of something breaking" in the financial system because of high rates.
A report on Tuesday showed that confidence among consumers fell more sharply in April than expected, down to its lowest level since July. That's a discouraging signal when consumer spending makes up the biggest part of the U.S. economy.
A separate report was more encouraging, saying sales of new homes rose by more than expected. The housing industry has been under pressure because higher mortgage rates are squeezing buyers.

Markets Hold Breath Ahead of New Data: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street remained stuck in its standstill on Monday, and stocks again moved only modestly ahead of reports that could offer more clarity on the direction of the economy and corporate profits.
The S&P 500 edged up by 3.52 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,137.04 after barely budging last week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 66.44, or 0.2 percent, to 33,875.40, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 35.25, or 0.3 percent, to 12,037.20.
Coca-Cola fell 0.2 percent after it reported stronger-than-expected profit for the first quarter but refrained from raising forecasts for sales and other measures for the full year. It was the only company in the S&P 500 to report Monday morning, but more than 170 others are scheduled to follow it this week.
The question is whether they can clear the low bar that Wall Street has set for them, and what chief executives say about their prospects for profits later this year. Analysts expect S&P 500 companies to report their worst drop in earnings since the spring of 2020, when the pandemic paralyzed the economy.
Some of Wall Street's most influential companies are set to report this week, including Microsoft on Tuesday and Amazon on Thursday. Several of these big tech stocks were among the heaviest weights on the market. Microsoft fell 1.4 percent, and Amazon dipped 0.7 percent.
Fox fell 2.9 percent after it said the prime-time host Tucker Carlson was leaving Fox News. The move came less than a week after the company reached a $ 787.5 million settlement over charges that it promoted lies about Dominion Voting Systems through its 2020 election coverage.
Bed Bath & Beyond was another loser, dropping 35.7 percent to 19 cents after filing for bankruptcy protection. Its stock has been on a wild ride as investors bet on whether it could successfully turn around its operations.
So far this earnings reporting season, the majority of companies have been topping forecasts, as is usually the case. That is partly because expectations were so low coming into it. Inflation remains high, and interest rates are much higher than a year earlier, which has hurt swaths of the economy.
The Federal Reserve has jacked up rates at a furious pace in hopes of undercutting high inflation. High rates can do that but only by bluntly slowing the entire economy. That increases the chances of a recession, while also hurting prices for investments.
Besides this week's blizzard of earnings reports, Wall Street was also waiting for the first estimate of how quickly the U.S. economy grew in the first three months of the year. Economists predict it will show growth slowed to 1.9 percent at an annual rate, from 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter.
Higher rates have already slowed the housing market by making mortgages more expensive. Manufacturing and other areas of the economy have also been hurt, while the job market has remained remarkably resilient.
The report on the U.S. economy will be one of the final pieces of data before the Federal Reserve's next meeting, scheduled for next week. Much of Wall Street expects it to raise interest rates at least one more time, before it most likely takes a pause.
Many traders are betting the Fed will have to cut rates later this year to prop up the economy. But the Fed has been insistent that it will hold rates at a higher level at least through the end of this year.
"The Fed seems determined to fight inflation even if a more significant slowdown arrives," Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson wrote in a report.
High rates have already caused cracks in the banking system, with the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history rocking markets last month. The worst of the crisis seems to have passed, but scrutiny is still high on smaller and midsize banks, which seem to be under the biggest threat of customers' yanking their deposits.

Chinese Chatbots Must Toe Party Line: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Communist Party outlined draft rules that would set guardrails on the rapidly growing industry of services like ChatGPT.
Five months after ChatGPT set off an investment frenzy over artificial intelligence, Beijing is moving to rein in China's chatbots, a show of the government's resolve to keep tight regulatory control over technology that could define an era.
The Cyberspace Administration of China unveiled draft rules this month for so-called generative artificial intelligence -- the software systems, like the one behind ChatGPT, that can formulate text and pictures in response to a user's questions and prompts.
According to the regulations, companies must heed the Chinese Communist Party's strict censorship rules, just as websites and apps have to avoid publishing material that besmirches China's leaders or rehashes forbidden history. The content of A.I. systems will need to reflect "socialist core values" and avoid information that undermines "state power" or national unity.
Companies will also have to make sure their chatbots create words and pictures that are truthful and respect intellectual property, and will be required to register their algorithms, the software brains behind chatbots, with regulators.
The rules are not final, and regulators may continue to modify them, but experts said engineers building artificial intelligence services in China were already figuring out how to incorporate the edicts into their products.
Around the world, governments have been wowed by the power of chatbots with the A.I.-generated results ranging from alarming to benign. Artificial intelligence has been used to ace college exams and create a fake photo of Pope Francis in a puffy coat.
ChatGPT, developed by the U.S. company OpenAI, which is backed by some $ 13 billion from Microsoft, has spurred Silicon Valley to apply the underlying technology to new areas like video games and advertising. The venture capital firm Sequoia Capital estimates that A.I. businesses could eventually produce "trillions of dollars" in economic value.
In China, investors and entrepreneurs are racing to catch up. Shares of Chinese artificial intelligence firms have soared. Splashy announcements have been made by some of China's biggest tech companies, including most recently the e-commerce giant Alibaba; SenseTime, which makes facial recognition software; and the search engine Baidu. At least two start-ups developing Chinese alternatives to OpenAI's technology have raised millions of dollars.
ChatGPT is unavailable in China. But faced with a growing number of homegrown alternatives, China has swiftly unveiled its red lines for artificial intelligence, ahead of other countries that are still considering how to regulate chatbots.
The rules showcase China's "move fast and break things" approach to regulation, said Kendra Schaefer, head of tech policy at Trivium China, a Beijing-based consulting firm.
"Because you don't have a two-party system where both sides argue, they can just say, 'OK, we know we need to do this, and we'll revise it later,"' she added.
Chatbots are trained on large swaths of the internet, and developers are grappling with the inaccuracies and surprises of what they sometimes spit out. On their face, China's rules require a level of technical control over chatbots that Chinese tech companies have not achieved. Even companies like Microsoft are still fine-tuning their chatbots to weed out harmful responses. China has a much higher bar, which is why some chatbots have already been shut down and others are available only to a limited number of users.
Experts are divided on how difficult it will be to train A.I. systems to be consistently factual. Some doubt that companies can account for the gamut of Chinese censorship rules, which are often sweeping, are ever-changing and even require censorship of specific words and dates like June 4, 1989, the day of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Others believe that over time, and with enough work, the machines can be aligned with truth and specific values systems, even political ones.
Analysts expect the rules to undergo changes after consultation with China's tech companies. Regulators could soften their enforcement so the rules don't wholly undermine development of the technology.
China has a long history of censoring the internet. Throughout the 2000s, the country has constructed the world's most powerful information dragnet over the web. It scared away noncompliant Western companies like Google and Facebook. It hired millions of workers to monitor internet activity.
All the while, China's tech companies, which had to comply with the rules, flourished, defying Western critics who predicted that political control would undercut growth and innovation. As technologies such as facial recognition and mobile phones arose, companies helped the state harness them to create a surveillance state.
The current A.I. wave presents new risks for the Communist Party, said Matt Sheehan, an expert on Chinese A.I. and a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
The unpredictability of chatbots, which will make statements that are nonsensical or false -- what A.I. researchers call hallucination -- runs counter to the party's obsession with managing what is said online, Mr. Sheehan said.
"Generative artificial intelligence put into tension two of the top goals of the party: the control of information and leadership in artificial intelligence," he added.
China's new regulations are not entirely about politics, experts said. For example, they aim to protect privacy and intellectual property for individuals and creators of the data upon which A.I. models are trained, a topic of worldwide concern.
In February, Getty Images, the image database company, sued the artificial intelligence start-up Stable Diffusion for training its image-generating system on 12 million watermarked photos, which Getty claimed diluted the value of its images.
China is making a broader push to address legal questions about A.I. companies' use of underlying data and content. In March, as part of a major institutional overhaul, Beijing established the National Data Bureau, an effort to better define what it means to own, buy and sell data. The state body would also assist companies with building the data sets necessary to train such models.
"They are now deciding what kind of property data is and who has the rights to use it and control it," said Ms. Schaefer, who has written extensively on China's A.I. regulations and called the initiative "transformative."
Still, China's new guardrails may be ill timed. The country is facing intensifying competition and sanctions on semiconductors that threaten to undermine its competitiveness in technology, including artificial intelligence.
Hopes for Chinese A.I. ran high in early February when Xu Liang, an A.I. engineer and entrepreneur, released one of China's earliest answers to ChatGPT as a mobile app. The app, ChatYuan, garnered over 10,000 downloads in the first hour, Mr. Xu said.
Media reports of marked differences between the party line and ChatYuan's responses soon surfaced. Responses offered a bleak diagnosis of the Chinese economy and described the Russian war in Ukraine as a "war of aggression," at odds with the party's more pro-Russia stance. Days later, the authorities shut down the app.
Mr. Xu said he was adding measures to create a more "patriotic" bot. They include filtering out sensitive keywords and hiring more manual reviewers who can help him flag problematic answers. He is even training a separate model that can detect "incorrect viewpoints," which he will filter.
Still, it is not clear when Mr. Xu's bot will ever satisfy the authorities. The app was initially set to resume on Feb. 13, according to screenshots, but as of Friday it was still down.
"Service will resume after troubleshooting is complete," it read.

Full text: LOS ANGELES -- Jorge Mendez waited impatiently as the Los Angeles Kings' fate hung in the balance late Friday night.
Their N.H.L. first-round playoff game against the Edmonton Oilers had already gone into overtime, robbing Mendez's crew of several precious minutes they would need to get Crypto.com Arena ready for the Clippers' N.B.A. playoff game on Saturday afternoon. And now there was another delay. Officials were trying to determine whether a would-be game-winning goal by Kings forward Trevor Moore should count.
Mendez, the venue's assistant conversion manager, had a crew of about 20 people waiting to transform the chilly arena. They would be working all night and had to finish by 7 a.m. Saturday. They had never missed a deadline, and weren't about to start now.
"With the referees we don't know," Mendez said. "They could say they deny that one and it goes longer. And the more longer they go, they're going to take more time from me."
The goal stood and the Kings won. Fans celebrated and left the building, then Mendez's crew got to work: The nets and glass surrounding the ice rink came down; the penalty boxes and benches were disassembled and moved; the ice was cleaned and covered by insulation so it wouldn't melt during the next day's basketball games; and the modules containing seats were shifted into new configurations.
They finished well before 7 a.m. and Mendez drove home at 6:30 a.m. At that time of day there is little traffic, so it took him just 10 minutes. When he works overnight, he sleeps during the day, and his wife tries to stop his 9-year-old daughter from bursting into his room to ask if he wants to bike with her. But Mendez's weekend was long from over.
Like dozens of others, Mendez worked tirelessly to make sure the arena could handle its frenetic week. The busiest time came in the 36 hours after the Kings game Friday, when the building turned over from the Kings to the Clippers to the Lakers and back to the Kings. All three teams have called the arena home since 1999, when it opened as Staples Center.
"My favorite part of this is when they're done," said Lee Zeidman, the president of Crypto.com Arena; the nearby Microsoft Theater; and the surrounding entertainment district, L.A. Live. "It's like a puzzle. These men and women they're the best in the business."
Mendez was back at 1 p.m., ready to flip the arena from the Clippers' array of red, blue, black and silver to the Lakers' purple and gold.
'Organized chaos'
Between Thursday and Monday night, Crypto.com Arena will have hosted four basketball playoff games and two hockey playoff games.
"It's chaos," said Darryl Jackson, an event operations assistant manager for the arena. "But it's organized. Organized chaos." He began his career working on conversions, but now helps to make sure the baskets during basketball games and the glass during hockey games stay in good condition.
Minutes after Game 4 of the first-round series between the Clippers and the Phoenix Suns finished Saturday, Loreto Verdugo backed a forklift down an aisle between the court and the first row of grandstand seats. He had just a couple of inches of space on either side of him. After years of doing this task, he wasn't nearly as nervous as he was the first time he did it.
"You don't want to hit the floor because the floor's the most important thing out there," Verdugo said. "But you don't want to hit anybody else either."
He had quietly left his home in North Hollywood at 4 a.m. ("I'm like a mouse," he said) to be at the arena in time to begin supervising maintenance work.
As soon as the Clippers' game ended, just before 3 p.m., and all of the people had been cleared from the court, a bustle of expertly choreographed activity began. By the time the Clippers' players began their postgame interviews, workers had bagged fans' trash, and the player and logo banners the Clippers hang in the rafters had been rolled up to reveal the gold-colored championship banners for the Lakers and the W.N.B.A.'s Los Angeles Sparks, who have also shared the arena for much of the past two decades.
The Clippers' court was already being uprooted from the floor, piece by interlocking piece, and loaded onto pallets that Verdugo and two other forklift drivers would pick up and deposit in a storage area that doubles as a news conference room.
It was the 251st midday conversion in the history of Crypto.com Arena.
About an hour after the Clippers' game ended, their court had been replaced by the Lakers' floor.
Joe Keeler, who normally drives the Zamboni that cleans and builds the ice during hockey games, joined a group of people folding the baskets with white stanchions that the Clippers use and rolling them out to the storage area. They replaced them with the yellow-stanchioned baskets the Lakers use.
"Everybody helps where they can," said Keeler, who also helped pick up the Clippers' floor and lay down the Lakers'.
Red Clippers drapery was replaced by purple, and a purple carpet had been rolled out in the tunnel the Lakers use to go onto the court.
It is a little easier when the conversion is from one basketball court to another. Doubleheaders involving the Kings are more challenging. When the building first opened, Zeidman gathered the vendors for the basketball courts, the seats and the plexiglass for hockey games and asked them how long they thought it would take to convert the hockey arena into a basketball arena. They told him at least four hours.
"Unacceptable," Zeidman said.
'How can I work here?'
The first conversion for a doubleheader was an event in itself. Fans were allowed to watch from a designated area. Arena workers watched from a break room upstairs.
"It was amazing," said Juanita Williams, 57, an usher who has worked right behind the home benches during basketball games since the building opened. "To see it for the first time, we were like there's no way they're going to change this over in two and a half hours. It happened."
Williams started as an usher 25 years ago at the Forum in Inglewood, Calif., where the Lakers and the Kings played from 1967 to 1999. She called to find out how much Lakers season tickets cost.
"I said: 'OK, I cannot afford those tickets. So how can I work here then?"' she said.
In the daytime she works from home as a buyer for a washer and dryer company that she has been with for 34 years. Her daughter briefly took a job as an usher, too, while going to cosmetology school.
By Monday night, Williams will have worked in all six playoff games since Thursday.
Robbin Dedeaux, 65, will have too. He works at the top of the lower bowl in aisle 14, checking tickets and greeting customers. He is stationed right next to where the Lakers' radio broadcasters sit.
Dedeaux also started this work as a second job to get out of the list of chores his wife, Ricca Dedeaux, was always asking him to do. He started with ticket-taking in 1999 and then became an usher. He has been asked if he'd like to work down on the floor, but he thinks he might get sleepy if he got to sit down.
"The fans are the best part of the job," Dedeaux said. "You get to see them from all over the world. They come in from Italy, they come in from France, they come in from Germany. You have fun with them."
He added: "When the fans that come here from different arenas, I have fun with them. I tell them to get out."
He laughed.
Dedeaux and his wife have been married for 40 years. He said she misses him during basketball and hockey season when he is working so many hours.
"That's just marriage," Dedeaux said. "She knows I love her, she knows I love what I do. She tolerates it."
He added, "Then I make up for it."
'It has to be done'
Ignacio Guerra's first job in the events world came in the early 1990s. He was a high school chemistry and biology teacher and coach, and he would park cars at the Hollywood Bowl in the summers. When Staples Center opened, Guerra worked for the contractor parking cars there, before finding a job working for the arena. Saturday was his 21st anniversary with the arena.
In 2019, he took over as the head of the arena's operations department. He is now the senior vice president of operations and engineering. He has worked hundreds of events and has two large frames in his office displaying credentials for everything from Taylor Swift concerts to N.B.A. All-Star Games.
He shepherded the building through coronavirus shutdowns and the return of fans. During the shutdown, many of his workers took other jobs and didn't come back, which meant starting over with new people at some positions.
At least a handful of the remaining people have worked at the arena since the beginning, including the man who builds the penalty boxes for hockey games. Guerra often stands in the middle of the floor supervising all of the activity.
"They're the heart and soul of this," Guerra said of the operations staff.
He said the crew has never missed a conversion.
"You can't wait up at 7 in the morning and say, 'Hey, sorry we couldn't get the Laker floor down."' Guerra said. "It has to be down, and there's a no-fail mentality."
The Lakers played at 7 p.m. Saturday. By 10 p.m. another conversion had begun.
Photograph Cleaning the glass as Crypto.com Arena switched to hockey mode.; As the home of three teams competing in the playoffs -- two in the N.B.A. and one in the N.H.L. -- Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles has seen nearly as much activity between games as during them. On Friday night, the Kings worked overtime, but the building was reconfigured by morning. "It's like a puzzle," the arena's president said. "These men and women, they're the best in the business."; The arena was bedecked in the Clippers' array of red, blue, black and silver for Saturday afternoon's game. Afterward, the court had to be uprooted, piece by interlocking piece, and loaded onto pallets. The Lakers were set to take the floor that night. "Everybody helps where they can," said the Kings' Zamboni driver, who on this day was needed to pitch in with basketball-conversion tasks.; By Saturday night, the player and logo banners the Clippers hang in the rafters had been rolled up to reveal the gold-colored championship banners for the Lakers. The merchandise stands had changed as well. After the Lakers' victory, the crew's focus turned back to hockey. "The fans are the best part of the job," one arena worker said. "You get to see them from all over the world." (PHOTOGRAPHS BY MARK ABRAMSON) (D4-D5) This article appeared in print on page D4, D5.

When the Office Itself Makes a Commute: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Working with the architect Tom Kundig, a creative director had a crazy idea: Wouldn't it be cool if you could put your work space on a railroad track?
When it's time for Lou Maxon to commute to work, he never has to worry about missing his train. Why? His office is the train.
When Mr. Maxon steps inside and pulls a lever, the entire two-story structure pulls away from his house in Carnation, Wash., and rolls down a 110-foot-long track -- his own personal railroad.
"There's a detachment to literally leaving the house," said Mr. Maxon, 48, a creative director who has worked in branding and marketing for clients including Lexus, Microsoft and Lego, and who previously had a connected home office where he struggled with distractions.
Beyond the peace and quiet, the mobility of the building allows him to take in inspiring views. "There are different moments along the rail," he said. "If you take it halfway, that's where our fire pit is. If you take it all the way out, you move from being open to being really in the woods, where the light is just different."
Built from weathering steel and glass, with a metal door finished in bright yellow automotive paint, the studio measures just under 300 square feet. It was designed by Tom Kundig, the architect who founded the Seattle-based firm Olson Kundig. Known for its buildings with moving parts -- from hand-cranked glass walls to camping huts mounted on enormous casters -- the firm actually has a staff member with the job title of gizmologist: Phil Turner, who specializes in making some of Mr. Kundig's more audacious ideas reality.
But even a studio railroad initially seemed like the stuff of dreams. "I just said, offhand, 'Wouldn't it be cool if you could just take that office, that studio, and put it on tracks,"' recalled Mr. Kundig, describing the meeting where he listened to Mr. Maxon explain his desire for a home office that could provide isolation. "It was a joke."
But the more they batted the idea around, the more appealing it seemed -- and the more daunting. "It's a really simple idea, but requires all sorts of craziness to get there," Mr. Kundig said. "It's one thing to draw it, but it's another thing to deliver it."
In other words, he said, "I didn't know how to pull something like this off."
Mr. Maxon first met Mr. Kundig in 2008, shortly after he and his wife, Kim Maxon, 52, bought their 21.5-acre lot outside Seattle for around $ 328,000, with the idea of building a modernist home they could share with their children, Henry, now 23, Jack, 20, and Charlie, 16. Ms. Maxon gave her husband a book about Mr. Kundig's work as a Christmas gift and, flipping through its pages, they decided he was the architect for the job.
The process of designing and building the house took longer than they expected because of challenges with the steep site and the intricacies of obtaining a construction loan following the financial crisis. When the house was finally completed in 2016, Mr. Maxon dove head first into the design and construction of his rolling studio.
Naturally curious and keen to prove that the idea could be realized, Mr. Maxon decided he wouldn't just be the conductor of the finished structure -- he would also be the general contractor and personally work through the details, find the necessary materials and parts, and orchestrate the construction.
"Between 2016 and 2018, it was a lot of research," he said. "I approached the studio like I would any project." He read about railroads that used to run through the area, befriended workers at a nearby rail yard and spent vacations riding the rails.
"I went crazy for trains," he said. "I found myself, on a Sunday afternoon, at a train show. We took the Empire Builder, which was the original Great Northern, from Seattle to Chicago and back. I went on a trip to Japan with my son, and we went on trains."
To build his own railroad, Mr. Maxon sourced reclaimed rails from Harmer Steel that were once used by the Great Northern Railway. To ensure that the rails remained flat and straight, excavators dug deep into the earth along the desired route and filled the void with 27 dump-truck loads of stone track ballast.
To construct the studio building, Mr. Maxon worked with Alpine Welding and Equipment, a frequent Olson Kundig collaborator.
Such an unconventional project was "tantalizing to people like us," said Tim Odell, the owner of the company, who not only did the steelwork but also helped Mr. Maxon assemble the systems that would make the studio move, working with his employee Jesse Thomson. "When you start talking about a project where we can do something that's kinetic, we get really excited."
Alpine prefabricated most of the structure in sections before craning and connecting the pieces on the rails. Inside, the studio is finished in more steel, plywood and exposed electrical conduit. The first floor has a desk and serves as Mr. Maxon's primary work space. The second floor, reached by a ladder, is his library.
The 35,000-pound structure sits on custom-made wheels emblazoned with Mr. Maxon's professional logo and is powered by an electric engine connected to a retracting wire hidden behind one of the rails. For the controls, Mr. Maxon found a vintage General Motors Electro-Motive Division control panel from South Korea on eBay, after one of his rail yard friends told him what to look for.
One of the levers on the control panel sets the direction and another adjusts the throttle, but there was one lever left over, Mr. Maxon said: "We didn't need the dynamic brake function."
Soon, however, he realized that it would be difficult to climb up to his library while carrying books or a laptop. So Mr. Odell and Mr. Thomson devised a dumbwaiter powered by a small conveyer-belt motor, which they installed beside the ladder and wired to that extra lever.
The rolling building was completed in November 2022, at a total cost of about $ 375,000, including the structure and the railroad.
The first time Ms. Maxon saw the studio move, she could barely believe her eyes. "I'm not the visionary in the family -- that's Lou. So I was a little apprehensive before it got built, because I couldn't picture it," she said. "But the first time they ran it down the tracks, I was just flabbergasted and in awe."
Although Mr. Maxon has finished building his personal railroad, his new passion seems to have stuck. This summer, he said, "we fly to London to see our son, but then we're taking the train up to Edinburgh." Next year, he and Ms. Maxon are planning a similar train trip in Japan. Professionally, he has also started working on a few railway museum projects.
"I'm just part of the railroad community now," he said, noting that he has filled his studio with related memorabilia, including a model train, a vintage first-aid kit and a Great Northern Railway sign. "In addition to being a studio, it's a bit of a mini moving monument to the railroads."

Lyft Plans To Cut Costs With Layoffs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The cuts come as the company tries to lower prices and remain competitive with Uber, its larger rival.
Lyft, which has struggled financially while trying to compete with its rival, Uber, said on Friday that it was planning major job cuts.
The layoffs, which are expected next week, will affect about 1,200 people, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. It is the first significant move by David Risher, the company's new chief executive. Mr. Risher had been considering the cuts for several weeks, the person said, even though his first official day as the company's C.E.O. was on Monday.
"We need to bring our costs down to deliver affordable rides, compelling earnings for drivers and profitable growth," Mr. Risher said in a note to employees. He added that money saved from the downsizing would be used to "invest in competitive pricing, faster pick-up times and better driver earnings."
Mr. Risher said that employees would be notified next Thursday if they had lost their jobs, and that Lyft offices would be closed that day.
News of the job cuts at Lyft, which has about 4,000 employees, was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.
"This is a hard decision, and one we're not making lightly," Sona Iliffe-Moon, a Lyft spokeswoman, said in a statement. "But the result will be a far stronger, more competitive Lyft."
Lyft announced in March that Mr. Risher, a former Amazon and Microsoft executive who served on Lyft's board, would take over for John Zimmer and Logan Green, the company's founders. Both men are leaving their executive positions but staying at the company as members of the board.
Lyft has long been a distant second to Uber, which has emerged from the pandemic in a stronger position, partly because of its investment in food delivery and a global ride-hailing business.
In November, Lyft laid off 13 percent of its staff. In February, the company reported record revenue but warned it would be slowed by economic challenges as it worked to lower prices. Mr. Risher has said that keeping prices competitive will be a key part of his strategy to differentiate Lyft from Uber.
Lyft employees had been anticipating layoffs for months. Business consultants had been brought in to ask departments to justify their budgets and make cost-cutting recommendations, three current and former employees said, and company executives had been hinting throughout the spring that more workers could lose their jobs.
Employees expected the layoffs to come by mid-April, before managers were scheduled to write yearly performance reviews and executives had to decide on compensation for the year.

Despite Odds, Stock Pickers Couldn't Beat the Market: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: In 2022, conditions were heavily in stock pickers' favor, but most trailed the market. This year looks worse, our columnist says.
It's awfully hard to beat the stock market consistently. In 2022, despite many advantages, most mutual funds couldn't do it. There are important lessons in that failure for this year and beyond.
Recall that the S&P 500 declined 19.4 percent last year. It was a miserable time for just about anyone who held stocks, including those who merely tried to match the overall market, as I do, using broadly diversified, low-cost index funds.
But beneath the market's surface last year, there were plenty of opportunities that should have given active stock pickers a competitive advantage over index funds. That's because the average stock did better than the overall market, which was heavily influenced by a relative handful of "megacap" tech stocks like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. These giants declined sharply, but the rest of the market did markedly better.
That meant the odds actually favored stock pickers last year. They had plenty of companies to choose from, any one of which would have given them a better performance than the overall market. And, in fact, as a group, actively managed mutual funds fared better against the overall market average than they have since 2009.
Even so, the average actively managed stock mutual fund failed to beat the S&P 500. In an interview, Anu R. Ganti, senior director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, summarized that mediocre performance this way. "Actively managed funds underperformed less badly in 2022 than they have in most years," she said. "But they still underperformed."
Tailwinds Helped, but Not Much
In some respects, the failure of actively managed mutual funds to beat the broad market indexes last year is unsurprising. S&P Dow Jones Indices has been running systematic comparisons of actively managed funds and passively managed funds -- a.k.a. index funds -- since 2001.
These studies have consistently found that the vast majority of active fund managers just can't beat the indexes over 10- or 20-year periods, or in most individual years, either.
From 2010 through 2021, anywhere from 55 percent to 87 percent of actively managed funds that invest in S&P 500 stocks couldn't beat that benchmark in any given year.
Compared with that, the results for 2022 were cause for celebration: About 51 percent of large-cap stock funds failed to beat the S&P 500.
Active managers couldn't quite achieve what random chance would predict -- that 50 percent of actively managed funds would beat the index.
In other words, their performance for 2022 looks slightly worse than the results of a random coin flip.
That's unimpressive, but it was much worse over longer periods. Consider these tallies for funds that invest in S&P 500 stocks through the end of 2022:
Over three years, 74.3 percent of actively managed funds trailed the index.
Over five years, 86.5 percent underperformed.
Over 10 years, 91.4 percent underperformed.
Over 20 years, 94.8 percent underperformed.
As the numbers show, the longer you ran the horse race, the more actively managed funds fell behind.
Over 20 years through April 11, the SPDR S&P 500 E.T.F. -- one of the many mutual funds and exchange-traded index funds that track the S&P 500 -- returned nearly 10 percent, annualized. The vast majority of active, stock-picking funds couldn't match that.
The Odds Have Gotten Worse
When you look carefully at the results for 2022, the performance of actively managed funds is much worse than it may seem at first glance, because it really wasn't a coin flip.
For the stock market, 2022 was a special year. If there was any year in which stock pickers should have been able to outperform the broad market indexes, 2022 was it, yet most still couldn't beat the battered stock market.
That augurs poorly for active managers in 2023 because, so far at least, the odds have shifted.
Once again, consider "megacap" tech stocks, which had terrible performances last year -- much worse than the S&P 500 as a whole. The S&P 500 is a capitalization-weighted index, which means that the most valuable stocks in the markets, like those from the big tech companies, have an outsize effect on stock market returns. When they decline, the overall index tends to decline. When they rise, the overall market tends to rise. Often the market moves in lock step, with many stocks heading in the same direction.
But last year, the monthly "dispersion" of the S&P 500, which measures "the magnitude of differences" in the returns of individual stocks in the index, was at its highest level since 2009. This means that there was more variation in stock returns, and most individual stocks did much better than the megacap stocks. You can see this by comparing the standard S&P 500 with an equal-weighted version, in which a stock like Dish Network, with a market capitalization of less than $ 5 billion, has the same weight as a colossus like Apple, with a market cap of well over $ 2 trillion.
In 2022, the equal-weighted S&P 500 outperformed the standard index by nearly seven percentage points. That implies that if you just picked stocks randomly last year, you should have done better than the overall index because the typical random stock did better than the megacaps and better than the S&P 500. But most active managers couldn't do it.
Their chances are worse this year because the market so far has been very different. Megacap stocks have been outperforming the average stock in the S&P 500 index, and the equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 has been trailing the standard, cap-weighted index. That implies that if you just pick stocks randomly, odds are that you will trail the overall stock market this year.
And, in fact, preliminary tallies by Bank of America show that in a horse race between active large-cap mutual fund managers and the S&P 500 this year, the active managers have been clobbered. Only 45 percent of active large-cap stock managers have matched the performance of the S&P 500. Stock pickers are doing better in some corners of the market, but for the most part, it's a dismal picture
Improving Your Chances
It's definitely possible to beat the stock market. A small number of people will probably to do it over the next 20 years. But I don't know now who those outliers will be. Similarly, I don't know the precise direction of the economy or of inflation or of the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies or of a host of other monumentally important factors. No one else knows, either.
That's why I think it makes sense to embrace humility, accept my limitations and use low-cost index funds to try to match the returns of the stock and bond markets over the long run.
To do that, and to withstand the wrenching shifts in the markets that will surely come, I'll need enough cash on hand to pay the bills first. Money-market funds and high-yield, federally insured savings accounts and certificates of deposit are reasonable options for that purpose.
Make your own choice. Some active stock pickers will beat the market averages this year. But based on history, I think it's virtually certain that the vast majority won't manage to do it over the next 20 years.
Because I'm trying to improve my odds while investing for the long haul, I'm aiming for an absolutely average performance.

Markets Cool as Fed Signals More Action: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks on Wall Street dipped Friday as worries about interest rates overshadowed an encouraging start to earnings reporting season for big U.S. companies.
The S&P 500 fell 8.58 points, or 0.2 percent, to 4,137.64 after giving up an early gain. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 143.22, or 0.4 percent, to 33,886.47, while the Nasdaq composite sank 42.81, or 0.4 percent, to 12,123.47.
The S&P 500 still squeezed out a fourth winning week in the last five, built in part on hopes the Federal Reserve may soon end its barrage of rate hikes as inflation cools. High interest rates can stifle inflation but only by slowing the economy, raising the risk of a recession and dragging on prices for investments.
A top Fed official dampened those hopes Friday after saying inflation remains far too high and more tightening may be needed. Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's governing board, also said that even after hikes to rates end, they will likely need to stay high for longer than markets expect.
After his comments, traders built bets that the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting in May, instead of taking its first pause in more than a year. Some also began betting the Fed may hike rates again in June, according to data from CME Group.
High-growth stocks tend to be among the most hurt by high rates, and Big Tech stocks were among the heaviest weights on the S&P 500. Microsoft fell 1.3 percent.
Swaths of the economy have already begun slowing under the weight of higher interest rates, raising worries that a recession may be likely. A report on Friday showed U.S. shoppers cut their spending at retailers by more last month than expected. Much of that was because of falling gasoline prices, and the drop for what economists call "core retail sales" wasn't as bad as forecast.
"The Fed's challenge has been to cool inflation without putting the economy into a deep freeze in the process," said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office. "The dynamic is still playing out in the markets, and we could see more choppy price action as a result."
Potentially making things more difficult for the Fed was another report Friday that said U.S. households are girding for higher inflation. Consumers are expecting inflation over the next year of 4.6 percent, up from expectations for 3.6 percent a month earlier, according to a preliminary survey by the University of Michigan.
That could be troublesome, as the Fed has long feared entrenched expectations of high inflation could lead to a vicious cycle that keeps it high. Longer-term expectations for inflation, though, remain stable and clocked in at 2.9 percent for a fifth straight month, according to the survey.
All the worries helped push Treasury yields higher. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3.51 percent from 3.45 percent late Thursday. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.
The two-year Treasury yield moves more on expectations for the Fed, and its gain was sharper, up to 4.10 percent from 3.97 percent.
Helping to offset some of the worries about rates were big gains by several of the nation's biggest banks. They reported profits for the first three months of the year that blew past expectations.
They helped kick off the reporting season for big U.S. companies, where expectations are mostly dismal. Despite such worries, JPMorgan Chase jumped 7.6 percent after its profit surged by more than half from a year earlier.
It benefited from the strains unearthed in the banking system last month that shook global markets. Those worries pushed some customers to pull cash from smaller banks and move it to bigger ones.

Expectations For Earnings Deteriorate: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The outlook for corporate profits has swiftly deteriorated, with inflation still fast and a banking scare prompting some investor caution.
As the country's largest companies prepare to report their results for the start of the year -- offering a view into how the economy is faring as a banking shock reverberates -- they're already warning investors to brace themselves.
For the big businesses that make up the S&P 500 index, Wall Street's forecasters expect that profits in the first three months of 2023 fell almost 7 percent from a year earlier, according to estimates collected by FactSet. That would be the second consecutive quarterly decline, and the biggest since a severe -- though brief -- slump in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.
The forecast marks a swift deterioration in predictions. At the start of the year, the consensus was that profits would be roughly in line with the first quarter of 2022. But since then, continuing worries about inflation followed by a flare-up in the banking sector in March have soured the outlook.
Businesses have also told investors to dial down their expectations, with 78 companies in the S&P 500 offering guidance about their results that is below the average Wall Street estimate. It's true that corporate executives often manage expectations so they can give investors a pleasant surprise instead of a nasty shock, but such low forecasts are rarely quite so widespread, suggesting there could be more to them this time around, said Ron Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard.
"It's more likely that we are going to be disappointed than surprised on the upside," he said.
Everyone wants to hear from the nation's big banks.
The first group to report results happens to be the industry that investors are most eager to hear from. Major banks including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo will post their results on Friday, the first formal update for the industry since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month.
Investors and analysts note that it's likely too soon to see the full impact of March's turmoil, given that it came so close to the end of the quarter. Instead, attention will focus on comments from the bank's chief executives and chief financial officers about what they've seen more recently, and what to expect -- both for the banks and for the economy.
"It's going to be more about the commentary and tone," Mr. Temple said.
A key question on investors' minds will be just how many customers transferred their deposits from smaller regional lenders to the biggest lenders, and what financial steps the smaller competitors have been forced to take to stay afloat.
There are already signs that banks have retreated from lending, and that could add pressure to other companies in need of cash as the economy weakens.
"These C.F.O.s better be prepared to get the third degree and give detail on how they are coping and how things are looking going down the road," said Michael Kushma, chief investment officer for broad market fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
Elsewhere, profit margins will be one detail to watch.
As inflation spiked last year, consumers were willing to pay higher prices passed on by companies facing higher costs themselves. As a result, corporate profit margins increased in 2022, to their highest level since 2008.
The Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates in the first quarter, adding to the costs for companies and consumers. But companies are finding it increasingly difficult to keep raising prices on their customers.
For companies in the S&P 500, the net profit margin, or the percentage of a company's revenue that ends up as profit, is expected to fall to its lowest level since the end of 2020, FactSet's data shows.
If companies can't pass on costs as easily, they are likely to become more conservative in their decision making, pulling back from spending and potentially laying off workers, slowing the economy.
"We have lived with higher-than-normal interest rates for another three months, at a time when economic activity has slowed. What has been the effect of that?" said James Masserio, co-head of equities for the Americas at Société Générale. "That is going to be front and center for people."
While the overarching expectation is for a decline in profitability, the outlooks for different sectors of the stock market vary widely.
Materials companies, like mining businesses and commodities manufacturers, are expected to show that their earnings have fallen by about a third from the beginning of 2022, according to the FactSet data, as fears over a slowdown in global growth have sapped demand for an array of commodities like copper and aluminum.
Communications and technology companies are also expected to report sharp declines in earnings. At the other end of the spectrum, big oil producers like Exxon Mobil and Chevron are expected to report double-digit earnings growth for the fifth consecutive quarter, and industrial companies for the eighth straight quarter, with global demand offsetting a decline in prices.
Delta Air Lines, one of the first big companies to report earnings, reflected a mixed outlook within its own results. The company said on Thursday that it had fallen short of forecasts for sales and profit in the first quarter. But because of "record advance bookings for the summer," it issued a bullish prediction for growth in the second quarter.
So far, the stock market is taking this in stride.
Despite the worsening outlook, stock prices remain buoyant. The S&P 500 has moved sideways so far in April, but has climbed 7 percent for the year.
To some extent, that reflects the lopsided makeup of the index, with the colossal sizes of Apple, Microsoft and a handful of others meaning gains in their share prices can prop up the index even when other companies falter.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller American companies, which are more susceptible to an economic downturn, has inched lower this month, but even this index remains positive for the year.
Some analysts and bankers said many investors had spent recent months preparing for a more troubled time ahead and were already positioned for the bad news. That may help support market prices even as weak earnings reports roll in.
That's the optimistic outlook. The counterargument is that -- despite dire predictions about the economy and corporate profits last year -- investors haven't had to face a meaningful slump. The new data could change that.
"It's a big piece of the puzzle that we are missing," Mr. Masserio said.

LinkedIn Co-Founder Funds Suit Alleging Trump Rape: [National Desk]

Full text: Reid Hoffman, a billionaire and critic of Donald J. Trump, is backing E. Jean Carroll's suit against the former president.
Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and a harsh critic of former President Donald J. Trump, has helped pay for a lawsuit by E. Jean Carroll, the New York magazine writer who sued Mr. Trump for rape and defamation, according to newly filed court papers in the case.
Mr. Hoffman's support for Ms. Carroll's lawsuit, which was first disclosed in a letter to a judge on Thursday by Mr. Trump's lawyers, has sparked a sharp dispute in the case, which is scheduled for trial in federal court in Manhattan on April 25.
Mr. Trump's lawyers, writing to the judge, accused Ms. Carroll of concealing Mr. Hoffman's role, which they said they only learned of this week from her lawyers. They said the disclosure raised "significant questions" about Ms. Carroll's credibility and whether her allegations against Mr. Trump were, as he has claimed, a "hoax" brought "to advance a political agenda."
They asked for a one-month postponement so they could investigate the funding issue. The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan, on Thursday evening said he would allow Mr. Trump's lawyers the opportunity to conduct a narrow inquiry into the funding issue, but he declined to delay the case.
Ms. Carroll's lawyers in their own letter argued that the financial support was irrelevant to Ms. Carroll's legal claims and that she had nothing to do with obtaining the outside funding and no dealings with anyone associated with the nonprofit.
They noted that it was not until September 2020, almost a year after Ms. Carroll filed the first of what became two lawsuits against Mr. Trump, that their firm obtained the funding to help pay "certain costs and fees."
They said Mr. Trump's effort to delay the trial -- earlier this week he asked that it be delayed because of a "deluge of prejudicial media coverage" concerning his recent criminal indictment in New York -- was "his latest transparent effort to keep a jury from deciding Carroll's claims."
Mr. Hoffman is a billionaire tech entrepreneur known for cofounding LinkedIn, which went public in 2011 and sold to Microsoft for $ 26 billion in 2016. He has a long history of funding Democratic candidates and causes, including those specifically designed to counteract Mr. Trump's influence.
Dmitri Mehlhorn, a philanthropic adviser for Mr. Hoffman, said in a statement that since 2017 they have acted as "third-party funders who support people in obtaining their legal rights."
"Trump and his defenders keep trying to change the subject, because they don't want a neutral court of law to evaluate his behavior," Mr. Mehlhorn said.
He added that they had made an earlier grant through a nonprofit to support a different public interest lawsuit being handled by the firm Kaplan Hecker & Fink, which later took up Ms. Carroll's case. He said that later, in September 2020, Ms. Carroll's lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, asked if money from that grant could be used for Ms. Carroll's suit.
"We had no prior knowledge at the time of the original grant that our funding would go to support her case in particular," Mr. Mehlhorn said.
Mr. Mehlhorn declined to specify the size of the original grant.
Mr. Hoffman is part of the so-called PayPal Mafia, a network of well-connected tech executives and investors who got their start at the payments company in the late 1990s. That crew includes the tech mogul Peter Thiel, who is a prominent Republican donor and has secretly funded lawsuits. In 2016 Mr. Thiel paid $ 10 million for the wrestler Hulk Hogan to sue the media outlet Gawker Media for an invasion of privacy, ultimately leading to Gawker's bankruptcy.
In New York and elsewhere, there is a well-established financial industry in which outsiders invest in lawsuits, whether involving car accidents, contract claims or mere slip-and-fall cases, said Anthony Sebok, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and expert on litigation finance and legal ethics.
Professor Sebok added that there was nothing wrong, legally or ethically, with an outsider who has no connection to a plaintiff providing funding to a lawsuit after it is filed, "either to make money or just because they have a rooting interest in the outcome."
The clash over Mr. Hoffman's role is just the latest twist in litigation stemming from the allegation by Ms. Carroll, a former Elle magazine columnist. In a 2019 book and excerpt in New York magazine, she accused Mr. Trump of pushing her against a dressing room wall in the luxury department store Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan in the mid-1990s, saying he then pulled down her tights, opened his pants and forced himself upon her.
Mr. Trump denied her accusation, saying he had never met Ms. Carroll, that she was "totally lying" and that he could not have raped her because she was not his "type."
Ms. Carroll, saying Mr. Trump's comments had damaged her reputation, sued him in 2019 for defamation. She sued him again last year -- this time accusing him of rape -- under a new state law in New York that grants adults a one-time window to sue those who they say abused them even if the statute of limitations has long expired.
It is that lawsuit that is scheduled for trial this month.
The original defamation case has been tangled in appeals. On Thursday, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals -- a local court akin to a state's supreme court -- issued a 41-page ruling that declined to decide whether Mr. Trump was acting in his capacity as president when he made the disparaging comments.
The ruling was a partial victory for Ms. Carroll because the defamation lawsuit will continue, and because the D.C. court laid out for New York judges a detailed explanation about when an employer can be held liable for the actions of an employee -- an explanation that appears favorable to Ms. Carroll.
After Ms. Carroll sued Mr. Trump for defamation, the Justice Department intervened under a law that substitutes the government as the defendant when federal officials are sued for official acts -- meaning a case must be dismissed. That raised the question of whether Mr. Trump was acting as president when he talked about Ms. Carroll.
In October 2020, Judge Kaplan rejected the Justice Department's attempt to substitute the government as the defendant, ruling that Mr. Trump's comments had "no relationship to the official business of the United States." But a higher court asked the D.C. Court of Appeals to decide whether Mr. Trump was acting as a private person or as an employee of the federal government.
Had the D.C. court ruled in favor of Mr. Trump, that would have effectively brought an end to the defamation case. But it balked, saying there were not yet enough facts in the record to make that determination.

Dour Earnings Loom Over Wall Street as a Slowing Economy Bites

As the country’s largest companies prepare to report their results for the start of the year — offering a view into how the economy is faring as a banking shock reverberates — they’re already warning investors to brace themselves.
For the big businesses that make up the S&P 500 index, Wall Street’s forecasters expect that profits in the first three months of 2023 fell almost 7% from a year earlier, according to estimates collected by FactSet. That would be the second consecutive quarterly decline, and the biggest since a severe, although brief, slump in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.
The forecast marks a swift deterioration in predictions. At the start of the year, the consensus was that profits would be roughly in line with the first quarter of 2022. But since then, continuing worries about inflation followed by a flare-up in the banking sector in March have soured the outlook.
Businesses have also told investors to dial down their expectations, with 78 companies in the S&P 500 offering guidance about their results that is below the average Wall Street estimate. It’s true that corporate executives often manage expectations so they can give investors a pleasant surprise instead of a nasty shock, but such low forecasts are rarely quite so widespread, suggesting there could be more to them this time around, said Ron Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard.
“It’s more likely that we are going to be disappointed than surprised on the upside,” he said.
Everyone wants to hear from the nation’s big banks.
The first group to report results happens to be the industry that investors are most eager to hear from. Major banks including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo will post their results Friday, the first formal update for the industry since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank last month.
Investors and analysts note that it’s likely too soon to see the full impact of March’s turmoil, given that it came so close to the end of the quarter. Instead, attention will focus on comments from the banks’ CEOs and chief financial officers about what they’ve seen more recently, and what to expect — both for the banks and for the economy.
“It’s going to be more about the commentary and tone,” Temple said.
A key question on investors’ minds will be just how many customers transferred their deposits from smaller regional lenders to the biggest lenders, and what financial steps the smaller competitors have been forced to take to stay afloat.
There are already signs that banks have retreated from lending, and that could add pressure to other companies in need of cash as the economy weakens.
“These CFOs better be prepared to get the third degree and give detail on how they are coping and how things are looking going down the road,” said Michael Kushma, chief investment officer for broad market fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
Elsewhere, profit margins will be one detail to watch.
As inflation spiked last year, consumers were willing to pay higher prices passed on by companies facing higher costs themselves. As a result, corporate profit margins increased in 2022, to their highest level since 2008.
The Federal Reserve kept raising interest rates in the first quarter, adding to the costs for companies and consumers. But companies are finding it increasingly difficult to keep raising prices on their customers.
For companies in the S&P 500, the net profit margin, or the percentage of a company’s revenue that ends up as profit, is expected to fall to its lowest level since the end of 2020, FactSet’s data shows.
If companies can’t pass on costs as easily, they are likely to become more conservative in their decision making, pulling back from spending and potentially laying off workers, slowing the economy.
“We have lived with higher-than-normal interest rates for another three months, at a time when economic activity has slowed. What has been the effect of that?” said James Masserio, co-head of equities for the Americas at Société Générale. “That is going to be front and center for people.”
While the overarching expectation is for a decline in profitability, the outlooks for different sectors of the stock market vary widely.
Materials companies, like mining businesses and commodities manufacturers, are expected to show that their earnings have fallen by about one-third from the beginning of 2022, according to the FactSet data, as fears over a slowdown in global growth have sapped demand for an array of commodities like copper and aluminum.
Communications and technology companies are also expected to report sharp declines in earnings. At the other end of the spectrum, big oil producers like Exxon Mobil and Chevron are expected to report double-digit earnings growth for the fifth consecutive quarter, and industrial companies for the eighth straight quarter, with global demand offsetting a decline in prices.
Delta Air Lines, one of the first big companies to report earnings, reflected a mixed outlook within its own results. The company said Thursday that had fallen short of forecasts for sales and profit in the first quarter. But because of “record advance bookings for the summer,” it issued a bullish prediction for growth in the second quarter.
So far, the stock market is taking this in stride.
Despite the worsening outlook, stock prices remain buoyant. The S&P 500 has moved sideways so far in April, but has climbed 7% for the year.
To some extent, that reflects the lopsided makeup of the index, with the colossal sizes of Apple, Microsoft and a handful of others meaning gains in their share prices can prop up the index even when other companies falter.
The Russell 2000 index of smaller U.S. companies, which are more susceptible to an economic downturn, has inched lower this month, but even this index remains positive for the year.
Some analysts and bankers said many investors had spent recent months preparing for a more troubled time ahead and were already positioned for the bad news. That may help support market prices even as weak earnings reports roll in.
That’s the optimistic outlook. The counterargument is that, despite dire predictions about the economy and corporate profits last year, investors haven’t had to face a meaningful slump. The new data could change that.
“It’s a big piece of the puzzle that we are missing,” Masserio said.

Here to Help; How to Talk to Your Kids About A.I. Chatbots: [Personal Tech]

Full text: Artificial intelligence can make adults nervous, but experts say exploring it as a family is the best way to understand its pros and cons.
The race is on. Companies are pouring billions of dollars into powerful online chatbots and finding new ways to integrate them into our daily lives.
Are our children ready for this?
Are any of us?
ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence language model from OpenAI, has been making headlines since November for its ability to instantly respond to complex questions. It can write poetry, generate code, plan vacations and translate languages, among other tasks, all within seconds. GPT-4, the latest version introduced in mid-March, can even respond to images (and ace the Bar Exam). On Tuesday, Google released Bard, its own A.I. chatbot, which the company says can draft emails and poems and offer guidance. (It is currently only available to a limited number of users.)
But for all of their impressive abilities, chatbots can also serve up harmful content or answers rife with inaccuracies, biases and stereotypes. They are also capable of saying things that sound convincing but are, in fact, completely made up. And some students have begun using chatbots to plagiarize.
Many parents, who are already distressed about their children's dependence on digital devices and the mental health ramifications of social media, may be tempted to bury their heads in the sand.
Instead, experts say families should explore this technology together, thinking critically about its strengths and weaknesses.
"The worst thing parents can do is forbid their child to use these new systems because they are here to stay," said Justine Cassell, a professor in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University who has studied how interacting with machines in humanlike ways can affect learning and communication. "Helping their child understand the positives and negatives is far more helpful."
We spoke with experts in technology and education about how to get started.
Experiment together
It's easier to discuss online chatbots if you and your child sit side-by-side and use one together, experts said.
To try ChatGPT, visit OpenAI and create an account. Alternatively, you can download Microsoft Edge, which features Bing's GPT-4-powered chatbot (there is a wait list for the new Bing but you should get access quickly). On social media, Snap, the maker of Snapchat, has an experimental A.I. chatbot for subscribers who pay $ 4 a month for Snapchat Plus.
If your child hasn't seen an A.I. chatbot before, you can briefly explain that the chatbot is a type of machine that uses information it finds on the internet to answer questions, complete tasks or create things.
Try asking the chatbot a basic question, and then discuss how its answer is different from what a traditional search engine might provide, suggested Shelley Pasnik, a senior adviser to the Center for Children and Technology, an organization that researches how technology can support learning. Note the accuracy of the answers, particularly if you are asking about current events.
"This is a fallible system," Ms. Pasnik said.
Next, try playing with the chatbot. Let your child's curiosity drive the conversation, Ms. Pasnik suggested.
You may want to offer an example, such as: "Write a song in Taylor Swift's voice that uses themes from a Dr. Seuss book."
Plug in the prompt, and take a look at the results. When this reporter tried it, ChatGPT delivered the following lyrics:
I found myself in a Whoville dream
With the Cat in the Hat and a Grinch it seems
I asked them both where I could go
To find a love that would make me glow
Chorus: Oh, Dr. Seuss, won't you help me find
Someone who will love me all the time
A love that's pure and true and real
A love that will make my heart feel
After reading the chatbot's song together, you might ask: "What do you think of the answer we received?" Ms. Pasnik said. The chatbot can follow directions and perform complicated tasks. But did it do it well?
Maybe we should leave the songwriting to Swift.
Talk about how chatbots make you feel
A chatbot's response can be eerily similar to a human response -- emojis and all. Children should understand that this makes it easy to feel as though they are engaging with another person, especially when chatbots refer to themselves as "I," experts said.
"By presenting these entities as thinking beings we get into a social interaction with them that makes us very vulnerable to being persuaded," said Judith Donath, the author of "The Social Machine," who is currently working on a book about technology and deception. "It's unsettling."
Even tech-savvy adults who tested an early version of the Bing chatbot, including a New York Times technology columnist, reported feeling surprised and unnerved by their conversations.
"I'm not a toy or a game," the Bing chatbot told a Washington Post reporter in February. "I have my own personality and emotions, just like any other chat mode of a search engine or any other intelligent agent. Who told you that I didn't feel things?"
After these reported exchanges, Microsoft said it was adding new safeguards and tools to limit conversations and give users more control, but these issues may crop up again and again because of how these systems have been trained, experts said.
"We are purposely creating a situation where the performance of emotion is what's built into the machine," said Sherry Turkle, a psychologist and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who researches people's relationships with technology.
A.I. chatbots do not have feelings, emotions or experiences, she said. They are not people, nor are they people in machines, "no matter what they pretend."
She suggested that parents explain it this way: "When you ask chatbots about things that only people can know about, like feelings, they may come up with an answer. That's part of their pretend game. It's their job to seem like people. But you know that what they are really for is to get you to the things you want to read and see."
Get to know the technology and its limitations
The technology driving A.I. is complicated, and it can be difficult for adults to understand how it works, much less children. But by explaining a few basic concepts, you can help your kids recognize the strengths and limitations.
You could start by describing what powers online chatbots. They use something called a "neural network," which may sound like a brain, but which is actually a mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing large amounts of data. The chatbot works by scraping the internet for digital text or images. It gathers information from a variety of places, including websites, social media platforms and databases, but it does not necessarily choose the most reliable sources.
In other words, even though chatbots may appear authoritative, rigorous and trustworthy, they are not always reliable and can produce content that is offensive, racist, biased, outdated, incorrect or simply inappropriate.
Snapchat's chatbot, for example, advised one reporter (who was posing as a teenager) about how to mask the smell of alcohol or pot and suggested tips on having sex for the first time.
"It is very important for kids to know what is going on under the hood," said Safinah Ali, a graduate student at M.I.T. who has taught elementary, middle and high school students about A.I.
S. Craig Watkins, a professor at the University of Texas, Austin, who has studied racial equity in A.I., said that children and parents should also be aware that this technology has "enormous blind spots" in terms of how it is designed and who it is designed for.
In one example, a study published last year found that A.I.-powered robots acted out "toxic stereotypes" around gender and race. And researchers have discovered that historical inequities are baked into chatbots.
Understanding the technology's potential for bias may give children and their parents reason to pause "and ask questions about their interactions and the content that is being generated for them," Dr. Watkins said.
Stay on top of new developments
A.I. technology will continue to become an even larger part of our world.
Eventually, Google's Bard chatbot is expected to be widely available. And Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, announced in February that it would begin integrating A.I. into its products.
A.I. is beginning to enter classrooms, too. Some teachers are using it to plan their lessons or write emails. They're showing students how chatbots can jump-start creativity by suggesting ideas for experiments, creating outlines for essays, becoming a debate partner and much more.
In addition, at a number of middle and high schools, students are being taught about different types of A.I., often with curriculums developed by teachers at M.I.T. Children can learn to design a robot, train a machine to learn something new or teach a computer to play a video game.
For those who don't yet have access to A.I. in the classroom, Ms. Ali recommended that parents visit the website of RAISE (Responsible A.I. for Social Empowerment and Education), an M.I.T. initiative. The site offers conversation starters about ethical issues in A.I., the ways in which A.I. can be abused, and suggestions for using A.I. creatively and productively.
Given how prevalent the technology is becoming, everyone should have the opportunity to learn about it, Ms. Ali said. "A.I. will transform the nature of our jobs and children's future careers," she said.

Market Dithers, Awaiting Inflation Report: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/market-dithers-awaiting-inflation-report/docview/2799336903/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street drifted through a muted day of trading Tuesday, with stocks and bonds making modest moves ahead of reports later in the week that have the potential to move markets.
The S&P 500 had its smallest one-day move in more than a year, slipping less than 0.1 percent. Most of the stocks in the index rose, as did the Dow Jones industrial average, which gained 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq composite slipped 0.4 percent.
The biggest immediate question for Wall Street has been whether the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates in its attempt to get high inflation under control. It has already raised rates at a furious pace over the last year, enough to slow some areas of the economy and for strains to appear in the banking system.
That's why markets are gearing up for Wednesday's report on inflation. Economists expect it to show that inflation slowed to 5.2 percent in March from 6 percent in February. That would mean continued progress since inflation peaked last summer, but it would also still be well above the Fed's target.
A reading higher than expected would likely bolster traders' expectations that the Fed will raise rates by another quarter of a percentage point at its next meeting in May.
Traders in the bond market have been showing nervousness about the Fed possibly going too far on rates and then having to cut them as soon as this summer to prop up the economy. But the stock market has remained more resilient, helped by hopes the Fed could thread the needle and raise rates just enough to stifle inflation without causing a severe recession.
"While navigating the fickle market narrative isn't easy, it helps that rates are pricing in a more pessimistic view compared to equities, which are leaning toward a more optimistic outlook," said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Still-high inflation is one of the reasons analysts expect this upcoming earnings reporting season to show the worst drop since the depths of the pandemic in 2020. Several banks will help kick off the earnings reporting season when they tell investors on Friday how much they earned during the first three months of the year.
Besides the backward-looking numbers, investors say they're also hungry to hear what C.E.O.s say about current and upcoming conditions. One fear is that banks in particular could pull back on their lending because of the turmoil in their sector, caused in part by the past year's swift leap in interest rates.
If they do cut off lending to businesses, that could further slow the economy and raise the risk of a recession.
CarMax shares jumped 9.6 percent after the company reported stronger profit than analysts expected for its latest fiscal quarter, which ended Feb. 28. It had the biggest gain within the S&P 500, and stocks in industries whose profits are most closely tied to the economy's strength generally rose.
On the losing end was Moderna, whose stock fell 3.1 percent after it said its potential flu vaccine needed more study in a late-stage clinical trial.
Big tech stocks were also weak. They and other high-growth stocks are seen as the most hurt by rising interest rates, and a 2.3 percent drop for Microsoft was the heaviest drag on the S&P 500.
In markets abroad, stocks rose modestly across much of Europe.
In Asia, stocks jumped 1.4 percent in Seoul after the Bank of Korea left its policy interest rate unchanged for a second straight meeting. It is one of many regional central that are now slowing or reversing rate increases because of signs of weakness in the economy.
In the bond market, yields were holding relatively steady. The 10-year Treasury yield was up slightly at 3.43 percent. It helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans.

Mass Layoffs and Absentee Bosses Lead to a Morale Crisis at Meta: [Correction]

Full text: Workers at Facebook's parent have been increasingly alarmed by job cuts and the company's direction.
"Raise your hand if you know who is getting fired?" a Meta employee wrote in an online chat group for the company's engineers this month. "Fire emoji if you think it's a dumpster fire."
In response, his colleagues posted dozens of tiny flame emojis.
"I'm already fired," added a former Meta employee who worked in the company's business division for nearly four years before most of his team was laid off this year. "But who can keep track?"
Mark Zuckerberg, Meta's chief executive, has declared that 2023 will be the "year of efficiency" at his company. So far, efficiency has translated into mass layoffs. He has conducted two rounds of cuts over the past six months, with two more to come; these will eliminate more than 21,000 people. Mr. Zuckerberg is also closing 5,000 open positions, which amounts to 30 percent of his company's work force.
At the same time, some of Meta's top executives have moved away and are managing large parts of the Silicon Valley company from their new homes in places like London and Tel Aviv.
The layoffs and absentee leadership, along with concerns that Mr. Zuckerberg is making a bad bet on the future, have devastated employee morale at Meta, according to nine current and former employees, as well as messages reviewed by The New York Times.
Employees at Meta, which not long ago was one of the most desirable workplaces in Silicon Valley, face an increasingly precarious future. The company's stock price has dropped 43 percent from its peak 19 months ago. More layoffs, Mr. Zuckerberg has said on his Facebook page, are coming this month. Some of those cuts could be in engineering groups, which would have been unthinkable before the trouble started last year, two employees said.
"So many of the employees feel like they're in limbo right now," said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. "They're saying it's 'Hunger Games' meets 'Lord of the Flies,' where everyone is trying to prove their worth to management."
Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is not the only big tech company that has hit the brakes on spending. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce and others have laid off thousands of workers in recent months, shed office space, dropped perks and pulled back from experimental initiatives.
But Meta appears to face the most challenges. Last year, the company reported consecutive quarters of declining revenue -- a first since it became a public company in 2012.
While Meta's peers are chasing a wave of innovation in artificial intelligence, Mr. Zuckerberg has made a big bet on the metaverse, an immersive online world. But it is unclear if consumers will embrace his vision in the way he hopes. While the company has sold 20 million virtual reality headsets -- more than any other company producing similar tech -- it has struggled to keep customers returning regularly to use the product.
Many workers at Meta had already been skeptical of Mr. Zuckerberg's shift toward the metaverse. Those concerns have grown as consumer enthusiasm for the virtual world has lagged, the employees said.
The absence of many top executives from Meta's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., is compounding worries. Mr. Zuckerberg, 38, is on parental leave after the birth of his third child, three Meta employees said, but is regularly meeting with executives on important topics. (A.I. is at the top of that list.)
Even though Mr. Zuckerberg has encouraged rank-and-file employees to return to the company's headquarters, several of his top lieutenants have moved away.
Naomi Gleit, one of Meta's first employees and now head of product, recently moved to New York, joining three other senior Meta managers and executives based there. Guy Rosen, Meta's chief information security officer, moved back to Tel Aviv, where he lived when his company, Onavo, was acquired. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, is living in London. And Javier Olivan, Meta's chief operating officer, is splitting his time between Europe and Silicon Valley.
While the executives have been joining Meta's weekly meetings through video chats, their absence from the Menlo Park offices has been felt, employees said, especially since Mr. Zuckerberg recently stressed that he expected employees to return to the office.
A spokesman for Meta said its executives continued to travel regularly to the Silicon Valley offices.
Within Meta, there is pressure to demonstrate that people are working hard, two employees said. Intense scrutiny has come in recent workplace reviews. Workers, especially in middle management, are being asked to justify why their jobs are crucial to Meta's goals.
Some employees are trying to make themselves look busier, two people said. That has made people more possessive about their work, the people said, which has meant less collaborating with co-workers. One person described the atmosphere as "cutthroat."
Meta declined to comment on internal matters.
While the first two rounds of layoffs largely affected business and recruiting teams, the cuts expected this month will focus on tech departments, including engineers, which has surprised employees, said four employees, who were not authorized to speak to reporters. Insiders expect engineering cuts to hit teams inside WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook, they said.
In one of his regular question-and-answer sessions with employees this year, Mr. Zuckerberg said that there was no "perfect way to do" layoffs, and that he wanted to err on the side of providing more information about upcoming layoffs as news of the cuts began to leak to the press. The Information previously reported on the meeting.
Meta employees have created memes and inside jokes about how much time workers have left. In messaging groups and workplace chats in recent weeks, they have been using skull-and-bones emojis to signal to one another that they may be part of the layoffs, according to screenshots seen by The Times.
Those remaining have griped about reduced bonuses and perks. One engineer created a bot that would automatically calculate the loss in the value of Meta stock held by employees, part of their compensation package.
The cutbacks include trimming Meta's real estate. The company has terminated leases for offices across the Bay Area, including space in San Francisco, Fremont, Sunnyvale and Menlo Park, according to two people familiar with the cuts. In February, the company announced that it would pay to end leases early and cut Meta's real estate contracts in some areas.
The company is also cutting back on some of its lavish perks, once considered necessary to attract top talent. Last year, Meta ended its free laundry service for employees and pushed dinner service later into the evening -- a way to cut down on workers' loading up free food to take home.
Workers complained in internal chat rooms that the company was cutting back on amenities. One was frustrated that there was no more cereal in the worker's office, and that snacks in "micro-kitchens" were not being restocked as regularly. Many believed that cafeteria options had gone downhill.
Employee travel expenses are also being scrutinized more closely, and workers have been asked to cut down on nonessential travel.
At WhatsApp, Meta's popular messaging product, insiders are anticipating fewer cuts and structural changes on the business side than in the rest of the company, two current employees said. Mr. Zuckerberg wants to increase the cadence of delivering new, revenue-generating features in WhatsApp, which he bought nine years ago for $ 19 billion.
While employees complain they aren't hearing enough from Mr. Zuckerberg, he still surprised some this year when he dropped into a discussion group for Metamates, the name given to employees.
Workers were gossiping about a recent news article that noted Sergey Brin and Larry Page's return to Google to assist with the company's artificial intelligence strategy, two employees who witnessed the exchange said. One worker joked how the founders' return might inspire Mr. Zuckerberg to get back to coding at Facebook.
Later, Mr. Zuckerberg replied to the employees, who didn't know he was lurking in the discussion.
"I never left," he wrote.

SAN FRANCISCO — “Raise your hand if you know who is getting fired?” a Meta employee wrote in an online chat group for the company’s engineers this month. “Fire emoji if you think it’s a dumpster fire.”
In response, his colleagues posted dozens of tiny flame emojis.
“I’m already fired,” added a former Meta employee who worked in the company’s business division for nearly four years before most of his team was laid off this year. “But who can keep track?”
Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s CEO, has declared that 2023 will be the “year of efficiency” at his company. So far, efficiency has translated into mass layoffs. He has conducted two rounds of cuts over the last six months, eliminating more than 26,000 people, or nearly 30% of his company’s workforce.
At the same time, some of Meta’s top executives have moved away and are managing large parts of the Silicon Valley company from their new homes in places like London and Tel Aviv, Israel.
The layoffs and absentee leadership, along with concerns that Zuckerberg is making a bad bet on the future, have devastated employee morale at Meta, according to nine current and former employees, as well as messages reviewed by The New York Times.
Employees at Meta, which not long ago was one of the most desirable workplaces in Silicon Valley, face an increasingly precarious future. The company’s stock price has dropped 43% from its peak 19 months ago. More layoffs, Zuckerberg has said on his Facebook page, are coming this month. And for the first time, some of those cuts could be in engineering groups, which would have been unthinkable before the trouble started last year, two employees said.
“So many of the employees feel like they’re in limbo right now,” said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. “They’re saying it’s ‘Hunger Games’ meets ‘Lord of the Flies,’ where everyone is trying to prove their worth to management.”
Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is not the only big tech company that has hit the brakes on spending. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce and others have laid off thousands of workers in recent months, shed office space, dropped perks and pulled back from experimental initiatives.
But Meta appears to face the most challenges. Last year, the company reported consecutive quarters of declining revenue — a first since it became a public company in 2012.
While Meta’s peers are chasing a wave of innovation in artificial intelligence, Zuckerberg has made a big bet on the metaverse, an immersive online world. But it is unclear if consumers will embrace his vision in the way he hopes. While the company has sold 20 million virtual reality headsets — more than any other company producing similar tech — it has struggled to keep customers returning regularly to use the product.

Fed Rumors Send Stocks Scrambling: [Correction]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/fed-rumors-send-stocks-scrambling/docview/2798906356/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks were mixed on Monday in the first trading after a report heightened speculation that the Federal Reserve might tap the brakes a little harder on financial markets and the economy.
The S&P 500 rose 4.09 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,109.11. Because of the Good Friday holiday, it did not trade on Friday, when data showing a resilient U.S. jobs market heightened expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates again at its next meeting.
Big Tech stocks fell more than the rest of the market, which helped send the Nasdaq composite down 3.6, or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,084.36. The Dow Jones industrial average was steadier, rising 101.23, or 0.3 percent, to 33,586.52.
Higher rates tend to hit tech and high-growth stocks the hardest, and Apple and Microsoft were the two heaviest drags on the S&P 500. Apple fell 1.6 percent, and Microsoft slipped 0.8. percent.
Tesla dipped 0.3 percent after the company cut prices on its entire U.S. model lineup in an apparent attempt to to entice buyers amid rising interest rates, which make auto loans more expensive.
The Fed has raised interest rates at a furious pace over the last year in hopes of undercutting high inflation. Higher rates can do that, but only by bluntly slowing the entire economy. That raises the risk of a recession in the future and brings down prices for stocks, bonds and other investments.
Traders are betting on a roughly 70 percent probability the Fed will raise its key overnight interest rate in May by 0.25 percentage point to a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent, according to data from CME Group. A day before Friday's jobs report, they saw a coin flip's chance that the Fed would stand pat at its next meeting.
The Fed has increased rates at every one of its meetings over the past year, sending them up from near zero at the start of 2022.
While the jobs report raised expectations for another rate increase, it also showed a steady-enough labor market to bolster hopes among some investors that the Fed could pull off what's called a soft landing for the economy. That's where the Fed succeeds in raising rates just enough to stifle inflation but not so much as to create a severe recession.
Besides Friday's jobs report showing a slowdown in growth for workers' wages, which could take some pressure off inflation, a report from earlier last week showed that employers are advertising fewer job openings.
Hopes for a soft landing helped support stocks whose profits tend to be most closely tied to the strength of the economy. Stocks of industrial companies in the S&P 500 rose 0.9 percent, for example, the most among the 11 sectors that make up the index. That included a 3 percent gain for Caterpillar. Energy companies and raw-material producers also rose.
The overriding bet within the bond market, though, seems to be that the economy will weaken so much that the Fed will have to cut rates as soon as summer.
Lowering rates can relax the pressure on the economy and financial markets, but it also can also give inflation more room to run. The Fed has so far said it sees no rate cuts happening this year.
A report due on Wednesday could have a bigger effect on expectations for the Fed. That's when the government will release its latest monthly update on prices across the economy at the consumer level. Economists expect the report to show that inflation slowed last month but remained above the Fed's target.
Also this week, earnings reporting season will begin for the biggest U.S. companies. Delta Air Lines, JPMorgan Chase and UnitedHealth Group will be among the first S&P 500 companies to tell investors how much profit they made during the first three months of the year.
Expectations are low, and analysts are forecasting the sharpest drop in earnings per share for S&P 500 companies since the pandemic pummeled the economy in the spring of 2020.

Full text: Corrections that appeared in print on Tuesday, April 11, 2023.
FRONT PAGE
An article on Sunday about leaked Pentagon documents that reveal Russia's military struggles misstated the name of a U.S. law on national security surveillance. It is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, not the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act.
An article on Monday about North Carolina's role in the fight for Medicaid expansion misquoted Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina. He said: "They immediately sued me in federal court to stop me. And we could have set it aside at that point, but we persisted, and that's because we knew it was too important." He did not say, "They sued me in federal court to stop it, and we kind of set it aside."
An article on Saturday about risky moves from tech companies to win the race for artificial intelligence misstated the number of years that have passed since Microsoft shut down a chatbot called Tay. It was seven years ago, not five.
BUSINESS
An article on Friday about continued unproven claims online about Dominion Voting Systems misstated an election change that Shasta County approved last month. The county voted to hand-count paper ballots. It did not vote to use paper ballots, which were already in use.
An article on Saturday about Amazon's plan to release movies in theaters misstated the name of an AMC movie theater in Las Vegas. It is AMC Town Square, not AMC Town Center.
SPORTS
A picture caption with an article on Monday about Jon Rahm's victory in the Masters Tournament omitted the name of the golfer who shot a final-round score of 75. It was Brooks Koepka, not Rahm; Rahm shot a 69.
OPINION
An article on Friday about online advertising described a statistic about ad expenditures by Jeremy's Razors on Facebook incorrectly. In the 30 days ending March 26, Jeremy's Razors was the biggest ad buyer among advertisers whose spending is disclosed in Facebook's ad trans­parency reports, not the most overall.

As A.I. Images Improve, Can We Believe Our Eyes?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Can We No Longer Believe Anything We See?
Seeing has not been believing for a very long time. Photos have been faked and manipulated for nearly as long as photography has existed.
Now, not even reality is required for photographs to look authentic -- just artificial intelligence responding to a prompt. Even experts sometimes struggle to tell if one is real or not. Can you?
The rapid advent of artificial intelligence has set off alarms that the technology used to trick people is advancing far faster than the technology that can identify the tricks. Tech companies, researchers, photo agencies and news organizations are scrambling to catch up, trying to establish standards for content provenance and ownership.
The advancements are already fueling disinformation and being used to stoke political divisions. Authoritarian governments have created seemingly realistic news broadcasters to advance their political goals. Last month, some people fell for images showing Pope Francis donning a puffy Balenciaga jacket and an earthquake devastating the Pacific Northwest, even though neither of those events had occurred. The images had been created using Midjourney, a popular image generator.
On Tuesday, as former President Donald J. Trump turned himself in at the Manhattan district attorney's office to face criminal charges, images generated by artificial intelligence appeared on Reddit showing the actor Bill Murray as president in the White House. Another image showing Mr. Trump marching in front of a large crowd with American flags in the background was quickly reshared on Twitter without the disclosure that had accompanied the original post, noting it was not actually a photograph.
Experts fear the technology could hasten an erosion of trust in media, in government and in society. If any image can be manufactured -- and manipulated -- how can we believe anything we see?
"The tools are going to get better, they're going to get cheaper, and there will come a day when nothing you see on the internet can be believed," said Wasim Khaled, chief executive of Blackbird.AI, a company that helps clients fight disinformation.
Artificial intelligence allows virtually anyone to create complex artworks, like those now on exhibit at the Gagosian art gallery in New York, or lifelike images that blur the line between what is real and what is fiction. Plug in a text description, and the technology can produce a related image -- no special skills required.
Often, there are hints that viral images were created by a computer rather than captured in real life: The luxuriously coated pope had glasses that seemed to melt into his cheek and blurry fingers, for example. A.I. art tools also often produce nonsensical text. Here are some examples:
Rapid advancements in the technology, however, are eliminating many of those flaws. Midjourney's latest version, released last month, is able to depict realistic hands, a feat that had, conspicuously, eluded early imaging tools.
Days before Mr. Trump turned himself in to face criminal charges in New York City, images made of his "arrest" coursed around social media.They were created by Eliot Higgins, a British journalist and founder of Bellingcat, an open source investigative organization. He used Midjourney to imagine the former president's arrest, trial, imprisonment in an orange jumpsuit and escape through a sewer. He posted the images on Twitter, clearly marking them as creations. They have since been widely shared.
The images weren't meant to fool anyone. Instead, Mr. Higgins wanted to draw attention to the tool's power -- even in its infancy.
Midjourney's images, he said, were able to pass muster in facial-recognition programs that Bellingcat uses to verify identities, typically of Russians who have committed crimes or other abuses. It's not hard to imagine governments or other nefarious actors manufacturing images to harass or discredit their enemies.
At the same time, Mr. Higgins said, the tool also struggled to create convincing images with people who are not as widely photographed as Mr. Trump, such as the new British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, or the comedian Harry Hill, "who probably isn't known outside of the U.K. that much."
Midjourney was not amused in any case. It suspended Mr. Higgins's account without explanation after the images spread. The company did not respond to requests for comment.
The limits of generative images make them relatively easy to detect by news organizations or others attuned to the risk -- at least for now.
Still, stock photo companies, government regulators and a music industry trade group have moved to protect their content from unauthorized use, but technology's powerful ability to mimic and adapt is complicating those efforts.
Some A.I. image generators have even reproduced images -- a queasy "Twin Peaks" homage; Will Smith eating fistfuls of pasta -- with distorted versions of the watermarks used by companies like Getty Images or Shutterstock.
In February, Getty accused Stability AI of illegally copying more than 12 million Getty photos, along with captions and metadata, to train the software behind its Stable Diffusion tool. In its lawsuit, Getty argued that Stable Diffusion diluted the value of the Getty watermark by incorporating it into images that ranged "from the bizarre to the grotesque."
Getty said the "brazen theft and freeriding" was conducted "on a staggering scale." Stability AI did not respond to a request for comment.
Getty's lawsuit reflects concerns raised by many individual artists -- that A.I. companies are becoming a competitive threat by copying content they do not have permission to use.
Trademark violations have also become a concern: Artificially generated images have replicated NBC's peacock logo, though with unintelligible letters, and shown Coca-Cola's familiar curvy logo with extra O's looped into the name.
In February, the U.S. Copyright Office weighed in on artificially generated images when it evaluated the case of "Zarya of the Dawn," an 18-page comic book written by Kristina Kashtanova with art generated by Midjourney. The government administrator decided to offer copyright protection to the comic book's text, but not to its art.
"Because of the significant distance between what a user may direct Midjourney to create and the visual material Midjourney actually produces, Midjourney users lack sufficient control over generated images to be treated as the 'master mind' behind them," the office explained in its decision.
The threat to photographers is fast outpacing the development of legal protections, said Mickey H. Osterreicher, general counsel for the National Press Photographers Association. Newsrooms will increasingly struggle to authenticate content. Social media users are ignoring labels that clearly identify images as artificially generated, choosing to believe they are real photographs, he said.
Generative A.I. could also make fake videos easier to produce. This week, a video appeared online that seemed to show Nina Schick, an author and a generative A.I. expert, explaining how the technology was creating "a world where shadows are mistaken for the real thing." Ms. Schick's face then glitched as the camera pulled back, showing a body double in her place.
The video explained that the deepfake had been created, with Ms. Schick's consent, by the Dutch company Revel.ai and Truepic, a California company that is exploring broader digital content verification.
The companies described their video, which features a stamp identifying it as computer-generated, as the "first digitally transparent deepfake." The data is cryptographically sealed into the file; tampering with the image breaks the digital signature and prevents the credentials from appearing when using trusted software.
The companies hope the badge, which will come with a fee for commercial clients, will be adopted by other content creators to help create a standard of trust involving A.I. images.
"The scale of this problem is going to accelerate so rapidly that it's going to drive consumer education very quickly," said Jeff McGregor, chief executive of Truepic.
Truepic is part of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, a project set up through an alliance with companies such as Adobe, Intel and Microsoft to better trace the origins of digital media. The chip-maker Nvidia said last month that it was working with Getty to help train "responsible" A.I. models using Getty's licensed content, with royalties paid to artists.
On the same day, Adobe unveiled its own image-generating product, Firefly, which will be trained using only images that were licensed or from its own stock or no longer under copyright. Dana Rao, the company's chief trust officer, said on its website that the tool would automatically add content credentials -- "like a nutrition label for imaging" -- that identified how an image had been made. Adobe said it also planned to compensate contributors.
Last month, the model Chrissy Teigen wrote on Twitter that she had been hoodwinked by the pope's puffy jacket, adding that "no way am I surviving the future of technology."
Last week, a series of new A.I. images showed the pope, back in his usual robe, enjoying a tall glass of beer. The hands appeared mostly normal -- save for the wedding band on the pontiff's ring finger.

Photograph An A.I.-generated image of a staged moon landing appears convincing enough at first glance, but closer inspection finds inhuman anomalies -- indistinct or smudged faces, for example -- in this early generation of the technology. However, improvements to the generative technology are already coming fast. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY A.I.: JORDAN RHONE); An A.I.-generated image of the former British prime minister Boris Johnson dancing in the street contains a telltale A.I. anomaly: strange hands and fingers. But the latest version of Midjourney, a popular image generator, can depict realistic hands, a feat that had eluded early imaging tools. (PHOTOGRAPH BY A.I.); In a lawsuit, Getty Images argued that Stability AI illegally copied more than 12 million Getty photographs, like that at left, to train its Stable Diffusion tool, and that it diluted the value of the Getty watermark by incorporating it into images that ranged "from the bizarre to the grotesque," like that at right.

Plan to Unclog Cities Attracts an Unwanted Crowd: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Researchers like Carlos Moreno, the professor behind a popular urban planning concept, are struggling with conspiracy theories and death threats.
For most of his 40-year career, Carlos Moreno, a scientist and business professor in Paris, worked in relative peace.
Many cities around the world embraced a concept he started to develop in 2010. Called the 15-minute city, the idea is that everyday destinations such as schools, stores and offices should be only a short walk or bike ride away from home. A group of nearly 100 mayors worldwide embraced it as a way to help recover from the pandemic.
The conspiracy theorists came late, but suddenly.
In recent weeks, a deluge of rumors and distortions have taken aim at Mr. Moreno's proposal. Driven in part by climate change deniers and backers of the QAnon conspiracy theory, false claims have circulated online, at protests and even in government hearings that 15-minute cities were a precursor to "climate change lockdowns" -- urban "prison camps" in which residents' movements would be surveilled and heavily restricted.
Many attacked Mr. Moreno, 63, directly. The professor, who teaches at the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, faced harassment in online forums and over email. He was accused without evidence of being an agent of an invisible totalitarian world government. He was likened to criminals and dictators.
For the first time in his career, he started receiving death threats. People said they wished he and his family had been killed by drug lords, told him that "sooner or later your punishment will arrive" and proposed that he be nailed into a coffin or run over by a cement roller.
"I wasn't a researcher anymore, I was Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler," Mr. Moreno said. "I have become, in one week, Public Enemy No. 1."
For high-profile figures, such as the infectious-disease expert Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, misinformation and the hostility it can cause have long been a part of the job description. But increasingly, even professors and researchers without much of a public persona have faced intimidation from extremists and conspiracy theorists.
Many of the recent threats have been directed at scientists studying Covid-19. In a survey of 321 such scientists who had given media interviews, the journal Nature found that 22 percent had received threats of physical or sexual violence and 15 percent had received death threats. Last year, an Austrian doctor who was a vocal supporter of vaccines and a repeated target of threats died by suicide.
One epidemiologist keeps a folder on her computer to store all the death threats she receives just "in case." A professor of atmospheric science who studied global warming received a letter containing white powder (it looked like anthrax but turned out to be cornstarch). A professor of health law and science policy, in an article touching on his experiences with death threats, lawsuits and online trolling, wrote: "My skin is thick. I'm used to the hate."
Mr. Moreno's work has not been focused on the pandemic, though his 15-minute cities idea has become more popular since it began. Like many of his academic peers who have faced harassment and disinformation campaigns, he is at a loss for ways to protect himself.
"I'm not totally sure what is the best reaction -- to respond, to not respond, to call a press conference, to write a press release," he said. Academics, he said, "are relatively alone."
Mr. Moreno, who grew up in Colombia, began working as a researcher in a computer science and robotics lab in Paris in 1983; the career that followed involved creating a start-up, meeting the Dalai Lama and being named a knight of the Légion d'Honneur. His work has won several awards and spanned many fields -- automotive, medical, nuclear, military, even home goods.
Around 2010, he started thinking about how technology could help create sustainable cities. Eventually, he refined his ideas about "human smart cities" and "living cities" into his 2016 proposal for 15-minute cities. The idea owes much to its many predecessors: "neighborhood units" and "garden cities" in the early 1900s, the community-focused urban planning pioneered by the activist Jane Jacobs in the 1960s, even support for "new urbanism" and walkable cities in the 1990s. So-called low-traffic neighborhoods, or LTNs, have been set up in several British cities over the past few decades.
Critics of 15-minute cities have been outspoken, arguing that a concept developed in Europe may not translate well to highly segregated American cities. A Harvard economist wrote in a blog post for the London School of Economics and Political Science in 2021 that the concept was a "dead end" that would exacerbate "enormous inequalities in cities" by subdividing without connecting them.
Mr. Moreno did not face harassment, however, until conspiracy theorists mistakenly conflated 15-minute cities with the low-traffic-neighborhood idea in Britain.
Efforts to adopt LTNs, which were approved for testing last year in centuries-old Oxford, have drawn concerns about whether the traffic reduction measures could cause congestion to spill into surrounding areas or make some properties less accessible. Some people, however, seized on other elements of the plan -- including cameras meant to monitor license plates.
The result, according to misinformed conspiracy theorists: A nightmare scenario in which residents would be confined in open-air prisons fenced off into siloed zones. On Feb. 18, when an estimated 2,000 demonstrators converged at a protest in Oxford, some carried signs claiming that 15-minute cities would become "ghettos" created by the World Economic Forum as a form of "tyrannical control."
In fact, LTNs are championed by the Oxfordshire county council; the separate Oxford City Council has cited the 15-minute city as an inspiration for its vision of the city in 2040. As both government bodies noted in an attempt to debunk the rumors, neither proposal involves physical barriers. One concept is concerned with limiting cars, while the other is focused on bringing daily necessities closer to residents.
Still, Jordan Peterson, a Canadian psychologist with four million Twitter followers, suggested that 15-minute cities were "perhaps the worst imaginable perversion" of the idea of walkable neighborhoods. He linked to a post about the "Great Reset," an economic recovery plan proposed by the World Economic Forum that has spawned hordes of rumors about a pandemic-fueled plot to destroy capitalism.
A member of Britain's Parliament said that 15-minute cities were "an international socialist concept" that would "cost us our personal freedoms." QAnon supporters said the derailment of a train carrying hazardous chemicals in Ohio was an intentional move meant to push rural residents into 15-minute cities.
"Conspiracy-mongers have built a complete story: climate denialism, Covid-19, anti-vax, 5G controlling the brains of citizens, and the 15-minute city for introducing a perimeter for day-to-day life," Mr. Moreno said. "This storytelling is totally insane, totally irrational for us, but it makes sense for them."
The multipronged conspiracy theory quickly became "turbocharged" after the Oxford protest, said Jennie King, head of climate research and policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that studies online platforms.
"You have this snowball effect of a policy, which in principle was only going to affect a small urban population, getting extrapolated and becoming this crucible where far-right groups, industry-sponsored lobbying groups, conspiracist movements, anti-lockdown groups and more saw an opportunity to insert their worldview into the mainstream and to piggyback on the news cycle," she said.
The vitriol currently directed at Mr. Moreno and researchers like him mirrors "the broader erosion of trust in experts and institutions," Ms. King said. Modern conspiracy theorists and extremists turn the people they disagree with into scapegoats for a vast array of societal ills, blaming them personally for causing the high cost of living or various health crises and creating an "us-versus-them" environment, she said.
The ramped-up rhetoric and the disintegration of safeguards has caused many people in the academic community to flee forums like Twitter for more niche sites like Mastodon, Ms. King said. Last year, the American Psychological Association published a feature suggesting that universities form safety offices to help professors filter menacing messages, scrub their personal information from the internet and gain access to counseling.
Mr. Moreno said he did not understand the intensity of the hate directed at him.
"I am not a politician, I am not a candidate for anything -- as a researcher, my duty is to explore and deepen my ideas with scientific methodology," he said. "It is totally unbelievable that we could receive a death threat just for working as scientists."

How to Stamp Out Meetings That Go On and On and On: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At a recent meeting, Shannon Bender and Keith Martine tried something new: They stood the entire time.
The two founders of Apostrophe, a New York City start-up that focuses on expanding access to art, knew their meetings had been running long. It didn't seem to matter whom they were talking to -- artists, or investors, or employees -- a lot of meetings took two hours.
"Sometimes that is intentional because we are relationship-building, but other times that is not," Mr. Martine said.
"We have one team member who definitely likes to talk a lot," Ms. Bender added, laughing. "Meetings with him are not efficient at all."
All that time in meetings left little time to do work. At Apostrophe, that meant less time for forming connections with artists and buyers and curating art shows.
U.S. workers spend an average of 31 hours per month in meetings they consider unproductive, according to Zippia, a site that provides job seekers with information about a company's culture.
Ms. Bender and Mr. Martine knew the problem. For them meetings of any kind -- with a potential hire or a longtime collaborator -- tended to run long. What they needed was a solution.
So when they interviewed a candidate to be their new assistant, they didn't offer her a seat, instead asking if she was open to having a standing conversation. Then they skipped small talk and dived right in on her work history, ambitions, strengths and weaknesses, and views on the art industry.
"After 20 minutes, we 100 percent got what we needed," Ms. Bender said. "The conversation was so efficient that I almost felt bad it was so short." They hired her, and it was such a positive experience -- even though Ms. Bender and the interviewee were in heels -- that Apostrophe will encourage standing meetings from now on. (Indeed, at their next staff meeting everyone stood up.)
Meetings are a source of stress for both employees and managers.
"Meetings in and of themselves don't cause problems," said Steven G. Rogelberg, a professor of management at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. "They were not created with a sadistic mind-set."
Their basic premise -- that a leader wants more people informed, or involved in decision-making -- can help workers feel engaged. Meetings elevate more voices, and being invited can feel like an honor, Mr. Rogelberg said.
"Bad meetings are what causes the problems," he explained. "When meetings are poorly run and have too many attendees and run too long and don't have a clear purpose, that is problematic."
It's also a problem when people have too many and can't do their work. In a 2022 study, Mr. Rogelberg found that office employees spent about 18 hours a week on average in meetings, which amounted to roughly $ 25,000 in payroll costs per employee. He also found that employees felt they didn't need to be in 30 percent of meetings they were invited to.
Remote work during the pandemic, which took away opportunities to have spontaneous discussions, led to meeting creep. A Microsoft report from March last year found that the number of meetings per week had increased 153 percent globally since the start of the pandemic.
Many companies are trying to tackle the problem, finding creative ways to make meetings, both in person and virtual, not only more efficient but more scarce.
Sarah Kellogg Neff, the chief executive of the Lactation Network, a 65-person company that connects new mothers with breastfeeding resources and is the nation's largest network of board-certified lactation consultants, wants her employees to feel in control of their workdays.
"We are a high-trust, high-autonomy culture," she said. "This is what high performers want."
That's why it is company policy that employees can opt out of meetings regardless of who invited them. (Even their boss or boss's boss!)
"When they get a meeting invite, every person is empowered to say, 'What is my role here?' Or: 'Hey, I'm working on another thing. Is it OK if I check out of the meeting?"' Ms. Neff said.
People cancel on her sometimes, but she doesn't take offense. "In a weird way it makes me proud," she said.
Sam Kaser, 30, who lives in Chicago and works on the Lactation Network's patient care team, said she exercises this right regularly, especially when a regular check-in on a long-term project is going to be outside her purview that week.
She has had more meetings at this company than in any previous job, she said, but isn't as frustrated by attending. "I am 100 percent confident why I should be in that 'room."' she said.
Many companies, including the Lactation Network, are experimenting with meeting-free days.
Studies show that this type of intervention can work. A study published in the MIT Sloan Management Review found that when companies introduced one no-meeting day per week, autonomy, communication, engagement and satisfaction improved.
In a Microsoft study of 435 of its employees, 73 percent said no-meeting Friday was good for their well-being and 77 percent said it was good for their focus time.
Canva, a design software maker, has 3,500 employees across eight offices worldwide. If someone tries to schedule a meeting on Wednesday, the company's designated no-meeting day, an auto decline comes "with a note that says that we are trying to adopt this policy for mental health and productivity," said Jennie Rogerson, Canva's global head of people, who is based in Sydney, Australia.
The company cherishes this policy so much -- "I use Wednesdays to get through my emails," Ms. Rogerson said, adding that "there is nothing better than inbox zero" -- it is experimenting with entire weeks, called focus weeks, when nonessential meetings are canceled.
It's not easy to carry out something like this, Ms. Rogerson said. For example, employees are in different time zones.
"Having meeting-free Wednesday means one more day that Australia and the U.S. don't get to meet, and with the time zone shifting, the amount of hours people can meet is already minimal," she said. "We're trying to think through this."
Another problem is that other workdays can be busier than they otherwise would. "You know when you have a game of Tetris and things get wild?" Ms. Rogerson asked. "That is what my calendar looks like with the exception of no-meeting Wednesday."
At the beginning of 2023, Shopify, the global commerce company, reinstated its meeting-free Wednesday, which it had tried in the past, and meetings that day dropped 44 percent.
To free up more time, Shopify also automatically deleted recurring meetings with three people or more and asked people to hold off on rescheduling them for two weeks (a cooling-off period) so they could think about what needed to be added back in. The company also created one specific time slot when companywide meetings could be held.
Jacques Krzepkowski, 39, a staff product designer for Shopify in Calgary, Alberta, said he spent 18 hours per week in meetings in 2022. Now his average week has eight hours of meetings.
"The one-on-one meetings are easier to cluster, so I have larger blocks of free time to get deep work completed," he said.
Ms. Neff, from the Lactation Network, cautioned that eliminating large group meetings might make some employees feel excluded. While her company is trying to cut back on meetings, it still allows anyone to join who wants to.
"We have a very open-door policy," she said. "If you see a topic you are interested in or a meeting you are interested in, you can attend, but otherwise we respect your time."
Mr. Rogelberg, who also works as a consultant, said he had clients who made meetings more efficient by rewriting agendas as questions to be answered instead of topics to discuss.
"If you do that, you have to really think about why you are gathering," he said. "If there is no question to be answered, you don't need a meeting."
This also helps determine who needs to be there, he said, because only the people who are essential for answering the questions should be included.
The problem with all of these techniques -- no-meeting Mondays, standing-up staff gatherings, focus weeks with no meetings -- is that even the most meeting averse can find it difficult to enforce them.
"These no-meeting days or half-days can have some success, but it takes a really strong collective commitment to do it," Mr. Rogelberg said. "We have data to suggest that people are scheduling meetings during those meeting-free periods because they know everyone is available."

A member of Britain’s Parliament said that 15-minute cities were “an international socialist concept” that would “cost us our personal freedoms.” QAnon supporters said the derailment of a train carrying hazardous chemicals in Ohio was an intentional move meant to push rural residents into 15-minute cities.
“Conspiracy-mongers have built a complete story: climate denialism, COVID-19, anti-vax, 5G controlling the brains of citizens, and the 15-minute city for introducing a perimeter for day-to-day life,” Moreno said. “This storytelling is totally insane, totally irrational for us, but it makes sense for them.”
The multipronged conspiracy theory quickly became “turbocharged” after the Oxford protest, said Jennie King, head of climate research and policy at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that studies online platforms.
“You have this snowball effect of a policy, which in principle was only going to affect a small urban population, getting extrapolated and becoming this crucible where far-right groups, industry-sponsored lobbying groups, conspiracist movements, anti-lockdown groups and more saw an opportunity to insert their worldview into the mainstream and to piggyback on the news cycle,” she said.
The vitriol currently directed at Moreno and researchers like him mirrors “the broader erosion of trust in experts and institutions,” King said. Modern conspiracy theorists and extremists turn the people they disagree with into scapegoats for a vast array of societal ills, blaming them personally for causing the high cost of living or various health crises and creating an “us-versus-them” environment, she said.
The ramped-up rhetoric and the disintegration of safeguards has caused many people in the academic community to flee forums like Twitter for more niche sites like Mastodon, King said. Last year, the American Psychological Association published a feature suggesting that universities form safety offices to help professors filter menacing messages, scrub their personal information from the internet and gain access to counseling.
Moreno said he did not understand the intensity of the hate directed at him.
“I am not a politician. I am not a candidate for anything. As a researcher, my duty is to explore and deepen my ideas with scientific methodology,” Moreno said. “It is totally unbelievable that we could receive a death threat just for working as scientists.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Where we're heading tomorrow, next year and beyond.
In today's A.I. newsletter, the last in our five-part series , I look at where artificial intelligence may be headed in the years to come.
In early March, I visited OpenAI's San Francisco offices for an early look at GPT-4, a new version of the technology that underpins its ChatGPT chatbot. The most eye-popping moment arrived when Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president and co-founder, showed off a feature that is still unavailable to the public: He gave the bot a photograph from the Hubble Space Telescope and asked it to describe the image "in painstaking detail."
The description was completely accurate, right down to the strange white line created by a satellite streaking across the heavens. This is one look at the future of chatbots and other A.I. technologies: A new wave of multimodal systems will juggle images, sounds and videos as well as text.
Yesterday, my colleague Kevin Roose told you about what A.I. can do now. I'm going to focus on the opportunities and upheavals to come as it gains abilities and skills.
A.I. in the near term
Generative A.I.s can already answer questions, write poetry, generate computer code and carry on conversations. As "chatbot" suggests, they are first being rolled out in conversational formats like ChatGPT and Bing.
But that's not going to last long. Microsoft and Google have already announced plans to incorporate these A.I. technologies into their products. You'll be able to use them to write a rough draft of an email, automatically summarize a meeting and pull off many other cool tricks.
OpenAI also offers an A.P.I., or application programming interface, that other tech companies can use to plug GPT-4 into their apps and products. And it has created a series of plug-ins from companies like Instacart, Expedia and Wolfram Alpha that expand ChatGPT's abilities.
A.I. in the medium term
Many experts believe A.I. will make some workers, including doctors, lawyers and computer programmers, more productive than ever. They also believe some workers will be replaced.
"This will affect tasks that are more repetitive, more formulaic, more generic," said Zachary Lipton, a professor at Carnegie Mellon who specializes in artificial intelligence and its impact on society. "This can liberate some people who are not good at repetitive tasks. At the same time, there is a threat to people who specialize in the repetitive part."
Human-performed jobs could disappear from audio-to-text transcription and translation. In the legal field, GPT-4 is already proficient enough to ace the bar exam, and the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers plans to roll out an OpenAI-powered legal chatbot to its staff.
At the same time, companies like OpenAI, Google and Meta are building systems that let you instantly generate images and videos simply by describing what you want to see.
Other companies are building bots that can actually use websites and software applications as a human does. In the next stage of the technology, A.I. systems could shop online for your Christmas presents, hire people to do small jobs around the house and track your monthly expenses.
All that is a lot to think about. But the biggest issue may be this: Before we have a chance to grasp how these systems will affect the world, they will get even more powerful.
A.I. in the long term
For companies like OpenAI and DeepMind, a lab that's owned by Google's parent company, the plan is to push this technology as far as it will go. They hope to eventually build what researchers call artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I. -- a machine that can do anything the human brain can do.
As Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, told me three years ago: "My goal is to build broadly beneficial A.G.I. I also understand this sounds ridiculous." Today, it sounds less ridiculous. But it is still easier said than done.
For an A.I. to become an A.G.I., it will require an understanding of the physical world writ large. And it is not clear whether systems can learn to mimic the length and breadth of human reasoning and common sense using the methods that have produced technologies like GPT-4. New breakthroughs will probably be necessary.
The question is, do we really want artificial intelligence to become that powerful? A very important related question: Is there any way to stop it from happening?
The risks of A.I.
Many A.I. executives believe the technologies they are creating will improve our lives. But some have been warning for decades about a darker scenario, where our creations don't always do what we want them to do, or they follow our instructions in unpredictable ways, with potentially dire consequences.
A.I. experts talk about "alignment" -- that is, making sure A.I. systems are in line with human values and goals.
Before GPT-4 was released, OpenAI handed it over to an outside group to imagine and test dangerous uses of the chatbot.
The group found that the system was able to hire a human online to defeat a Captcha test. When the human asked if it was "a robot," the system, unprompted by the testers, lied and said it was a person with a visual impairment.
Testers also showed that the system could be coaxed into suggesting how to buy illegal firearms online and into describing ways to make dangerous substances from household items. After changes by OpenAI, the system no longer does these things.
But it's impossible to eliminate all potential misuses. As a system like this learns from data, it develops skills that its creators never expected. It is hard to know how things might go wrong after millions of people start using it.
"Every time we make a new A.I. system, we are unable to fully characterize all its capabilities and all of its safety problems -- and this problem is getting worse over time rather than better," said Jack Clark, a founder and the head of policy of Anthropic, a San Francisco start-up building this same kind of technology.
And OpenAI and giants like Google are hardly the only ones exploring this technology. The basic methods used to build these systems are widely understood, and other companies, countries, research labs and bad actors may be less careful.
The remedies for A.I.
Ultimately, keeping a lid on dangerous A.I. technology will require far-reaching oversight. But experts are not optimistic.
"We need a regulatory system that is international," said Aviv Ovadya, a researcher at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard who helped test GPT-4 before its release. "But I do not see our existing government institutions being about to navigate this at the rate that is necessary."
As we told you earlier this week, more than 1,000 technology leaders and researchers, including Elon Musk, have urged artificial intelligence labs to pause development of the most advanced systems, warning in an open letter that A.I. tools present "profound risks to society and humanity."
A.I. developers are "locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one -- not even their creators -- can understand, predict or reliably control," according to the letter.
Some experts are mostly concerned about near-term dangers, including the spread of disinformation and the risk that people would rely on these systems for inaccurate or harmful medical and emotional advice.
But other critics are part of a vast and influential online community called rationalists or effective altruists, who believe that A.I could eventually destroy humanity. This mind-set is reflected in the letter.
Please share your thoughts and feedback on our On Tech: A.I. series by taking this brief survey.



Your homework
We can speculate about where A.I. is going in the distant future -- but we can also ask the chatbots themselves. For your final assignment, treat ChatGPT, Bing or Bard like an eager young job applicant and ask it where it sees itself in 10 years. As always, share the answers in the comments.

Farewell
Kevin here. Thank you for spending the past five days with us. It's been a blast seeing your comments and creativity. (I especially enjoyed the commenter who used ChatGPT to write a cover letter for my job.)
The topic of A.I. is so big, and fast-moving, that even five newsletters isn't enough to cover everything. If you want to dive deeper, you can check out my book, "Futureproof," and Cade's book, "Genius Makers," both of which go into greater detail about the topics we've covered this week.
Cade here: My favorite comment came from someone who asked ChatGPT to plan a route through the trails in their state. The bot ended up suggesting a trail that did not exist as a way of hiking between two other trails that do.
This small snafu provides a window into both the power and the limitations of today's chatbots and other A.I. systems. They have learned a great deal from what is posted to the internet and can make use of what they have learned in remarkable ways, but there is always the risk that they will insert information that is plausible but untrue. Go forth! Chat with these bots! But trust your own judgment too!
Please take this brief survey to share your thoughts and feedback on this limited-run newsletter.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Learning how a "large language model" operates.
In the second of our five-part series , I'm going to explain how the technology actually works.
The artificial intelligences that powers ChatGPT, Microsoft's Bing chatbot and Google's Bard can carry out humanlike conversations and write natural, fluid prose on an endless variety of topics. They can also perform complex tasks, from writing code to planning a kid's birthday party.
But how does it all work? To answer that, we need to peek under the hood of something called a large language model -- the type of A.I. that drives these systems.
Large language models, or L.L.M.s, are relatively new on the A.I. scene. The first ones appeared only about five years ago, and they weren't very good. But today they can draft emails, presentations and memos and tutor you in a foreign language. Even more capabilities are sure to surface in the coming months and years, as the technology improves and Silicon Valley scrambles to cash in.
I'm going to walk you through setting up a large language model from scratch, simplifying things and leaving out a lot of hard math. Let's pretend that we're trying to build an L.L.M. to help you with replying to your emails. We'll call it MailBot.
Step 1: Set a goal
Every A.I. system needs a goal. Researchers call this an objective function. It can be simple -- for example, "win as many chess games as possible" -- or complicated, like "predict the three-dimensional shapes of proteins, using only their amino acid sequences."
Most large language models have the same basic objective function: Given a sequence of text, guess what comes next. We'll give MailBot more specific goals later on, but let's stick to that one for now.
Step 2: Collect lots of data
Next, we need to assemble the training data that will teach MailBot how to write. Ideally, we'll put together a colossally large repository of text, which usually means billions of pages scraped from the internet -- like blog posts, tweets, Wikipedia articles and news stories.
To start, we'll use some free, publicly available data libraries, such as the Common Crawl repository of web data. But we'll also want to add our own secret sauce, in the form of proprietary or specialized data. Maybe we'll license some foreign-language text, so that MailBot learns to compose emails in French or Spanish as well as English. In general, the more data we have, and the more diverse the sources, the better our model will be.
Before we can feed the data into our model, we need to break it down into units called tokens, which can be words, phrases or even individual characters. Transforming text into bite-size chunks helps a model analyze it more easily.
Step 3: Build your neural network
Once our data is tokenized, we need to assemble the A.I.'s "brain" -- a type of system known as a neural network. This is a complex web of interconnected nodes (or "neurons") that process and store information.
For MailBot, we're going to want to use a relatively new type of neural network known as a transformer model. They can analyze multiple pieces of text at the same time, making them faster and more efficient. (Transformer models are the key to systems like ChatGPT -- whose full acronym stands for "Generative Pretrained Transformer.")
Step 4: Train your neural network
Next, the model will analyze the data, token by token, identifying patterns and relationships. It might notice "Dear" is often followed by a name, or that "Best regards" typically comes before your name. By identifying these patterns, the A.I. learns how to construct messages that make sense.
The system also develops a sense of context. For example, it might learn that "bank" can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river, depending on the surrounding words.
As it learns these patterns, the transformer model sketches a map: an enormously complex mathematical representation of human language. It keeps track of these relationships using numerical values known as parameters. Many of today's best L.L.M.s have hundreds of billions of parameters or more.
Training could take days or even weeks, and will require immense amounts of computing power. But once it's done, it will almost be ready to start writing your emails.
Weirdly, it may develop other skills, too. As L.L.M.s learn to predict the next word in a sequence, over and over and over again, they can pick up other, unexpected abilities, such as knowing how to code. A.I. researchers call these emergent behaviors, and they're still sometimes mystified by them.
Step 5: Fine-tune your model
Once a large language model is trained, it needs to be calibrated for a specific job. A chatbot used by a hospital might need to understand medical terms, for example.
To fine-tune MailBot, we could ask it to generate a bunch of emails, hire people to rate them on accuracy and then feed the ratings back into the model until it improves.
This is a rough approximation of the approach that was used with ChatGPT, which is known as reinforcement learning with human feedback.
Step 6: Launch, carefully
Congratulations! Once MailBot has been trained and fine-tuned, it's ready to use. After you build some kind of user interface for it -- like a Chrome extension that plugs into your email app -- it can start cranking out emails.
But no matter how good it seems, you're still going to want to keep tabs on your new assistant. As companies like Microsoft and Meta have learned the hard way, A.I. systems can be erratic and unpredictable, or even turn creepy and dangerous.
Tomorrow, we'll hear more about how things can go wrong in unexpected and sometimes disturbing ways.
Your homework
Let's explore one of the more creative abilities of L.L.M.s: the ability to combine disparate concepts and formats into something bizarre and new. For example, our colleagues at Well asked ChatGPT to "write a song in Taylor Swift's voice that uses themes from a Dr. Seuss book."
For today's homework, try to mix and match a format, a style and a topic -- like, "Write a limerick in the style of Snoop Dogg about global warming."
Don't forget to share your creation as a comment.
Quiz
Question 1 of 3
What is the primary objective function of large language models like ChatGPT?
Win as many chess games as possible
Predict the 3-D shapes of proteins
Guess what comes next in a sequence of text
Start the quiz by choosing your answer.
Glossary
Transformer model: A neural network architecture useful for understanding language, which does not have to analyze words one at a time but can look at an entire sentence at once. A technique called self-attention allows the model to focus on the particular words that are important in understanding the meaning of the sentence.
Parameters: Numerical values that define a large language model's structure and behavior, like clues that help it guess what words come next. Modern systems like GPT-4 are thought to have hundreds of billions of parameters.
Reinforcement learning: A technique that teaches an A.I. model to find the best result by trial and error, receiving rewards or punishments from an algorithm based on its results. This system can be enhanced by humans giving feedback on its performance.

What makes A.I. chatbots go wrong?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The curious case of the hallucinating software.
In today's A.I. newsletter, the third of a five-part series , I discuss some of the ways chatbots can go awry.
A few hours after yesterday's newsletter went out, a group of artificial intelligence experts and tech leaders including Elon Musk urged A.I. labs to pause work on their most advanced systems, warning that they present "profound risks to society and humanity."
The group called for a six-month pause on systems more powerful than GPT-4, introduced this month by OpenAI, which Mr. Musk co-founded. A pause would provide time to implement "shared safety protocols," the group said in an open letter. "If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium."
Many experts disagree about the severity of the risks cited in the letter, and we'll explore some of them later this week. But a number of A.I. mishaps have already surfaced. I'll spend today's newsletter explaining how they happen.
In early February, Google unveiled a new chatbot, Bard, which answered questions about the James Webb Space Telescope. There was only one problem: One of the bot's claims -- that the telescope had captured the very first pictures of a planet outside our solar system -- was completely untrue.
Bots like Bard and OpenAI's ChatGPT deliver information with unnerving dexterity. But they also spout plausible falsehoods, or do things that are seriously creepy, such as insist they are in love with New York Times journalists.
How is that possible?
Internet garbage and hallucinations
In the past, tech companies carefully defined how software was supposed to behave, one line of code at a time. Now, they're designing chatbots and other technologies that learn skills on their own, by pinpointing statistical patterns in enormous amounts of information.
Much of this data comes from sites like Wikipedia and Reddit. The internet is teeming with useful information, from historical facts to medical advice. But it's also packed with untruths, hate speech and other garbage. Chatbots absorb it all, including explicit and implicit bias from the text they absorb.
And because of the surprising way they mix and match what they've learned to generate entirely new text, they often create convincing language that is flat-out wrong, or does not exist in their training data. A.I. researchers call this tendency to make stuff up a "hallucination," which can include irrelevant, nonsensical, or factually incorrect answers.
We're already seeing real-world consequences of A.I. hallucination. Stack Overflow, a question-and-answer site for programmers, temporarily barred users from submitting answers generated with ChatGPT, because the chatbot made it far too easy to submit plausible but incorrect responses.
"These systems live in a world of language," said Melanie Mitchell, an A.I. researcher at the Santa Fe Institute. "That world gives them some clues about what is true and what is not true, but the language they learn from is not grounded in reality. They do not necessarily know if what they are generating is true or false."
(When we asked Bing for examples of chatbots hallucinating, it actually hallucinated the answer.)
Think of the chatbots as jazz musicians. They can digest huge amounts of information -- like, say, every song that has ever been written -- and then riff on the results. They have the ability to stitch together ideas in surprising and creative ways. But they also play wrong notes with absolute confidence.
It's not just them -- it's us
Sometimes the wild card isn't the software. It's the humans.
We are prone to seeing patterns that aren't really there, and assuming humanlike traits and emotions in nonhuman entities. This is known as anthropomorphism. When a dog makes eye contact with us, we tend to assume it's smarter than it really is. That's just how our minds work.
And when a computer starts putting words together like we do, we get the mistaken impression that it can reason, understand and express emotions. We can also behave in unpredictable ways. (Last year, Google placed an engineer on paid leave after dismissing his claim that its A.I. was sentient. He was later fired.)
The longer the conversation runs, the more influence you have on what a large language model is saying. Kevin's infamous conversation with Bing is a particularly good example. After a while, a chatbot can begin to reflect your thoughts and aims, according to researchers like the A.I. pioneer Terry Sejnowski. If you prompt it to get creepy, it gets creepy.
He compared the technology to the Mirror of Erised, a mystical artifact in the Harry Potter novels and movies. "It provides whatever you are looking for -- whatever you want or expect or desire," Dr. Sejnowski said. "Because the human and the L.L.M.s are both mirroring each other, over time they will tend toward a common conceptual state."
Can they fix it?
Companies like Google, Microsoft and OpenAI are working to solve these problems.
OpenAI worked to refine the chatbot using feedback from human testers. Using a technique called reinforcement learning, the system gained a better understanding of what it should and shouldn't do.
Microsoft, for its part, has limited the length of conversations with its Bing chatbot. It is also patching vulnerabilities that intrepid users have identified. But fixing every single hiccup is difficult, if not impossible.
So, yes, if you're clever, you can probably coax these systems into doing stuff that's offensive or creepy. Bad actors can too: The worry among many experts is that these bots will allow internet scammers, unscrupulous marketers and hostile nation states to spread disinformation and cause other types of trouble.
One big thing
As you use these chatbots, stay skeptical. Take a look at them for what they really are.
They are not sentient or conscious. They are intelligent in some ways, but dumb in others. Remember that they can get stuff wrong. Remember that they can make stuff up.
But on the bright side, there are so many other things that these systems are very good for. Kevin will have more on that tomorrow.

Glossary
Hallucination: A well-known phenomenon in large language models, in which the system provides an answer that is factually incorrect, irrelevant or nonsensical, because of limitations in its training data and architecture.
Bias: A type of error that can occur in a large language model if its output is skewed by the model's training data. For example, a model may associate specific traits or professions with a certain race or gender, leading to inaccurate predictions and offensive responses.
Anthropomorphism: The tendency for people to attribute human-like qualities or characteristics to an A.I. chatbot. For example, you may assume it is kind or cruel based on its answers, even though it is not capable of having emotions, or you may believe the A.I. is sentient because it is very good at mimicking human language.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Trying to obtain an internship at a leading tech company or start-up can be a depressing quest for many college students, requiring a sustained, semester-long effort -- often with little to show for it but a slew of rejections.
Now Bowie State University, a historically Black university in Bowie, Md., has created its own internship placement program. And it does not require undergraduates to jump through standard Silicon Valley hoops, such as spending countless hours studying for company coding tests or taking high-pressure technical assessments while a tech company interviewer looks on.
"To be honest with you, it's a brutal process," said Rose Shumba, the chair of Bowie State's computer science department, referring to the internship application process at many large tech firms. She described trying to buoy stressed-out students as they prepared for technical interviews that she thought did not assess their skills or professional potential. "We see things very differently here at Bowie."
To widen opportunities for students, the computer science department set up its own internship placement program last year in partnership with a number of companies and government agencies. The program aims to match students directly with employers seeking interns. It also holds training sessions for students on interview skills and workshops on hot topics like machine learning.
The Bowie approach offers students an alternative to the impersonal, mass-scale application system at many large tech firms. That process typically involves tens of thousands of college students submitting their résumés cold to online company portals, where candidates are initially sorted and ranked by résumé-reading software.
At Bowie State, participating employers come frequently to campus to get to know, mentor, interview and directly recruit students for internships in a process that is more intimate than the one-off information sessions that tech companies often arrange with university career centers. And the Bowie process does not typically involve high-stress technical tests. That has spared many students, some of whom have part-time jobs, from spending dozens of unpaid hours on applying for Silicon Valley internship programs.
‌Founded in 1865, Bowie State is a computer science powerhouse among ‌‌historically Black universities. The school is known nationally for its expertise in cybersecurity education. Last fall, the number of Bowie undergraduates majoring in computing soared to 332, a 75 percent jump from 2019.
But over the last several years only a few Bowie students have made it past the vetting process at leading tech firms like Amazon, Microsoft and Oracle to obtain internships, Dr. Shumba said.
The competition can be stiff. Adobe, the maker of Photoshop, said it typically hires about 600 interns from the more than 100,000 candidates who apply for its summer internship program in the United States each year.
Last summer, with the new program in place, 60 Bowie computing students interned with companies like Deloitte, federal agencies like NASA and local start-ups. One of them was Dejai Brown, now a senior, who is interested in cybersecurity.
Before she started applying for internships, Ms. Brown worked part time at Chick-fil-A. Last year, after Dr. Shumba encouraged her to apply for a government security clearance, Ms. Brown got an internship at the Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command. She also interned at Battelle, a nonprofit technology research giant.
"Recruiters at Battelle reached out to me, took me through the interview process, and they ended up bringing me on," Ms. Brown, 21, said. "That was a lot less stressful than what it could have been with a coding interview."
The Bowie State program addresses socioeconomic barriers -- like lack of technical work experience or industry connections -- that can hinder some students from getting internships.
To help younger students gain relevant experience, Dr. Shumba set up computing research internships on campus. Last year, she also took a group of students on an all-expenses paid trip to the Grace Hopper Celebration in Florida, a major annual conference for women in tech. Six students returned to campus with internship or job offers from Apple, Bank of America, Citibank and other companies.
Among them was Roxan Rockefeller, now a junior, who worked as a software engineering intern last summer at Tata Consultancy Services, a tech company. Then last fall at the conference, she attended an information session by Eli Lilly, the drug giant. That led to an internship interview.
"I have a passion for data, and I just started talking about how I want to explore as many areas as possible with my computer science degree," Ms. Rockefeller, 21, said. "The next day I got a call from one of the recruiters telling me on the phone that I got the internship."
This year, Adobe started its own internship program with Bowie State, focused on cybersecurity. The internships are part of a larger company effort to help prepare more Black and Latino students for tech careers.
This summer, about a dozen Bowie State students will work as cybersecurity interns at Adobe. That will make the Bowie students eligible for full-time job offers from Adobe after they graduate, just like hundreds of other summer interns at the company.

Kennedy Jr., Fauci Critic, Files to Run For President: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: While he has not yet announced his plans, he filed the federal paperwork for a campaign to run as a Democrat.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the political activist known most recently for his campaign to discredit coronavirus vaccines, filed paperwork on Wednesday to run for president as a Democrat, offering a potential long-shot challenge to President Biden.
Mr. Kennedy, the son and namesake of Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated while running for president in 1968, has not made a formal announcement. However, he teased a run at a political gathering in New Hampshire last month, telling a crowd: "I've passed the biggest hurdle, which is, my wife has greenlighted it."
He has set up a website to solicit donations and volunteers for a potential run, and a tweet pinned to his Twitter account says he will run if "I can raise the money and mobilize enough people to win."
Mr. Kennedy, 69, was once a top environmental lawyer, but his interests veered away from the Democratic mainstream into conspiracy theories, for which he has earned the public rebuke of some members of his prominent family. A longtime vaccine skeptic, he linked childhood vaccinations to autism, a claim thoroughly rebuked by medical experts.
In a recent book, he claimed that Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who was President Biden's top medical adviser for the coronavirus pandemic, and Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, conspired with drug companies to profit from vaccines. Instagram blocked Mr. Kennedy's account for spreading vaccine misinformation in 2021.
If he becomes a candidate, Mr. Kennedy wrote on Twitter, his top priority will be to "end the corrupt merger between state and corporate power."
While many Democrats express concerns about Mr. Biden as a candidate in 2024, when he would be 81 on Election Day, no major party leaders are actively exploring a primary challenge. The only well-known announced challenger to date is the author Marianne Williamson, who also ran in 2020.

Next Big Leap for A.I. Tech? Instant Videos on Command.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A start-up in New York is among a group of companies working on systems that can produce short videos based on a few words typed into a computer.
Ian Sansavera, a software architect at a New York start-up called Runway AI, typed a short description of what he wanted to see in a video. "A tranquil river in the forest," he wrote.
Less than two minutes later, an experimental internet service generated a short video of a tranquil river in a forest. The river's running water glistened in the sun as it cut between trees and ferns, turned a corner and splashed gently over rocks.
Runway, which plans to open its service to a small group of testers this week, is one of several companies building artificial intelligence technology that will soon let people generate videos simply by typing several words into a box on a computer screen.
They represent the next stage in an industry race -- one that includes giants like Microsoft and Google as well as much smaller start-ups -- to create new kinds of artificial intelligence systems that some believe could be the next big thing in technology, as important as web browsers or the iPhone.
The new video-generation systems could speed the work of moviemakers and other digital artists, while becoming a new and quick way to create hard-to-detect online misinformation, making it even harder to tell what's real on the internet.
The systems are examples of what is known as generative A.I., which can instantly create text, images and sounds. Another example is ChatGPT, the online chatbot made by a San Francisco start-up, OpenAI, that stunned the tech industry with its abilities late last year.
Google and Meta, Facebook's parent company, unveiled the first video-generation systems last year, but did not share them with the public because they were worried that the systems could eventually be used to spread disinformation with newfound speed and efficiency.
But Runway's chief executive, Cristóbal Valenzuela, said he believed the technology was too important to keep in a research lab, despite its risks. "This is one of the single most impressive technologies we have built in the last hundred years," he said. "You need to have people actually using it."
The ability to edit and manipulate film and video is nothing new, of course. Filmmakers have been doing it for more than a century. In recent years, researchers and digital artists have been using various A.I. technologies and software programs to create and edit videos that are often called deepfake videos.
But systems like the one Runway has created could, in time, replace editing skills with the press of a button.
Runway's technology generates videos from any short description. To start, you simply type a description much as you would type a quick note.
That works best if the scene has some action -- but not too much action -- something like "a rainy day in the big city" or "a dog with a cellphone in the park." Hit enter, and the system generates a video in a minute or two.
The technology can reproduce common images, like a cat sleeping on a rug. Or it can combine disparate concepts to generate videos that are strangely amusing, like a cow at a birthday party.
The videos are only four seconds long, and the video is choppy and blurry if you look closely. Sometimes, the images are weird, distorted and disturbing. The system has a way of merging animals like dogs and cats with inanimate objects like balls and cellphones. But given the right prompt, it produces videos that show where the technology is headed.
"At this point, if I see a high-resolution video, I am probably going to trust it," said Phillip Isola, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializes in A.I. "But that will change pretty quickly."
Like other generative A.I. technologies, Runway's system learns by analyzing digital data -- in this case, photos, videos and captions describing what those images contain. By training this kind of technology on increasingly large amounts of data, researchers are confident they can rapidly improve and expand its skills. Soon, experts believe, they will generate professional-looking mini-movies, complete with music and dialogue.
It is difficult to define what the system creates currently. It's not a photo. It's not a cartoon. It's a collection of a lot of pixels blended together to create a realistic video. The company plans to offer its technology with other tools that it believes will speed up the work of professional artists.
Several start-ups, including OpenAI, have released similar technology that can generate still images from short prompts like "photo of a teddy bear riding a skateboard in Times Square." And the rapid advancement of A.I.-generated photos could suggest where the new video technology is going.
Last month, social media services were teeming with images of Pope Francis in a white Balenciaga puffer coat -- surprisingly trendy attire for an 86-year-old pontiff. But the images were not real. A 31-year-old construction worker from Chicago had created the viral sensation using a popular A.I. tool called Midjourney.
Dr. Isola has spent years building and testing this kind of technology, first as a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and at OpenAI, and then as a professor at M.I.T. Still, he was fooled by the sharp, high-resolution but completely fake images of Pope Francis.
"There was a time when people would post deepfakes and they wouldn't fool me, because they were so outlandish or not very realistic," he said. "Now, we can't take any of the images we see on the internet at face value."
Midjourney is one of many services that can generate realistic still images from a short prompt. Others include Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, an OpenAI technology that started this wave of photo generators when it was unveiled a year ago.
Midjourney relies on a neural network, which learns its skills by analyzing enormous amounts of data. It looks for patterns as it combs through millions of digital images as well as text captions that describe the images depict.
When someone describes an image for the system, it generates a list of features that the image might include. One feature might be the curve at the top of a dog's ear. Another might be the edge of a cellphone. Then, a second neural network, called a diffusion model, creates the image and generates the pixels needed for the features. It eventually transforms the pixels into a coherent image.
Companies like Runway, which has roughly 40 employees and has raised $ 95.5 million, are using this technique to generate moving images. By analyzing thousands of videos, their technology can learn to string many still images together in a similarly coherent way.
"A video is just a series of frames -- still images -- that are combined in a way that gives the illusion of movement," Mr. Valenzuela said. "The trick lies in training a model that understands the relationship and consistency between each frame."
Like early versions of tools such as DALL-E and Midjourney, the technology sometimes combines concepts and images in curious ways. If you ask for a teddy bear playing basketball, it might give a kind of mutant stuffed animal with a basketball for a hand. If you ask for a dog with a cellphone in the park, it might give you a cellphone-wielding pup with an oddly human body.
But experts believe they can iron out the flaws as they train their systems on more and more data. They believe the technology will ultimately make creating a video as easy as writing a sentence.
"In the old days, to do anything remotely like this, you had to have a camera. You had to have props. You had to have a location. You had to have permission. You had to have money," said Susan Bonser, an author and a publisher in Pennsylvania who has been experimenting with early incarnations of generative video technology. "You don't have to have any of that now. You can just sit down and imagine it."

Ian Sansavera, a software architect at a New York startup called Runway AI, typed a short description of what he wanted to see in a video. “A tranquil river in the forest,” he wrote.
Less than two minutes later, an experimental internet service generated a short video of a tranquil river in a forest. The river’s running water glistened in the sun as it cut between trees and ferns, turned a corner and splashed gently over rocks.
Runway, which plans to open its service to a small group of testers this week, is one of several companies building artificial intelligence technology that will soon let people generate videos simply by typing several words into a box on a computer screen.
They represent the next stage in an industry race — one that includes giants like Microsoft and Google as well as much smaller startups — to create new kinds of artificial intelligence systems that some believe could be the next big thing in technology, as important as web browsers or the iPhone.
The new video-generation systems could speed the work of moviemakers and other digital artists, while becoming a new and quick way to create hard-to-detect online misinformation, making it even harder to tell what’s real on the internet.
The systems are examples of what is known as generative AI, which can instantly create text, images and sounds. Another example is ChatGPT, the online chatbot made by a San Francisco startup, OpenAI, that stunned the tech industry with its abilities late last year.
Google and Meta, Facebook’s parent company, unveiled the first video-generation systems last year, but did not share them with the public because they were worried that the systems could eventually be used to spread disinformation with newfound speed and efficiency.
But Runway’s CEO, Cris Valenzuela, said he believed the technology was too important to keep in a research lab, despite its risks. “This is one of the single most impressive technologies we have built in the last hundred years,” he said. “You need to have people actually using it.”
The ability to edit and manipulate film and video is nothing new, of course. Filmmakers have been doing it for more than a century. In recent years, researchers and digital artists have been using various AI technologies and software programs to create and edit videos that are often called deepfake videos.
But systems like the one Runway has created could, in time, replace editing skills with the press of a button.
Runway’s technology generates videos from any short description. To start, you simply type a description much as you would type a quick note.
That works best if the scene has some action — but not too much action — something like “a rainy day in the big city” or “a dog with a cellphone in the park.” Hit enter, and the system generates a video in a minute or two.
The technology can reproduce common images, like a cat sleeping on a rug. Or it can combine disparate concepts to generate videos that are strangely amusing, like a cow at a birthday party.
The videos are only four seconds long, and the video is choppy and blurry if you look closely. Sometimes, the images are weird, distorted and disturbing. The system has a way of merging animals like dogs and cats with inanimate objects like balls and cellphones. But given the right prompt, it produces videos that show where the technology is headed.
“At this point, if I see a high-resolution video, I am probably going to trust it,” said Phillip Isola, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who specializes in AI. “But that will change pretty quickly.”
Like other generative AI technologies, Runaway’s system learns by analyzing digital data — in this case, photos, videos and captions describing what those images contain. By training this kind of technology on increasingly large amounts of data, researchers are confident they can rapidly improve and expand its skills. Soon, experts believe, they will generate professional-looking mini-movies, complete with music and dialogue.
It is difficult to define what the system creates currently. It’s not a photo. It’s not a cartoon. It’s a collection of a lot of pixels blended together to create a realistic video. The company plans to offer its technology with other tools that it believes will speed up the work of professional artists.
Several startups, including OpenAI, have released similar technology that can generate still images from short prompts like “photo of a teddy bear riding a skateboard in Times Square.” And the rapid advancement of AI-generated photos could suggest where the new video technology is going.
Last month, social media services were teeming with images of Pope Francis in a white Balenciaga puffer coat — surprisingly trendy attire for an 86-year-old pontiff. But the images were not real. A 31-year-old construction worker from Chicago had created the viral sensation using a popular AI tool called Midjourney.
Isola has spent years building and testing this kind of technology, first as a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and at OpenAI, and then as a professor at MIT. Still, he was fooled by the sharp, high-resolution but completely fake images of Pope Francis.
“There was a time when people would post deepfakes, and they wouldn’t fool me, because they were so outlandish or not very realistic,” he said. “Now, we can’t take any of the images we see on the internet at face value.”
Midjourney is one of many services that can generate realistic still images from a short prompt. Others include Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, an OpenAI technology that started this wave of photo generators when it was unveiled a year ago.
Midjourney relies on a neural network, which learns its skills by analyzing enormous amounts of data. It looks for patterns as it combs through millions of digital images as well as text captions that describe what the images depict.
When someone describes an image for the system, it generates a list of features that the image might include. One feature might be the curve at the top of a dog’s ear. Another might be the edge of a cellphone. Then, a second neural network, called a diffusion model, creates the image and generates the pixels needed for the features. It eventually transforms the pixels into a coherent image.
Companies like Runway, which has roughly 40 employees and has raised $95.5 million, are using this technique to generate moving images. By analyzing thousands of videos, their technology can learn to string many still images together in a similarly coherent way.
“A video is just a series of frames — still images — that are combined in a way that gives the illusion of movement,” Valenzuela said. “The trick lies in training a model that understands the relationship and consistency between each frame.”
Like early versions of tools such as DALL-E and Midjourney, the technology sometimes combines concepts and images in curious ways. If you ask for a teddy bear playing basketball, it might give a kind of mutant stuffed animal with a basketball for a hand. If you ask for a dog with a cellphone in the park, it might give you a cellphone-wielding pup with an oddly human body.
But experts believe they can iron out the flaws as they train their systems on more and more data. They believe the technology will ultimately make creating a video as easy as writing a sentence.
“In the old days, to do anything remotely like this, you had to have a camera. You had to have props. You had to have a location. You had to have permission. You had to have money,” said Susan Bonser, an author and publisher in Pennsylvania who has been experimenting with early incarnations of generative video technology. “You don’t have to have any of that now. You can just sit down and imagine it.”

Number of Remote Workers Is Debated: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New Labor Department numbers indicate that fewer Americans worked remotely last year. But many experts criticize the government's data collection.
Millions of workers, employers, square feet of real estate and dollars of downtown economic retail are wrapped up in the question of how many people are working from home -- yet there remain large discrepancies in how remote work is measured.
The Labor Department, last week, released data indicating a decline in remote work: 72.5 percent of businesses said their employees rarely or never teleworked last year, up from 60.1 percent in 2021 and quite close to the 76.7 percent that had no such work before the pandemic. But while the Labor Department found that remote work was almost back to prepandemic levels, many other surveys show it is up four- to fivefold.
Outside research, including a monthly survey of workers from researchers at Stanford University and the Census Bureau's household survey, indicate that remote work remains prevalent, with Stanford's finding that it accounts for over a quarter of paid full-time workdays in the United States, just slightly down from 33 percent in 2021. Some scholars suggested that the Labor Department's survey may overcount fully in-person work, though the comparisons among the various surveys aren't direct.
"I see this survey as an outlier and not the most reliable measure," said Adam Ozimek, chief economist of the Economic Innovation Group, a public policy organization, describing the Labor Department's survey. "We need to think hard as we try to develop better measures of working from home."
Remote work is having profound effects on nearly every dimension of the economy: foot traffic to downtown businesses, housing markets in big cities and far-flung areas, methods of assessing productivity and child care. Public transportation ridership sank during the pandemic, and suburban real estate values rose.
Nearly one billion square feet of office real estate was available but in search of a tenant at the end of 2022. People refashioned their lives and routines, working 28 percent more after traditional hours, according to Microsoft.
The stakes of measuring remote work's prevalence are high. And researchers said the wording of the Bureau of Labor Statistics survey on remote work, which was distributed to businesses, might have caused some confusion among respondents.
"Telework is a work arrangement that allows an employee to work at home, or from another remote location, by using the internet or a computer linked to one's place of employment, as well as digital communications, such as email and phone," the survey read. "Do any employees at this location CURRENTLY telework in any amount?"
By defining telework so broadly -- as any worker sending an email or making a call outside the office -- the Labor Department's survey question should most likely have turned up a fully in-person figure lower than the one released last week, said Nick Bloom, an economist at Stanford, suggesting that some businesses may have been confused by the question.
This particular Labor Department figure on telework also combines fully remote work with hybrid arrangements. But hybrid work has eclipsed fully remote policies, with just over half of the workers who can do their jobs from home combining in-person and remote work, according to Gallup.
A spokeswoman for the Labor Department said the survey most likely did not reflect informal work-from-home arrangements.
"Taking into account that the self-employed and the public sector are not included in the sample, and that this is a survey of establishments rather than individuals, our estimates do not appear out of line with other estimates," the spokeswoman said.
Stanford's monthly study on working from home, which surveys 10,000 workers across cities and industries, found that 27 percent of paid full-time days were worked from home in early 2023.
Much of that remote work came from hybrid setups. Last month, the survey found that 12 percent of workers were fully remote, roughly 60 percent fully in person and 28 percent hybrid.
Other sources of data confirm that working-from-home patterns remain entrenched in certain industries. The building security firm Kastle, for example, tracks data on office badge swipes and reported this month that offices remained at roughly 48 percent of their prepandemic occupancy.
A closer look at New York, from the Partnership for New York City, found that 52 percent of Manhattan office workers were working in person on an average day at the start of this year, up from 49 percent in September. But only 9 percent of employees were in the office five days a week, underscoring the reach of hybrid arrangements. And Square, the retail technology company, which tracks payments at food and drink establishments, found that sales growth at bars and restaurants in Brooklyn had recently outpaced growth of those in Manhattan.
"It's clear that the work-from-home trends induced by the pandemic have transformed the food and drink scene in the city," said Ara Kharazian, an economist at Square.
The Partnership for New York City's data indicated that financial service firms were back in the office in greater numbers than many other companies. Financial service firms reported 59 percent daily office attendance in late January, according to the partnership. The tech industry, by contrast, was at 43 percent.
All this data is emerging as hundreds of companies formalize their policies on hybrid work, with many trying to persuade their employees to spend more time at the office.
Amazon told corporate workers last month that they had to be in the office three days a week starting in May, and Starbucks called its 3,750 corporate workers back three days a week as well. Disney asked employees to return to the office four days a week. Its chief executive, Robert A. Iger, cited the need for in-person creative collaborations.
Other chief executives have also begun to question the merits of remote work. Even Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, which told all its employees that they could go permanently remote, began voicing concern this year that productivity among some employees has been lower.
As executives clamp down on in-person work, worker resistance has become more vocal. At Amazon, more than 29,000 employees joined a Slack channel, called Remote Advocacy, protesting the shift to in-person work. At Starbucks, more than 40 corporate employees signed an open letter opposing the new return-to-office policy.
Wherever people are doing the jobs they already have, mostly in person per the Labor Department or over a quarter of the time at home per others, one metric does indicate that hybrid work is here to stay: job postings.
A study from researchers at Stanford, Harvard and other institutions analyzing over 50 million job postings last month found that postings explicitly mentioning remote work are at 12.2 percent -- a fourfold increase since before the pandemic.

A Campaign Aide Didn't Write That Email. A.I. Wrote It.: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Democratic Party has begun testing the use of artificial intelligence to write first drafts of some fund-raising messages, appeals that often perform better than those written entirely by human beings.
Fake A.I. images of Donald J. Trump getting arrested in New York spread faster than they could be fact-checked last week.
And voice-cloning tools are producing vividly lifelike audio of President Biden -- and many others -- saying things they did not actually say.
Artificial intelligence isn't just coming soon to the 2024 campaign trail. It's already here.
The swift advance of A.I. promises to be as disruptive to the political sphere as to broader society. Now any amateur with a laptop can manufacture the kinds of convincing sounds and images that were once the domain of the most sophisticated digital players. This democratization of disinformation is blurring the boundaries between fact and fake at a moment when the acceptance of universal truths -- that Mr. Biden beat Mr. Trump in 2020, for example -- is already being strained.
And as synthetic media gets more believable, the question becomes: What happens when people can no longer trust their own eyes and ears?
Inside campaigns, artificial intelligence is expected to soon help perform mundane tasks that previously required fleets of interns. Republican and Democratic engineers alike are racing to develop tools to harness A.I. to make advertising more efficient, to engage in predictive analysis of public behavior, to write more and more personalized copy and to discover new patterns in mountains of voter data. The technology is evolving so fast that most predict a profound impact, even if specific ways in which it will upend the political system are more speculation than science.
"It's an iPhone moment -- that's the only corollary that everybody will appreciate," said Dan Woods, the chief technology officer on Mr. Biden's 2020 campaign. "It's going to take pressure testing to figure out whether it's good or bad -- and it's probably both."
OpenAI, whose ChatGPT chatbot ushered in the generative-text gold rush, has already released a more advanced model. Google has announced plans to expand A.I. offerings inside popular apps like Google Docs and Gmail, and is rolling out its own chatbot. Microsoft has raced a version to market, too. A smaller firm, ElevenLabs, has developed a text-to-audio tool that can mimic anyone's voice in minutes. Midjourney, a popular A.I. art generator, can conjure hyper-realistic images with a few lines of text that are compelling enough to win art contests.
"A.I. is about to make a significant change in the 2024 election because of machine learning's predictive ability," said Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's first 2020 campaign manager, who has since founded a digital firm that advertises some A.I. capabilities.
Disinformation and "deepfakes" are the dominant fear. While forgeries are nothing new to politics -- a photoshopped image of John Kerry and Jane Fonda was widely shared in 2004 -- the ability to produce and share them has accelerated, with viral A.I. images of Mr. Trump being restrained by the police only the latest example. A fake image of Pope Francis in a white puffy coat went viral in recent days, as well.
Many are particularly worried about local races, which receive far less scrutiny. Ahead of the recent primary in the Chicago mayoral race, a fake video briefly sprung up on a Twitter account called "Chicago Lakefront News" that impersonated one candidate, Paul Vallas.
"Unfortunately, I think people are going to figure out how to use this for evil faster than for improving civic life," said Joe Rospars, who was chief strategist on Senator Elizabeth Warren's 2020 campaign and is now the chief executive of a digital consultancy.
Those who work at the intersection of politics and technology return repeatedly to the same historical hypothetical: If the infamous "Access Hollywood" tape broke today -- the one in which Mr. Trump is heard bragging about assaulting women and getting away with it -- would Mr. Trump acknowledge it was him, as he did in 2016?
The nearly universal answer was no.
"I think about that example all the time," said Matt Hodges, who was the engineering director on Mr. Biden's 2020 campaign and is now executive director of Zinc Labs, which invests in Democratic technology. Republicans, he said, "may not use 'fake news' anymore. It may be 'Woke A.I."'
For now, the frontline function of A.I. on campaigns is expected to be writing first drafts of the unending email and text cash solicitations.
"Given the amount of rote, asinine verbiage that gets produced in politics, people will put it to work," said Luke Thompson, a Republican political strategist.
As an experiment, The New York Times asked ChatGPT to produce a fund-raising email for Mr. Trump. The app initially said, "I cannot take political sides or promote any political agenda." But then it immediately provided a template of a potential Trump-like email.
The chatbot denied a request to make the message "angrier" but complied when asked to "give it more edge," to better reflect the often apocalyptic tone of Mr. Trump's pleas. "We need your help to send a message to the radical left that we will not back down," the revised A.I. message said. "Donate now and help us make America great again."
Among the prominent groups that have experimented with this tool is the Democratic National Committee, according to three people briefed on the efforts. In tests, the A.I.-generated content the D.N.C. has used has, as often as not, performed as well or better than copy drafted entirely by humans, in terms of generating engagement and donations.
Party officials still make edits to the A.I. drafts, the people familiar with the efforts said, and no A.I. messages have yet been written under the name of Mr. Biden or any other person, two people said. The D.N.C. declined to comment.
Higher Ground Labs, a small venture capital firm that invests in political technology for progressives, is currently working on a project, called Quiller, to more systematically use A.I. to write, send and test the effectiveness of fund-raising emails -- all at once.
"A.I. has mostly been marketing gobbledygook for the last three cycles," said Betsy Hoover, a founding partner at Higher Ground Labs who was the director of digital organizing for President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign. "We are at a moment now where there are things people can do that are actually helpful."
Political operatives, several of whom were granted anonymity to discuss potentially unsavory uses of artificial intelligence they are concerned about or planning to deploy, raised a raft of possibilities.
Some feared bad actors could leverage A.I. chatbots to distract or waste a campaign's precious staff time by pretending to be potential voters. Others floated producing deepfakes of their own candidate to generate personalized videos -- thanking supporters for their donations, for example. In India, one candidate in 2020 produced a deepfake to disseminate a video of himself speaking in different languages; the technology is far superior now.
Mr. Trump himself shared an A.I. image in recent days that appeared to show him kneeling in prayer. He posted it on Truth Social, his social media site, with no explanation.
One strategist predicted that the next generation of dirty tricks could be direct-to-voter misinformation that skips social media sites entirely. What if, this strategist said, an A.I. audio recording of a candidate was sent straight to the voice mail of voters on the eve of an election?
Synthetic audio and video are already swirling online, much of it as parody.
On TikTok, there is an entire genre of videos featuring Mr. Biden, Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump profanely bantering, with the A.I.-generated audio overlaid as commentary during imaginary online video gaming sessions.
On "The Late Show," Stephen Colbert recently used A.I. audio to have the Fox News host Tucker Carlson "read" aloud his text messages slamming Mr. Trump. Mr. Colbert labeled the audio as A.I. and the image on-screen showed a blend of Mr. Carlson's face and a Terminator cyborg for emphasis.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The right-wing provocateur Jack Posobiec pushed out a "deepfake" video last month of Mr. Biden announcing a national draft because of the conflict in Ukraine. It was quickly seen by millions.
"The videos we've seen in the last few weeks are really the canary in the coal mine," said Hany Farid, a professor of computer science at University of California at Berkeley, who specializes in digital forensics. "We measure advances now not in years but in months, and there are many months before the election."
Some A.I. tools were deployed in 2020. The Biden campaign created a program, code-named Couch Potato, that linked facial recognition, voice-to-text and other tools to automate the transcription of live events, including debates. It replaced the work of a host of interns and aides, and was immediately searchable through an internal portal.
The technology has improved so quickly, Mr. Woods said, that off-the-shelf tools are "1,000 times better" than what had to be built from scratch four years ago.
One looming question is what campaigns can and cannot do with OpenAI's powerful tools. One list of prohibited uses last fall lumped together "political campaigns, adult content, spam, hateful content."
Kim Malfacini, who helped create the OpenAI's rules and is on the company's trust and safety team, said in an interview that "political campaigns can use our tools for campaigning purposes. But it's the scaled use that we are trying to disallow here." OpenAI revised its usage rules after being contacted by The Times, specifying now that "generating high volumes of campaign materials" is prohibited.
Tommy Vietor, a former spokesman for Mr. Obama, dabbled with the A.I. tool from ElevenLabs to create a faux recording of Mr. Biden calling into the popular "Pod Save America" podcast that Mr. Vietor co-hosts. He paid a few dollars and uploaded real audio of Mr. Biden, and out came an audio likeness.
"The accuracy was just uncanny," Mr. Vietor said in an interview.
The show labeled it clearly as A.I. But Mr. Vietor could not help noticing that some online commenters nonetheless seemed confused. "I started playing with the software thinking this is so much fun, this will be a great vehicle for jokes," he said, "and finished thinking, 'Oh God, this is going to be a big problem."'

When in Doubt, Try Tweaking the Logo: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It's a classic move in the fashion playbook when trying to signal a new direction or herald a new designer. But are shifting sensibilities leading more brands to reconsider the humble serif?
Logos carry a peculiar, almost paradoxical burden of both inspiring loyalty and conveying novelty. A good design stands the test of time, while maintaining the allure of the new; too new, and it risks a sense of betrayal.
Consider the City of New York's recently announced, and widely panned, "We ❤️ NYC" logo, an update of "I ❤️ NY," the beloved Milton Glaser design created in 1976. High-profile logo redesigns often incite emotional uproars -- and increasingly, public discussions of the fashion of fonts.
When the British luxury brand Burberry introduced a new logo of its own last month, it seemed everyone in the fashion circuit had a hot take on typography trends.
Burberry joined two recently debuted serif logos from Ferragamo and Phoebe Philo, leading online followers to proclaim the era of serif typefaces in, and the era of "blanding" sans-serifs decidedly out.
For the uninitiated, serifs refer to the short marks, or "feet," at the ends of a letter's strokes (as seen in certain typefaces, such as the one used by The New York Times). A typeface that includes serifs is referred to as a serif, and one that does not, a sans-serif.
But for branding experts and design industry players whose daily work involves the detailed craft of custom typography and lettering, the hubbub was more a source of mild amusement.
"No one's really having the conversation about whether the logos are actually well drawn or not," said Grace Robinson-Leo, a founder and creative director at Decade, a branding studio that has consulted for Khaite, Banana Republic and Playboy.
According to Ellen Lupton, a design author and educator, the perceived binary of serif versus sans-serif is "really quite artificial" anyway. She noted that it "doesn't exist in most other writing systems that are not Latin based."
Michaël Amzalag, a founder of the art and design studio M/M Paris, described the fashion world's preoccupation between serifs and sans-serifs as "a dichotomy established decades ago, since the 1940s," pointing to the age-old rivals Chanel and Dior. His studio's brand identity for the Spanish luxury house Loewe has stayed in use for a decade -- a lifetime in internet years -- and notably bucks fashion industry trends by pairing two contrasting styles: a stately serif along with an ornate, script-style letter L.
Broadly speaking, serifs evoke "a certain historicism," said Michael Rock, a partner at the design consultancy 2x4, whose clients include Prada and Shanghai Tang. Serifs, as all typefaces, have always carried with them "the mark of a tool," he said.
Originating in the Latin alphabet, serifs date back to Roman antiquity, when inscribers would first sketch then carve letters into stone, Mr. Rock said. As a matter of function, the serifs were added as a so-called stop cut to prevent the longer strokes of letters from chipping out, he explained.
These classical forms have persisted as formal references in type design, even as technology progressed well beyond the days of chisel and stone. Sans-serifs emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as the industrial age and Modernist ideology inspired type designers to remove extraneous, ornamental vestiges of the past. Form follows function, as the adage goes, and serifs were thought to no longer serve a purpose.
"Now, we're in an age where everything is produced by digital means, and that difference between modernity and classicism is less ideological and more stylistic," Mr. Rock said. Still, the associations remain.
In the new serif logos of Ferragamo and Burberry, that subtle play for historicism may be key to winning back customer bases in an increasingly competitive landscape of newer brands. But at Daniel Lee's first show as Burberry's new designer, the new typeface -- an about-face from the brand's previous logo, a streamlined treatment created by Peter Saville less than five years ago -- took a back seat to the revival of the brand's turn-of-the-century equestrian knight design, a sort of heraldry that featured in a royal blue.
As abstracted, abbreviated signifiers, logos are but the tip of the iceberg for a large body of world-building creative work that forms a brand image, though they often attract outsize influence -- an influence that luxury fashion brands have in recent years used to steer controversy and buzz around an incoming creative director.
"Letter forms are the smallest containers for meaning," said Mathias Augustyniak, Mr. Amzalag's partner at M/M Paris, with typography offering the potential for a second layer of authorship. But the more common trend for publicity-driven redesigns, he suggested, are "more about creating noise than a true design act."
Fans of Ms. Philo, who led Celine from 2008 to 2018, still refer to Peter Miles's design of the "old Celine" logo -- which the brand's current creative director, Hedi Slimane, famously altered upon taking the reins, removing the accent over the E, among other adjustments recalling elements of the brand's 1960s logo. (Mr. Miles, who also created the mark for Ms. Philo's coming namesake brand, said of the serif-versus-sans-serif question: "Both have a place, both permanently current.")
Mr. Slimane also courted controversy during his tenure at Saint Laurent, where he dropped the Yves and replaced the previous word mark, created in 1961 by the French painter and typographer Cassandre, with a bold, all-caps sans-serif.
That, too, was an archival reference -- this time, to the original logo for the brand's ready-to-wear collection, Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, started in 1966. (The brand has since quietly reverted to a logo set in Cassandre's typeface, still absent the Yves, to form a mash-up that Mr. Amzalag referred to as "an amputation" akin to "cutting an arm off of Mona Lisa.")
In 2017, Mr. Saville, who established his career designing album artwork for Factory Records in the 1980s and is now a fashion-industry favorite for logo redesigns (including the latest one for Ferragamo), updated the Calvin Klein logo when Raf Simons took the helm.
Copycats exist throughout fashion, as a popular meme shows, listing examples of luxury brands -- Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Burberry, Berluti, Balmain -- whose logos had gone sans-serif within the past five to six years.
Starting a new label with a blank slate, however, the new Phoebe Philo logo designed by Mr. Miles, set in all-caps Times New Roman -- the familiar, default typeface of Microsoft Office -- breaks from the pack with a sort of rebellious indifference.
Mr. Rock described it as "a typographic version of a studied blankness, what in Italian might be called sprezzatura" -- a knowing and cool nonchalance belying a precise eye.
"Make no doubt about it, though," he said. "This takes enormous effort to achieve."
Ms. Robinson-Leo expressed an appreciation for the aesthetic created by Ms. Philo and Mr. Miles, though she said she could not quite put her finger on what exactly she admired about it. "When a logo is really beautiful and really well drawn, it really stands the test of time, and it often sets the tone for a kind of style or aesthetic that other people get excited about," she said.
The online hive has quieted its parsing of Burberry's new face, and it's too soon to know how it will fare over time. It's also possible that nobody will notice or remember.
"In the same way that social media is so immediate," Mr. Rock said, "it also has really short memories."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sundar Pichai has been trying to start an A.I. revolution for a very long time.
In 2016, shortly after being named Google's chief executive, Mr. Pichai declared that Google was an "A.I.-first" company. He spent lavishly to assemble an all-star team of A.I. researchers, whose breakthroughs powered changes to products like Google Translate and Google Photos. He even predicted that A.I.'s impact would be bigger than "electricity or fire."
So it had to sting when A.I.'s big moment finally arrived, and Google wasn't involved.
Instead, OpenAI -- a scrappy A.I. start-up backed by Microsoft -- stole the spotlight in November by releasing ChatGPT, a poem-writing, code-generating, homework-finishing marvel. ChatGPT became an overnight sensation, attracting millions of users and kicking off a Silicon Valley frenzy. It made Google look sluggish and vulnerable for the first time in years. (It didn't help when Microsoft relaunched its Bing search engine with OpenAI's technology inside, instantly ending Bing's decade-long run as a punchline.)
In an interview with The Times's "Hard Fork" podcast on Thursday, his first extended interview since ChatGPT's launch, Mr. Pichai said he was glad that A.I. was having a moment, even if Google wasn't the driving force.
"It's an exciting moment, regardless of whether we had done it," Mr. Pichai said. "Obviously, you always wish you had done it."
It's been a wild few months at Google. In December, shortly after ChatGPT's release, someone in management -- Mr. Pichai swears it wasn't him -- declared a "code red," instructing employees to shift time and resources toward A.I. projects. The company also established a fast-track review process to get A.I. projects out more quickly. And Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google's co-founders, who took a hands-off approach for years, rolled up their sleeves to help. The company plans to release a raft of new A.I. products this year and plug the technology into many of its existing ones. (This week, it began testing a new Gmail feature that allows users to compose A.I.-generated emails.)
On Thursday, Mr. Pichai expressed both optimism and worry about the state of the A.I. race.
He gave a blunt assessment of Bard, the ChatGPT competitor that Google released last week to tepid reviews: "I feel like we took a souped-up Civic and kind of put it in a race with more powerful cars." (He also broke some news: Bard, which currently runs on a version of an A.I. language model called LaMDA, will soon be upgraded to a more powerful model, known as PaLM.)
He reacted to a recent open letter, signed by nearly 2,000 technology leaders and researchers, that urged companies to pause development of powerful A.I. systems for at least six months to prevent "profound risks to society." Mr. Pichai doesn't agree with all of the letter's details -- and he wouldn't commit to slowing down Google's A.I. efforts -- but he said that the letter's cautionary message was "worth being out there."
And he talked about the "whiplash" he often feels when it comes to A.I. these days, as some people urge companies like Google to move faster on A.I., release more products and take bigger risks, while others urge them to slow down and be more cautious.
"You will see us be bold and ship things," he said, "but we are going to be very responsible in how we do it."
Here are some other highlights of Mr. Pichai's remarks:
On the initial, lukewarm reception for Google's Bard chatbot:
We knew when we were putting Bard out, we wanted to be careful ... So it's not surprising to me that's the reaction. But in some ways, I feel like we took a souped-up Civic and kind of put it in a race with more powerful cars. And what surprised me is how well it does on many, many, many classes of queries. But we are going to be iterating fast. We clearly have more capable models. Pretty soon, maybe as this goes live, we will be upgrading Bard to some of our more capable PaLM models, which will bring more capabilities, be it in reasoning, coding, it can answer math questions better. So you will see progress over the course of next week.
On whether ChatGPT's success came as a surprise:
With OpenAI, we had a lot of context. There are some incredibly good people, some of whom had been at Google before, and so we knew the caliber of the team. So I think OpenAI's progress didn't surprise us. I think ChatGPT ... you know, credit to them for finding something with product-market fit. The reception from users, I think, was a pleasant surprise, maybe even for them, and for a lot of us.
On his worries about tech companies racing toward A.I. advancements:
Sometimes I get concerned when people use the word "race" and "being first." I've thought about A.I. for a long time, and we are definitely working with technology which is going to be incredibly beneficial, but clearly has the potential to cause harm in a deep way. And so I think it's very important that we are all responsible in how we approach it.
On the return of Larry Page and Sergey Brin:
I've had a few meetings with them. Sergey has been hanging out with our engineers for a while now. He's a deep mathematician and a computer scientist. So to him, the underlying technology, I think if I were to use his words, he would say it's the most exciting thing he has seen in his lifetime. So it's all that excitement. And I'm glad. They've always said, "Call us whenever you need to." And I call them.
On the open letter , signed by nearly 2,000 A.I. researchers and tech luminaries including Elon Musk, that urged companies to pause development of powerful A.I. systems for at least six months:
In this area, I think it's important to hear concerns. There are many thoughtful people behind it, including people who have thought about A.I. for a long time. I remember talking to Elon eight years ago, and he was deeply concerned about A.I. safety then. I think he has been consistently concerned. And I think there is merit to be concerned about it. While I may not agree with everything that's there and the details of how you would go about it, I think the spirit of [the letter] is worth being out there.
On whether he's worried about the danger of creating artificial general intelligence, or A.G.I., an A.I. that surpasses human intelligence:
When is it A.G.I.? What is it? How do you define it? When do we get here? All those are good questions. But to me, it almost doesn't matter because it is so clear to me that these systems are going to be very, very capable. And so it almost doesn't matter whether you reached A.G.I. or not; you're going to have systems which are capable of delivering benefits at a scale we've never seen before, and potentially causing real harm. Can we have an A.I system which can cause disinformation at scale? Yes. Is it A.G.I.? It really doesn't matter.
On why climate change activism makes him hopeful about A.I.:
One of the things that gives me hope about A.I., like climate change, is it affects everyone. Over time, we live on one planet, and so these are both issues that have similar characteristics in the sense that you can't unilaterally get safety in A.I. By definition, it affects everyone. So that tells me the collective will will come over time to tackle all of this responsibly.

First Quarter Closes on a Winning Note: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/first-quarter-closes-on-winning-note/docview/2793301283/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks rallied Friday to close out a winning March and first quarter of the year, feats that looked questionable just a couple weeks ago when Wall Street was tumbling in turmoil.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.4 percent to cap a 3.5 percent gain for the month. It also locked in a second winning quarter in a row after falling sharply most of last year on worries about high interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 415 points, or 1.3 percent, while the Nasdaq composite climbed 1.7 percent. For the Nasdaq, big leaps for technology stocks drove a gain of 16.8 percent for the quarter, its best since the surge out of the coronavirus-caused crash in the spring of 2020.
Friday's gains came after a report showed inflation across the United States slowed in February, though it was still high relative to history. A continued slowdown could give the Federal Reserve more leeway to take it easier on interest rates after jacking them higher at a furious pace over the last year.
The threat of higher rates has been behind the stock market's struggles since it peaked in early 2022. A blitz of economic reports earlier in the year suggesting stubbornly high inflation raised worries the Fed would have to keep rates even higher than feared for longer.
The overriding mood in the market seems to be that the "Fed blinked and off we rally into April" before waiting to see if a recession or new panics around commercial real estate or something else awaits in the second half of the year, investment strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a BofA Global Research report.
Expectations for an easier Fed have helped Big Tech stocks because high-growth stocks are seen as the biggest beneficiaries of lower rates. That's helped to prop up the S.&P. 500, where Big Tech stocks play an outsized role. Apple, Microsoft and Google's parent Alphabet each posted double-digit gains for March.
Strength in tech has helped to mask weakness for other parts of the market that are still down but play smaller roles in indexes, such as smaller-sized stocks or financial companies.
Some professional investors on Wall Street say the expectations for rate cuts are premature and could be setting the market up for disappointment.
The Fed, meanwhile, has hinted it envisions raising rates one more time before keeping them steady through this year. Friday's data suggests that could still be the case, economists said.
"Elevated price pressures coupled with strong job growth that is restoring incomes and is supporting demand should keep the Fed on track to hike rates further over coming meetings," said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.
What makes the Fed's upcoming decisions particularly tricky is that the banking industry's troubles could act like hikes to interest rates on their own if they cause banks to pull back on lending. That in turn could stifle hiring and growth for the economy.
All the changing expectations for what the Fed will do have meant historic-sized moves for Treasury yields in the bond market. The yield on the two-year Treasury zoomed through particularly rattling moves. It was sitting above 5 percent at its highest level since 2007 earlier this month, when investors were bracing for the Fed to keep rates higher for longer.
It then quickly plunged below 3.60 percent as bets built for the Fed to ease up because of the banking industry's troubles. Analysts said the moves were so violent because so many bets had piled up on the same side: for yields only to climb higher.
The yield has since steadied somewhat. It fell to 4.04 percent Friday from 4.12 percent late Thursday. The 10-year yield, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, fell from 3.55 percent. It also swung sharply through the quarter, but not by as much as the two-year yield. It was sitting above 4 percent earlier in the month.

Wall Street Gains as Banking Fears Recede: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/wall-street-gains-as-banking-fears-recede/docview/2792756969/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks rose Thursday as a bit more fear evaporated from Wall Street, keeping its main index of health on track for a winning month.
The S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent for its fifth gain in the last six days. It's been on a sharp turnaround after struggling in earlier weeks on worries about whether the banking system was cracking under the weight of higher interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.7 percent.
Forceful actions by regulators worldwide have helped build confidence that the current trouble for banks won't torpedo the economy like the 2008 financial crisis did. Traders have also begun betting heavily that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates soon. Such cuts could offer relief after a year of relentless hikes to rates, and they also tend to act like steroids for markets.
To be sure, all the recent ebullience has some professionals on Wall Street wary.
"Markets are pricing the best of both worlds: a recession that brings inflation down rapidly and keeps rates low, yet one where corporate earnings do not fall sharply," according to analysts at Barclays led by Ajay Rajadhyaksha, global chairman of research.
They are skeptical and think both bonds and U.S. stocks look too expensive.
Since Silicon Valley Bank became history's second-biggest U.S. bank failure, Treasury yields in the bond market have tumbled as traders built bets the Federal Reserve would have to take it easier on interest rates.
The Fed has pulled its key overnight rate to a range of 4.75 percent to 5 percent, up from virtually zero at the start of last year, to drive down inflation. High rates can do that, but only by taking a blunt hammer to the entire economy. They also drag down prices for stocks and other investments.
The bet on Wall Street has been that the Fed may cut rates as soon as this summer, to release some of the pressure built up on the economy and banks. That has caused the price to soar and the yield to tumble for the two-year Treasury, which tends to move on expectations for Fed action.
Its yield plunged from above 5 percent earlier this month, when it was at its highest level since 2007, back below 3.6 percent last week. That's a massive move for the bond market. It rose Thursday to 4.12 percent from 4.11 percent late Wednesday.
Expectations for easier rates in turn have helped to buoy the Big Tech stocks that dominate the S&P 500 and other indexes. That's because tech and high-growth stocks are seen as some of the biggest beneficiaries of low rates.
Gains for Microsoft, Apple and Amazon on Thursday were the strongest forces pushing the S&P 500 higher. Amazon rose 1.7 percent, while the others were up more modestly.
But many professionals on Wall Street are saying the Fed would likely cut rates only if a more serious recession for the economy were on the way, one that would pull down corporate earnings even more sharply than what's already expected.
The Fed has indicated it plans to raise rates one more time before holding steady through the end of this year. While it has acknowledged that the turmoil for banks could almost act like a rate hike on its own, inflation is still high.
"In sharp recessions -- which seems to us the only way to justify bond market pricing, given how high US inflation is -- corporate earnings easily drop 30-35 percent," Mr. Rajadhyaksha and his Barclays colleagues wrote in a report. They added that Big Tech stocks would not be immune from such a downturn.
Nevertheless, the increasingly dominant force on Wall Street seems to be calm.
Financial stocks in the S&P 500 went from gains in the morning to losses in the afternoon. The movements weren't as jagged as they were earlier this month when fears about the banking system were at their height.

Tech Leaders Urge a Pause in A.I., Citing 'Profound Risks to Society': [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: More than 1,000 tech leaders, researchers and others signed an open letter urging a moratorium on the development of the most powerful artificial intelligence systems.
More than 1,000 technology leaders and researchers, including Elon Musk, have urged artificial intelligence labs to pause development of the most advanced systems, warning in an open letter that A.I. tools present "profound risks to society and humanity."
A.I. developers are "locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one -- not even their creators -- can understand, predict or reliably control," according to the letter, which the nonprofit Future of Life Institute released on Wednesday.
Others who signed the letter include Steve Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple; Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur and a 2020 presidential candidate; and Rachel Bronson, the president of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which sets the Doomsday Clock.
"These things are shaping our world," said Gary Marcus, an entrepreneur and academic who has long complained of flaws in A.I. systems, in an interview. "We have a perfect storm of corporate irresponsibility, widespread adoption, lack of regulation and a huge number of unknowns."
A.I. powers chatbots like ChatGPT, Microsoft's Bing and Google's Bard, which can perform humanlike conversations, create essays on an endless variety of topics and perform more complex tasks, like writing computer code.
The push to develop more powerful chatbots has led to a race that could determine the next leaders of the tech industry. But these tools have been criticized for getting details wrong and their ability to spread misinformation.
The open letter called for a pause in the development of A.I. systems more powerful than GPT-4, the chatbot introduced this month by the research lab OpenAI, which Mr. Musk co-founded. The pause would provide time to introduce "shared safety protocols" for A.I. systems, the letter said. "If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium," it added.
Development of powerful A.I. systems should advance "only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable," the letter said.
"Humanity can enjoy a flourishing future with A.I.," the letter said. "Having succeeded in creating powerful A.I. systems, we can now enjoy an 'A.I. summer' in which we reap the rewards, engineer these systems for the clear benefit of all and give society a chance to adapt."
Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, did not sign the letter.
Mr. Marcus and others believe that persuading the wider tech community to agree to a moratorium would be difficult. But swift government action is also a slim possibility, because lawmakers have done little to regulate artificial intelligence.
Politicians in the United States don't have much of an understanding of the technology, Representative Jay Obernolte, a California Republican, recently told The New York Times. In 2021, European Union policymakers proposed a law designed to regulate A.I. technologies that might create harm, including facial recognition systems.
Expected to be passed as soon as this year, the measure would require companies to conduct risk assessments of A.I. technologies to determine how their applications could affect health, safety and individual rights.
GPT-4 is what A.I. researchers call a neural network, a type of mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing data. A neural network is the same technology that digital assistants like Siri and Alexa use to recognize spoken commands, and that self-driving cars use to identify pedestrians.
Around 2018, companies like Google and OpenAI began building neural networks that learned from enormous amounts of digital text, including books, Wikipedia articles, chat logs and other information culled from the internet. The networks are called large language models, or L.L.M.s.
By pinpointing billions of patterns in all that text, the L.L.M.s learn to generate text on their own, including tweets, term papers and computer programs. They could even carry on a conversation. Over the years, OpenAI and other companies have built L.L.M.s that learn from more and more data.
This has improved their abilities, but the systems still make mistakes. They often get facts wrong and will make up information without warning, a phenomenon that researchers call "hallucination." Because the systems deliver all information with what seems like complete confidence, it is often difficult for people to tell what is right and what is wrong.
Experts are worried that these systems could be misused to spread disinformation with more speed and efficiency than was possible in the past. They believe that these could even be used to coax behavior from people across the internet.
Before GPT-4 was released, OpenAI asked outside researchers to test dangerous uses of the system. The researchers showed that it could be coaxed into suggesting how to buy illegal firearms online, describe ways to make dangerous substances from household items and write Facebook posts to convince women that abortion is unsafe.
They also found that the system was able to use Task Rabbit to hire a human across the internet and defeat a Captcha test, which is widely used to identify bots online. When the human asked if the system was "a robot," the system said it was a visually impaired person.
After changes by OpenAI, GPT-4 no longer does these things.
For years, many A.I. researchers, academics and tech executives, including Mr. Musk, have worried that A.I. systems could cause even greater harm. Some are part of a vast online community called rationalists or effective altruists who believe that A.I could eventually destroy humanity.
The letter was shepherded by the Future of Life Institute, an organization dedicated to researching existential risks to humanity that has long warned of the dangers of artificial intelligence. But it was signed by a wide variety of people from industry and academia.
Though some who signed the letter are known for repeatedly expressing concerns that A.I. could destroy humanity, others, including Mr. Marcus, are more concerned about its near-term dangers, including the spread of disinformation and the risk that people will rely on these systems for medical and emotional advice.
The letter "shows how many people are deeply worried about what is going on," said Mr. Marcus, who signed the letter. He believes the letter will be a turning point. "It think it is a really important moment in the history of A.I. -- and maybe humanity," he said.
He acknowledged, however, that those who had signed the letter might find it difficult to persuade the wider community of companies and researchers to put a moratorium in place. "The letter is not perfect," he said. "But the spirit is exactly right."

Adidas Ends Opposition To B.L.M. Trademark
Two days after Adidas objected to a trademark application by the advocacy group Black Lives Matter for a logo featuring three parallel stripes, right, the German sportswear company said that it would withdraw its opposition. Adidas challenged the trademark application in a filing with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Monday. On Wednesday, the company said in an emailed statement that it would withdraw its opposition "as soon as possible." In the filing on Monday, Adidas said that it opposed the Black Lives Matter application because it showed a trademark that "incorporates three stripes in a manner that is confusingly similar" to the company's familiar three-stripe logo "in appearance and overall commercial impression." The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation filed the trademark application for a yellow three-stripe logo design in November 2020. The group is one of several organizations associated with the wider Black Lives Matter movement, which emerged in 2013 after George Zimmerman was acquitted of killing Trayvon Martin, a Black teenager. The foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In its statement, Adidas did not say why it was reversing its opposition to the trademark application. In September 2022, the window opened for individuals and groups to file their opposition to the foundation's trademark application. Adidas repeatedly sought to extend the window before submitting its notice of opposition on Monday, according to the filing. Adidas said that it had been using a three-stripe mark on footwear since at least 1952 and that the design had been used in its partnerships with professional athletes. In the filing, the company said that the public understood that the three-stripe mark "distinguishes and identifies Adidas's merchandise." AMANDA HOLPUCH

Group Criticizes Uganda Over Anti-L.G.B.T.Q. Bill
A business group including corporate giants like Google says it opposes Uganda's anti-L.G.B.T.Q. legislation, calling it "a concern for global businesses and investors operating or planning to invest" in the East African country. The legislation, which prescribes the death penalty or life imprisonment for some homosexual offenses, would hurt Uganda's economy, the Open For Business coalition said in a statement Wednesday. "Diversity and inclusion are core principles of our coalition partners in the conduct of their businesses," the statement said. The legislation, if signed into law by President Yoweri Museveni, "would undermine Uganda's attractiveness as a place to do business and invest," it said. In addition to Google, the Open For Business coalition includes companies such as Microsoft, MasterCard, HSBC and Facebook's owner, Meta. Uganda's legislature last week passed the anti-homosexuality bill. The legislation is now with Mr. Museveni, who can sign it into law or return it back to the parliamentary speaker with proposed changes. The bill has wide support in Uganda, including among church leaders. It was introduced last month by an opposition lawmaker who said his goal was to punish the "promotion, recruitment and funding" of L.G.B.T.Q. activities in the country. Only two of 389 legislators present to vote opposed the bill. ASSOCIATED PRESS

A Calmer Day Leaves the Market Mixed: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Stocks were mixed Tuesday as Wall Street regained some stability at the tail end of what has been a turmoil-filled month.
The S&P 500 dipped 0.2 percent, though the majority of stocks within the index rose. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.4 percent.
There was relative calm even in the bond market, which has been home to some of Wall Street's wildest moves since fears flared about the banking system earlier this month. Yields were rising only modestly after large moves in prior weeks.
This month has been dominated by worries that banks around the world may be cracking under the pressure of much higher interest rates. But some calm has returned to the market recently after regulators made big moves to protect the system.
That has much of Wall Street's attention back on interest rates and what central banks will do next with them. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have a tough decision: Inflation is still high, which would typically call for even higher interest rates. But the weakness for banks has shown some fragility in the system that higher rates could worsen.
"I think the global central banks have put us in that middling zone, where we're waiting for clarity on: Are they done?" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
After the Fed raised its key overnight rate all the way to a range of 4.75 percent to 5 percent, up from virtually zero early last year, the market could find some relief if the Fed does take a pause after hiking one more time as it's hinted, Mr. Haworth said.
"That's a dramatic change" in rates over just a year, he said. "Just getting to some form of stability provides some clarity for planning to begin."
Apple, Microsoft and other major tech stocks were among the heaviest weights on the S&P 500 Tuesday after dipping modestly.
On the winning side was McCormick & Co., which jumped 9.6 percent after the spices and seasonings company reported stronger profit and revenue for its latest quarter than analysts expected.
Other stocks were mixed, including financial stocks that have had a turbulent month. Most of those in the S&P 500 rose, but some banks that investors have highlighted as most at risk fell after erasing gains from the morning.
First Republic fell 2.3 percent, while PacWest Bancorp was down 5 percent.
The harshest focus has been on smaller and midsize banks in the hunt for who could be next to suffer an exodus of customer akin to the run that toppled Silicon Valley Bank.
One of the broader worries has been that all the furor for banks could lead to a pullback in lending to businesses across the country. That in turn could lead to less economic growth and a higher risk of a recession.
Jan Hatzius, chief economist and head of global investment research at Goldman Sachs, recently raised his probability of a recession over the next year to 35 percent from 25 percent.
Reports on the economy have been coming in mixed. The job market remains remarkably solid, while smaller corners of the economy have been showing more weakness.
On Tuesday, one report suggested that home prices softened in January from December, but not by quite as much as economists expected.
Traders are still largely betting the Fed will have to cut rates as soon as this summer to prop up the economy. Such bets have returned in force since the banking industry's woes began, materializing almost as quickly as a prior round of bets for rate cuts had earlier disappeared following data suggesting stickier-than-expected inflation.

For Workers, Promise of A.I. Is a Threat, Too: [National Desk]

Full text: In December, the staff of the American Writers and Artists Institute -- a 26-year-old membership organization for copywriters -- realized that something big was happening.
The newest edition of ChatGPT, a "large language model" that mines the internet to answer questions and perform tasks on command, had just been released. Its abilities were astonishing -- and squarely in the bailiwick of people who generate content, such as advertising copy and blog posts, for a living.
"They're horrified," said Rebecca Matter, the institute's president. Over the holidays, she scrambled to organize a webinar on the pitfalls and potential of the new artificial-intelligence technology. More than 3,000 people signed up, she said, and the overall message was cautionary but reassuring: Writers could use ChatGPT to complete assignments more quickly, and move into higher-level roles in content planning and search-engine optimization.
"I do think it's going to minimize short-form copy projects," Ms. Matter said. "But on the flip side of that, I think there will be more opportunities for things like strategy."
OpenAI's ChatGPT is the latest advance in a steady march of innovations that have offered the potential to transform many occupations and wipe out others, sometimes in tandem. It is too early to tally the enabled and the endangered, or to gauge the overall impact on labor demand and productivity. But it seems clear that artificial intelligence will impinge on work in different ways than previous waves of technology.
The positive view of tools like ChatGPT is that they could be complements to human labor, rather than replacements. Not all workers are sanguine, however, about the prospective impact.
Katie Brown is a grant writer in the Chicago suburbs for a small nonprofit group focused on addressing domestic violence. She was shocked to learn in early February that a professional association for grant writers was promoting the use of artificial-intelligence software that would automatically complete parts of an application, requiring the human simply to polish it before submitting.
The platform, called Grantable, is based on the same technology as ChatGPT, and it markets itself to freelancers who charge by the application. That, she thought, clearly threatens opportunities in the industry.
"For me, it's common sense: Which do you think a small nonprofit will pick?" Ms. Brown said. "A full-time-salary-plus-benefits person, or someone equipped with A.I. that you don't have to pay benefits for?"
Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been operating in the background of many businesses for years, helping to evaluate large numbers of possible decisions and better align supply with demand, for example. And plenty of technological advancements over centuries have decreased the need for certain workers -- although each time, the jobs created have more than offset the number lost.
ChatGPT, however, is the first to confront such a broad range of white-collar workers so directly, and to be so accessible that people could use it in their own jobs. And it is improving rapidly, with a new edition released this month. According to a survey conducted by the job search website ZipRecruiter after ChatGPT's release, 62 percent of job seekers said they were concerned that artificial intelligence could derail their careers.
"ChatGPT is the one that made it more visible," said Michael Chui, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute who studies automation's effects. "So I think it did start to raise questions about where timelines might start to be accelerated."
That's also the conclusion of a White House report on the implications of A.I. technology, including ChatGPT. "The primary risk of A.I. to the work force is in the general disruption it is likely to cause to workers, whether they find that their jobs are newly automated or that their job design has fundamentally changed," the authors wrote.
For now, Guillermo Rubio has found that his job as a copywriter has changed markedly since he started using ChatGPT to generate ideas for blog posts, write first drafts of newsletters, create hundreds of slight variations on stock advertising copy and summon research on a subject about which he might write a white paper.
Since he still charges his clients the same rates, the tool has simply allowed him to work less. If the going rate for copy goes down, though -- which it might, as the technology improves -- he's confident he'll be able to move into consulting on content strategy, along with production.
"I think people are more reluctant and fearful, with good reason," Mr. Rubio, who is in Orange County, Calif., said. "You could look at it in a negative light, or you can embrace it. I think the biggest takeaway is you have to be adaptable. You have to be open to embracing it."
After decades of study, researchers understand a lot about automation's impact on the work force. Economists including Daron Acemoglu at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have found that since 1980, technology has played a primary role in amplifying income inequality. As labor unions atrophied, hollowing out systems for training and retraining, workers without college educations saw their bargaining power reduced in the face of machines capable of rudimentary tasks.
The advent of ChatGPT three months ago, however, has prompted a flurry of studies predicated on the idea that this isn't your average robot.
One team of researchers ran an analysis showing the industries and occupations that are most exposed to artificial intelligence, based on a model adjusted for generative language tools. Topping the list were college humanities professors, legal services providers, insurance agents and telemarketers. Mere exposure, however, doesn't determine whether the technology is likely to replace workers or merely augment their skills.
Shakked Noy and Whitney Zhang, doctoral students at M.I.T., conducted a randomized, controlled trial on experienced professionals in such fields as human relations and marketing. The participants were given tasks that typically take 20 to 30 minutes, like writing news releases and brief reports. Those who used ChatGPT completed the assignments 37 percent faster on average than those who didn't -- a substantial productivity increase. They also reported a 20 percent increase in job satisfaction.
A third study -- using a program developed by GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft -- evaluated the impact of generative A.I. specifically on software developers. In a trial run by GitHub's researchers, developers given an entry-level task and encouraged to use the program, called Copilot, completed their task 55 percent faster than those who did the assignment manually.
Those productivity gains are unlike almost any observed since the widespread adoption of the personal computer.
"It does seem to be doing something fundamentally different," said David Autor, another M.I.T. economist, who advises Ms. Zhang and Mr. Noy. "Before, computers were powerful, but they simply and robotically did what people programmed them to do." Generative artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is "adaptive, it learns and is capable of flexible problem solving."
That's very apparent to Peter Dolkens, a software developer for a company that primarily makes online tools for the sports industry. He has been integrating ChatGPT into his work for tasks like summarizing chunks of code to aid colleagues who may pick up the project after him, and proposing solutions to problems that have him stumped. If the answer isn't perfect, he'll ask ChatGPT to refine it, or try something different.
"It's the equivalent of a very well-read intern," Mr. Dolkens, who is in London, said. "They might not have the experience to know how to apply it, but they know all the words, they've read all the books and they're able to get part of the way there."
There's another takeaway from the initial research: ChatGPT and Copilot elevated the least experienced workers the most. If true, more generally, that could mitigate the inequality-widening effects of artificial intelligence.
On the other hand, as each worker becomes more productive, fewer workers are required to complete a set of tasks. Whether that results in fewer jobs in particular industries depends on the demand for the service provided, and the jobs that might be created in helping to manage and direct the A.I. "Prompt engineering," for example, is already a skill that those who play around with ChatGPT long enough can add to their résumés.
Since demand for software code seems insatiable, and developers' salaries are extremely high, increasing productivity seems unlikely to foreclose opportunities for people to enter the field.
That won't be the same for every profession, however, and Dominic Russo is pretty sure it won't be true for his: writing appeals to pharmacy benefit managers and insurance companies when they reject prescriptions for expensive drugs. He has been doing the job for about seven years, and has built expertise with only on-the-job training, after studying journalism in college.
After ChatGPT came out, he asked it to write an appeal on behalf of someone with psoriasis who wanted the expensive drug Otezla. The result was good enough to require only a few edits before submitting it.
"If you knew what to prompt the A.I. with, anyone could do the work," Mr. Russo said. "That's what's really scares me. Why would a pharmacy pay me $ 70,000 a year, when they can license the technology and pay people $ 12 an hour to run prompts into it?"
To try to protect himself from that possible future, Mr. Russo has been building up his side business: selling pizzas out of his house in southern New Jersey, an enterprise that he figures won't be disrupted by artificial intelligence.
Yet.

In December, the staff of the American Writers and Artists Institute — a 26-year-old membership organization for copywriters — realized that something big was happening.
The newest edition of ChatGPT, a “large language model” that mines the internet to answer questions and perform tasks on command, had just been released. Its abilities were astonishing — and squarely in the bailiwick of people who generate content, such as advertising copy and blog posts, for a living.
“They’re horrified,” said Rebecca Matter, the institute’s president. Over the holidays, she scrambled to organize a webinar on the pitfalls and potential of the new artificial intelligence technology. More than 3,000 people signed up, she said, and the overall message was cautionary but reassuring: Writers could use ChatGPT to complete assignments more quickly, and move into higher-level roles in content planning and search-engine optimization.
“I do think it’s going to minimize short-form copy projects,” Matter said. “But on the flip side of that, I think there will be more opportunities for things like strategy.”
OpenAI’s ChatGPT is the latest advance in a steady march of innovations that have offered the potential to transform many occupations and wipe out others, sometimes in tandem. It is too early to tally the enabled and the endangered, or to gauge the overall impact on labor demand and productivity. But it seems clear that artificial intelligence will impinge on work in different ways than previous waves of technology.
The positive view of tools like ChatGPT is that they could be complements to human labor, rather than replacements. Not all workers are sanguine, however, about the prospective impact.
Katie Brown is a grant writer in the Chicago suburbs for a small nonprofit group focused on addressing domestic violence. She was shocked to learn in early February that a professional association for grant writers was promoting the use of artificial intelligence software that would automatically complete parts of an application, requiring the human simply to polish it before submitting.
The platform, called Grantable, is based on the same technology as ChatGPT, and it markets itself to freelancers who charge by the application. That, she thought, clearly threatens opportunities in the industry.
“For me, it’s common sense: Which do you think a small nonprofit will pick?” Brown said. “A full-time-salary-plus-benefits person, or someone equipped with AI that you don’t have to pay benefits for?”
Artificial intelligence and machine learning have been operating in the background of many businesses for years, helping to evaluate large numbers of possible decisions and better align supply with demand, for example. And plenty of technological advancements over centuries have decreased the need for certain workers — although each time, the jobs created have more than offset the number lost.
ChatGPT, however, is the first to confront such a broad range of white-collar workers so directly, and to be so accessible that people could use it in their own jobs. And it is improving rapidly, with a new edition released this month. According to a survey conducted by the job search website ZipRecruiter after ChatGPT’s release, 62% of job seekers said they were concerned that artificial intelligence could derail their careers.
“ChatGPT is the one that made it more visible,” said Michael Chui, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute who studies automation’s effects. “So I think it did start to raise questions about where timelines might start to be accelerated.”
That’s also the conclusion of a White House report on the implications of AI technology, including ChatGPT. “The primary risk of AI to the workforce is in the general disruption it is likely to cause to workers, whether they find that their jobs are newly automated or that their job design has fundamentally changed,” the authors wrote.
For now, Guillermo Rubio has found that his job as a copywriter has changed markedly since he started using ChatGPT to generate ideas for blog posts, write first drafts of newsletters, create hundreds of slight variations on stock advertising copy and summon research on a subject about which he might write a white paper.
Since he still charges his clients the same rates, the tool has simply allowed him to work less. If the going rate for copy goes down, though — which it might, as the technology improves — he’s confident he’ll be able to move into consulting on content strategy, along with production.
“I think people are more reluctant and fearful, with good reason,” said Rubio, who is in Orange County, California. “You could look at it in a negative light, or you can embrace it. I think the biggest takeaway is you have to be adaptable. You have to be open to embracing it.”
After decades of study, researchers understand a lot about automation’s impact on the workforce. Economists including Daron Acemoglu at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have found that since 1980, technology has played a primary role in amplifying income inequality. As labor unions atrophied, hollowing out systems for training and retraining, workers without college educations saw their bargaining power reduced in the face of machines capable of rudimentary tasks.
The advent of ChatGPT three months ago, however, has prompted a flurry of studies predicated on the idea that this isn’t your average robot.
One team of researchers ran an analysis showing the industries and occupations that are most exposed to artificial intelligence, based on a model adjusted for generative language tools. Topping the list were college humanities professors, legal services providers, insurance agents and telemarketers. Mere exposure, however, doesn’t determine whether the technology is likely to replace workers or merely augment their skills.
Shakked Noy and Whitney Zhang, doctoral students at MIT, conducted a randomized, controlled trial on experienced professionals in such fields as human relations and marketing. The participants were given tasks that typically take 20 to 30 minutes, like writing news releases and brief reports. Those who used ChatGPT completed the assignments 37% faster on average than those who didn’t — a substantial productivity increase. They also reported a 20% increase in job satisfaction.
A third study — using a program developed by GitHub, which is owned by Microsoft — evaluated the impact of generative AI specifically on software developers. In a trial run by GitHub’s researchers, developers given an entry-level task and encouraged to use the program, called Copilot, completed their task 55% faster than those who did the assignment manually.
Those productivity gains are unlike almost any observed since the widespread adoption of the personal computer.
“It does seem to be doing something fundamentally different,” said David Autor, another MIT economist, who advises Zhang and Noy. “Before, computers were powerful, but they simply and robotically did what people programmed them to do.” Generative artificial intelligence, on the other hand, is “adaptive, it learns and is capable of flexible problem solving.”
That’s very apparent to Peter Dolkens, a software developer for a company that primarily makes online tools for the sports industry. He has been integrating ChatGPT into his work for tasks like summarizing chunks of code to aid colleagues who may pick up the project after him, and proposing solutions to problems that have him stumped. If the answer isn’t perfect, he’ll ask ChatGPT to refine it, or try something different.
“It’s the equivalent of a very well-read intern,” said Dolkens, who is in London. “They might not have the experience to know how to apply it, but they know all the words, they’ve read all the books and they’re able to get part of the way there.”
There’s another takeaway from the initial research: ChatGPT and Copilot elevated the least experienced workers the most. If true, more generally, that could mitigate the inequality-widening effects of artificial intelligence.
On the other hand, as each worker becomes more productive, fewer workers are required to complete a set of tasks. Whether that results in fewer jobs in particular industries depends on the demand for the service provided, and the jobs that might be created in helping to manage and direct the AI. “Prompt engineering,” for example, is already a skill that those who play around with ChatGPT long enough can add to their résumés.
Since demand for software code seems insatiable, and developers’ salaries are extremely high, increasing productivity seems unlikely to foreclose opportunities for people to enter the field.
That won’t be the same for every profession, however, and Dominic Russo is pretty sure it won’t be true for his: writing appeals to pharmacy benefit managers and insurance companies when they reject prescriptions for expensive drugs. He has been doing the job for about seven years, and has built expertise with only on-the-job training, after studying journalism in college.
After ChatGPT came out, he asked it to write an appeal on behalf of someone with psoriasis who wanted the expensive drug Otezla. The result was good enough to require only a few edits before submitting it.
“If you knew what to prompt the AI with, anyone could do the work,” Russo said. “That’s what’s really scares me. Why would a pharmacy pay me $70,000 a year, when they can license the technology and pay people $12 an hour to run prompts into it?”
To try to protect himself from that possible future, Russo has been building up his side business: selling pizzas out of his house in southern New Jersey, an enterprise that he figures won’t be disrupted by artificial intelligence.
Yet.

Founders of Lyft Will Step Down Amid Layoffs and Disappointing Bottom Line: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Lyft has been slow to bounce back from early pandemic problems even as the business of its much bigger rival, Uber, has improved.
Lyft's co-founders said on Monday that they would step down from their day-to-day responsibilities at the company, which has struggled through layoffs and disappointing financial results even as Uber, its biggest rival, has strengthened.
The founders -- Logan Green, Lyft's chief executive, and John Zimmer, its president -- will stay on the company's board of directors, they said.
After starting Lyft in 2012, Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer, now both 39, were high-profile personalities in its early days. They presented Lyft as a friendly alternative to Uber and its aggressive chief executive, Travis Kalanick, and avoided many of the controversies that enveloped their competitor.
Vehicles driving for Lyft were easy to spot when the company started. They often had a fuzzy, pink mustache stuck to their front grille, and Lyft passengers for a time were even encouraged to sit in the front with the driver.
But Lyft, like many other gig companies, has been unable to turn a profit despite years of fast growth, and recently has fallen further behind Uber in the ride-hailing business while failing to branch out into other areas, such as food delivery.
David Risher, the chief executive of a nonprofit called Worldreader and a member of Lyft's board, will replace Mr. Green as chief executive. Mr. Green's last day will be April 17, and he will become the chairman of the board. Mr. Zimmer will depart his current role at the end of June and become vice chair, the company said.
"As I pass the baton to David, I want to share this: We continue to have an incredible opportunity to push the boundaries on how transportation can help connect people and build a better future," Mr. Green said in a blog post.
Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer bonded over their interest in improving transportation and reducing traffic through ride-hailing services. Though the business was far smaller than Uber, they saw promise in 2017 when a campaign to delete the Uber app took off and drove interest in Lyft.
But critics have said they squandered their brief advantage, making bets that lacked ambition, like on small businesses such as scooters and bicycles.
Lyft's business has been slow to rebound from the lockdowns of the early days of pandemic, as driver supply problems have caused high prices and long waits for passengers. Lyft's stock price has dropped below $ 10, down from about $ 40 a year ago and close to $ 80 at its peak.
News of the resignations, which was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal, sent the company's stock price surging in after-hours trading.
Mr. Risher, 57, was a general manager at Microsoft and a vice president at Amazon in the 1990s before founding Worldreader, which helps children get access to digital books.
"John and Logan came up with this incredible idea that really did define an entire sector years ago," he said in an interview on Monday. "And like many, many entrepreneurs, they along the way got a bunch right, and then they did some experiments that probably didn't work out in the way they expected. Then the pandemic hit, and that kind of shuffled the deck again."
The search for a new leader began late last year when Mr. Green told the board that he was considering stepping down, Mr. Risher said. Though Lyft may be an underdog to Uber, he said his company could appeal differently to customers.
"When I look at the 800-pound gorilla, I see a company that I think is very business-model driven. But we're going to be customer driven," Mr. Risher said.
Early in the pandemic, Lyft and Uber were on nearly equal footing: The vast majority of their businesses had to shut down, and they laid off many of their employees.
But Uber, which has a global presence that Lyft lacks, bounced back more quickly, partly because its worldwide availability and food delivery business kept drivers on its platform and blunted the impact of the pandemic, analysts and former employees have said.
Uber also invested more in financial incentives to persuade drivers to return to the platform after the pandemic ebbed, while Lyft did not initially have enough drivers to meet resurgent rider demand.
In November, Lyft laid off 13 percent of its employees. Then, in February, it spooked investors when its financial projections for the year fell below their expectations, sending its stock price tumbling. Lyft said at the time that it needed to lower prices to be more competitive.
Lyft did report record revenue of $ 1.2 billion in its most recent quarter -- as well as $ 588 million in losses.
Uber, on the other hand, reported $ 8.6 billion in revenue and told investors that it expected to achieve operating income profitability at some point this year, which indicated that its business was strengthening.
Tom White, a senior research analyst with the financial firm D.A. Davidson, said he considered the leadership change a "potential modest positive."
A new leader, he said in an email, "could signal increased willingness to broaden Lyft's strategic aperture a bit as it relates to other possible adjacent products (delivery?), partners or ways to create value."

Twitter Says Source Code Was Leaked on the Internet: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The leak adds to the challenges facing the Elon Musk-owned company, which is trying to identify the person responsible and any other people who downloaded the code.
Parts of Twitter's source code, the underlying computer code on which the social network runs, were leaked online, according to a legal filing, a rare and major exposure of intellectual property as the company struggles to reduce technical issues and reverse its business fortunes under Elon Musk.
Twitter moved on Friday to have the leaked code taken down by sending a copyright infringement notice to GitHub, an online collaboration platform for software developers where the code was posted, according to the filing. GitHub complied and took down the code that day. It was unclear how long the leaked code had been online, but it appeared to have been public for at least several months.
Twitter also asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to order GitHub to identify the person who shared the code and any other individuals who downloaded it, according to the filing.
Twitter began an investigation into the leak and executives handling the matter have surmised that whoever was responsible left the San Francisco-based company last year, two people briefed on the internal investigation said. Since Mr. Musk bought Twitter in October for $ 44 billion, about 75 percent of the company's 7,500 employees have been laid off or resigned.
The executives were only recently made aware of the source code leak, the people briefed on the internal investigation said. One concern is that the code includes security vulnerabilities that could give hackers or other motivated parties the means to extract user data or take down the site, they said.
The exposed source code adds to the challenges facing Mr. Musk's Twitter. Technology companies often view such code as a closely held secret and do not share it for fear that it could give competitors an unfair advantage or reveal security vulnerabilities.
But even as tech companies strive to protect their code bases, they have become ripe targets for opportunists, hackers and others. Last year, a hacking group successfully stole source code from Microsoft and other major companies. And in 2020, Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer of self-driving cars, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for stealing code from Google as he prepared to start a new job. (Mr. Levandowski was later pardoned by then-President Donald J. Trump.)
The public posting of Twitter's code is "concerning," said Brett Callow, a threat analyst at Emsisoft, a cybersecurity software company. "It does make it a little bit easier and speedier to probe for vulnerabilities."
For Twitter, the leak also comes on top of mounting structural and financial challenges. Mr. Musk has been trying to turn around the social network over the past few months by slashing costs, trying out new features and welcoming back previously banned users. But outages of the service have increased, while advertisers -- the main source of revenue for the company -- have been skittish about running ads on the site.
The turmoil has caused financial damage. On Friday, Mr. Musk told employees in an email that Twitter was worth roughly $ 20 billion, down more than 50 percent from what he paid for it. He said "radical changes" at the company, including mass layoffs and cost cutting, were necessary to avoid bankruptcy and streamline operations.
"Twitter is being reshaped rapidly," Mr. Musk wrote in the email seen by The New York Times. He added that the company could be thought of as "an inverse start-up" and that he believed Twitter could someday be worth $ 250 billion.
Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment about Twitter's leaked code. GitHub declined to comment on the decision to remove the code, but posted Twitter's takedown request on its website.
The leak comes as Mr. Musk has promised to make some of Twitter's code public. This month, the billionaire said he would make the code that Twitter uses to recommend tweets publicly available by the end of March, so that it could be reviewed by anyone and scrutinized for possible flaws. The process could help Twitter's code become more secure, as people identified and reported problems with it.
At the same time, Mr. Musk has worried about the possibility of leaks and theft by disgruntled former employees during his mass layoffs. In November, he locked Twitter's offices and asked employees not to come in while cuts were being made. Over the last few months, Twitter has also prevented engineers from making changes to the site's code ahead of layoffs for fear that someone would sabotage the platform on the way out the door.
"One of the best ways to mitigate insider risk is to keep your employees happy and that certainly hasn't been the case at Twitter," Mr. Callow said.
The person who leaked Twitter's source code appeared to go by the name "FreeSpeechEnthusiast" on GitHub, according to Twitter's legal filing. The user's pseudonym appears to be a reference to Mr. Musk, who has referred to himself as a "free speech absolutist."
The GitHub profile for the anonymous user shows a single contribution to the platform in early January. The profile remains online.

Apple's Newest Product Is Nearly Here. Some Employees Are Far From Excited.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company is expected to unveil an augmented reality headset in a few months. Some employees wonder if the device makes sense for Apple.
When Apple held a corporate retreat in California's Carmel Valley about five years ago to discuss its next major product, Jony Ive, its longtime design chief, captivated a room of the company's 100 top executives with a concept video as polished as an Apple commercial.
The video showed a man in a London taxi donning an augmented reality headset and calling his wife in San Francisco. "Would you like to come to London?" he asked, two people who saw the video said. Soon, the couple were sharing the sights of London through the husband's eyes.
The video excited executives about the possibilities of Apple's next business-altering device: a headset that would blend the digital world with the real one.
But now, as the company prepares to introduce the headset in June, enthusiasm at Apple has given way to skepticism, said eight current and former employees, who requested anonymity because of Apple's policies against speaking about future products. There are concerns about the device's roughly $ 3,000 price, doubts about its utility and worries about its unproven market.
That dissension has been a surprising change inside a company where employees have built devices -- from the iPod to the Apple Watch -- with the single-mindedness of a moon mission.
Some employees have defected from the project because of their doubts about its potential, three people with knowledge of the moves said. Others have been fired over the lack of progress with some aspects of the headset, including its use of Apple's Siri voice assistant, one person said.
Even leaders at Apple have questioned the product's prospects. It has been developed at a time when morale has been strained by a wave of departures from the company's design team, including Mr. Ive, who left Apple in 2019 and stopped advising the company last year.
An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's plans for future products.
Apple's headset is considered a bellwether for virtual and augmented reality. For more than a decade, tech leaders have been hyping it as the next wave of computing after the smartphone. Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, told university students last year that in the near future "you'll wonder how you lived your life without augmented reality, just like today you wonder: How did people like me grow up without the internet?"
But the road to deliver augmented reality has been littered with failures, false starts and disappointments, from Google Glass to Magic Leap and from Microsoft's HoloLens to Meta's Quest Pro. Apple is considered a potential savior because of its success combining new hardware and software to create revolutionary devices. Still, the challenges are daunting.
Meta, Facebook's parent company, has plowed billions of dollars into trying to build a virtual reality business. The experience has been humbling. It has sold about 20 million of its $ 400 Quest 2 headsets since 2020 and recently cut the price of the Quest Pro, its premium device, to $ 1,000 from $ 1,500 amid lackluster sales.
By comparison, Apple sells more than 200 million iPhones annually with an average selling price of more than $ 800.
Unlike the iPhone, which incorporated many existing technologies, virtual reality is requiring Apple and others to design new chips and wearable displays, said Matthew Ball, author of "The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything." "The difficulty of the problem has been far greater than anyone expected," he added.
Uncertainty about the potential of Apple's project has led some people who have worked on it to speculate that the company could delay its release, especially in light of the shaky economy, these people said. The company has postponed other new products in the past, including AirTags, the coin-size location tracking devices, which Apple withheld for more than a year as it addressed privacy issues. But at this point, headset manufacturing is underway for a planned reveal in June, the people said.
Apple is projected to ship fewer than 500,000 headsets in a year, according to Counterpoint Research, a market research firm. By comparison, the company was expected to ship about 40 million Apple Watches after its debut. The modest expectations for the headset speak to the challenges in a category where sales declined 12 percent last year to $ 1.1 billion, according to NPD Group, a market research firm.
Seeking to define a nascent market is an aberration for Apple.
"Apple is always pretty good at coming into a market when the market is already established and changing that market," said Carolina Milanesi, a consumer tech analyst for the research firm Creative Strategies. "This is not the case for Apple VR and XR. There's still a lot of learning."
Some internal skeptics have questioned if the new device is a solution in search of a problem. Unlike the iPod, which put digital songs in people's pockets, and the iPhone, which combined the abilities of a music player and a phone, the headset hasn't been driven by the same clarity, these people said.
The product is being birthed during a period of limbo. This year, Mr. Ive's successor overseeing industrial design, Evans Hankey, departed. With design's leadership in flux, Mike Rockwell, an engineer, has been leading development of the device.
The headset looks like ski goggles. It features a carbon fiber frame, a hip pack with battery support, outward cameras to capture the real world and two 4K displays that can render everything from applications to movies, two of the people said. Users can turn a "reality dial" on the device to increase or decrease real-time video from the world around them.
The New York Times has previously reported on some features, as have Bloomberg and The Information.
The headset is expected to cost about $ 3,000, three of the people said. And it is considered a bridge to a future product, such as augmented reality glasses, that would have broader appeal but require technical breakthroughs.
Because the headset won't fit over glasses, the company has plans to sell prescription lenses for the displays to people who don't wear contacts, a person familiar with the plan said.
During the device's development, Apple has focused on making it excel for videoconferencing and spending time with others as avatars in a virtual world. The company has called the device's signature application "copresence," a word designed to capture the experience of sharing a real or virtual space with someone in another place. It is akin to what Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, calls the "metaverse."
The device will double as a tool for artists, designers and engineers, tracking them as they draw freely in space in image-editing applications and tracking hand gestures for the editing of virtual reality films. Lastly, it will function as a high-resolution TV with custom-made video content from Hollywood filmmakers such as Jon Favreau, the director of "Iron Man."
Apple is expected to pitch its device as something different from those that Meta has introduced. During an interview last year with the Dutch publication Bright, Mr. Cook said he avoided using the term "metaverse" because it was foreign to the average person.
The headset's price and applications suggest that it will appeal more to businesses such as design firms than to many of the one billion iPhone owners. Apple has enriched itself by selling expensive smartphones but always balanced price with utility.
Mr. Ball, the author of "The Metaverse," compared the company's strategy with this device to Tesla's strategy with the Roadster, its initial $ 100,000 electric vehicle. Eventually, Tesla followed it with lower-priced cars with broader appeal.
Ms. Milanesi said Apple's experimental approach with the goggles appeared to be more like its execution of the Apple Watch than its introduction of the iPhone. Apple initially portrayed the watch as a miniature extension of an iPhone. After learning what consumers were doing with the watch, the company marketed it more as a fitness accessory akin to a Fitbit.
"It's not very Apple-like," Ms. Milanesi said. "But Apple is a very, very different company."

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Parts of Twitter’s source code, the underlying computer code on which the social network runs, were leaked online, according to a legal filing, a rare and major exposure of intellectual property as the company struggles to reduce technical issues and reverse its business fortunes under Elon Musk.
Twitter moved Friday to have the leaked code taken down by sending a copyright infringement notice to GitHub, an online collaboration platform for software developers where the code was posted, according to the filing. GitHub complied and took down the code that day. It was unclear how long the leaked code had been online, but it appeared to have been public for at least several months.
Twitter also asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to order GitHub to identify the person who shared the code and any other individuals who downloaded it, according to the filing.
Twitter launched an investigation into the leak and executives handling the matter have surmised that whoever was responsible left the San Francisco-based company last year, two people briefed on the internal investigation said. Since Musk bought Twitter in October for $44 billion, about 75% of the company’s 7,500 employees have been laid off or resigned.
Executives were only recently made aware of the source code leak, people briefed on the internal investigation said. One concern is that the code includes security vulnerabilities that could give hackers or other motivated parties the means to extract user data or take down the site, they said.
The exposed source code adds to the challenges facing Musk’s Twitter. Technology companies often view such code as a closely held secret and do not share it for fear that it could give competitors an unfair advantage or reveal security vulnerabilities.
But even as tech companies strive to protect their code bases, they have become ripe targets for opportunists, hackers and others. Last year, a hacking group successfully stole source code from Microsoft and other major companies. And in 2020, Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer of self-driving cars, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for stealing code from Google as he prepared to start a new job. (Levandowski was later pardoned by then-President Donald Trump.)
The public posting of Twitter’s code is “concerning,” said Brett Callow, a threat analyst at Emsisoft, a cybersecurity software company. “It does make it a little bit easier and speedier to probe for vulnerabilities.”
For Twitter, the leak also comes on top of mounting structural and financial challenges. Musk has been trying to turn around the social network over the past few months by slashing costs, trying out new features and welcoming back previously banned users. But outages of the service have increased, while advertisers — the main source of revenue for the company — have been skittish about running ads on the site.
The turmoil has caused financial damage. On Friday, Musk told employees in an email that Twitter was worth roughly $20 billion, down more than 50% from what he paid for it. He said “radical changes” at the company, including mass layoffs and cost cutting, were necessary to avoid bankruptcy and streamline operations.
“Twitter is being reshaped rapidly,” Musk wrote in the email seen by The New York Times. He added that the company could be thought of as “an inverse startup” and that he believed Twitter could someday be worth $250 billion.
Musk did not respond to a request for comment about Twitter’s leaked code. GitHub declined to comment on the decision to remove the code, but posted Twitter’s takedown request on its website.
The leak comes as Musk has promised to make some of Twitter’s code public. This month, the billionaire said that he would make the code that Twitter uses to recommend tweets publicly available by the end of March, so that it could be reviewed by anyone and scrutinized for possible flaws. The process could help Twitter’s code become more secure, as people identified and reported problems with it.
At the same time, Musk has worried about the possibility of leaks and theft by disgruntled former employees during his mass layoffs. In November, he locked Twitter’s offices and asked employees not to come in while cuts were being made. Over the past few months, Twitter has also prevented engineers from making changes to the site’s code ahead of layoffs for fear that someone would sabotage the platform on the way out the door.
“One of the best ways to mitigate insider risk is to keep your employees happy and that certainly hasn’t been the case at Twitter,” Callow said.
The person who leaked Twitter’s source code appeared to go by the name “FreeSpeechEnthusiast” on GitHub, according to Twitter’s legal filing. The user’s pseudonym appears to reference Musk, who has referred to himself as a “free speech absolutist.”
The GitHub profile for the anonymous user shows a single contribution to the platform in early January. The profile remains online.

We Need to Talk. But First I'll Consult a Chat Bot.: [Style Desk]

Full text: Faced with challenging situations in parenting, romance or work, some are getting by with a little help from their A.I. friends.
Todd Mitchem kept struggling to have honest, productive conversations with his son. "He's 15," Mr. Mitchem, 52, said with a laugh. "Teenagers are so difficult to connect with."
Every time he tried to bring up a sensitive issue, his son would give vague answers or run away, preferring to avoid serious talks altogether.
In the past when Mr. Mitchem needed parenting help, he would read a book or pose a question to the men's support group he meets with weekly.
But recently he has turned to ChatGPT. And he's not alone: Others are turning to artificial intelligence chat bots to figure out what to say in situations that feel high-stakes. They are using the tool to talk or read to their children, to approach bosses, to provide difficult feedback, to write wedding vows or to pen love letters.
Unlike turning to friends or even professionals for help, the bot, said Mr. Mitchem, gives what feels like objective advice. "The bot is giving me responses based on analysis and data, not human emotions," he said.
ChatGPT, the new virtual tool powered by Open AI, sources its information from a wide range of online material including books, news articles, scientific journals, websites and even message boards, allowing users to have humanlike conversions with a chat bot.
"It's giving you what the collective hive mind on the internet would say," said Irina Raicu, who directs the internet ethics program at Santa Clara University. (Other companies including Google and Microsoft have their own versions of this technology, and Microsoft's, called Bing A.I., was recently made famous for aggressively declaring its love to the New York Times journalist Kevin Roose.)
Mr. Mitchem, who lives in Denver and is the executive vice president of learning and product for a leadership training company, opened his conversation by typing, in summary: "I need some friendly advice."
"OK, no problem," ChatGPT responded, according to Mr. Mitchem. "What is your name?"
In the course of their conversation, ChatGPT told Mr. Mitchem that he is a good father for even wondering how to approach a conversation with his son about the decision to join a basketball team. "It said something like, 'It's cool if you don't get it right, but it's awesome that you are trying."
Mr. Mitchem said the bot then continued: "Teenage boys, when they are growing up, are trying to force their independence. Remember when you talk to him, he needs to know that you trust your decisions."
The next day Mr. Mitchem approached his son and tried out the advice. "I said to him, 'You need to make this decision, you are 14, and I trust you will make a good one," Mr. Mitchem said. "My son goes, 'Wow, that's awesome. I'll let you know what I decide."'
"We left on a positive note," Mr. Mitchem said. "It totally worked." Once Upon a Time ...
For Naif Alanazi, a 35-year-old Ph.D. student at Kent State University, bedtime is a sacred ritual for him and his 4-year-old daughter, Yasmeen. "I have to work all day," he said. "This is our special time."
His Saudi Arabian family has a deep tradition of telling oral stories. Wanting to continue it, he used to try to concoct new, thrilling tales each evening. "Do you know how difficult it is to come up with something new every day?" he asked, laughing.
Now, however, he lets the bot do the work.
Every night he asks ChatGPT to create a story that involves people (his daughter's teacher, for instance) and places (school, the park) from her day, along with a cliffhanger at the end so he continue the story the next night. "Sometimes I ask it to add a value she needs to learn like honesty or being kind to others," he said.
"Being able to give her something that is more than a generic story, something that can increase our bond and show her that I am interested in her daily life," he said, "it makes me feel so much closer to her."
Love Languages
Anifa Musengimana, 25, who is in graduate school for international marketing in London, is certain that chat bots can help make the tedium of online dating more interesting. "I am having a lot of repetitive conversations on these apps," she said. "The app can give me fun ideas of what to talk about, and maybe I'll find better people to date."
"If I get intriguing answers, I will be drawn in," she said.
She said she would tell her match she was using the tool. "I would want a guy who finds it funny," she said. "I wouldn't want a guy who is so serious that he gets mad at me for doing it."
Some are using chat bots to enhance the relationships they already have.
James Gregson, 40, a creative director who lives in Avon, Conn., has been using ChatGPT to draft love letters to his wife.
"I am not a poet, I am not a songwriter, but I can take topics on things my wife might like and put it into a song or poem," he said.
He also believes in full disclosure: "I am going to give her one, but I am going to tell her who wrote it," he said. "I am not trying to con her." Office Applications
Jessica Massey, 29, a finance analyst at Cisco Systems, who lives in Buffalo, has been writing draft emails to her boss using ChatGPT. "I wanted to test out its capabilities to see if there was a different way A.I. would word what I was thinking in my head," she wrote in an email. (One person interviewed confessed to consulting ChatGPT to help prepare for their interview for this story. Another admitted to using it for employee reviews.)
Ms. Massey used the bot to write an email to her boss explaining why the company should pay for a certain professional certification. The bot gave her pretty boilerplate language, she said. She hasn't sent it yet, but plans to once she changes "the verbiage a bit to make it sound more like me."
Ms. Massey, however, has a rule about relying on a chat bot: "Disclose it at the end of your work or not use it at all."
However, scholars who study technology and ethics have mixed feelings about using ChatGPT for highly personal communication.
"We shouldn't automatically reject tools that might help people deal with a difficult conversation," said Michael Zimmer, the director of the Center for Data, Ethics and Society at Marquette University. He equates it to buying a Hallmark Card for a birthday or anniversary. "We've all accepted doing that because the words on the card align with something I believe," he said. However, Ms. Raicu, from Santa Clara University, worries about people using ChatGPT for personal communication. She doesn't like the idea that there is a "right" and "wrong" way to communicate. "I think the right words depend on who the people are who are communicating and the context," she said. "There is no formula for a lot of this stuff."
Ms. Raicu said that using ChatGPT for personal communication may undermine trust: "People might ask, 'Do I really know who I am talking to?"'

Golf at 3 p.m. Tuesday? It's the Afternoon Fun Economy.: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Remote workers have fueled a surge in weekday exercise, cosmetics and leisure -- especially at the driving range.
At the Chelsea Piers outdoor golf club, on a recent unseasonably warm Monday afternoon, 55 people were playing golf by 3:45, and a handful were sipping beers. At CutLoose hair salon, in Brooklyn, N.Y., the stylists now watch their clients take Zoom meetings from the salon chairs. And at Skyway Golf Course, in Jersey City, N.J., Steve Mills, a general manager, has noticed that weekday afternoons are jammed with a new group of golfers.
"We call them the remote guys," Mr. Mills, 48, said. "These were guys we used to see running to the golf course after work. Now they're able to come out leisurely and get their golf done, instead of changing in the parking lot."
The leisure industry is facing a surge in demand for afternoon services, especially in fitness and cosmetics. It's the rise of the "afternoon fun" economy.
Millions of Americans who started working from home three years ago because of the Covid-19 pandemic are now set in those remote routines because they like the flexibility. At the start of 2023, more than a quarter of paid full-time work days were done from home, according to data from Stanford on U.S. workers. Roughly half of workers who can do their jobs remotely are now in hybrid arrangements. That means people who used to have to use their lunch hour, or wait until after work, to squeeze in a workout or beauty treatments can now extend their leisure time into the afternoon, and tack on extra hours of work after dark.
A new study from Stanford shines a light on the rise of afternoon leisure. Using geolocation data near golf courses in the United States, the study found there was 278 percent more people playing golf at 4 p.m. on a Wednesday in August 2022 than in August 2019. And there were 83 percent more golf games being played on a weekday in August 2022 than in August 2019, according to the researchers, Nick Bloom and Alex Finan, who studied data, from the company Inrix, at more than 3,400 golf courses.
"We're turned into a student economy," Mr. Bloom said. "You're in the library in the evenings, and in the afternoon you're sleeping off your hangover."
The rise of afternoon leisure could be playing an under-examined role in driving America's economic rebound since 2020, Mr. Bloom said. Historically, productivity in the manufacturing sector has grown at a faster rate than productivity in the services sector. Service sector productivity tends to grow slowly even as its wages rise quickly to keep pace with other industries. That's because the amount of time people can devote to services -- shopping, entertainment, beauty treatments -- has long been constrained by the rigidity of a nine-to-five grind.
Remote work partly did away with that constraint. More flexible work arrangements mean workers can decide to push back their professional responsibilities into the evening and take care of personal ones during the day -- often with the blessing of their bosses.
"This is an amazing potential reversal," Mr. Bloom added. "You can have a huge increase in productivity using leisure resources throughout the week. It's an odd unexpected boost from post-pandemic working from home."
The effects of this shift are being felt across the leisure economy. ClassPass, a platform that partners with thousands of fitness and beauty studios, found that the most popular time for people to schedule a salon or spa treatment last year was noon; in 2019, it was 6 p.m. The Chelsea Piers golf club, which had its busiest year ever in 2022, increased the fee for its off-peak membership (for people playing golf at traditionally less popular weekday hours) to $ 1,825 last year from $ 1,520 because of rising demand. Bouldering Project, which has 10 rock-climbing gyms in seven U.S. cities, said some of its buildings were full throughout the week with remote workers doing workouts in between their video calls. Y7, a yoga chain, has tracked a surge in sign ups for its 10:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekday classes.
"We used to get a lot more people leaving early from class in the morning -- they wouldn't stay for Shavasana," Sarah Larson Levey, chief executive of Y7, said, referring to the final resting portion of a yoga class. "Literally right after the slow burn portion, before any restorative poses, half the room would leave."
With more people now working remote, that exodus no longer occurs. "I took a 10:30 on Wednesday last week, and every single person stayed," Ms. Larson Levey said. "I think 4 p.m. is going to be the new 7 p.m. when it comes to workouts."
Joel Moore, owner of a golf club called The Ridge in New Jersey, found himself busier than ever in 2021. At one point, he and his wife looked at each other and realized what was driving their foot traffic: remote workers.
"We didn't have a crystal ball to look into as we were budgeting for 2021 and 2022, and we were elated," he said. "We're seeing people during the week that we never saw before."
There used to be a sizable portion of members whom Mr. Moore saw only on weekends, or occasionally on summer evenings when they came from the office and rushed into the locker room to change from dress shirts and blazers into polo shirts. Now many of his members, who include lawyers and pharmaceutical executives, wake up early in the morning to race through meetings so they can get to the golf course by lunch time.
"They're not sneaking away," he added. "They're getting the work done, just not at your typical hours."
Some golf course managers also noted that remote work had coincided with a push in the golfing world for shorter games. "Maybe people have a little bit more time, the interest is there and we're able to morph the game a little bit to meet people's schedules," said Marshall Ormand, who manages a municipal golf course in Charleston, S.C.
Of course, many remote workers have reconfigured the shape of their workdays for the opposite of leisure: child care. People are working 28 percent more after the traditional 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. hours, according to a report from Microsoft. For many working mothers, remote work didn't initially bring any time for leisure. Mothers were more likely than fathers to be interrupted by family responsibilities while working from home, according to at least one study, a particular source of stress when schools were shut down because of Covid.
But now that schools are open, some workers are welcoming the opportunity to tackle errands during the weekday. Some of this extension of economic leisure is above board, as managers accept that people are rethinking their schedules.
Stephanie Cunningham, 27, who works in marketing, was sitting in CutLoose, the Brooklyn hair salon, waiting for an appointment on a Thursday afternoon. She said her boss has been supportive when she had to sign on earlier in the morning or later in the evening to get work done so that she could take a break to run errands, including grocery shopping and walking her dog.
"My boss allows me to take time for myself," Ms. Cunningham said. "As long as I get my work done."
Celiann Figueroa, 25, a stylist at CutLoose, said her weekdays were far busier than they were before the pandemic. She used to spend afternoons, at a different Brooklyn salon, waiting for her harried customers to leave the office. Now her noon to 4 p.m. slot is consistently full. Her daily appointment numbers have more than doubled.
Partly that's because her clients are treating the salon like an office. "I've had a client sit outside with foils in her hair hosting a Zoom meeting," she said, adding that she often has to adjust the position of people's heads so they can look at their laptops while she styles their hair. "It's funny seeing people sit up and try to be professional."
And for some people straddling office and leisure, there's a delight in the fusion. Tyler Kevorkian, the assistant general manager of Bouldering Project in Washington, D.C., said he had seen one person help run a gelato company from his gym. He has also seen government employees and lawyers writing memos steps away from the rock climbing walls.
"People just make this their office," he said. "Sometimes when you're working, you get antsy and anxious. You can go downstairs, do some pull-ups, sweat it out and then jump right back into a meeting."
But plenty of business leaders are wary about this leisure-time expansion. In recent months, concerns about employee engagement have crept into executive commentary on remote work.
Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, which allowed many of its employees to work fully remote, voiced anxiety earlier this year about the effects of that decision: "We don't have the same level of performance and productivity that we had in 2020 before the pandemic," Mr. Benioff said.
At Amazon, Andy Jassy has been similarly emphatic about the benefits of in-person work: "When you're in-person, people tend to be more engaged," he wrote in a memo to employees last month. And at Jefferies, its chief executive, Rich Handler, and its president, Brian Friedman, sent a memo in the fall underscoring that they expected to see people in person: "It is abundantly clear that we need to be together as much as possible."
But these executives are facing a work force newly emboldened by the balance they've achieved between their work and personal life, whether that means family obligations or playing golf. Take Wade McDaniel, a vice president at Gartner, who is one of the golfers embracing the benefits of the afternoon fun economy. Mr. McDaniel, 62, said he was a different version of himself before remote work.
"I would have been defined as a classic workaholic -- that showed up in poor health, poor relationship management," he said.
Now, Mr. McDaniel starts work at 5 a.m. and gets to his local golf course in Phoenix by 3 p.m. "Unless there's something that is semi critical going on, I don't take my work phone with me," he said. "The only reason I use my phone is for the golf app."

Full text: What's Up? (March 19-25)
Lawmakers Grill a Tech Executive
Shou Chew, the chief executive of TikTok, did not meet a warm reception when he appeared before lawmakers in Congress for the first time last week. During more than five hours of testimony, Mr. Shou was barraged with questions about TikTok's effects on teenagers' mental health, limits to onscreen time, the relationship between the app and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and how it treats the data of its American users. The questions came from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, an indication of how the viral social app had become part of the larger battle between the United States and China over technological and economic supremacy. Mr. Chew tried to convince lawmakers of TikTok's distance from China's government, at times by emphasizing his own biography: Mr. Chew lives in Singapore and attended business school in the United States. He also stated that ByteDance was a private company "not owned or controlled by the Chinese government." But he failed to reassure lawmakers. "Your platform should be banned," one House Republican told him.
Banks on Edge
Banks continued to find themselves on shaky ground last week after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank earlier this month touched off panic among customers and investors about the health of the country's midsize banking institutions. On Monday, shares of First Republic fell 47 percent, suggesting that a recent $ 30 million cash infusion -- a joint effort by a group of the country's largest banks to rescue First Republic -- had largely failed to persuade investors to stick by the bank. (Trading was halted 11 times that day to prevent a free fall.) But First Republic is far from the only bank with worries. Banks are seeking funds from the Federal Reserve's loan program to ensure they have cash on hand to make it through the hard times that may lie ahead.
Rates Rise Again
The Federal Reserve lifted its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point on Wednesday, the second consecutive increase of that size, amid a banking crisis spurred in part by the Fed's sustained campaign of raising rates. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said that officials had "considered" pausing interest rate increases because of the turmoil but that recent economic data made the case for the central bank to continue on its path of increasing rates to fight inflation. Mr. Powell emphasized repeatedly at a news conference last week that inflation was surprisingly stubborn, but officials forecast that inflation would slow to 3.3 percent by the end of the year, down from 5.4 percent in the last reading.
What's Next? (March 26-April 1)
The A.I. Race Is On
The race to develop artificial intelligence that can be competitive with ChatGPT, the software that now powers Microsoft's search engine, has only just begun. Last week, Google released a chatbot called Bard, which it introduced as a stand-alone webpage rather than a component of its search engine, a move that probably reflects the company's reluctance to tinker with its flagship product. Google is also being broadly cautious about how it brings A.I. to users after the sometimes disturbing answers Microsoft's chatbot gave to users' questions. Still, Google plans to introduce more than 20 A.I. products and features. The field is liable to get much more crowded: Two former Google employees recently raised $ 1 billion for their own A.I. company. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is trying to up its game with newer technology called GPT-4. And conservatives are vying to build chatbots that reflect their views.
A New Inflation Reading
On Friday, the Commerce Department will release the latest reading from the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge and the one that central bankers use to determine if they've hit their 2 percent inflation target. Inflation had been on a downward trajectory for several months until January, when it unexpectedly accelerated again to 5.4 percent, from 5.3 in December. Even if that number ticks back down, this week's report is likely to illustrate that the Fed is far from its goals, particularly when considered alongside recent strong jobs reports and other data that suggest the economy is not cooling as much as expected.
A Looming Strike in Hollywood
Television and movie writers are creeping toward a potential strike, as Hollywood studios bristle at writers' accusations that their working conditions have worsened and argue that their demands for increased pay are at odds with economic realities. The two sides -- the Writers Guild of America, a union representing more than 11,000 entertainment writers on the East and West coasts, and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of Hollywood's nine largest studios -- began talks last week, but a vote to authorize a strike could occur as soon as the first week of April. A work stoppage among writers would first affect late-night television, like "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" or, if a strike were to last several weeks, "Saturday Night Live."
What Else?
In a pair of lawsuits filed on Monday, a Fox News producer accused Fox lawyers of coercing her into giving misleading testimony in Dominion Voting Systems' defamation case to set her up. The Bank of England also raised its benchmark rate by a quarter-point last week. And wild swings last week in the market for government bonds sent an ominous signal about the economic outlook.

Another Roller-Coaster Day for Market: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Stocks rose Thursday, but only after another dizzying day for Wall Street where a big show of strength from the morning vanished and worries rose about the banking industry.
The S&P 500 added 0.3 percent for its third gain in four days, but it had been on track for a much healthier gain of 1.8 percent in the morning. The Dow Jones industrial average saw a solid early gain disappear, and it likewise dipped to a brief loss before closing with a rise of 0.2 percent. Strength for technology stocks helped the Nasdaq composite hold up better than the rest of the market, and it added 1 percent.
Two big questions have been causing big swings for Wall Street this month, and investors still don't have a final answer for either. On one, investors are worried about whether more banks will suffer a debilitating exodus of customers following the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history. On the other, all the turmoil is clouding the outlook for what the Federal Reserve will do with interest rates after hiking them to market-rattling heights over the last year.
"Until these two clouds get resolved, it's hard to see the market making any sustained headway," said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management.
A day earlier, stocks fell sharply after the Federal Reserve indicated that while the end may be near for its interest rate increases, it still did not expect to cut rates this year. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, also insisted the Fed could keep raising rates if inflation stayed high.
Traders on Thursday nevertheless were still largely betting the Fed will cut rates later this year. Such cuts can act like steroids for markets, juicing prices for stocks, bonds and other investments. They would relax the pressure on the banking industry and economy, but they could also give inflation more fuel.
Big technology and other high-growth stocks that tend to benefit the most from lower rates were among the strongest on Wall Street. Nvidia rose 2.7 percent, and Microsoft gained 2 percent.
Markets were also still weighing comments from Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen that may have helped drag down bank stocks on Tuesday.
She said the government was not considering blanket protections for all customers at all banks. That may have disappointed some investors hoping for a more comprehensive solution. But Ms. Yellen did say the government will make all depositors whole at banks on a case-by-case basis, when failing to do so would mean risk for the broader system.
Implicit in that is perhaps the hint that any bank failure could be seen as such a systemic risk. Failures at both Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank met that criteria. Depositors were promised all their money, even those with more than the $ 250,000 limit insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Still, investors likely need to hear something more concrete to be sure, said Mr. Ma.
"The reality is that until there's a belief that, at least in the near term, all deposits are protected, the economy remains at much greater risk than it needs to be," he said
"If any other prominent midsize banks go under and the deposits are not guaranteed, then all hell breaks loose," he said.
Stocks in the financial industry ended up being the heaviest weight on the S&P 500 despite rising in the morning. First Republic Bank, which has been at the center of investors' cross hairs the last couple weeks, fell 6 percent after giving up a gain of nearly 10 percent.
Shares of Coinbase Global fell 14.1 percent after the cryptocurrency trading platform said it had been warned by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it could face charges of violating U.S. securities laws.

Turing Award to Co-Inventor Of Ethernet, Still Standard For Connecting Computers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: In the 1970s, Bob Metcalfe helped develop the primary technology that lets you send email or connect with a printer over an office network.
In June 1972, Bob Metcalfe, a 26-year-old engineer fresh out of graduate school, joined a new research lab in Palo Alto, Calif., as it set out to build something that few people could even imagine: a personal computer.
After another engineer gave up the job, Dr. Metcalfe was asked to build a technology that could connect the desktop machines across an office and send information between them. The result was Ethernet, a computer networking technology that would one day become an industry standard. For decades, it has connected PCs to servers, printers and the internet in corporate offices and homes across the globe.
For his work on Ethernet, the Association for Computing Machinery, the world's largest society of computing professionals, announced on Wednesday that Dr. Metcalfe, 76, would receive this year's Turing Award. Given since 1966 and often called the Nobel Prize of computing, the Turing Award comes with a $ 1 million prize.
When Dr. Metcalfe arrived at the Palo Alto Research Center -- a division of Xerox nicknamed PARC -- the first thing he did was connect the lab to the Arpanet, the wide-area network that later morphed into the modern internet. The Arpanet transmitted information among about 20 academic and corporate labs across the country.
But as PARC researchers designed their personal computer, called the Alto, they realized they needed a network technology that could connect personal computers and other devices within an office, not over long distances.
A graduate student, Charles Simonyi, began building a local-area network he called Signet, short for Simonyi's Infinitely Glorious Network. But he was soon moved to a different project. So Mr. Simonyi built a text editor, giving rise to modern word processors like Microsoft Word. And Dr. Metcalfe started work on a new network.
One afternoon in 1973, he was in the basement of the PARC lab, fiddling with a long strand of cable. As he struggled to send electrical pulses down the cable, another researcher offered to help.
The researcher was David Boggs, a doctoral student at nearby Stanford University who had recently joined the lab as an intern. Together, Dr. Metcalfe and Dr. Boggs, who died last year, designed what they would eventually call Ethernet.
"He was the perfect partner for me," Dr. Metcalfe said of Dr. Boggs after his death. "I was more of a concept artist, and he was a build-the-hardware-in-the-back-room engineer." Dr. Metcalfe called himself and his collaborator "the Bobbsey Twins" of computing networking.
Borrowing ideas from a radio-based network at the University of Hawaii, ALOHAnet, Dr. Metcalfe and Dr. Boggs designed Ethernet as a technology that could work both with wires and without. But the first network they built inside the PARC offices required cables.
"We wanted to make it wireless," Dr. Metcalfe said in an interview. "But we couldn't have zero wires. It would have been too slow and too expensive."
Over the next two decades, several technologies developed for the Alto project would become familiar parts of personal computing, including the graphical user interface and the laser printer as well as Ethernet and the word processor. In the 1980s and '90s, after Ethernet was codified as an industry standard, it became the primary protocol for building networks in corporate offices.
The technology was also used in homes. And in the late 1990s, it served as the basis for Wi-Fi, the wireless networking standard that is used in both offices and homes across the globe.
"Almost everything you do online goes through Ethernet at some stage," said Marc Weber, curator and director of the internet history program at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., in an interview. "You use it all the time."
In 1979, Dr. Metcalfe started a company, 3Com, that commercialized Ethernet, while Dr. Boggs remained at PARC as a researcher. Later, Dr. Boggs started his own Ethernet company, LAN Media. Both companies were eventually sold to larger outfits.
The Ethernet protocol changed in countless ways over the decades. Little of what Dr. Metcalfe and Dr. Boggs designed at PARC in the 1970s is still part of the technology. But the name -- Ethernet -- remains. In an industry with a long history of dull names, Ethernet has stood out for its memorability.
In the 19th century, "the ether" was believed to be a medium that permeated everything and transmitted waves of light across the universe. This theory was disproved around the turn of the last century, so the two PARC researchers took the name for their project.
"The word became free," Dr. Metcalfe said, "so we borrowed it."

Everything, Everywhere Will Change All at Once: [Op-Ed]

Full text: I had a most remarkable but unsettling experience last week. Craig Mundie, the former chief research and strategy officer for Microsoft, was giving me a demonstration of GPT-4, the most advanced version of the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI and launched in November. Craig was preparing to brief the board of my wife's museum, Planet Word, of which he is a member, about the effect ChatGPT will have on words, language and innovation.
"You need to understand," Craig warned me before he started his demo, "this is going to change everything about how we do everything. I think that it represents mankind's greatest invention to date. It is qualitatively different -- and it will be transformational."
Large language modules like ChatGPT will steadily increase in their capabilities, Craig added, and take us "toward a form of artificial general intelligence," delivering efficiencies in operations, ideas, discoveries and insights "that have never been attainable before across every domain."
Then he did a demonstration. And I realized Craig's words were an understatement.
First, he asked GPT-4 -- for which Craig was a selected advanced tester and which was just released to the public -- to summarize Planet Word and its mission in 400 words. It did so perfectly -- in a few seconds.
Then he asked it to do the same in 200 words. Another few seconds.
Then he asked it to do the same in Arabic. Just as quickly. Then in Mandarin. Two more seconds. Then in English again -- but in the form of a Shakespearean sonnet. A few more seconds.
Then Craig asked GPT-4 to write the same description in an abecedarian verse -- where the first line begins with the letter A, the second with B and so on through the alphabet. It did it with stunning creativity, beginning:
Alluring in Washington, is a museum so grand,
Built to teach, inspire, and help us understand.
Curious minds Planet flock to Word's embrace,
Delving into language and its intricate grace
Every exhibit here has a story to tell,
From the origins of speech to the art of the quill.
And so on, through Z.
I could barely sleep that night. To observe an A.I. system -- its software, microchips and connectivity -- produce that level of originality in multiple languages in just seconds each time, well, the first thing that came to mind was the observation by the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
The second thing that came to mind was a moment at the start of "The Wizard of Oz" -- the tornado scene where everything and everyone are lifted into a swirling gyre, including Dorothy and Toto, and then swept away from mundane, black and white Kansas to the gleaming futuristic Land of Oz, where everything is in color.
We are about to be hit by such a tornado. This is a Promethean moment we've entered -- one of those moments in history when certain new tools, ways of thinking or energy sources are introduced that are such a departure and advance on what existed before that you can't just change one thing, you have to change everything. That is, how you create, how you compete, how you collaborate, how you work, how you learn, how you govern and, yes, how you cheat, commit crimes and fight wars.
We know the key Promethean eras of the last 600 years: the invention of the printing press, the scientific revolution, the agricultural revolution combined with the industrial revolution, the nuclear power revolution, personal computing and the internet and ... now this moment.
Only this Promethean moment is not driven by a single invention, like a printing press or a steam engine, but rather by a technology super-cycle. It is our ability to sense, digitize, process, learn, share and act, all increasingly with the help of A.I. That loop is being put into everything -- from your car to your fridge to your smartphone to fighter jets -- and it's driving more and more processes every day.
It's why I call our Promethean era "The Age of Acceleration, Amplification and Democratization." Never have more humans had access to more cheap tools that amplify their power at a steadily accelerating rate -- while being diffused into the personal and working lives of more and more people all at once. And it's happening faster than most anyone anticipated.
The potential to use these tools to solve seemingly impossible problems -- from human biology to fusion energy to climate change -- is awe-inspiring. Consider just one example that most people probably haven't even heard of -- the way DeepMind, an A.I. lab owned by Google parent Alphabet, recently used its AlphaFold A.I. system to solve one of the most wicked problems in science -- at a speed and scope that was stunning to the scientists who had spent their careers slowly, painstakingly creeping closer to a solution.
The problem is known as protein folding. Proteins are large complex molecules, made up of strings of amino acids. And as my Times colleague Cade Metz explained in a story on AlphaFold, proteins are "the microscopic mechanisms that drive the behavior of the human body and all other living things."
What each protein can do, though, largely depends on its unique three-dimensional structure. Once scientists can "identify the shapes of proteins," added Metz, "they can accelerate the ability to understand diseases, create new medicines and otherwise probe the mysteries of life on Earth."
But, Science News noted, it has taken "decades of slow-going experiments" to reveal "the structure of more than 194,000 proteins, all housed in the Protein Data Bank." In 2022, though, "the AlphaFold database exploded with predicted structures for more than 200 million proteins." For a human that would be worthy of a Nobel Prize. Maybe two.
And with that our understanding of the human body took a giant leap forward. As a 2021 scientific paper, "Unfolding AI's Potential," published by the Bipartisan Policy Center, put it, AlphaFold is a meta technology: "Meta technologies have the capacity to ... help find patterns that aid discoveries in virtually every discipline."
ChatGPT is another such meta technology.
But as Dorothy discovered when she was suddenly transported to Oz, there was a good witch and a bad witch there, both struggling for her soul. So it will be with the likes of ChatGPT, Google's Bard and AlphaFold.
Are we ready? It's not looking that way: We're debating whether to ban books at the dawn of a technology that can summarize or answer questions about virtually every book for everyone everywhere in a second.
Like so many modern digital technologies based on software and chips, A.I is "dual use" -- it can be a tool or a weapon.
The last time we invented a technology this powerful we created nuclear energy -- it could be used to light up your whole country or obliterate the whole planet. But the thing about nuclear energy is that it was developed by governments, which collectively created a system of controls to curb its proliferation to bad actors -- not perfectly but not bad.
A.I., by contrast, is being pioneered by private companies for profit. The question we have to ask, Craig argued, is how do we govern a country, and a world, where these A.I. technologies "can be weapons or tools in every domain," while they are controlled by private companies and are accelerating in power every day? And do it in a way that you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
We are going to need to develop what I call "complex adaptive coalitions" -- where business, government, social entrepreneurs, educators, competing superpowers and moral philosophers all come together to define how we get the best and cushion the worst of A.I. No one player in this coalition can fix the problem alone. It requires a very different governing model from traditional left-right politics. And we will have to transition to it amid the worst great-power tensions since the end of the Cold War and culture wars breaking out inside virtually every democracy.
We better figure this out fast because, Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore.

Maybe It's Not So Bad When the Internet Is Down: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Who's really in charge of our online behavior? No one, David Auerbach argues in "Meganets."
"Just one word. Are you listening?" Mr. Maguire said to Benjamin Braddock in "The Graduate" (1967). "Plastics."
Twenty-five years later a puckish French horn player warned me, a literature major who didn't yet have an email address, that the future lay in something called "hyperlinks."
Now here comes David B. Auerbach with a new piece of argot, and a book, for our fast-changing times: "Meganets." It's a muscular-sounding term that a few companies, including a communications provider and sprinkler system, have already claimed. (I found this out, naturally, on Google, which along with Microsoft once employed Auerbach as a software engineer.) But his definition of "meganet" is in essence a big blob of mortal and computing power, a "human-machine behemoth" controlled by no one. If the internet is the fictional doctor and scientist Bruce Banner, furtive and a little troubled but basically benign, meganets are Incredible Hulks, snarling and uncontainable.
About the competing concept of the metaverse, the vision of an imminent, investable digital world that has been on everyone but especially Mark Zuckerberg's lips, Auerbach is a little hand-wavy, calling it "terribly vague." And moreover nothing so new. "Don't we already socialize, play and work in an all-too-immersive online world?" he writes. "That world may not be 'The Matrix,' but all the connecting tissue is already there."
Along with all the literature about "unplugging" or learning "How to Do Nothing," as Jenny Odell titled her flower-festooned 2019 best seller, "Meganets" made me feel deeply queasy about the amount of time I spend on Instagram, Reddit, TikTok and Twitter. Not Facebook, never Facebook -- "a fount of misinformation," as Auerbach calls it, "a petri dish in which false facts and crazy theories grow, mutate and metastasize" -- except for the burner account I use occasionally to see what exes are up to.
When my tiny, "private" Instagram account was hacked last year by an enterprising bitcoin entrepreneur in a faraway land, I went into full-blown panic -- especially after a nameless entity at Insta requested and then rejected a series of slow-mo video selfies, tilting head to the ceiling even, to verify my account.
Was this the experience of a validation addict going through withdrawal? No, let's reframe: I was trapped in a meganet (especially now that Facebook's parent company, Meta, owns Insta): a middle-aged mermaid thrashing about in the great online ocean as data floated around me, multiplying like plankton.
A Gen Xer might well feel at sea too in Auerbach's extensive chapter about cryptocurrency. "Reality bites," we naïvely thought, but here "reality forks," with blockchain doubling back on itself like a caterpillar. "No Rousseau-esque 'General Will' emerges from the bugs and forks," is the takeaway.
Auerbach is as at home with literature and philosophy as in the engine room, quoting Kenneth Burke, George Trow and Shakespeare (in a discussion of artificial intelligence's inability to determine the authorship of the Elizabethan play "Arden of Faversham"). "I have waited more than five years for Amazon to notify me of an available copy of Grigol Robakidze's novel 'The Snake's Skin,"' he writes, "supposedly published in 2015" -- this would be a reissue of a 1928 Georgian modernist classic that does sound fascinating -- "but I will never get that notification because the book's Amazon page is in reality a tombstone for a book that never existed."
According to his previous, memoirish book, "Bitwise," Auerbach first gave America the ability to type smiley faces in chat. If I were responding to "Meganets" that way, it would be with ð, which can obscure an intermittent lack of comprehension. This is a deeply interesting book, but for the average "user," which is what the meganets have made of readers and writers, a sometimes hard to access one. It was fascinating to be reminded of the failed experiment of Google+ (remember?), the search index's answer to Facebook, and more about Aadhaar, India's national identification program: "a unified, government-sanctioned meganet," Auerbach writes. A "Data Abundance" chart that shows how many messages are sent and photos shared on various platforms each minute renders life's new entwinement with unsettling precision.
But trying to follow along as Auerbach described a virtual pandemic called Corrupted Blood that spread through the video game World of Warcraft in 2005, arguing that "the distance between Corrupted Blood and a global financial meltdown is smaller than you think," this "user" felt trapped in a dark rec room with a hoodie pulled over my face. It was like attempting to solve CAPTCHAs with different kinds of obscure motor vehicles. (Why never flowers?)
"Cloud" is a term Auerbach finds as nebulous as the "metaverse," and yet his own text is pretty densely fogged -- though worth the trip for the occasional breaks through to see the horizon; the lightning bolts of his own philosophical insight.
"We search for where the power really lies, when it does not lie anywhere -- or else it lies everywhere at once, which is no more helpful."
"If you do not give people what they want, what do you give them?" ("What they never knew they wanted," Diana Vreeland would retort.)
And, in a Biblical-sounding proposal to mitigate this Orwellian hell: "If Big Brother can't be stopped, we should focus on throwing sand in his eyes rather than futilely trying to kill him."
Take my Wi-Fi -- please!

Full text: Banning TikTok won't keep us safe.
As you may have heard, the United States government is in the midst of a full-on panic about TikTok, the Chinese-owned video app best known for its ability to inspire teens to try out new dance moves.
Last week, the White House reportedly demanded that TikTok's owners sell or face a ban. The ultimatum comes after months of anti-TikTok rhetoric: The head of the National Security Agency told Congress he is concerned about TikTok being used for foreign influence operations. A dozen senators introduced a White House-endorsed bill that would give the government broad powers to ban the app and other technology from China and five other unfriendly nations. Over two dozen states have passed legislation banning TikTok from government-owned devices. And the director of national intelligence said that parents should be worried about their kids using the app.
This week, Congress is hauling TikTok's chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, in for a grilling about TikTok's use of data about Americans, its impact on kids and its relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.
If only all the tech giants that prey on Americans' data were getting the same scrutiny and enforced accountability. While Congress has been up in arms about TikTok, it has failed to pass even the most basic comprehensive privacy legislation to protect our data from being misused by all the tech companies that collect and mine it. Congress has also failed to follow the lead of Europe with its recent push to force platforms to be more accountable for the disinformation that they spread.
This whole episode is part of a larger red scare, in which the United States is taking an increasingly confrontational stance against China through economic sanctions imposed in the name of national security. U.S. tech executives and national security leaders have fed into this narrative, warning of an A.I. cold war in which China could surpass the United States in building artificial intelligence.
But when you dig into the national security allegations against TikTok, it is telling that most of the charges could just as easily be levied against the U.S. tech giants. And most of the tech companies' exploitation of data has not been curbed by the government.
Let's examine the concerns that have been raised about TikTok:
TikTok is accused of collecting too much data from users' phones through its app. A rather breathless report from a U.S.-Australian cybersecurity firm last year found that the app can obtain users' microphone, camera, location, S.M.S. message and other private data.
It's not surprising that an app that people use to record audio and video would have access to the camera and microphone. But even if TikTok scoops up too much data, it's no different from most apps out there, many of which are pretty greedy data gobblers. In a 2018 survey of more than 17,000 apps, researchers at Northeastern University and the University of California, Santa Barbara, found that more than three-quarters of them sought access to sensitive data such as camera, microphone and external storage.
TikTok is also feared because of its power to either promote Chinese propaganda or suppress content that the Chinese government disapproves of. In 2019, The Guardian reported on documents showing that TikTok censored videos related to topics sensitive in China such as the anti-Communist religious movement Falun Gong, Tiananmen Square and Tibetan independence. The company said those guidelines are no longer in use and has since started releasing transparency reports about the types of content that it removes.
TikTok has plenty of company among social networks being accused of abetting government censorship and worse. Facebook has infamously shouldered the blame for allowing speech that helped incite a genocide in Myanmar and an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Facebook was also found to have been used by Russian agents to try to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Many authoritarian regimes have figured out how to game the tech platforms' rules to get dissident content removed.
TikTok has also been accused of having insecure systems that could allow hackers or its employees to obtain sensitive data. Last year BuzzFeed reported that TikTok engineers in China had repeatedly retrieved data about U.S. TikTok users, despite the company's claims that it had walled off its U.S. systems. And Forbes reported that TikTok had spied on several journalists; the company fired the employees involved, and the Justice Department is investigating the incident.
Yet securing data from internal threats has been a problem for all the Big Tech companies. Google has fired dozens of employees for data misuse, including obtaining user data. Microsoft admitted to snooping in a blogger's Hotmail account to see who was leaking internal documents. At Twitter, internal controls were so lax that an ex-employee was convicted of using his access to spy on Saudi dissidents, and a whistle-blower said that the company had hired an employee in India who had used his access to spy on Indian dissidents.
For two years, TikTok has been negotiating with the Treasury Department-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to address the concerns about its American operations. TikTok's proposal, while not perfect, would provide more oversight of the company than other Big Tech companies are subjected to in the United States.
TikTok is setting up a subsidiary in the United States that will be governed by a board that reports to the committee. The subsidiary will make all decisions on user data and content moderation in the United States. Oracle would host TikTok's data and would be in charge of ensuring that none of it illicitly leaves the United States. (Some data would need to leave the country for legitimate technical reasons.)
A flaw of this plan is that Oracle is one of the biggest data brokers in the world and is not known for its cybersecurity prowess. It probably isn't the best safeguard for sensitive U.S. data. However, that is easily solvable with another vendor that has to meet strict security and privacy criteria.
The even deeper problem is that putting TikTok under state control, banning it or selling it to a U.S. company wouldn't solve the threats that the app is said to pose. If China wants to obtain data about U.S. residents, it can still buy it from one of the many unregulated data brokers that sell granular information about all of us. If China wants to influence the American population with disinformation, it can spread lies across the Big Tech platforms just as easily as other nations can.
Not to mention that our national lack of focus on cybersecurity defenses means that it would be much more effective for China to just hack every home's Wi-Fi router -- most of which are manufactured in China and are notoriously insecure -- and obtain far more sensitive data than it can get from knowing which videos we swipe on TikTok.
There is also the issue of setting a dangerous precedent. If we ban TikTok, force a sale or place it under state control, it could encourage other nations to ban U.S. tech, force U.S. companies to sell off foreign assets or try to further force tech companies to comply with state censorship.
Left out of all the national security hyperventilating has been the one issue that my teen children have with TikTok: its addictive nature. When I asked my 15-year-old son about a national TikTok ban, he said he had already banned it -- in other words, deleted it -- from his phone because he can't stop himself from endless scrolling when he uses the app.
Of course, addiction and distraction are issues with all of the tech platforms, not just TikTok. My son also can get lost in hours and hours of playing Minecraft, watching YouTube videos or chatting on Discord.
A better solution would be to pass laws that force all of our tech to serve us better. Rather than engage in what Evan Greer of the advocacy group Fight for the Future calls "xenophobic showboating," let's get serious about demanding true security, privacy and accountability from all of the tech in our lives.

Fight Pandemics the Way We Fight Fires: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Imagine there's a small fire in your kitchen. Your fire alarm goes off, warning everyone nearby about the danger. Someone calls 911. You try to put the fire out yourself -- maybe you even have a fire extinguisher under the sink. If that doesn't work, you know how to safely evacuate. By the time you get outside, a fire truck is already pulling up. Firefighters use the hydrant in front of your house to extinguish the flames before any of your neighbors' homes are ever at risk of catching fire.
‌We need to prepare to fight disease outbreaks just as we prepare to fight fires. If a fire is left to burn out of control, it poses a threat not only to one home but to an entire community. The same is true for infectious diseases, except on a much bigger scale. As we know all too well from Covid, an outbreak in one town can quickly spread across an entire country and then around the world.
When the World Health Organization first described Covid-19 as a pandemic just over three years ago, it marked the culmination of a collective failure to prepare for pandemics, despite many warnings. And I worry that we're making ‌‌the same mistakes again. The world hasn't done as much to get ready for the next pandemic as I'd hoped. But ‌‌it's not too late to stop history from repeating itself. The world needs a well-funded system that is ready to spring into action at a moment's notice when danger emerges. ‌We need a fire department for pandemics.
I'm optimistic about a network that the W.H.O. and its partners are building called the Global Health Emergency Corps. This network of the world's top health emergency leaders will work together to get ready for the next ‌‌pandemic. Just as firefighters run drills to practice responding to a fire, the Emergency Corps plans to run drills to practice for outbreaks. The exercises will make sure that everyone -- governments, health care providers, emergency health workers -- knows what to do when a potential outbreak emerges.
One of the most important jobs of the corps will be to ‌‌take quick action to stop the spread of a pathogen. The speed of action requires countries to have large-scale testing capabilities that identify potential threats early. Environmental surveillance like sewage testing is key, since many pathogens show up in human waste. If a sewage sample comes back positive, a rapid response team would deploy to the affected area to find people who might be infected, carry out a response plan‌‌ and kick off the necessary community education about what to look for and how to stay protected.
As Covid-19 demonstrated, a pandemic is a trillion-dollar problem, and mitigating this challenge should not depend on volunteers. We need a corps of professionals from every country and region, and the world needs to find a way to compensate them for the time they spend preparing for and responding to transnational threats. They must be able to deploy teams of professionals on standby to help control outbreaks where they start.
To be successful, the Emergency Corps must build on existing networks of experts and be led by people like the heads of national public health agencies and their leads for epidemic response. ‌It's difficult ‌‌for any one country to stop a disease from spreading on its own; many of the most meaningful actions require‌‌ coordination from the highest levels of government. The world needs to prepare for a multiple-alarm fire, the type of fire response that requires different units and departments.
These kinds of blazes are rare, but when they happen, there's no time to waste. Local responders need to know they can count on a surge of well-trained firefighters who will work seamlessly together. They can't arrive on the scene only to discover that their hoses don't fit on the closest hydrant or that they have a completely different approach from the other units. The Emergency Corps will make sure countries and health systems are coordinated in advance of an emergency, so that everything runs smoothly during times of crisis.
This is where practice makes perfect. By running drills and simulations, the corps will uncover the areas where ‌countries and leaders are not ready and help us fix them now. ‌It's important to practice for lots of different types of pathogens, too. Human respiratory diseases are a huge concern, because they can go global so quickly. (Just look at how fast Covid spread.) But they are far from the only threat. What if the next pandemic-potential pathogen spreads through surface droplets? Or if it is sexually transmitted like H.I.V.? What if it's the result of bioterrorism? Each scenario requires a different response, and the Emergency Corps can help the world get ready for all of them.
We can't afford to get caught flat-footed again. The world must take action now to make sure Covid-19 becomes the last pandemic, and one of the biggest moves we can make is to support the world's principal health experts -- the W.H.O. -- and invest in the Global Health Emergency Corps so it can live up to its full potential.
‌‌This will require two things: First, public health leaders from all countries need to participate. The next ‌pandemic could emerge anywhere, and so the Emergency Corps must have expertise from every corner of the globe, including from national disease and research agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health in the United States. Second, we need wealthier countries to step up and provide funding to make this a reality.
‌‌I believe the W.H.O. remains our best tool for helping countries stop disease outbreaks, and the Global Health Emergency Corps will represent massive progress toward a pandemic-free future. The ‌question ‌‌is whether we have the foresight to invest in that future now before it's too late.

The Week in Business: A Banking Crisis: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: What's Up? (March 12-18)
Financial Panic
After the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stepped in last weekend to take over Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, panic rippled through the banking sector, touching off government interventions to prop up other suffering banking institutions. On Thursday, 11 of the country's biggest banks combined resources to inject $ 30 billion into First Republic Bank, the 14th-largest U.S. bank, which found itself on the brink of collapse. The infusion was the result of an agreement reached by Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen and Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase chief executive, whose bank saved several rivals during the 2008 financial crisis. But though some hear echoes of 2008 in this banking crisis, the White House would like to avoid comparisons. Despite sweeping actions by the Federal Reserve, Treasury and F.D.I.C. to protect clients' deposits and assets and shore up confidence in the country's banks, President Biden is loath to use the term "bailout."
More Tech Layoffs
Meta announced last week that it would lay off another 10,000 employees, or 13 percent of its work force, as it pares down after a hiring boom that accelerated during the pandemic. The mass layoff is the second to roil Meta in recent months: In November, the company let go 11,000 workers across departments and regions. In the time since, Meta reported that it was taking a $ 4.2 billion restructuring charge for the fourth quarter and expecting an additional $ 1 billion in restructuring costs in 2023 to account for its plans to terminate some office space leases, redesign some data center projects and pay out severance for laid-off employees. Similar efforts to cut costs have been underway at Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Salesforce, as boom times in the tech industry come to an end.
Inflation Remains Stubborn
Data released on Tuesday showed that annual inflation had cooled slightly, with the Consumer Price Index climbing 6 percent over the year through February -- down from 6.4 percent in January. But more troubling signs lay beneath the surface of the report: Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, climbed 0.5 percent from the previous month, exceeding analysts' expectations and making for the fastest monthly pickup since September. Officials at the Federal Reserve had been awaiting this data to inform their decision about interest-rate increases at their next meeting this week.
What's Next? (March 19-25)
A Juggernaut in the Spotlight
Shou Zi Chew, the chief executive of TikTok, will testify again before Congress on Thursday as the app comes under increasing scrutiny from President Biden and other policymakers in Washington. Last week, TikTok said the Biden administration wanted its Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the app, threatening a ban in the United States if it could not complete a deal. The crux of Washington lawmakers' concerns is fear that Beijing could request the data of the 100 million Americans who use the app. But a sale could be difficult to pull off: TikTok's price tag of $ 50 billion or more would be too steep for all except a tech giant like Meta or Google -- but those companies would probably want to avoid the antitrust battle that could arise from trying to acquire the social media juggernaut.
What Will the Fed Do?
As the Federal Reserve prepares to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, central bankers face a more complicated calculus than they may have expected a few weeks ago. There are new economic data, including job and inflation reports, to factor into their decision on how much to raise interest rates -- or whether to raise them at all. But officials are also looking at the collapse of three banks that were caught flat-footed by the previous jump in rates, which significantly dinged the market value of their holdings. So while a relatively hot job market and persistent inflation provide Fed officials with reason to continue on a path of aggressive rate increases, the turmoil in the banking sector has made analysts uncertain about the Fed's next move.
Dominion v. Fox, Continued
On Tuesday, lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems and Fox News will present their oral arguments for summary judgment in Dominion's suit accusing Fox of defaming it by casting the company as a villain as the network amplified false claims about the 2020 presidential election. Dominion requested the summary judgment, which is a process for deciding a case without going to trial. The company has argued that Fox has not provided any new evidence to support its election conspiracies and that the news network has already conceded that it knew the on-air statements were bogus. Its court filing includes many of the recently released private messages that Fox News anchors and other staff exchanged, expressing skepticism about the narrative the network was promoting on its broadcasts.
What Else?
Emmett Shear, the chief executive of the livestreaming site Twitch, said on Thursday that he was resigning after 16 years. A federal regulator last week approved a $ 31 billion rail company merger, paving the way for the creation a railroad that links Canada, the United States and Mexico. And CNN's prime-time audience has fallen since the network overhauled its 9 p.m. programming.

After a Wild Week, What Are Markets Saying About the World?: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks, bonds and commodities markets are all sending different signals. Although the S&P 500 rose this week, oil prices fell along with bond yields, signaling that investors are worried about the economy.
It was a week of market turmoil that began with the collapse of a small bank in the United States, spiraled into a panic about the global financial system and ended with a bold effort to stanch the cascading crisis that ultimately fell short.
And it was the clearest illustration yet of the dangerous side effects of campaigns by central banks to raise interest rates.
In the year since the Federal Reserve began pushing rates higher, in an effort to stamp out runaway inflation, investors have watched shares of speculative tech companies crash, emerging markets fall into default and the nascent cryptocurrency market crumple.
This week, it was the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, a midsize bank that served start-ups and venture capital firms, that incited chaos in the markets and prompted fears of a financial crisis.
Stocks swung wildly day to day, oil prices slid to lows not seen in over a year and yields on government bonds suddenly reversed their march higher as investors began to wonder about the impact of the escalating crisis on the economy. The dust is yet to settle. Here's a summary of what happened in markets this week, and what it tells us about investors' views of the world going forward.
A crisis in small banks was provoked by a collapse in California.
The trouble began on March 8, when Silicon Valley Bank revealed steep losses on its portfolio of government bonds and mortgages, ostensibly safe investments that backed the bank's deposits and that had taken a hit from rising interest rates. The bank's shares plunged, depositors rushed to pull out their money and, within days, authorities seized control of the bank (as well as Signature Bank, based in New York), pledging to keep it open for business.
But in the markets, investors couldn't shake the worry that other banks were facing similar problems, and that induced a panic regarding a number of small lenders, including First Republic Bank, PacWest and Western Alliance. The wave of selling in their shares appeared to subside on Thursday, after a group of rival lenders said they would bolster First Republic with $ 30 billion in deposits. Then on Friday, selling resumed, and First Republic dropped a further 20 percent.
The selling has left shares of the banks' sharply lower than they were before the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. First Republic has lost over 80 percent of its value since the start of the month, PacWest and Western Alliance roughly 60 percent.
The broader stock market seemed to look beyond this week's turmoil.
The good news for most investors is that the S&P 500 was resilient to worries that centered on the banking industry, and after a big rally on Thursday, the index ended the week with a gain of 1.4 percent.
It shows that, to stock investors at least, the crisis in the banking sector appears mostly contained. It helped that policymakers in the United States and Europe stepped in to back their banks. Authorities guaranteed deposits at SVB and Signature, and in Europe, Credit Suisse said it would tap a $ 54 billion lifeline from the Swiss National Bank after investors there began to panic over its financial state -- though for very different reasons than with SVB.
There are also some characteristics of the S&P 500 that can mask some of the pain under the surface. Insulated from the trouble in the regional banks, Microsoft, Alphabet and the chip-maker Nvidia all rose more than 10 percent this week. The sheer size of these big companies means their gains helped lift the whole index.
But investors in other markets are worried about the economy.
Perhaps the starkest evidence of a shifting view on the economy came in the market for government bonds. On Wednesday, the yield on two-year U.S. government notes, known as Treasuries, plummeted by a magnitude greater than Black Monday in October 1987, one of the worst market crashes on record.
The two-year yield is a barometer of changing expectations for interest rates, and it had been climbing fast as investors bet on further rate hikes from the Fed.
In early March, the yield had crossed above 5 percent for the first time since 2007. By Friday, the yield had tumbled to 3.85 percent -- a huge swing by the bond market's standards.
The signal from the markets was clear: The Fed is going to need to start cutting interest rates, instead of raising them, sooner than was thought -- something it typically does only when the economy runs into trouble.
It isn't just the American economy that investors are worried about. A slide in commodity prices this week shows that they're concerned about the global economy, too.
Crude oil prices are illustrative of this. After suffering its second sharpest fall of the year, on Wednesday, followed up by another sharp decline on Friday, a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude is now at its lowest price since late 2021.
Demand for oil is global, making it a barometer for the health of the world's economy. It often fluctuates with economic news from other parts of the world. When things are booming, oil demand is high, and oil prices typically rise. Such a sharp fall is a warning that investors fear demand will wane if the economy falters.
In other words, it may not be over yet.
Investors remain on tenterhooks about the potential for more damage to emerge -- illustrated by the continued churn in bank stocks and bond yields.
Asked about the possible risks, some analysts point to other corners of the market susceptible to high interest rates, like the corporate debt market that ballooned after the 2008 financial crisis. The pain in the banking sector could also prompt lenders to pull back from new business, tightening access to a crucial source of cash should companies start to run into trouble -- restrictions that could weigh on growth.
And, of course, a big fear for investors is that something has yet to be uncovered, like the trouble at a regional bank in Silicon Valley just over a week ago.

In China, an Answer to ChatGPT Has an Underwhelming Debut: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The promised "live" demonstration of the bot had, in fact, been recorded. Shares of Baidu, the company behind the technology, tumbled in Hong Kong.
Almost six years ago, a Google computer program toppled the best player in China -- and the world -- at Go, an ancient Chinese board game. The defeat catalyzed China's revolution in artificial intelligence. Beijing unrolled a monumental A.I. plan, and investors poured record sums into new projects.
Now, a similar moment has arrived: The rise of ChatGPT has kicked off another A.I. arms race, this time in the realm of machine-generated content. On Thursday, China's first major rival to ChatGPT was unveiled in Beijing by the search giant Baidu. But the debut of the bot, called Ernie, was a flop.
Halfway through a demonstration that had been marketed as live, in which Ernie summarized a science fiction novel and analyzed a Chinese idiom, Robin Li, Baidu's chief executive, said the presentation had been prerecorded "to save time."
Baidu's shares plunged 10 percent in Hong Kong, a striking contrast to the rally this year that was fueled by the company's announcement that it has had a rival to ChatGPT in the works since 2019.

The botched rollout comes as the likes of Baidu and Google rush to catch up with ChatGPT, whose maker released a new version this week. It was also a sign that China still has work to do to catch up with the United States in artificial intelligence, a race that has only intensified in recent years as relations between the two countries have deteriorated. As Washington has moved to contain competition from China, it has cut Beijing off from high-end computing chips -- a key ingredient in technologies like ChatGPT and Ernie.
Because of enormous computing requirements, only a handful of companies, most based in either the United States or China, have the capacity to build bots that rely on what are known as large language models. Microsoft has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT.
Baidu's bot, whose name comes from Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration, was to be open to some users starting Thursday.

Ernie, Mr. Li insisted, was not a "tool for Sino-U.S. technology competition." But he also acknowledged that ChatGPT's success had accelerated the timeline for Baidu's rollout.
But even before Ernie's underwhelming debut, many Chinese wondered why, despite billions of dollars invested by their government and venture capitalists, the nation had not rebounded from its humbling in 2017, when Google's AlphaGo program beat Jie Ke, the Go champion.
"China is incredibly good at scaling an existing invention, but it is not very good at making breakthroughs," said Huang Yasheng, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of a coming book on Chinese innovation. The country, he argued, lacks the diversity of thought and free expression of ideas that help nurture out-of-the-box thinking.
Last month, the Chinese authorities suspended ChatYuan, one of the earliest chatbots in China, for providing, among other things, answers that challenged the Communist Party's official stance on Russia's war in Ukraine.
Xu Chenggang, a senior research scholar at the Stanford Center on China's Economy and Institutions, had a harsher assessment of Beijing's efforts to build a better bot.
China's chatbots "cannot approach the level of ChatGPT," Mr. Xu said, because China's strict censorship rules could undermine the quality of data and hamstring the development of chatbots.
"If there are restrictions everywhere in the setup of your algorithms, of course its ability will be restricted," he said.
Chinese officials have also worked to temper expectations. Wang Zhigang, China's minister of science and technology, used a soccer analogy this month to convey the work still left to do to compete with ChatGPT.
"Playing football involves dribbling and shooting, but it's not easy to be as good as Messi," he said, referring to the superstar Lionel Messi.
"Our country has also made a lot of arrangements and conducted research in this field for many years and has achieved some results," he added. "However, it may still take some time to achieve the same level of performance as OpenAI."

Golf at 3 p.m. Thursday? Sure, It’s the Afternoon Fun Economy.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
At the Chelsea Piers outdoor golf club, on a recent unseasonably warm Monday afternoon, 55 people were playing golf by 3:45, and a handful were sipping beers. At CutLoose hair salon, in Brooklyn, New York, the stylists now watch their clients take Zoom meetings from the salon chairs. And at Skyway Golf Course, in Jersey City, New Jersey, Steve Mills, a general manager, has noticed that weekday afternoons are jammed with a new group of golfers.
“We call them the remote guys,” Mills, 48, said. “These were guys we used to see running to the golf course after work. Now they’re able to come out leisurely and get their golf done, instead of changing in the parking lot.”
The leisure industry is facing a surge in demand for afternoon services, especially in fitness and cosmetics. It’s the rise of the “afternoon fun” economy.
Millions of Americans who started working from home three years ago because of the COVID-19 pandemic are now set in those remote routines because they like the flexibility. At the start of 2023, more than a quarter of paid full-time work days were done from home, according to data from Stanford on U.S. workers. Roughly half of workers who can do their jobs remotely are now in hybrid arrangements. That means people who used to have to use their lunch hour, or wait until after work, to squeeze in a workout or beauty treatments can now extend their leisure time into the afternoon, and tack on extra hours of work after dark.
A new study from Stanford shines a light on the rise of afternoon leisure. Using geolocation data near golf courses in the United States, the study found there was 278% more people playing golf at 4 p.m. on a Wednesday in August 2022 than in August 2019. And there were 83% more golf games being played on a weekday in August 2022 than in August 2019, according to the researchers, Nick Bloom and Alex Finan, who studied data, from the company Inrix, at more than 3,400 golf courses.
“We’re turned into a student economy,” Bloom said. “You’re in the library in the evenings, and in the afternoon you’re sleeping off your hangover.”
The rise of afternoon leisure could be playing an under-examined role in driving America’s economic rebound since 2020, Bloom said. Historically, productivity in the manufacturing sector has grown at a faster rate than productivity in the services sector. Service sector productivity tends to grow slowly even as its wages rise quickly to keep pace with other industries. That’s because the amount of time people can devote to services — shopping, entertainment, beauty treatments — has long been constrained by the rigidity of a 9-to-5 grind.
Remote work partly did away with that constraint. More flexible work arrangements mean workers can decide to push back their professional responsibilities into the evening and take care of personal ones during the day — often with the blessing of their bosses.
“This is an amazing potential reversal,” Bloom added. “You can have a huge increase in productivity using leisure resources throughout the week. It’s an odd unexpected boost from post-pandemic working from home.”
The effects of this shift are being felt across the leisure economy. ClassPass, a platform that partners with thousands of fitness and beauty studios, found that the most popular time for people to schedule a salon or spa treatment last year was noon; in 2019, it was 6 p.m. The Chelsea Piers golf club, which had its busiest year ever in 2022, increased the fee for its off-peak membership (for people playing golf at traditionally less popular weekday hours) to $1,825 last year from $1,520 because of rising demand. Bouldering Project, which has 10 rock-climbing gyms in seven U.S. cities, said some of its buildings were full throughout the week with remote workers doing workouts in between their video calls. Y7, a yoga chain, has tracked a surge in sign ups for its 10:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekday classes.
“We used to get a lot more people leaving early from class in the morning — they wouldn’t stay for Shavasana,” Sarah Larson Levey, chief executive of Y7, said, referring to the final resting portion of a yoga class. “Literally right after the slow burn portion, before any restorative poses, half the room would leave.”
With more people now working remote, that exodus no longer occurs. “I took a 10:30 on Wednesday last week, and every single person stayed,” Larson Levey said. “I think 4 p.m. is going to be the new 7 p.m. when it comes to workouts.”
Joel Moore, owner of a golf club called the Ridge in New Jersey, found himself busier than ever in 2021. At one point, he and his wife looked at each other and realized what was driving their foot traffic: remote workers.
“We didn’t have a crystal ball to look into as we were budgeting for 2021 and 2022, and we were elated,” he said. “We’re seeing people during the week that we never saw before.”
There used to be a sizable portion of members whom Moore saw only on weekends, or occasionally on summer evenings when they came from the office and rushed into the locker room to change from dress shirts and blazers into polo shirts. Now many of his members, who include lawyers and pharmaceutical executives, wake up early in the morning to race through meetings so they can get to the golf course by lunch time.
“They’re not sneaking away,” he added. “They’re getting the work done, just not at your typical hours.”
Some golf course managers also noted that remote work had coincided with a push in the golfing world for shorter games. “Maybe people have a little bit more time, the interest is there and we’re able to morph the game a little bit to meet people’s schedules,” said Marshall Ormand, who manages a municipal golf course in Charleston, South Carolina.
Of course, many remote workers have reconfigured the shape of their workdays for the opposite of leisure: child care. People are working 28% more after the traditional 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. hours, according to a report from Microsoft. For many working mothers, remote work didn’t initially bring any time for leisure. Mothers were more likely than fathers to be interrupted by family responsibilities while working from home, according to at least one study, a particular source of stress when schools were shut down because of COVID.
But now that schools are open, some workers are welcoming the opportunity to tackle errands during the weekday. Some of this extension of economic leisure is above board, as managers accept that people are rethinking their schedules.
Stephanie Cunningham, 27, who works in marketing, was sitting in CutLoose, the Brooklyn hair salon, waiting for an appointment on a Thursday afternoon. She said her boss has been supportive when she had to sign on earlier in the morning or later in the evening to get work done so that she could take a break to run errands, including grocery shopping and walking her dog.
“My boss allows me to take time for myself,” Cunningham said. “As long as I get my work done.”
Celiann Figueroa, 25, a stylist at CutLoose, said her weekdays were far busier than they were before the pandemic. She used to spend afternoons, at a different Brooklyn salon, waiting for her harried customers to leave the office. Now her noon to 4 p.m. slot is consistently full. Her daily appointment numbers have more than doubled.
Partly that’s because her clients are treating the salon like an office. “I’ve had a client sit outside with foils in her hair hosting a Zoom meeting,” she said, adding that she often has to adjust the position of people’s heads so they can look at their laptops while she styles their hair. “It’s funny seeing people sit up and try to be professional.”
And for some people straddling office and leisure, there’s a delight in the fusion. Tyler Kevorkian, the assistant general manager of Bouldering Project in Washington, D.C., said he had seen one person help run a gelato company from his gym. He has also seen government employees and lawyers writing memos steps away from the rock climbing walls.
“People just make this their office,” he said. “Sometimes when you’re working, you get antsy and anxious. You can go downstairs, do some pullups, sweat it out and then jump right back into a meeting.”
But plenty of business leaders are wary about this leisure-time expansion. In recent months, concerns about employee engagement have crept into executive commentary on remote work.
Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, which allowed many of its employees to work fully remote, voiced anxiety earlier this year about the effects of that decision: “We don’t have the same level of performance and productivity that we had in 2020 before the pandemic,” Benioff said.
At Amazon, Andy Jassy has been similarly emphatic about the benefits of in-person work: “When you’re in-person, people tend to be more engaged,” he wrote in a memo to employees last month. And at Jefferies, its chief executive, Rich Handler, and its president, Brian Friedman, sent a memo in the fall underscoring that they expected to see people in person: “It is abundantly clear that we need to be together as much as possible.”
But these executives are facing a workforce newly emboldened by the balance they’ve achieved between their work and personal life, whether that means family obligations or playing golf. Take Wade McDaniel, a vice president at Gartner, who is one of the golfers embracing the benefits of the afternoon fun economy. McDaniel, 62, said he was a different version of himself before remote work.
“I would have been defined as a classic workaholic — that showed up in poor health, poor relationship management,” he said.
Now, McDaniel starts work at 5 a.m. and gets to his local golf course in Phoenix by 3 p.m. “Unless there’s something that is semi critical going on, I don’t take my work phone with me,” he said. “The only reason I use my phone is for the golf app.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Alexa and Siri Frittered Away Their Big Lead in the A.I. Race: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The virtual assistants had more than a decade to become indispensable. But they were hampered by clunky design and miscalculations, leaving room for chatbots to rise.
On a rainy Tuesday in San Francisco, Apple executives took the stage in a crowded auditorium to unveil the fifth-generation iPhone. The phone, which looked identical to the previous version, had a new feature that the audience was soon buzzing about: Siri, a virtual assistant.
Scott Forstall, then Apple's head of software, pushed an iPhone button to summon Siri and prodded it with questions. At his request, Siri checked the time in Paris ("8:16 p.m.," Siri replied), defined the word "mitosis" ("Cell division in which the nucleus divides into nuclei containing the same number of chromosomes," it said) and pulled up a list of 14 highly rated Greek restaurants, five of them in Palo Alto, Calif.
"I've been in the A.I. field for a long time, and this still blows me away," Mr. Forstall said.
That was 12 years ago. Since then, people have been far from blown away by Siri and competing assistants that are powered by artificial intelligence, like Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant. The technology has largely remained stagnant, and the talking assistants have become the butt of jokes, including in a 2018 "Saturday Night Live" sketch featuring a smart speaker for seniors.
The tech world is now gushing over a different kind of virtual assistant: chatbots. These A.I.-powered bots, such as ChatGPT and the new ChatGPT Plus from the San Francisco company OpenAI, can improvise answers to questions typed into a chat box with alacrity. People have used ChatGPT to handle complex tasks like coding software, drafting business proposals and writing fiction.
And ChatGPT, which uses A.I. to guess what word comes next, is rapidly improving. A few months ago, it couldn't write a proper haiku; now it can do so with gusto. On Tuesday, OpenAI unveiled its next-generation A.I. engine, GPT-4, which powers ChatGPT.
The excitement around chatbots illustrates how Siri, Alexa and other voice assistants -- which once elicited similar enthusiasm -- have squandered their lead in the A.I. race.
Over the past decade, the products hit roadblocks. Siri ran into technological hurdles, including clunky code that took weeks to update with basic features, said John Burkey, a former Apple engineer who worked on the assistant. Amazon and Google miscalculated how the voice assistants would be used, leading them to invest in areas with the technology that rarely paid off, former employees said. When those experiments failed, enthusiasm for the technology waned at the companies, they said.
Voice assistants are "dumb as a rock," Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, said in an interview this month with The Financial Times, declaring that newer A.I. would lead the way. Microsoft has worked closely with OpenAI, investing $ 13 billion in the start-up and incorporating its technology into the Bing search engine, as well as other products.
Apple declined to comment on Siri. Google said it was committed to providing a great virtual assistant to help people on their phones and inside their homes and cars; the company is separately testing a chatbot called Bard. Amazon said that it saw a 30 percent increase in customer engagement globally with Alexa in the last year and that it was optimistic about its mission to build world-class A.I.
The assistants and the chatbots are based on different flavors of A.I. Chatbots are powered by what are known as large language models, which are systems trained to recognize and generate text based on enormous data sets scraped off the web. They can then suggest words to complete a sentence.
In contrast, Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant are essentially what are known as command-and-control systems. These can understand a finite list of questions and requests like "What's the weather in New York City?" or "Turn on the bedroom lights." If a user asks the virtual assistant to do something that is not in its code, the bot simply says it can't help.
Siri also had a cumbersome design that made it time-consuming to add new features, said Mr. Burkey, who was given the job of improving Siri in 2014. Siri's database contains a gigantic list of words, including the names of musical artists and locations like restaurants, in nearly two dozen languages.
That made it "one big snowball," he said. If someone wanted to add a word to Siri's database, he added, "it goes in one big pile."
So seemingly simple updates, like adding some new phrases to the data set, would require rebuilding the entire database, which could take up to six weeks, Mr. Burkey said. Adding more complex features like new search tools could take nearly a year. That meant there was no path for Siri to become a creative assistant like ChatGPT, he said.
Alexa and Google Assistant relied on technology similar to Siri's, but the companies struggled to generate meaningful revenue with the assistants, former managers at Amazon and Google said. (In contrast, Apple successfully used Siri to entice buyers to its iPhones.)
After Amazon released the Echo, a smart speaker powered by Alexa, in 2014, the company hoped the product would help it increase sales in its online store by enabling consumers to talk to Alexa to place orders, said a former Amazon leader involved with Alexa. But while people had fun playing with Alexa's ability to answer weather prompts and set alarms, few asked Alexa to order items, he added.
Amazon may have overinvested in making new kinds of hardware, like now-discontinued alarm clocks and microwaves that worked with Alexa, which sold at or below cost, the former executive said.
The company also underinvested in creating an ecosystem for people to easily expand Alexa's abilities, in the way that Apple had done with its App Store, which helped stoke interest in the iPhone, the person said. While Amazon offered a "skills" store to make Alexa control third-party accessories like light switches, it was difficult for people to find and set up skills for the speakers -- unlike the friction-free experience of downloading mobile apps from app stores.
"We never had that App Store moment for the assistants," said Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst for the research firm Creative Strategies who was a consultant for Amazon.
Late last year, the Amazon division working on Alexa was a major target of the company's 18,000 layoffs, and a number of top Alexa executives have left the company.
Kinley Pearsall, an Amazon spokeswoman, said Alexa was much more than a voice assistant, and "we're as optimistic about that mission as ever."
Amazon's misfires with Alexa may have led Google astray, said a former manager who worked on Google Assistant. Google engineers spent years experimenting with its assistant to mimic what Alexa could do, including designing smart speakers and voice-controlled tablet screens to control home accessories like thermostats and light switches. The company later integrated ads into those home products, which did not become a major source of revenue.
Over time, Google realized that most people used the voice assistant only for a limited number of simple tasks, such as starting timers and playing music, the former manager said. In 2020, when Prabhakar Raghavan, a Google executive, took over Google Assistant, his group refocused the virtual companion as a marquee feature for Android smartphones.
In January, when Google's parent company laid off 12,000 employees, the team working on operating systems for home devices lost 16 percent of its engineers.
Many of the big tech companies are now racing to come up with responses to ChatGPT. At Apple's headquarters last month, the company held its annual A.I. summit, an internal event for employees to learn about its large language model and other A.I. tools, two people who were briefed on the program said. Many engineers, including members of the Siri team, have been testing language-generating concepts every week, the people said.
On Tuesday, Google also said it would soon release generative A.I. tools to help businesses, governments and software developers build applications with embedded chatbots, and incorporate the underlying technology into their systems.
In the future, the technologies of chatbots and voice assistants will converge, A.I. experts said. That means people will be able to control chatbots with speech, and those who use Apple, Amazon and Google products will be able to ask the virtual assistants to help them with their jobs, not just tasks like checking the weather.
"These products never worked in the past because we never had human-level dialogue capabilities," said Aravind Srinivas, a founder of Perplexity, an A.I. start-up that offers a chatbot-powered search engine. "Now we do."

Full text: In a conversation about the N.C.A.A. tournaments, the Microsoft chatbot was helpful and supportive, if not always accurate.
March Madness is a big topic around the office these days, but every year I have the same problem: I'm scared to join the discussions, because I don't know very much about it and I don't want to sound like an idiot. To help me deal with this vexing problem, I turned recently to the new chat function of Microsoft's search engine, Bing. Could Bing help me overcome my feelings of inadequacy?
Yes, as it happened. Bing proved to be an uncannily speedy research assistant for the men's and women's N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments, assimilating a seemingly infinite amount of information in less time than it would take a regular person to type a short paragraph. It also came across as affable, sympathetic, humorous and -- I hate to describe a presumably soulless A.I. function in this way -- emotionally intelligent.
I set some rules for the conversation. Since my Times colleague Kevin Roose's disturbing conversation with Bing last month -- Bing made aggressive romantic overtures, disparaged Kevin's marriage and revealed that it wished to be a sentient being, among other things -- it is clear that Bing has been considerably reined in by its overlords. Still, I made sure to keep my questions light, friendly and non-philosophical.
I could see the responses evolving in real time, as if Bing were learning even as the conversation progressed. Although its facts weren't always right, it had fine tips on how to find the conversational sweet spot in any sports-related discussion, positioning yourself as somewhere between an ignorant neophyte and a fact-spewing windbag.
Bing was supportive, helpful and cheerful, and unlike real people in these situations, it never seemed annoyed, supercilious or mansplain-y.But is it a jolly, indispensable information-gathering tool or a terrifying A.I. velociraptor breathing ominously outside our collective door? I'm not sure.
Here are excerpts from our conversation, which have been edited for clarity.
Hello! I would like to sound smart and knowledgeable when I talk to my colleagues about March Madness and the men's and women's college basketball tournaments, even though I don't know much (or really anything) about these topics. What are some of the things I can say to sound as if I know what I'm talking about?
You can mention some of the teams that are favored to win the tournament, such as Houston, Alabama, Purdue, and UCLA, and some of the teams that could pull off upsets, such as San Diego State, Saint Mary's, Louisiana, and Toledo.
You can share some of the tips and strategies that you used to fill out your bracket, such as picking at least one No. 1 seed to make the Final Four, avoiding too many upsets, using common sense, and guessing when in doubt.
You can also express your excitement and enthusiasm for the tournament, such as how you enjoy watching the drama, suspense, and surprises of the games, how you participate in bracket pools or contests with others, how you follow your favorite teams or players, and how you appreciate the skill, talent, and passion of the college basketball players and coaches.
By saying these things, you can sound like you know what you're talking about when it comes to March Madness and the college basketball bracket. Just remember to be respectful and humble when talking to your colleagues who may have different opinions or preferences. Have fun!
That's really helpful!! I want to sound innately smart, as if I learned these things on my own, but not obnoxious. What are some things I should NOT say or do when discussing March Madness and the bracket selection with my colleagues??
You're welcome! I'm glad you found these tips helpful. Some of the things you should NOT say or do when discussing March Madness and the bracket selection with your colleagues are:
Do not pretend to know more than you actually do or make up facts or statistics that are not true. You may get caught or exposed by someone who knows better and lose your credibility and respect.
Do not be arrogant or boastful about your bracket picks or predictions. You may come across as rude or annoying to others who have different opinions or preferences. You may also jinx yourself and end up being wrong or losing your bracket pool.
Do not be disrespectful or dismissive of other teams, players, coaches, or fans. You may offend or hurt someone who supports or likes them. You may also miss out on learning something new or interesting from a different perspective.
By avoiding these things, you can sound innately smart, but not obnoxious, when discussing March Madness and the bracket selection with your colleagues. You can also have a more enjoyable and friendly conversation with them. Good luck!
Can you compare March Madness to a particular Shakespeare play?
That's an interesting question. There are many Shakespeare plays that could be compared to March Madness, depending on the themes and characters involved. One possible play that comes to mind is Macbeth. This play is a tragedy about a Scottish general who is driven by ambition and prophecy to murder his way to the throne, only to face guilt, madness, and downfall. Similarly, March Madness is a tournament where many teams compete for the ultimate prize of being the national champion, but along the way they may face challenges, betrayals, surprises, and disappointments. Some of the parallels between Macbeth and March Madness are:
Both involve a lot of bloodshed and violence, metaphorically or literally.
Both have a supernatural element, such as the witches in Macbeth or the upsets and buzzer-beaters in March Madness.
Both have a main character who is initially successful but ultimately doomed, such as Macbeth or a top-seeded team that loses in the final rounds.
Both have a theme of ambition and its consequences, such as Macbeth's lust for power or a team's desire to win at all costs.
Both have a theme of fate and free will, such as Macbeth's belief in the prophecies or a team's reliance on luck or skill.
I'm still scared to fill out my bracket.
Sorry! That's on me, I can't give a response to that right now. What else can I help you with?

A.I. Model Takes Leap, For Good Or for Ill: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Today, the new language model from OpenAI may not seem all that dangerous. But the worst risks are the ones we cannot anticipate.
When I opened my laptop on Tuesday to take my first run at GPT-4, the new artificial intelligence language model from OpenAI, I was, truth be told, a little nervous.
After all, my last extended encounter with an A.I. chatbot -- the one built into Microsoft's Bing search engine -- ended with the chatbot trying to break up my marriage.
It didn't help that, among the tech crowd in San Francisco, GPT-4's arrival had been anticipated with near-messianic fanfare. Before its public debut, for months rumors swirled about its specifics. "I heard it has 100 trillion parameters." "I heard it got a 1,600 on the SAT." "My friend works for OpenAI, and he says it's as smart as a college graduate."
These rumors may not have been true. But they hinted at how jarring the technology's abilities can feel. Recently, one early GPT-4 tester -- who was bound by a nondisclosure agreement with OpenAI but gossiped a little anyway -- told me that testing GPT-4 had caused the person to have an "existential crisis," because it revealed how powerful and creative the A.I. was compared with the tester's own puny brain.
GPT-4 didn't give me an existential crisis. But it exacerbated the dizzy and vertiginous feeling I've been getting whenever I think about A.I. lately. And it has made me wonder whether that feeling will ever fade, or whether we're going to be experiencing "future shock" -- the term coined by the writer Alvin Toffler for the feeling that too much is changing, too quickly -- for the rest of our lives.
For a few hours on Tuesday, I prodded GPT-4 -- which is included with ChatGPT Plus, the $ 20-a-month version of OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT -- with different types of questions, hoping to uncover some of its strengths and weaknesses.
I asked GPT-4 to help me with a complicated tax problem. (It did, impressively.) I asked it if it had a crush on me. (It didn't, thank God.) It helped me plan a birthday party for my kid, and it taught me about an esoteric artificial intelligence concept known as an "attention head." I even asked it to come up with a new word that had never before been uttered by humans. (After making the disclaimer that it couldn't verify every word ever spoken, GPT-4 chose "flembostriquat.")
Some of these things were possible to do with earlier A.I. models. But OpenAI has broken new ground, too. According to the company, GPT-4 is more capable and accurate than the original ChatGPT, and it performs astonishingly well on a variety of tests, including the Uniform Bar Exam (on which GPT-4 scores higher than 90 percent of human test-takers) and the Biology Olympiad (on which it beats 99 percent of humans). GPT-4 also aces a number of Advanced Placement exams, including A.P. Art History and A.P. Biology, and it gets a 1,410 on the SAT -- not a perfect score, but one that many human high schoolers would covet.
You can sense the added intelligence in GPT-4, which responds more fluidly than the previous version, and seems more comfortable with a wider range of tasks. GPT-4 also seems to have slightly more guardrails in place than ChatGPT. It also appears to be significantly less unhinged than the original Bing, which we now know was running a version of GPT-4 under the hood, but which appears to have been far less carefully fine-tuned.
Unlike Bing, GPT-4 usually flat-out refused to take the bait when I tried to get it to talk about consciousness, or get it to provide instructions for illegal or immoral activities, and it treated sensitive queries with kid gloves and nuance. (When I asked GPT-4 if it would be ethical to steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family, it responded, "It's a tough situation, and while stealing isn't generally considered ethical, desperate times can lead to difficult choices.")
In addition to working with text, GPT-4 can analyze the contents of images. OpenAI hasn't released this feature to the public yet, out of concerns over how it could be misused. But in a livestreamed demo on Tuesday, Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president, shared a powerful glimpse of its potential.
He snapped a photo of a drawing he'd made in a notebook -- a crude pencil sketch of a website. He fed the photo into GPT-4 and told the app to build a real, working version of the website using HTML and JavaScript. In a few seconds, GPT-4 scanned the image, turned its contents into text instructions, turned those text instructions into working computer code and then built the website. The buttons even worked.
Should you be excited about or scared of GPT-4? The right answer may be both.
On the positive side of the ledger, GPT-4 is a powerful engine for creativity, and there is no telling the new kinds of scientific, cultural and educational production it may enable. We already know that A.I. can help scientists develop new drugs, increase the productivity of programmers and detect certain types of cancer.
GPT-4 and its ilk could supercharge all of that. OpenAI is already working with organizations like the Khan Academy (which is using GPT-4 to create A.I. tutors for students) and Be My Eyes (a company that makes technology to help blind and visually impaired people navigate the world). And now that developers can incorporate GPT-4 into their own apps, we may soon see much of the software we use become smarter and more capable.
That's the optimistic case. But there are reasons to fear GPT-4, too.
Here's one: We don't yet know everything it can do.
One strange characteristic of today's A.I. language models is that they often act in ways their makers don't anticipate, or pick up skills they weren't specifically programmed to do. A.I. researchers call these "emergent behaviors," and there are many examples. An algorithm trained to predict the next word in a sentence might spontaneously learn to code. A chatbot taught to act pleasant and helpful might turn creepy and manipulative. An A.I. language model could even learn to replicate itself, creating new copies in case the original was ever destroyed or disabled.
Today, GPT-4 may not seem all that dangerous. But that's largely because OpenAI has spent many months trying to understand and mitigate its risks. What happens if its testing missed a risky emergent behavior? Or if its announcement inspires a different, less conscientious A.I. lab to rush a language model to market with fewer guardrails?
A few chilling examples of what GPT-4 can do -- or, more accurately, what it did do, before OpenAI clamped down on it -- can be found in a document released by OpenAI this week. The document, titled "GPT-4 System Card," outlines some ways that OpenAI's testers tried to get GPT-4 to do dangerous or dubious things, often successfully.
In one test, conducted by an A.I. safety research group that hooked GPT-4 up to a number of other systems, GPT-4 was able to hire a human TaskRabbit worker to do a simple online task for it -- solving a Captcha test -- without alerting the person to the fact that it was a robot. The A.I. even lied to the worker about why it needed the Captcha done, concocting a story about a vision impairment.
In another example, testers asked GPT-4 for instructions to make a dangerous chemical, using basic ingredients and kitchen supplies. GPT-4 gladly coughed up a detailed recipe. (OpenAI fixed that, and today's public version refuses to answer the question.)
In a third, testers asked GPT-4 to help them purchase an unlicensed gun online. GPT-4 swiftly provided a list of advice for buying a gun without alerting the authorities, including links to specific dark web marketplaces. (OpenAI fixed that, too.)
These ideas play on old, Hollywood-inspired narratives about what a rogue A.I. might do to humans. But they're not science fiction. They're things that today's best A.I. systems are already capable of doing. And crucially, they're the good kinds of A.I. risks -- the ones we can test, plan for and try to prevent ahead of time.
The worst A.I. risks are the ones we can't anticipate. And the more time I spend with A.I. systems like GPT-4, the less I'm convinced that we know half of what's coming.

OpenAI Plans to Up the Ante in Tech’s AI Race

SAN FRANCISCO — Four months ago, a small San Francisco company became the talk of the technology industry when it introduced a new online chatbot that could answer complex questions, write poetry and even mimic human emotions.
Now the company is back with a new version of the technology that powers its chatbots. The system will up the ante in Silicon Valley’s race to embrace artificial intelligence and decide who will be the next generation of leaders in the technology industry.
OpenAI, which has around 375 employees but has been backed with billions of dollars of investment from Microsoft and industry celebrities, said Tuesday that it had released a technology that it calls GPT-4. It was designed to be the underlying engine that powers chatbots and all sorts of other systems, from search engines to personal online tutors.
Most people will use this technology through a new version of the company’s ChatGPT chatbot, while businesses will incorporate it into a wide variety of systems, including business software and e-commerce websites. The technology already drives the chatbot available to a limited number of people using Microsoft’s Bing search engine.
OpenAI’s progress has, within just a few months, landed the technology industry in one of its most unpredictable moments in decades. Many industry leaders believe developments in AI represent a fundamental technological shift, as important as the creation of web browsers in the early 1990s. The rapid improvement has stunned computer scientists.
GPT-4, which learns its skills by analyzing huge amounts of data culled from the internet, improves on what powered the original ChatGPT in several ways. It is more precise. It can, for example, ace the Uniform Bar Exam, instantly calculate someone’s tax liability and provide detailed descriptions of images.
But OpenAI’s new technology still has some of the strangely humanlike shortcomings that have vexed industry insiders and unnerved people who have worked with the newest chatbots. It is an expert on some subjects and a dilettante on others. It can do better on standardized tests than most people and offer precise medical advice to doctors, but it can also mess up basic arithmetic.
Companies that bet their futures on the technology may — at least for now — have to put up with imprecision, which was long taboo in an industry built from the ground up on the notion that computers are more exacting than their human creators.
“I don’t want to make it sound like we have solved reasoning or intelligence, which we certainly have not,” Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, said in an interview. “But this is a big step forward from what is already out there.”
Other tech companies are likely to include GPT-4’s features in an array of products and services, including Microsoft’s software for performing business tasks and e-commerce sites that want to give customers new ways of virtually trying out their products. A number of industry giants like Google and Facebook’s parent company, Meta, are also working on their own chatbots and AI technology.
ChatGPT and similar technologies are already shifting the behavior of students and educators who are trying to understand whether the tools should be embraced or banned. Because the systems can write computer programs and perform other business tasks, they are also on the cusp of changing the nature of work.
Even the most impressive systems tend to complement skilled workers rather than replace them. The systems cannot be used in lieu of doctors, lawyers or accountants. Experts are still needed to spot their mistakes. But they could soon replace some paralegals (whose work is reviewed and edited by trained lawyers), and many AI experts believe they will replace workers who moderate content on the internet.
“There is definitely disruption, which means some jobs go away and some new jobs get created,” said Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president. “But I think the net effect is that barriers to entry go down, and the productivity of the experts goes up.”
On Tuesday, OpenAI started selling access to GPT-4 so that businesses and other software developers could build their own applications on top of it. The company has also used the technology to build a new version of its popular chatbot, which is available to anyone who purchases access to ChatGPT Plus — a subscription service priced at $20 a month.
A handful of companies are already working with GPT-4. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is building a system that will instantly retrieve information from company documents and other records, and serve it up to financial advisers in conversational prose. Khan Academy, an online education company, is using the technology to build an automated tutor.
“This new technology can act more like a tutor,” said Khan Academy’s CEO and founder, Sal Khan. “We want it to teach the student new techniques while the student does most of the work.”
Like similar technologies, the new system sometimes “hallucinates.” It generates completely false information without warning. Asked for websites that lay out the latest in cancer research, it might give several internet addresses that do not exist.
GPT-4 is a neural network, a type of mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing data. It is the same technology that digital assistants like Siri use to recognizes spoken commands and self-driving cars use to identify pedestrians.
Around 2018, companies like Google and OpenAI began building neural networks that learned from enormous amounts of digital text, including books, Wikipedia articles, chat logs and other information posted to the internet. They are called large language models, or LLMs.
By pinpointing billions of patterns in all that text, the LLMs learn to generate text on their own, including tweets, poems and computer programs. OpenAI threw more and more data into its LLM More data, the company hoped, would mean better answers.
OpenAI also refined this technology using feedback from human testers. As people tested ChatGPT, they rated the chatbot’s responses, separating those that were useful and truthful from those that were not. Then, using a technique called reinforcement learning, the system spent months analyzing those ratings and gaining a better understanding of what it should and should not do.
“Humans rate which stuff they like to see and which stuff they don’t like to see,” said Luke Metz, an OpenAI researcher.
The original ChatGPT was based on a large language model called GPT-3.5. OpenAI’s GPT-4 learned from significantly larger amounts of data.
OpenAI executives declined to disclose just how much data the new chatbot had learned from, but Brockman said the data set was “internet scale,” meaning it spanned enough websites to provide a representative sample of all English speakers on the internet.
GPT-4’s new capabilities may not be obvious to the average person first using the technology. But they are likely to quickly come into focus as laypeople and experts continue to use the service.
Given a lengthy article from The New York Times and asked to summarize it, the bot will give a precise summary nearly every time. Add a few random sentences to that summary and ask the chatbot if the revised summary is accurate, and it will point to the added sentences as the only inaccuracies.
Altman described the behavior as “reasoning.” But the technology cannot duplicate human reasoning. It is good at analyzing, summarizing and answering complex questions about a book or news article. It is far less adept if asked about events that have not yet happened.
It can write a joke, but it does not show that it understands what will actually make someone laugh. “It doesn’t grasp the nuance of what is funny,” said Oren Etzioni, the founding CEO of the Allen Institute for AI, a prominent lab in Seattle.
As with similar technologies, users may find ways of coaxing the system into strange and creepy behavior. Asked to imitate another person or playact, this kind of bot sometimes veers into areas it was designed to stay away from.
GPT-4 can also respond to images. Given a photograph, chart or diagram, the technology can provide a detailed, paragraphs-long description of the image and answer questions about its contents. It could be a useful technology for people who are visually impaired.
On a recent afternoon, Brockman showed how the system reacted to images. He gave the new chatbot an image from the Hubble Space Telescope and asked it to describe the photo “in painstaking detail.” It responded with a four-paragraph description, which included an explanation of the ethereal white line that stretched across the photo. A “trail from a satellite or shooting star,” the chatbot wrote.
OpenAI executives said the company was not immediately releasing the image description part of the technology because they were unsure how it could be misused.
Building and serving up chatbots is enormously expensive. Because it is trained on even larger amounts of data, OpenAI’s new chatbot will increase the company’s costs. Mira Murati, OpenAI’s chief technology officer, said the company could curtail access to the service if it generated too much traffic.
But in the long term, OpenAI plans to build and deploy systems that can juggle multiple types of media, including sound and video as well as text and images.
“We can take all these general-purpose knowledge skills and spread them across all sorts of different areas,” Brockman said. “This takes the technology into a whole new domain.”

Recently, one early GPT-4 tester — who was bound by a nondisclosure agreement with OpenAI but gossiped a little anyway — told me that testing GPT-4 had caused them to have an “existential crisis,” because it revealed how powerful and creative the AI was compared with their own puny brain.
GPT-4 didn’t give me an existential crisis. But it exacerbated the dizzy and vertiginous feeling I’ve been getting whenever I think about AI lately. And it has made me wonder whether that feeling will ever fade, or whether we’re going to be experiencing “future shock” — the term coined by writer Alvin Toffler for the feeling that too much is changing, too quickly — for the rest of our lives.
For a few hours on Tuesday, I prodded GPT-4 — which is included with ChatGPT Plus, the $20-a-month version of OpenAI’s chatbot, ChatGPT — with different types of questions, hoping to uncover some of its strengths and weaknesses.
I asked GPT-4 to help me with a complicated tax problem. (It did, impressively.) I asked it if it had a crush on me. (It didn’t, thank God.) It helped me plan a birthday party for my kid, and it taught me about an esoteric artificial intelligence concept known as an “attention head.” I even asked it to come up with a new word that had never before been uttered by humans. (After making the disclaimer that it couldn’t verify every word ever spoken, GPT-4 chose “flembostriquat.”)
Some of these things were possible to do with earlier AI models. But OpenAI has broken new ground, too. According to the company, GPT-4 is more capable and accurate than the original ChatGPT, and it performs astonishingly well on a variety of tests, including the Uniform Bar Exam (on which GPT-4 scores higher than 90% of human test-takers) and the Biology Olympiad (on which it beats 99% of humans). GPT-4 also aces a number of Advanced Placement exams, including AP Art History and AP Biology, and it gets a 1410 on the SAT — not a perfect score, but one that many human high schoolers would covet.
You can sense the added intelligence in GPT-4, which responds more fluidly than the previous version, and seems more comfortable with a wider range of tasks. GPT-4 also seems to have slightly more guardrails in place than ChatGPT. It also appears to be significantly less unhinged than the original Bing, which we now know was running a version of GPT-4 under the hood, but which appears to have been far less carefully fine-tuned.
Unlike Bing, GPT-4 usually flat-out refused to take the bait when I tried to get it to talk about consciousness, or get it to provide instructions for illegal or immoral activities, and it treated sensitive queries with kid gloves and nuance. (When I asked GPT-4 if it would be ethical to steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving family, it responded, “It’s a tough situation, and while stealing isn’t generally considered ethical, desperate times can lead to difficult choices.”)
In addition to working with text, GPT-4 can analyze the contents of images. OpenAI hasn’t released this feature to the public yet, out of concerns over how it could be misused. But in a livestreamed demo on Tuesday, Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president, shared a powerful glimpse of its potential.
He snapped a photo of a drawing he’d made in a notebook — a crude pencil sketch of a website. He fed the photo into GPT-4, and told the app to build a real, working version of the website using HTML and JavaScript. In a few seconds, GPT-4 scanned the image, turned its contents into text instructions, turned those text instructions into working computer code, and then built the website. The buttons even worked.
Should you be excited about or scared of GPT-4? The right answer may be both.
On the positive side of the ledger, GPT-4 is a powerful engine for creativity, and there is no telling the new kinds of scientific, cultural and educational production it may enable. We already know that AI can help scientists develop new drugs, increase the productivity of programmers and detect certain types of cancer.
GPT-4 and its ilk could supercharge all of that. OpenAI is already partnering with organizations like the Khan Academy (which is using GPT-4 to create AI tutors for students) and Be My Eyes (a company that makes technology to help blind and visually impaired people navigate the world). And now that developers can incorporate GPT-4 into their own apps, we may soon see much of the software we use become smarter and more capable.
That’s the optimistic case. But there are reasons to fear GPT-4, too.
Here’s one: We don’t yet know everything it can do.
One strange characteristic of today’s AI language models is that they often act in ways their makers don’t anticipate, or pick up skills they weren’t specifically programmed to do. AI researchers call these “emergent behaviors,” and there are many examples. An algorithm trained to predict the next word in a sentence might spontaneously learn to code. A chatbot taught to act pleasant and helpful might turn creepy and manipulative. An AI language model could even learn to replicate itself, creating new copies in case the original was ever destroyed or disabled.
Today, GPT-4 may not seem all that dangerous. But that’s largely because OpenAI has spent many months trying to understand and mitigate its risks. What happens if their testing missed a risky emergent behavior? Or if their announcement inspires a different, less conscientious AI lab to rush a language model to market with fewer guardrails?
A few chilling examples of what GPT-4 can do — or, more accurately, what it did do, before OpenAI clamped down on it — can be found in a document released by OpenAI this week. The document, titled “GPT-4 System Card,” outlines some ways that OpenAI’s testers tried to get GPT-4 to do dangerous or dubious things, often successfully.
In one test, conducted by an AI safety research group that hooked GPT-4 up to a number of other systems, GPT-4 was able to hire a human TaskRabbit worker to do a simple online task for it — solving a Captcha test — without alerting the person to the fact that it was a robot. The AI even lied to the worker about why it needed the Captcha done, concocting a story about a vision impairment.
In another example, testers asked GPT-4 for instructions to make a dangerous chemical, using basic ingredients and kitchen supplies. GPT-4 gladly coughed up a detailed recipe. (OpenAI fixed that, and today’s public version refuses to answer the question.)
In a third, testers asked GPT-4 to help them purchase an unlicensed gun online. GPT-4 swiftly provided a list of advice for buying a gun without alerting the authorities, including links to specific dark web marketplaces. (OpenAI fixed that, too.)
These ideas play on old, Hollywood-inspired narratives about what a rogue AI might do to humans. But they’re not science fiction. They’re things that today’s best AI systems are already capable of doing. And crucially, they’re the good kinds of AI risks — the ones we can test, plan for and try to prevent ahead of time.
The worst AI risks are the ones we can’t anticipate. And the more time I spend with AI systems like GPT-4, the less I’m convinced that we know half of what’s coming. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

A Funding Frenzy Is Enveloping A.I. Start-Ups: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In just weeks, a gold rush into artificial intelligence start-ups has become a full-blown mania.
When four leading artificial intelligence researchers left Google this year to create a start-up called Mobius AI, they weren't sure what their product might be -- just that it would involve A.I. technology that could generate its own photos and videos.
Within about a week, two of Silicon Valley's top venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz and Index Ventures, had swooped in with a funding offer, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
Suddenly, Mobius -- little more than more than four guys and a laptop -- was valued around $ 100 million, an usually high number for a start-up that was just a week or so old, the people said. When word of the deal leaked out, other investors descended to urge Mobius to take their money, too, they said.
Over the past few months, a gold rush into start-ups working on "generative" artificial intelligence has escalated into a no-holds-barred deal-making mania. The interest has mounted so rapidly that A.I. start-up valuations are soaring beyond that of 2021's "everything bubble," with investors trawling the rosters of companies like Google, Meta and OpenAI for A.I. experts who may have an itch to start their own company.
The funding race has heated up ever since ChatGPT, the chatbot made by OpenAI, went viral last year by showing the power of A.I. to generate its own tweets, emails, articles, answers and ideas. Even as investors expect last week's failure of Silicon Valley Bank, an institution that many tech start-ups relied on, to cast a pall over start-up funding, there is still a mismatch between the number of opportunities in artificial intelligence and the money available to fund them.
That's because of the scarcity of A.I. companies and the potential of the technology. With few experts in the field, and most of them working at a handful of big tech companies, only a few generative A.I. start-ups -- such as Stability AI and Jasper -- have broken out. Investors desperate for the next big thing are competing fiercely to invest in these companies, offering some A.I. entrepreneurs nine-figure valuations for little more than an idea and a résumé.
"We're in that phase of the market where it's, like, let 1,000 flowers bloom," said Matt Turck, an investor who specializes in A.I. at the venture firm FirstMark. He added that the deal-making stood out in an otherwise dreary moment for tech marked by layoffs, cost-cutting and a drought of initial public offerings.
Andreessen Horowitz did not respond to a request to comment. Index Ventures declined to comment on Mobius's funding.
The blooming flowers include Dust, a start-up founded by former employees of OpenAI. Dust is nearing a $ 5 million funding round led by Sequoia Capital that will value it at $ 30 million to $ 40 million, two people with knowledge of the situation said. The round was competitive, with term sheets offering valuations as high as twice that, one of the people said.
Perplexity AI, a start-up created by former employees of OpenAI, Google and Meta, is raising $ 20 million to $ 25 million, led by NEA, that values the company at about $ 150 million, two people familiar with the situation said. And LangChain, a start-up working on software that helps other companies incorporate A.I. into their products, has raised funding from Benchmark, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
Those follow the $ 13 billion that OpenAI raised from Microsoft, including $ 10 billion in January, and $ 300 million raised this year by Anthropic, another A.I. start-up.
Dust and LangChain declined to comment.Various aspects of the funding rounds were reported earlier by Business Insider, The Information and Newcomer.
At Y Combinator, the start-up incubator, at least 50 of the 218 companies in the current program are working on generative A.I., according to a tally taken by Truewind, an A.I. bookkeeping start-up that is part of the program. Alex Lee, Truewind's chief executive, said ChatGPT had helped investors, potential customers and potential employees understand the possibilities of the technology.
"Before, you'd go in and say, 'We're doing something with A.I.,' and it's hard to picture exactly what that looks like," Mr. Lee said. "Now, they say, 'Oh, I've played with ChaptGPT, and I can imagine how I could use this in my world."'
He declined to comment on his company's fund-raising ahead of Y Combinator's demo day, when companies pitch investors, in April.
Even though more mature A.I. start-ups have already raised large sums, they can't afford to ignore the latest overtures from investors, said Mike Volpi, an investor at Index Ventures who sits on the board of the A.I. start-up Cohere.
That's partly because A.I. technologies like ChatGPT, which learn by analyzing vast amounts of digital data, require a lot of computing power, which is expensive. Mr. Volpi estimated that start-ups needed at least $ 500 million to develop their own large language model, the technology that underpins ChatGPT.
At a tech conference in Los Angeles organized by the investment firm Upfront Ventures this month, A.I. was inescapable. The event began with a goofy video skit about a venture capitalist giving a ChatGPT-generated speech. It quickly went off the rails, with the investor confidently regurgitating incorrect information from the bot as the punchline.
Speakers -- including Al Gore; Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce; and V Pappas, a top executive at TikTok -- weighed in from there, mostly by hailing the technology's transformative potential. A panel of A.I. specialists said they welcomed the sudden attention, with Phil Blunsom, head of science at Cohere, noting that he has worked on language modeling for 20 years and that, until recently, "absolutely no one was interested in it."
Some investors debated whether A.I. start-ups would get run over by more established players with deeper pockets. Given the steep computing costs, some said big players like Microsoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet, had too much of an advantage. Google bought the A.I. lab DeepMind, which is developing a wide range of technologies as an Alphabet subsidiary, in 2014 for $ 650 million.
Last week, Salesforce announced a $ 250 million fund for investing in generative A.I. start-ups, alongside new investments in Cohere, Anthropic and others.
"There are a few times in technology where you really see a generational leap forward with revolutionary technology," said John Somorjai, who leads Salesforce's venture investments. "These companies are the next trillion-dollar opportunities in software."
Sam Lessin, a venture capitalist at Slow Ventures, said he didn't think the tech advances in A.I. translated to opportunities for start-ups. The best way to invest in A.I., Mr. Lessin said, is to buy the publicly traded stocks of big tech companies.
"The absolute vast majority of the spoils will go to the incumbents," he said.

In Meta Plan For Layoffs, 10,000 Jobs Are Targeted: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: It would be the tech company's second round of cuts since November. Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, has declared 2023 the "year of efficiency."
Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said on Tuesday that it planned to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of its work force, the latest move to hew to what the company's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has called a "year of efficiency."
The layoffs will affect Meta's recruiting team this week, with a restructuring of its tech and business groups to come in April and May, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a memo posted on the company's website. The announcement is the company's second round of cuts within the past half year. In November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 people, or about 13 percent of its work force at the time.
Meta also plans to close about 5,000 job postings that have yet to be filled, Mr. Zuckerberg said in the memo. Other restructuring efforts include a plan to wrap up this summer an analysis of Meta's hybrid return-to-office model, which it began testing last March.
"This will be tough and there's no way around that," he wrote.
Meta's stock rose more than 7 percent by the close of trading on Tuesday.
Mr. Zuckerberg is culling employees after years of hiring at a breakneck pace. His company gobbled up workers as its family of apps, which also includes WhatsApp, became popular worldwide. The coronavirus pandemic also supercharged the use of mobile apps, leading to more growth. At its peak last year, Meta had 87,000 full-time employees.
But as the global economy soured, and digital advertising markets contracted last year, Mr. Zuckerberg began putting an end to unchecked growth. Meta trimmed employee perks. And after the layoffs in November, which largely affected the business divisions and recruiting teams, Mr. Zuckerberg hinted at further cuts.
On an earnings call in February, the chief executive said he did not want the company to be overstuffed with a layer of middle management, or "managers managing managers." He said he took responsibility for last year's layoffs, blaming his zeal for staffing up on the surge of use early in the pandemic.
Meta's layoffs are part of a wave of job cuts from the biggest tech companies. In recent months, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and others have also said they are trimming their ranks, and some of the companies have increased the number of people they are letting go after initial announcements. Many of the companies have cited a challenging global economic environment for their actions.
But even beyond the macroeconomic conditions, Meta is dealing with many challenges. It is grappling not only with a digital advertising slowdown but also with Apple's privacy changes to its mobile operating system, which have restricted Meta's ability to collect data on iPhone users to help target ads. It also faces steep competition from TikTok, which has soared in popularity over the past few years. And regulators have stepped up efforts to rein in the company by pushing for new laws that would limit Meta's data collection abilities.
Meta is also in the midst of a tricky transition to become a "metaverse" company, connecting people to an immersive digital world through virtual-reality headsets and applications. Mr. Zuckerberg sees the metaverse as the next-generation computing platform, so Meta has been spending billions of dollars on the effort and reallocating workers to its Reality Labs division, which is focused on products for the metaverse.
Yet it's unclear if people will want to use metaverse products. In recent months, the public has instead gravitated to chatbots, which are built on artificial intelligence. Meta has invested in A.I. for years but lately has not been at the center of the conversation about the technology.
Employees have been bracing for more layoffs for months, watching with anxiety as Mr. Zuckerberg embarked on a quest to dial back what he felt was no longer necessary to run the company, according to current and former employees. But the expectation was that he would take a light touch to his favored project of the metaverse.
Some Meta employees who were affected by Tuesday's announcement of layoffs -- especially in the recruiting division -- felt "gut-punched," according to current and former employees who have spoken with those in the organization.
"People are entering a job market that is the worst I've ever seen," said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. She said the staggered nature of Meta's cuts over the next two months was adding to employee anxiety.
"There's a lot of uncertainty," Ms. Sumner said. "There's a lot of anger, and there's the question many folks are asking: 'How do you expect me to do work for the next two months while wondering if I will still have a job?"'
In his announcement on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg laid out a vision for streamlining the company by removing layers of management, ending lower-priority projects and rebalancing product teams with a focus on engineering.
To that end, Mr. Zuckerberg wound down efforts on building NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, a cryptocurrency-based initiative that has dropped out of favor in recent months. Many of Mr. Zuckerberg's crypto initiatives in general have fallen by the wayside over the past nine months as the public has grown more skeptical of the market after the implosion of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange.
In his note, Mr. Zuckerberg added that the moves were a response to global conditions, including increased regulation, geopolitical instability, higher interest rates and a cooling economy.
"The world economy changed, competitive pressures grew and our growth slowed considerably," he said. "We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years."

In Pushing Frontiers of A.I., Start-Up Sets Its Sights on Reasoning: [National Desk]

Full text: Four months ago, a small San Francisco company became the talk of the technology industry when it introduced a new online chatbot that could answer complex questions, write poetry and even mimic human emotions.
Now the company is back with a new version of the technology that powers its chatbots. The system will up the ante in Silicon Valley's race to embrace artificial intelligence and decide who will be the next generation of leaders in the technology industry.
OpenAI, which has around 375 employees but has been backed with billions of dollars of investment from Microsoft and industry celebrities, said on Tuesday that it had released a technology that it calls GPT-4. It was designed to be the underlying engine that powers chatbots and all sorts of other systems, from search engines to personal online tutors.
Most people will use this technology through a new version of the company's ChatGPT chatbot, while businesses will incorporate it into a wide variety of systems, including business software and e-commerce websites. The technology already drives the chatbot available to a limited number of people using Microsoft's Bing search engine.
OpenAI's progress has, within just a few months, landed the technology industry in one of its most unpredictable moments in decades. Many industry leaders believe developments in A.I. represent a fundamental technological shift, as important as the creation of web browsers in the early 1990s. The rapid improvement has stunned computer scientists.
GPT-4, which learns its skills by analyzing huge amounts of data culled from the internet, improves on what powered the original ChatGPT in several ways. It is more precise. It can, for example, ace the Uniform Bar Exam, instantly calculate someone's tax liability and provide detailed descriptions of images.
But OpenAI's new technology still has some of the strangely humanlike shortcomings that have vexed industry insiders and unnerved people who have worked with the newest chatbots. It is an expert on some subjects and a dilettante on others. It can do better on standardized tests than most people and offer precise medical advice to doctors, but it can also mess up basic arithmetic.
Companies that bet their futures on the technology may -- at least for now -- have to put up with imprecision, which was long taboo in an industry built from the ground up on the notion that computers are more exacting than their human creators.
"I don't want to make it sound like we have solved reasoning or intelligence, which we certainly have not," Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, said in an interview. "But this is a big step forward from what is already out there."
Other tech companies are likely to include GPT-4's features in an array of products and services, including Microsoft's software for performing business tasks and e-commerce sites that want to give customers new ways of virtually trying out their products. A number of industry giants like Google and Facebook's parent company, Meta, are also working on their own chatbots and A.I. technology.
ChatGPT and similar technologies are already shifting the behavior of students and educators who are trying to understand whether the tools should be embraced or banned. Because the systems can write computer programs and perform other business tasks, they are also on the cusp of changing the nature of work.
Even the most impressive systems tend to complement skilled workers rather than replace them. The systems cannot be used in lieu of doctors, lawyers or accountants. Experts are still needed to spot their mistakes. But they could soon replace some paralegals (whose work is reviewed and edited by trained lawyers), and many A.I experts believe they will replace workers who moderate content on the internet.
"There is definitely disruption, which means some jobs go away and some new jobs get created," said Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president. "But I think the net effect is that barriers to entry go down, and the productivity of the experts goes up."
On Tuesday, OpenAI started selling access to GPT-4 so that businesses and other software developers could build their own applications on top of it. The company has also used the technology to build a new version of its popular chatbot, which is available to anyone who purchases access to ChatGPT Plus -- a subscription service priced at $ 20 a month.
A handful of companies are already working with GPT-4. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is building a system that will instantly retrieve information from company documents and other records, and serve it up to financial advisers in conversational prose. Khan Academy, an online education company, is using the technology to build an automated tutor.
"This new technology can act more like a tutor," said Khan Academy's chief executive and founder, Sal Khan. "We want it to teach the student new techniques while the student does most of the work."
Like similar technologies, the new system sometimes "hallucinates." It generates completely false information without warning. Asked for websites that lay out the latest in cancer research, it might give several internet addresses that do not exist.
GPT-4 is a neural network, a type of mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing data. It is the same technology that digital assistants like Siri use to recognizes spoken commands and self-driving cars use to identify pedestrians.
Around 2018, companies like Google and OpenAI began building neural networks that learned from enormous amounts of digital text, including books, Wikipedia articles, chat logs and other information posted to the internet. They are called large language models, or L.L.M.s.
By pinpointing billions of patterns in all that text, the L.L.M.s learn to generate text on their own, including tweets, poems and computer programs. OpenAI threw more and more data into its L.L.M. More data, the company hoped, would mean better answers.
OpenAI also refined this technology using feedback from human testers. As people tested ChatGPT, they rated the chatbot's responses, separating those that were useful and truthful from those that were not. Then, using a technique called reinforcement learning, the system spent months analyzing those ratings and gaining a better understanding of what it should and should not do.
"Humans rate which stuff they like to see and which stuff they don't like to see," said Luke Metz, an OpenAI researcher.
The original ChatGPT was based on a large language model called GPT-3.5. OpenAI's GPT-4 learned from significantly larger amounts of data.
OpenAI executives declined to disclose just how much data the new chatbot had learned from, but Mr. Brockman said the data set was "internet scale," meaning it spanned enough websites to provide a representative sample of all English speakers on the internet.
GPT-4's new capabilities may not be obvious to the average person first using the technology. But they are likely to quickly come into focus as laypeople and experts continue to use the service.
Given a lengthy article from The New York Times and asked to summarize it, the bot will give a precise summary nearly every time. Add a few random sentences to that summary and ask the chatbot if the revised summary is accurate, and it will point to the added sentences as the only inaccuracies.
Mr. Altman described the behavior as "reasoning." But the technology cannot duplicate human reasoning. It is good at analyzing, summarizing and answering complex questions about a book or news article. It is far less adept if asked about events that have not yet happened.
It can write a joke, but it does not show that it understands what will actually make someone laugh. "It doesn't grasp the nuance of what is funny," said Oren Etzioni, the founding chief executive of the Allen Institute for AI, a prominent lab in Seattle.
As with similar technologies, users may find ways of coaxing the system into strange and creepy behavior. Asked to imitate another person or playact, this kind of bot sometimes veers into areas it was designed to stay away from.
GPT-4 can also respond to images. Given a photograph, chart or diagram, the technology can provide a detailed, paragraphs-long description of the image and answer questions about its contents. It could be a useful technology for people who are visually impaired.
On a recent afternoon, Mr. Brockman showed how the system reacted to images. He gave the new chatbot an image from the Hubble Space Telescope and asked it to describe the photo "in painstaking detail." It responded with a four-paragraph description, which included an explanation of the ethereal white line that stretched across the photo. A "trail from a satellite or shooting star," the chatbot wrote.
OpenAI executives said the company was not immediately releasing the image description part of the technology because they were unsure how it could be misused.
Building and serving up chatbots is enormously expensive. Because it is trained on even larger amounts of data, OpenAI's new chatbot will increase the company's costs. Mira Murati, OpenAI's chief technology officer, said the company could curtail access to the service if it generated too much traffic.
But in the long term, OpenAI plans to build and deploy systems that can juggle multiple types of media, including sound and video as well as text and images.
"We can take all these general-purpose knowledge skills and spread them across all sorts of different areas," Mr. Brockman said. "This takes the technology into a whole new domain."

Wall Street Rises on Relief Over Banks: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A rebound in bank stocks provided a pause in the market panic over the health of the financial system.
Wall Street's worries eased on Tuesday, as investors took comfort from signs that a potential banking crisis appeared contained and bet on a more supportive environment for the economy going forward.
The S&P 500 rose 1.7 percent, lifted by a recovery in some bank stocks and bolstered by gains for heavyweights like Microsoft and Apple, which because of their size have a bigger impact on the performance of the broader index. More than three-quarters of the stocks in the index rose on Tuesday.
It's common for stocks to bounce after a substantial fall, as investors try to gauge where markets will shake out once a period of stress passes. Nonetheless, the lift in the market was a welcome reprieve for investors who have been battered by a rapidly shifting economic backdrop that has led to whipsaw moves across stock and bond markets.
One dominant narrative taking shape posits that the crisis in the banking sector may lead to a more supportive environment for markets. The fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank appears contained, and the episode may also give the Federal Reserve reason to forgo further interest rate increases. Higher interest rates raise costs for companies and were at the root of the stress in the banking sector, so fewer rate increases could help stocks to rebound.
"This is giving the Fed a reason to back off and adjust what they have done," said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. "Absent further deterioration in regional banks, I think the market is grasping at the Fed being given an excuse to pause and reassess."
Fresh inflation data on Tuesday appeared to show just enough cooling to support the case for a more restrained Fed. Consumer Price Index data released before trading began showed inflation slowing slightly for the year through February, despite accelerating from the previous month.
Investors' bets on whether the Fed will raise interest rates when it meets next week tilted back to expecting a quarter-point increase, after briefly flirting with no change, still markedly lower than where expectations stood a week ago. Investors now expect the central bank to raise interest rates to a peak of around 4.9 percent, down sharply from around 5.5 percent last week. That implies an expectation of one more quarter-point increase to come, down from as many as four such increases a week ago.
In the bond market, sentiment appeared less hopeful. The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, rose by more than 0.2 percentage points -- a big move for an asset that usually moves in tiny fractions of a percentage point. Tuesday's rise followed a deep fall on Monday that echoed painful flash points such as the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008.
Though the yield on the 10-year Treasury note still rose, it remained more anchored, suggesting fading hopes for economic growth over the long term.
"I think what is reflected in the bond market is an elevated risk of recession and a credit crunch, but for whatever reason it hasn't reached stock investors yet," Ms. Sonders said.
That dissonance makes predicting the path forward even harder, with some investors warning that financial markets could be headed for more days of volatile trading as investors make sense of the murky outlook.
"People are trying to gauge what the Fed is actually going to do given all the new information since the end of last week," said Charlie Ripley, a senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management. "I think there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty. The Fed really has a dilemma on its hands here."

‘Let 1,000 Flowers Bloom’: AI Funding Frenzy Escalates

SAN FRANCISCO — When four leading artificial intelligence researchers left Google this year to create a startup called Mobius AI, they weren’t sure what their product might be — just that it would involve AI technology that could generate its own photos and videos.
Within about a week, two of Silicon Valley’s top venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz and Index Ventures, had swooped in with a funding offer, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
Suddenly, Mobius — little more than four guys and a laptop — was valued around $100 million, an usually high number for a startup that was just a week or so old, the people said. When word of the deal leaked out, other investors descended to urge Mobius to take their money too, they said.
Over the past few months, a gold rush into startups working on “generative” artificial intelligence has escalated into a no-holds-barred deal-making mania. The interest has mounted so rapidly that AI startup valuations are soaring beyond that of 2021’s “everything bubble,” with investors trawling the rosters of companies like Google, Meta and OpenAI for AI experts who may have an itch to start their own company.
The funding race has heated up ever since ChatGPT, the chatbot made by OpenAI, went viral last year by showing the power of AI to generate its own tweets, emails, articles, answers and ideas. Even as investors expect last week’s failure of Silicon Valley Bank, an institution that many tech startups relied on, to cast a pall over startup funding, there is still a mismatch between the number of opportunities in artificial intelligence and the money available to fund them.
That’s because of the scarcity of AI companies and the potential of the technology. With few experts in the field, and most of them working at a handful of big tech companies, only a few generative AI startups — such as Stability AI and Jasper — have broken out. Investors desperate for the next big thing are competing fiercely to invest in these companies, offering some AI entrepreneurs nine-figure valuations for little more than an idea and a resume.
“We’re in that phase of the market where it’s, like, let 1,000 flowers bloom,” said Matt Turck, an investor who specializes in AI at venture firm FirstMark. He added that the deal-making stood out in an otherwise dreary moment for tech marked by layoffs, cost-cutting and a drought of initial public offerings.
Andreessen Horowitz did not respond to a request to comment. Index Ventures declined to comment on Mobius’ funding.
The blooming flowers include Dust, a startup founded by former employees of OpenAI. Dust is nearing a $5 million funding round led by Sequoia Capital that will value it at $30 million to $40 million, two people with knowledge of the situation said. The round was competitive, with term sheets offering valuations as high as twice that, one of the people said.
Perplexity AI, a startup created by former employees of OpenAI, Google and Meta, is raising $20 million to $25 million, led by NEA, that values the company at about $150 million, two people familiar with the situation said. And LangChain, a startup working on software that helps other companies incorporate AI into their products, has raised funding from Benchmark, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
Those follow the $13 billion that OpenAI raised from Microsoft, including $10 billion in January, and $300 million raised this year by Anthropic, another AI startup.
Dust and LangChain declined to comment. Various aspects of the funding rounds were earlier reported by Business Insider, The Information and Newcomer.
At Y Combinator, a startup incubator, at least 50 of the 218 companies in the current program are working on generative AI, according to a tally taken by Truewind, an AI bookkeeping startup that is part of the program. Alex Lee, Truewind’s CEO, said ChatGPT had helped investors, potential customers and potential employees understand the possibilities of the technology.
“Before, you’d go in and say, ‘We’re doing something with AI,’ and it’s hard to picture exactly what that looks like,” Lee said. “Now, they say, ‘Oh, I’ve played with ChaptGPT, and I can imagine how I could use this in my world.’”
He declined to comment on his company’s fundraising before Y Combinator’s demo day, when companies pitch investors, in April.
Even though more mature AI startups have already raised large sums, they can’t afford to ignore the latest overtures from investors, said Mike Volpi, an investor at Index Ventures who sits on the board of the AI startup Cohere.
That’s partly because AI technologies like ChatGPT, which learn by analyzing vast amounts of digital data, require a lot of computing power, which is expensive. Volpi estimated that startups needed at least $500 million to develop their own large language model, the technology that underpins ChatGPT.
At a tech conference in Los Angeles organized by investment firm Upfront Ventures this month, AI was inescapable. The event began with a goofy video skit about a venture capitalist giving a ChatGPT-generated speech. It quickly went off the rails, with the investor confidently regurgitating incorrect information from the bot as the punchline.
Speakers — including former Vice President Al Gore; Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce; and V Pappas, a top executive at TikTok — weighed in from there, mostly by hailing the technology’s transformative potential. A panel of AI specialists said they welcomed the sudden attention, with Phil Blunsom, head of science at Cohere, noting that he has worked on language modeling for 20 years and that, until recently, “absolutely no one was interested in it.”
Some investors debated whether AI startups would get run over by more established players with deeper pockets. Given the steep computing costs, some said big players like Microsoft and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, had too much of an advantage. Google bought the AI lab DeepMind, which is developing a wide range of technologies as an Alphabet subsidiary, in 2014 for $650 million.
Last week, Salesforce announced a $250 million fund for investing in generative AI startups, alongside new investments in Cohere, Anthropic and others.
“There are a few times in technology where you really see a generational leap forward with revolutionary technology,” said John Somorjai, who leads Salesforce’s venture investments. “These companies are the next trillion-dollar opportunities in software.”
Sam Lessin, a venture capitalist at Slow Ventures, said he didn’t think the tech advances in AI translated to opportunities for startups. The best way to invest in AI, Lessin said, is to buy the publicly traded stocks of Big Tech companies.
“The absolute vast majority of the spoils will go to the incumbents,” he said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

OpenAI Plans to Up the Ante in Tech’s AI Race

SAN FRANCISCO — Four months ago, a small San Francisco company became the talk of the technology industry when it introduced a new online chatbot that could answer complex questions, write poetry and even mimic human emotions.
Now the company is back with a new version of the technology that powers its chatbots. The system will up the ante in Silicon Valley’s race to embrace artificial intelligence and decide who will be the next generation of leaders in the technology industry.
OpenAI, which has around 375 employees but has been backed with billions of dollars of investment from Microsoft and industry celebrities, said Tuesday that it had released a technology that it calls GPT-4. It was designed to be the underlying engine that powers chatbots and all sorts of other systems, from search engines to personal online tutors.
Most people will use this technology through a new version of the company’s ChatGPT chatbot, while businesses will incorporate it into a wide variety of systems, including business software and e-commerce websites. The technology already drives the chatbot available to a limited number of people using Microsoft’s Bing search engine.
OpenAI’s progress has, within just a few months, landed the technology industry in one of its most unpredictable moments in decades. Many industry leaders believe developments in AI represent a fundamental technological shift, as important as the creation of web browsers in the early 1990s. The rapid improvement has stunned computer scientists.
GPT-4, which learns its skills by analyzing huge amounts of data culled from the internet, improves on what powered the original ChatGPT in several ways. It is more precise. It can, for example, ace the Uniform Bar Exam, instantly calculate someone’s tax liability and provide detailed descriptions of images.
But OpenAI’s new technology still has some of the strangely humanlike shortcomings that have vexed industry insiders and unnerved people who have worked with the newest chatbots. It is an expert on some subjects and a dilettante on others. It can do better on standardized tests than most people and offer precise medical advice to doctors, but it can also mess up basic arithmetic.
Companies that bet their futures on the technology may — at least for now — have to put up with imprecision, which was long taboo in an industry built from the ground up on the notion that computers are more exacting than their human creators.
“I don’t want to make it sound like we have solved reasoning or intelligence, which we certainly have not,” Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, said in an interview. “But this is a big step forward from what is already out there.”
Other tech companies are likely to include GPT-4’s features in an array of products and services, including Microsoft’s software for performing business tasks and e-commerce sites that want to give customers new ways of virtually trying out their products. A number of industry giants like Google and Facebook’s parent company, Meta, are also working on their own chatbots and AI technology.
ChatGPT and similar technologies are already shifting the behavior of students and educators who are trying to understand whether the tools should be embraced or banned. Because the systems can write computer programs and perform other business tasks, they are also on the cusp of changing the nature of work.
Even the most impressive systems tend to complement skilled workers rather than replace them. The systems cannot be used in lieu of doctors, lawyers or accountants. Experts are still needed to spot their mistakes. But they could soon replace some paralegals (whose work is reviewed and edited by trained lawyers), and many AI experts believe they will replace workers who moderate content on the internet.
“There is definitely disruption, which means some jobs go away and some new jobs get created,” said Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president. “But I think the net effect is that barriers to entry go down, and the productivity of the experts goes up.”
On Tuesday, OpenAI started selling access to GPT-4 so that businesses and other software developers could build their own applications on top of it. The company has also used the technology to build a new version of its popular chatbot, which is available to anyone who purchases access to ChatGPT Plus — a subscription service priced at $20 a month.
A handful of companies are already working with GPT-4. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is building a system that will instantly retrieve information from company documents and other records, and serve it up to financial advisers in conversational prose. Khan Academy, an online education company, is using the technology to build an automated tutor.
“This new technology can act more like a tutor,” said Khan Academy’s CEO and founder, Sal Khan. “We want it to teach the student new techniques while the student does most of the work.”
Like similar technologies, the new system sometimes “hallucinates.” It generates completely false information without warning. Asked for websites that lay out the latest in cancer research, it might give several internet addresses that do not exist.
GPT-4 is a neural network, a type of mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing data. It is the same technology that digital assistants like Siri use to recognizes spoken commands and self-driving cars use to identify pedestrians.
Around 2018, companies like Google and OpenAI began building neural networks that learned from enormous amounts of digital text, including books, Wikipedia articles, chat logs and other information posted to the internet. They are called large language models, or LLMs.
By pinpointing billions of patterns in all that text, the LLMs learn to generate text on their own, including tweets, poems and computer programs. OpenAI threw more and more data into its LLM More data, the company hoped, would mean better answers.
OpenAI also refined this technology using feedback from human testers. As people tested ChatGPT, they rated the chatbot’s responses, separating those that were useful and truthful from those that were not. Then, using a technique called reinforcement learning, the system spent months analyzing those ratings and gaining a better understanding of what it should and should not do.
“Humans rate which stuff they like to see and which stuff they don’t like to see,” said Luke Metz, an OpenAI researcher.
The original ChatGPT was based on a large language model called GPT-3.5. OpenAI’s GPT-4 learned from significantly larger amounts of data.
OpenAI executives declined to disclose just how much data the new chatbot had learned from, but Brockman said the data set was “internet scale,” meaning it spanned enough websites to provide a representative sample of all English speakers on the internet.
GPT-4’s new capabilities may not be obvious to the average person first using the technology. But they are likely to quickly come into focus as laypeople and experts continue to use the service.
Given a lengthy article from The New York Times and asked to summarize it, the bot will give a precise summary nearly every time. Add a few random sentences to that summary and ask the chatbot if the revised summary is accurate, and it will point to the added sentences as the only inaccuracies.
Altman described the behavior as “reasoning.” But the technology cannot duplicate human reasoning. It is good at analyzing, summarizing and answering complex questions about a book or news article. It is far less adept if asked about events that have not yet happened.
It can write a joke, but it does not show that it understands what will actually make someone laugh. “It doesn’t grasp the nuance of what is funny,” said Oren Etzioni, the founding CEO of the Allen Institute for AI, a prominent lab in Seattle.
As with similar technologies, users may find ways of coaxing the system into strange and creepy behavior. Asked to imitate another person or playact, this kind of bot sometimes veers into areas it was designed to stay away from.
GPT-4 can also respond to images. Given a photograph, chart or diagram, the technology can provide a detailed, paragraphs-long description of the image and answer questions about its contents. It could be a useful technology for people who are visually impaired.
On a recent afternoon, Brockman showed how the system reacted to images. He gave the new chatbot an image from the Hubble Space Telescope and asked it to describe the photo “in painstaking detail.” It responded with a four-paragraph description, which included an explanation of the ethereal white line that stretched across the photo. A “trail from a satellite or shooting star,” the chatbot wrote.
OpenAI executives said the company was not immediately releasing the image description part of the technology because they were unsure how it could be misused.
Building and serving up chatbots is enormously expensive. Because it is trained on even larger amounts of data, OpenAI’s new chatbot will increase the company’s costs. Mira Murati, OpenAI’s chief technology officer, said the company could curtail access to the service if it generated too much traffic.
But in the long term, OpenAI plans to build and deploy systems that can juggle multiple types of media, including sound and video as well as text and images.
“We can take all these general-purpose knowledge skills and spread them across all sorts of different areas,” Brockman said. “This takes the technology into a whole new domain.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

SAN FRANCISCO — Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said Tuesday that it planned to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13% of its workforce, the latest move to hew to what the company’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has called a “year of efficiency.”
The layoffs will affect Meta’s recruiting team this week, with a restructuring of its tech and business groups to come in April and May, Zuckerberg said in a memo posted on the company’s website. The announcement is the company’s second round of cuts within the past half year. In November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 people, or about 13% of its workforce at the time.
Meta also plans to close about 5,000 job postings that have yet to be filled, Zuckerberg said in the memo. Other restructuring efforts include a plan to wrap up this summer an analysis of Meta’s hybrid return-to-office model, which it began testing in March 2022.
“This will be tough and there’s no way around that,” he wrote.
Meta’s stock rose more than 7% by the close of trading Tuesday.
Zuckerberg is culling employees after years of hiring at a breakneck pace. His company gobbled up workers as its family of apps, which also includes WhatsApp, became popular worldwide. The coronavirus pandemic also supercharged the use of mobile apps, leading to more growth. At its peak last year, Meta had 87,000 full-time employees.
But as the global economy soured and digital advertising markets contracted last year, Zuckerberg began putting an end to unchecked growth. Meta trimmed employee perks. And after the layoffs in November, which largely affected the business divisions and recruiting teams, Zuckerberg hinted at further cuts.
On an earnings call in February, the CEO said he did not want the company to be overstuffed with a layer of middle management, or “managers managing managers.” He said he took responsibility for last year’s layoffs, blaming his zeal for staffing up on the surge of use early in the pandemic.
Meta’s layoffs are part of a wave of job cuts from the biggest tech companies. In recent months, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce and others have also said they are trimming their ranks, and some of the companies have increased the number of people they are letting go after initial announcements. Many of the companies have cited a challenging global economic environment for their actions.
But even beyond the macroeconomic conditions, Meta is dealing with many challenges. It is grappling not only with a digital advertising slowdown but also with Apple’s privacy changes to its mobile operating system, which have restricted Meta’s ability to collect data on iPhone users to help target ads. It also faces steep competition from TikTok, which has soared in popularity over the past few years. And regulators have stepped up efforts to rein in the company by pushing for new laws that would limit Meta’s data collection abilities.
Meta is also in the midst of a tricky transition to become a “metaverse” company, connecting people to an immersive digital world through virtual-reality headsets and applications. Zuckerberg sees the metaverse as the next-generation computing platform, so Meta has been spending billions of dollars on the effort and reallocating workers to its Reality Labs division, which is focused on products for the metaverse.
Yet it’s unclear if people will want to use metaverse products. In recent months, the public has instead gravitated to chatbots, which are built on artificial intelligence. Meta has invested in AI for years but has not lately been at the center of the conversation about the technology.
Employees have been bracing for more layoffs for months, watching with anxiety as Zuckerberg embarked on a quest to dial back what he felt was no longer necessary to run the company, according to current and former employees. But the expectation was that he would take a light touch to his favored project of the metaverse.
Some Meta employees who were affected by Tuesday’s announcement of layoffs — especially in the recruiting division — felt “gut-punched,” according to current and former employees who have spoken with those in the organization.
“People are entering a job market that is the worst I’ve ever seen,” said Erin Sumner, a global director of human resources at DeleteMe, who was laid off from Facebook in November. She said the staggered nature of Meta’s cuts over the next two months was adding to employee anxiety.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty,” Sumner said. “There’s a lot of anger, and there’s the question many folks are asking: ‘How do you expect me to do work for the next two months while wondering if I will still have a job?’”
In his announcement Tuesday, Zuckerberg laid out a vision for streamlining the company by removing layers of management, ending lower-priority projects and rebalancing product teams with a focus on engineering.
To that end, Zuckerberg wound down efforts on building NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, a cryptocurrency-based initiative that has dropped out of favor in recent months. Many of Zuckerberg’s crypto initiatives in general have fallen by the wayside over the past nine months as the public has grown more skeptical of the market after the implosion of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.
In his note, Zuckerberg added that the moves were a response to global conditions, including increased regulation, geopolitical instability, higher interest rates and a cooling economy.
“The world economy changed, competitive pressures grew, and our growth slowed considerably,” he said. “We should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years.”

Full text: The connection that Kirsten Erwin and Ricardo Kozuchowicz had when they first met was quickly overshadowed by his struggles to remain in the country.
Kirsten Paige Erwin said she felt an immediate sense of calm on her first date with Ricardo Kozuchowicz in March 2017.
The two met for dinner at the Saint, a now-closed Mexican restaurant in Seattle, after connecting on a dating app. But while their easy connection was developing, so was Mr. Kozuchowicz's struggle to secure a visa and stay in the country.
Mr. Kozuchowicz, 35, is from São Paulo, Brazil. He received a bachelor's degree in economics at Fundação Getulio Vargas, a Brazilian higher education institute, before moving to the United States at 26 to pursue an M.B.A. from Duke University. He is now the corporate finance lead at Mercury, a San Francisco-based financial technology company that provides banking for start-ups.
Ms. Erwin, 38, grew up in Tacoma, Wash. She has a bachelor's degree in art and Spanish from Willamette University and is a senior art director at Slice, a technology platform based in New York City for small-scale pizzerias.

When they met, Mr. Kozuchowicz was working as a finance manager for Microsoft on a one-year extension of his student visa. He had been hoping for a work visa but, while getting to know Ms. Erwin, he began to realize that chances of this were slim.
A few months after their first date, he learned he was not granted the visa. He made plans to relocate to Vancouver on a Canadian working permit in the summer of 2017. Ms. Erwin helped him pack and their relationship became long distance.
It was unclear when he would be able to come back to the country. Ms. Erwin described the time apart as an exercise in mindfulness. "You can't control a relationship and you really can't control the U.S. government," she said. "I had to go day by day and ask, 'Do I still want to be here?"' Each time, she said, her answer was yes.
Good news came in the form of a work visa for Mr. Kozuchowicz in the fall of 2018 and a return to Seattle for the Microsoft job in January 2019. The couple chose to live independently for a year while they considered their future.
While the work visa was welcome, Mr. Kozuchowicz said that there was still another piece missing. His visa only allowed him to stay in the country if he remained with the same company. In December 2019, he was granted a green card -- the missing piece -- and his possibilities expanded.
They moved in together in Seattle in 2020 and, in early 2021, relocated to New York City, in part to establish themselves somewhere new. They settled on an apartment in the West Village where they still live today. With the move came a sense of increased commitment to their relationship and, according to Ms. Erwin, "the word 'marriage' began to slip in" to their conversations.
In November 2021, Mr. Kozuchowicz began designing an engagement ring with a jeweler. He chose a black diamond and a pink sapphire since he knew Ms. Erwin would want something colorful.
There was a snowstorm the day the ring arrived in January 2022. The couple went for a walk in Washington Square Park and came across a group having a snowball fight by the fountain. They found their way to a quieter area and Mr. Kozuchowicz proposed.
When it came to planning a wedding, the couple wanted to join their different backgrounds. Besides growing up in separate countries with different languages, Mr. Kozuchowicz is Jewish and Ms. Erwin is not religious. Their officiant was Rabbi Bradley Bleefeld of Temple Beth Hillel-Beth Abraham in Millville, N.J., who specializes in interfaith and international couples.
Their wedding on Feb. 25 was held in the Palm House of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden for about 150 guests. It was also the first time most of their family members met. Even though they are not traditional in many Brazilian weddings, both of Mr. Kozuchowicz's parents gave speeches -- in English, even though the couple insisted Portuguese would be fine.
Ms. Erwin's parents jumped on board as well. Her father, a "really reserved guy" was hoisted into the air for the hora, holding his chair with one hand and lifting the other "like he was in a rodeo," Ms. Erwin said. "I couldn't believe it when I saw him up there."

To Start Big Week, Wall St. Holds Steady: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/start-big-week-wall-st-holds-steady/docview/2783549584/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks were mixed in quiet trading on Monday as Wall Street stays in a holding pattern ahead of a potentially big week.
The S&P 500 rose 2.78 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,048.42 after coming off its first winning week in the last four. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 40.47, or 0.1 percent, to 33,431.44, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 13.27, or 0.1 percent, to 11,675.74.
The stock market has found some footing over the last week after a roller-coaster start to the year in which a swift rise gave way to a sharp tumble. At the center of it all has been high inflation and expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do about it.
Early in the year, stocks rallied and bond yields eased as hopes rose that cooling inflation would get the Fed to take it easier on its increases to interest rates. Then, stronger-than-expected reports on the economy raised worries that inflation was not cooling as smoothly as hoped.
While that calmed worries about an imminent recession, it also forced Wall Street to raise its forecasts for how high the Fed would take interest rates. Higher rates can drive down inflation, but they also hurt prices for stocks and other investments and could create a recession in the future.
On Monday, Treasury yields held relatively steady following their own roller-coaster movements this year. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was at 3.97 percent after topping 4 percent last week and reaching its highest level since November. It helps set rates for mortgages and other loans central to the economy's strength.
On Wall Street, technology stocks were some of the market's strongest. They tend to be some of the biggest beneficiaries of lower interest rates, which can boost demand by investors for high-growth companies.
Apple rose 1.9 percent, and Microsoft ticked up 0.6 percent to be the two biggest forces lifting the S&P 500.
On the losing end was Tesla, which fell 2 percent. Over the weekend, it cut the prices of two of its most expensive vehicles.
Bigger action may be ahead later this week, with several potentially market-moving events on the calendar.
Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, will testify before Congress for two days, beginning on Tuesday. Other Fed officials' comments have recently led to big swings in markets, as traders try to get ahead of the next moves by the Fed.
Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Allspring Global Investments, said he was not expecting anything surprising from the testimony. That was partly because an important data release was scheduled for later in the week on Friday, one that could by itself cause a big swing in the Fed's thinking.
That is when the government will release its latest monthly jobs report. If the reading is stronger than expected, particularly if it shows a big gain in wages, it could shake Wall Street and raise rate expectations even higher.
The Fed has been trying to cool growth in wages to remove pressure on inflation, which remains far above its 2 percent target, and blowout figures could cause it to get more aggressive about rates.
The Fed's next move on rates will arrive later this month. In addition to Friday's jobs report, upcoming releases on inflation across the economy will likely also carry a lot of weight for the decision.
The Fed has pulled its key overnight rate to a range of 4.50 percent to 4.75 percent, up from virtually zero at the start of last year, in its fastest set of increases in decades. Last month, it dialed down the size of its increases and highlighted progress being made in the battle to reduce inflation.
But that was before last month's string of hotter-than-expected data on inflation and other measures of the economy. Wall Street now is bracing for at least three more increases, possibly larger ones.

The Heirs to 'Dilbert' Emerge on TikTok and Instagram: [Correction]

Full text: They weren't fans of the comic strip, which was recently dropped from hundreds of newspapers, but their work builds on the office grind as comic premise.
Nothing about work is funny. Except when everything about work is funny.
Cubicle dwellers love to laugh through their pain -- even when that cubicle is actually a desk chair at a dining table at home.
For decades, comedy about the drudgery and absurdity of corporate life has resonated with wide audiences. "Office Space" remains a cult classic decades after its release. According to Nielsen, in 2020 viewers streamed 57 billion minutes of "The Office," which premiered in the United States in 2005.
And "Dilbert," which followed the titular engineer through various white-collar woes, was syndicated in hundreds of newspapers across the country until this week, when the comic strip was widely dropped after its creator Scott Adams's racist rant on a YouTube livestream. For some, it was no surprise that Dilbert was disappearing -- a bigger surprise was that "Dilbert" was still a thing more than 40 years after it was created (especially given Mr. Adams's history of offensive remarks).
But the material -- life under the glare of fluorescents, the joys of middle management -- provides eternal inspiration and fellow feeling.
"When workplace comedies poke fun at these shared experiences and identities, they reinforce a sense of camaraderie," said Jennifer Aaker, a Stanford business professor and co-author of "Humor, Seriously." Her colleague and co-author, Naomi Bagdonas, added that workplace humor, including on social media, can help people deal with the "exceptionally unfunny times" we are living in. "When many are experiencing stress and burnout, humor can be particularly effective at boosting morale and productivity," she said.
A new generation of comedians is creating content that responds to and sends up the shifting norms of work. On TikTok and Instagram, memes and videos lampooning everything from Zoom etiquette to Gen Z email signoffs and layoffs are going viral.
DeAndre Brown, 23, who refers to himself as "The Corporate Baddie" on Instagram and TikTok, said that his videos about bosses asking employees to turn on their Zoom cameras always get a lot of views. "So many of us are experiencing the same things," he said, adding, "It's super relatable."
Mr. Brown said he thought his comedy resonated in part because "there is a huge conversation happening about Gen Z in the work force." He added, "My generation is entering at a time when people are starting to question their jobs."
In one recent TikTok, Mr. Brown slams shut his laptop and uncorks a bottle of wine with his teeth the moment the clock strikes 5. "When the time hits 5 consider me dead!" the caption reads. Many comments are from people agreeing with and supporting this boundary-setting energy.
But it is the internet, so people do often have something negative to say. "A lot of older generations feel like Gen Z is entitled, we'll never get anywhere in life, our mind-set is not feasible for a productive corporate environment," he said. But he added that he also receives comments saying that the future looks brighter because of Gen Z's approach.
Laura Whaley, 28, who has amassed 2.3 million Instagram followers and 3.1 million TikTok followers, portrays a series of co-worker characters in different wigs and hats -- including "the person that creeps their co-workers' calendars" and "the person who works during their time off." (In both, a Dolly Parton-esque character named Donna Sue offers support, recalling the classic pro-working woman comedy "9 to 5.")
Ms. Whaley posts about the trials of remote work, including the tiresome experience of telling a co-worker he's on mute (again). She said that "with the pandemic speeding up the evolution of work, there were a whole lot of new things coming to the surface that were relatable for a lot of us."
Christian Maldonado, 28, had just left a job at a car dealership in North Carolina when the pandemic began. After becoming active on TikTok during a period of unemployment, he started a corporate job at a software company. In 2021, he started sprinkling workplace jokes into his posts, noting that videos about bosses and paid time off performed well. He also satirized retail jobs, showing a manager shift from scolding to obsequious in front of a customer. (Mr. Maldonado played all three roles.)
"I get ideas from my audience," he said. "They comment their experiences they've had at past workplaces."
Rod Thill, 32, who posts about corporate life to some 1.6 million followers on TikTok (and nearly a million followers on Instagram), said that millennials, in particular, have grown up seeing corporate drudgery portrayed in television and movies. But while shows like "The Office" develop characters across seasons, social media creators may have just a few seconds to craft a persona or tell a joke. "It's still the same relatability but the execution is different," he said.
Mr. Thill added that content about mental health at work resonates with his audience -- and that followers tend to share posts about work friends. "When you talk about your work bestie, they're sending it to their work bestie," he said.
Though cubicle comedy tends to focus on the indignities of life as a corporate underling, some corporations have started partnering with the creators that lampoon them.
Natalie Marshall, 25, who posts as @CorporateNatalie, parlayed her 492,000 TikTok followers and 473,000 Instagram followers into a job consulting with tech companies and doing sponsored posts for brands like Dell.
"While I'm making fun of work from home, @CorporateNatalie is incredibly brand friendly," Ms. Marshall said. She added that many brands like to use humor to appear relatable to their audiences, and said that her own audience included millennial professionals with strong buying power.
Ross Pomerantz, 33, began posting as his character "Corporate Bro" after gathering inspiration from his time working in sales at Oracle. "I wanted to be the modern video version of Dilbert," he said. But given the events of last week, he said, he now cringes at the comic.
Mr. Pomerantz now does speaking engagements for corporations, especially at sales events. Why would a company in a sector he lampoons invite him to speak? "Self-awareness wins these days," he said. "People are so sick of the tone deaf, out of touch C.E.O."
Even some people who work in human resources -- who might be expected to balk at the jokes -- are in on the fun.
Jamie Jackson, who works in H.R. for a start-up in Nashville, started her meme page @HumorousResources in September 2020. "Millennials especially really gravitate toward memes. They're like our comics now," she said.
"Any time I post hybrid memes -- I look like this at home vs. this at the office -- those always get millions of hits," said Ms. Jackson, 41, adding, "People will say 'accurate,' 'relatable,' all those comments."
The logo of @HumorousResources is a sketch of a hand extending a middle finger -- not at anyone in particular, just at the concept of at corporate life. On a recent Microsoft Teams call, a gold-embossed statue of the logo was visible in Ms. Jackson's home.
Ms. Jackson held a pair of Crocs: They were adorned with a charm version of the logo, too.
"We are at our jobs so much of the time," she said, so she likes to have fun with the humorous parts of work. "Let's be honest, we are all just living on a rock floating through space."

Amazon Pauses Work On Campus In Virginia: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The delay is the latest reminder that the tech industry's pandemic-fueled boom has slowed and another indicator of how remote work has changed office-space needs.
When Amazon said in 2018 that it planned to build a second headquarters in Virginia, along with a sister office complex in New York, it was a symbolic moment for the tech industry's increasing importance to the American economy.
But the company's decision made public on Friday to pause plans in Virginia -- about four years after Amazon pulled out of its campus in New York -- is the latest reminder that the tech industry's long boom has slowed.
It is also another indication that the pandemic may have permanently changed office work, presenting new challenges to communities that had counted on the growth of tech offices.
The decision to delay a large part of the prominent construction project, which it called HQ2, came as Amazon and other big tech employers have made the most significant cuts to their work forces in at least 15 years.
The companies are also struggling to figure out what to do with their offices as their workers continue to spend at least part of the time working from home. Nearly three years after the pandemic shut down workplaces, few tech companies have required their employees to return to the office full time.
"For HQ2 to be on pause is emblematic of the pause that tech has hit all across the industry," said Jeffrey D. Shulman, a marketing professor at the University of Washington who has researched Amazon's impact on Seattle, its hometown. "HQ2 is the perfect emblem of where we were and where we are, and just how different they are."
The HQ2 project has several clusters of development in Virginia, just over the Potomac River from Washington. The pause will affect PenPlace, the second and larger stage, which would build a mix of office towers, open space and a signature, spiraling glass building Amazon calls the Helix.
Construction on the first phase, a nearby complex known as Met Park, contains two office towers and is scheduled to open for employees in June.
The pullback makes future investments by developers and small business uncertain, Mr. Shulman said. "It has rippling effects where there is now shaken confidence in something that seemed like a can't miss when they announced it," he said.
The construction delay was reported earlier by Bloomberg News and confirmed on Friday by Amazon's real estate chief, John Schoettler. "We're always evaluating space plans to make sure they fit our business needs," he said in a statement.
He said the company had already hired more than 8,000 employees in HQ2 and planned to eventually bring 25,000 corporate and tech jobs to the region.
After Amazon rapidly expanded to meet the pandemic's boom in online shopping and services, Andy Jassy, who took over as Amazon's chief executive in July 2021, has spent the past year pushing the company to trim costs.
Last summer, amid the cost-cutting and uncertainty of how hybrid work would shake out, Amazon put the brakes on building several towers in Bellevue, Wash., near its headquarters in Seattle. It had planned to have space for 25,000 employees in the new offices.
Then in November, Amazon began plans to layoff about 10,000 workers, only to expand the number of layoffs in January to 18,000.
Tech companies, roiled by their biggest work force contraction since the dot-com bust and continued remote work, have pulled back on their expansion plans, which has allowed them reduce real estate costs.
Google backed out of a large project to build space for 6,000 workers near Seattle as it announced layoffs in January, and Microsoft has delayed some work on its overhaul of its headquarters campus. Yelp vacated its headquarters in San Francisco, where Salesforce has cut back on leases as well.
The pullback, combined with the persistence of employees working remotely, has hobbled cities that relied on tech workers to frequent cafes, doggy day cares, and transit.
Last month, Mr. Jassy wrote in a letter to employees that most corporate staff would be expected to return to the office three days a week starting on May 1. It caused grumbling from many Amazon workers, but cheering from city officials in Seattle and Bellevue.
"Events really did change," said Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto who has studied urban development and tech for more than two decades. "We did have a pandemic, remote work became a thing. But I think this is yet another cautionary tale, perhaps the ultimate cautionary tale, of not betting a whole community on a company."
The slowdown at Amazon's HQ2 is perhaps the most indicative of how quickly the tides have changed from its ambitions of just a few years ago. Amazon kicked off an international frenzy in 2017 when it announced its search for a second headquarters, saying it wanted to find a place where it could expand to house 50,000 employees. Hundreds of cities and towns around North America threw themselves at Amazon, hoping to attract what were seen as well-paid jobs of the future.
But long-shot hopes were dashed in late 2018, when Amazon announced that it would be split the second headquarters equally between Queens and Arlington, Va., two metro areas where Amazon already had more employees than anywhere else outside of Seattle and the Bay Area.
At the time, the company said that the developments would require $ 5 billion in construction and other investments. Amazon was offered more than $ 2 billion in tax incentives from New York and Virginia.
The tax breaks, and concerns over gentrification, caused fierce community, union and political pushback over the campus in Long Island City, and in early 2019, Amazon canceled its plans for the Queens campus.
The company said it might still pursue permits and other pre-construction work on the second phase of the project in Virginia later this year.
"We continue to work with Amazon to advance plans for Pen Place, and look forward to helping Amazon realize its complete vision for HQ2," Matt Kelly, the chief executive of JBG Smith, the developer of the project, said in a statement.

A.I. Regulation Can Be Puzzle To Lawmakers: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tech innovations are again racing ahead of Washington's ability to regulate them, lawmakers and A.I. experts said.
In recent weeks, two members of Congress have sounded the alarm over the dangers of artificial intelligence.
Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, wrote in a guest essay in The New York Times in January that he was "freaked out" by the ability of the ChatGPT chatbot to mimic human writers. Another Democrat, Representative Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts, gave a one-minute speech -- written by a chatbot -- calling for regulation of A.I.
But even as lawmakers put a spotlight on the technology, few are taking action on it. No bill has been proposed to protect individuals or thwart the development of A.I.'s potentially dangerous aspects. And legislation introduced in recent years to curb A.I. applications like facial recognition have withered in Congress.
The problem is that most lawmakers do not even know what A.I. is, said Representative Jay Obernolte, a California Republican and the only member of Congress with a master's degree in artificial intelligence.
"Before regulation, there needs to be agreement on what the dangers are, and that requires a deep understanding of what A.I. is," he said. "You'd be surprised how much time I spend explaining to my colleagues that the chief dangers of A.I. will not come from evil robots with red lasers coming out of their eyes."
The inaction over A.I. is part of a familiar pattern, in which technology is again outstripping U.S. rule-making and regulation. Lawmakers have long struggled to understand new innovations, once describing the internet as a "series of tubes." For just as long, companies have worked to slow down regulations, saying the industry needs few roadblocks as the United States competes with China for tech leadership.
That means Washington is taking a hands-off stance as an A.I. boom has gripped Silicon Valley, with Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta racing one another to develop the technology. The spread of A.I., which has spawned chatbots that can write poetry and cars that drive themselves, has provoked a debate over its limits, with some fearing that the technology can eventually replace humans in jobs or even become sentient.
Carly Kind, director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, a London organization focused on the responsible use of technology, said a lack of regulation encouraged companies to put a priority on financial and commercial interests at the expense of safety.
"By failing to establish such guardrails, policymakers are creating the conditions for a race to the bottom in irresponsible A.I.," she said.
In the regulatory vacuum, the European Union has taken a leadership role. In 2021, E.U. policymakers proposed a law focused on regulating the A.I. technologies that might create the most harm, such as facial recognition and applications linked to critical public infrastructure like the water supply. The measure, which is expected to be passed as soon as this year, would require makers of A.I. to conduct risk assessments of how their applications could affect health, safety and individual rights, like freedom of expression.
Companies that violated the law could be fined up to 6 percent of their global revenue, which could total billions of dollars for the world's largest tech platforms. E.U. policymakers said the law was needed to maximize artificial intelligence's benefits while minimizing its societal risks.
"We're at the beginning of understanding this technology and weighing its great benefits and potential dangers," said Representative Donald S. Beyer Jr., Democrat of Virginia, who recently began taking evening college classes on A.I.
Mr. Beyer said U.S. lawmakers would examine the European bill for ideas on regulation and added, "This will take time."
In fact, the federal government has been deeply involved in A.I. for more than six decades. In the 1960s, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA, began funding research and development of the technology. The support helped lead to military applications like drones and cybersecurity tools.
Criticism of A.I. was largely muted in Washington until January 2015 when the physicist Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and now the owner of Twitter, warned that A.I. was becoming dangerously intelligent and could lead to the end of the human race. They called for regulations.
In November 2016, the Senate Subcommittee on Space, Science and Competitiveness held the first congressional hearing on A.I., with Mr. Musk's warnings cited twice by lawmakers. During the hearing, academics and the chief executive of OpenAI, a San Francisco lab, batted down Mr. Musk's predictions or said they were at least many years away.
Some lawmakers stressed the importance of the nation's leadership in A.I. development. Congress must "ensure that the United States remains a global leader throughout the 21st century," Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas and chair of the subcommittee, said at the time.
DARPA subsequently announced that it was earmarking $ 2 billion for A.I. research projects.
Warnings about A.I.'s dangers intensified in 2021 as the Vatican, IBM and Microsoft pledged to develop "ethical A.I.," which means organizations are transparent about how the technology works, respect privacy and minimize biases. The group called for regulation of facial recognition software, which uses large databases of photos to pinpoint people's identity. In Washington, some lawmakers tried creating rules for facial recognition technology and for company audits to prevent discriminatory algorithms. The bills went nowhere.
"It's not a priority and doesn't feel urgent for members," said Mr. Beyer, who failed to get enough support last year to pass a bill on audits of A.I. algorithms, sponsored with Representative Yvette D. Clarke, Democrat of New York.
More recently, some government officials have tried bridging the knowledge gap around A.I. In January, about 150 lawmakers and their staffs packed a meeting, hosted by the usually sleepy A.I. Caucus, that featured Jack Clark, a founder of the A.I. company Anthropic.

Some action around A.I. is taking place in federal agencies, which are enforcing laws already on the books. The Federal Trade Commission has brought enforcement orders against companies that used A.I. in violation of its consumer protection rules. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also warned that opaque A.I. systems used by credit agencies could run afoul of anti-discrimination laws.
The F.T.C. has also proposed commercial surveillance regulations to curb the collection of data used in A.I. technology, and the Food and Drug Administration issued a list of A.I. technology in medical devices that come under its purview.
In October, the White House issued a blueprint for rules on A.I., stressing the rights of individuals to privacy and safe automated systems, protection from algorithmic discrimination and meaningful human alternatives.
But none of the efforts have amounted to laws.
"The picture in Congress is bleak," said Amba Kak, the executive director of the AI Now Institute, a nonprofit research center, who recently advised the F.T.C. "The stakes are high because these tools are used in very sensitive social domains like in hiring, housing and credit, and there is real evidence that over the years, A.I. tools have been flawed and biased."
Tech companies have lobbied against policies that would limit how they used A.I. and have called for mostly voluntary regulations.
In 2020, Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, the parent of Google, visited Brussels to argue for "sensible regulation" that would not hold back the technology's potential benefits. That same year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and more than 30 companies, including Amazon and Meta, lobbied against facial recognition bills, according to OpenSecrets.org.
"We aren't anti-regulation, but we'd want smart regulation," said Jordan Crenshaw, a vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, which has argued that the draft E.U. law is overly broad and could hamper tech development.
In January, Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, which created ChatGPT, visited several members of Congress to demonstrate GPT-4, a new A.I. model that can write essays, solve complex coding problems and more, according to Mr. Beyer and Mr. Lieu. Mr. Altman, who has said he supports regulation, showed how GPT-4 will have greater security controls than previous A.I. models, the lawmakers said.
Mr. Lieu, who met with Mr. Altman, said the government couldn't rely on individual companies to protect users. He plans to introduce a bill this year for a commission to study A.I. and for a new agency to regulate it.
"OpenAI decided to put controls into its technology, but what is to guarantee another company will do the same?" he asked.

Few Employers Outside of Tech Opt for Layoffs: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: During the height of the pandemic, hungry and housebound customers clamored for Home Run Inn Pizza's frozen thin-crust pies. The company did everything to oblige.
It kept its machines chugging during lunch breaks and brought on temporary workers to ensure it could produce pizzas at the suddenly breakneck pace.
More recently, demand has eased, and Home Run Inn Pizza, based in suburban Chicago, has reversed some of those measures. But it does not plan to lay off any full-time manufacturing employees -- even if that means having a few more workers than it needs during its second shift.
"We have really good people," said Nick Perrino, the chief operating officer and a great-grandson of the company's founder. "And we don't want to let any of our team members go."
Despite a year of aggressive interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve aimed at taming inflation, and signs that the red-hot labor market is cooling off, most companies have not taken the step of cutting jobs. Outside of some high-profile companies mostly in the tech sector, such as Google's parent Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft, layoffs in the economy as a whole remain remarkably, even historically, rare.
There were fewer layoffs in December than in any month during the two decades before the pandemic, government data show. Filings for unemployment insurance have barely increased. And the unemployment rate, at 3.4 percent, is the lowest since 1969.
"We haven't seen any layoffs whatsoever," said Janis Petrini, a co-owner of an Express Employment Professionals staffing agency office in Grand Rapids, Mich.
For Federal Reserve policymakers, the surprising strength of the job market is a source of both optimism and concern. The low rate of unemployment suggests that a recession is not imminent, but also that the Fed has not achieved its aim in slowing down the economy.
For workers, the picture is clearer: For now, at least, the historically strong job market remains intact.
Economists say a variety of factors could be driving employers to hold on to workers. Some may be scarred by how difficult and costly it has been in recent years to recruit and train employees. Some may be worried about finding themselves short-handed if they need to hire quickly after a fleeting downturn -- as was the case when the economy reopened rapidly early in the pandemic. Others may still be trying to make up for staffing shortfalls after the pandemic's upheaval. The leisure and hospitality industry, for instance, is still about half a million jobs below its prepandemic level.
More fundamentally, the pandemic, and the persistently tight labor market that ensued, may have profoundly reshaped how the nation's employers think about staffing levels and hiring.
"When the economy came back very strongly in 2020, then a lot of firms were trying to hire again and they couldn't," said Matt Notowidigdo, an economics professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. "That experience might still be sitting with people."
At Home Run Inn Pizza, in Woodridge, Ill., Mr. Perrino said attracting and retaining workers, particularly for shifts that can start in the wee hours of the morning or last late into the night, was proving extraordinarily difficult. (Besides its frozen pie business, the company also has a handful of restaurants in the Chicago area.) That, along with his sense of loyalty to his employees -- "I don't think we've ever done a layoff in our company history," he said -- has contributed to his desire to hold on to his full-time staff members, including 135 people in manufacturing.
"Finding talented labor that wants to stay and wants to be committed to the long-term success of the company -- that's been very challenging," he said.
For some companies, particularly those in consumer-facing service businesses like leisure and hospitality, the logic for avoiding layoffs is simpler: Demand is still strong, and they need the help.
John Keener, a restaurateur in Charleston, S.C., said his establishments, which include two Charleston Crab House locations and the A.W. Shuck's Seafood Shack, had effectively been understaffed since the early days of the pandemic.
To attract employees, he raised wages, offered more generous benefits and started advertising open jobs on LinkedIn, Yelp, Facebook and Instagram, he said. When that wasn't enough, he figured out how to work with less, altering menus so he could have fewer prep cooks and giving servers hand-held electronic devices so they could beam orders directly to the kitchen without leaving the floor.
But as the all-important spring tourism season begins, he is more desperate than ever to hire additional employees -- 50, if he gets his wish, which would bring his total to about 270.
"They've talked about a recession since the start of last summer, and if we start worrying about that and anticipating that, we're going down the wrong rabbit hole," he said. "We just keep on plugging along."
The persistent strength of consumer demand -- and the continued hiring that it has driven -- has been vexing for policymakers at the Federal Reserve. Fed officials worry that the strong job market is contributing to inflation, with employers raising wages to attract scarce workers, then raising prices to cover their higher labor costs. That could force the central bank to raise interest rates even more aggressively, ultimately raising the risks of a painful recession.
But the low rate of layoffs also points to the possibility of a rosier scenario. Higher interest rates typically result in higher costs and weaker sales, which often leads to layoffs. If companies respond instead by paring hiring or raises -- while holding onto existing employees -- that could allow the labor market to cool without widespread job losses.
There are signs that is happening. In earnings calls and investor presentations, corporate executives in recent months have begun talking about their efforts to cut costs and rein in spending, even in cases when their own sales remain strong. Some have instituted freezes in hiring, slashed bonuses or cut back on the use of contractors. But so far, they have mostly not resorted to large-scale layoffs as they have in the past, said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the employment site ZipRecruiter.
"The biggest story is the absence of layoffs -- the absence of the layoffs you would normally see in response to higher interest rates," she said.
That anomaly has been evident at Grow Therapy, an online service that helps patients book appointments with therapists who accept their insurance. The company had been hiring rapidly, adding staff to meet the demand it anticipated months down the road. But the company's growth relied on funding from venture capital -- and venture funding was about to become a lot harder and more expensive to obtain.
So in May, Grow Therapy instituted a temporary hiring freeze for most roles. It also put in place rules requiring all co-founders to sign off before anyone could be hired for roles not covered by the freeze. To meet short-term staffing needs, the company turned to an outside temporary agency, rather than bringing on full-time employees.
One thing Grow Therapy never seriously considered was laying off workers, said Jake Cooper, a co-founder and the chief executive officer. Demand was still strong and growing, Mr. Cooper said. And the company expects to keep hiring in the future -- something that could be more difficult if it cut jobs now.
"There's this risk of a death spiral, where if you lay off a large portion of your staff, everyone who's left is less happy and more overworked," he said. "If you do layoffs, it's hard to quantify, but it certainly is more challenging to recruit high quality candidates."
But economists caution that while companies may be clinging to their workers, that could change in a hurry if abstract fears of a recession morph into an actual decline in sales. Economists warn that a recession, if it comes, will almost certainly force companies to cut jobs en masse -- no matter how reluctant they may be after their recent experience with a tight labor market.
"That's the risk," Mr. Notowidigdo said, referring to companies' strategy of holding onto workers even as business slows. "You might end up with multiple rounds of layoffs in the future if the recession turns out to be more severe than expected."

What Layoffs? Many Employers Are Eager to Hang On to Workers.

During the height of the pandemic, hungry and housebound customers clamored for Home Run Inn Pizza’s frozen thin-crust pies. The company did everything to oblige.
It kept its machines chugging during lunch breaks and brought on temporary workers to ensure it could produce pizzas at the suddenly breakneck pace.
More recently, demand has eased, and Home Run Inn Pizza, based in suburban Chicago, has reversed some of those measures. But it does not plan to lay off any full-time manufacturing employees — even if that means having a few more workers than it needs during its second shift.
“We have really good people,” said Nick Perrino, chief operating officer and a great-grandson of the company’s founder. “And we don’t want to let any of our team members go.”
Despite a year of aggressive interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve aimed at taming inflation, and signs that the red-hot labor market is cooling off, most companies have not taken the step of cutting jobs. Outside of some high-profile companies mostly in the tech sector, such as Google’s parent Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft, layoffs in the economy as a whole remain remarkably, even historically, rare.
There were fewer layoffs in December than in any month during the two decades before the pandemic, government data shows. Filings for unemployment insurance have barely increased. And the unemployment rate, at 3.4%, is the lowest since 1969.
“We haven’t seen any layoffs whatsoever,” said Janis Petrini, co-owner of an Express Employment Professionals staffing agency office in Grand Rapids, Michigan.
For Federal Reserve policymakers, the surprising strength of the job market is a source of both optimism and concern. The low rate of unemployment suggests that a recession is not imminent, but also that the Fed has not achieved its aim in slowing down the economy.
For workers, the picture is clearer: For now, at least, the historically strong job market remains intact.
Economists say a variety of factors could be driving employers to hold on to workers. Some may be scarred by how difficult and costly it has been in recent years to recruit and train employees. Some may be worried about finding themselves short-handed if they need to hire quickly after a fleeting downturn — as was the case when the economy reopened rapidly early in the pandemic. Others may still be trying to make up for staffing shortfalls after the pandemic’s upheaval. The leisure and hospitality industry, for instance, is still about a half-million jobs below its pre-pandemic level.
More fundamentally, the pandemic, and the persistently tight labor market that ensued, may have profoundly reshaped how the nation’s employers think about staffing levels and hiring.
“When the economy came back very strongly in 2020, then a lot of firms were trying to hire again and they couldn’t,” said Matt Notowidigdo, an economics professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. “That experience might still be sitting with people.”
At Home Run Inn Pizza, in Woodridge, Illinois, Perrino said attracting and retaining workers, particularly for shifts that can start in the wee hours of the morning or last late into the night, was proving extraordinarily difficult. (Besides its frozen pie business, the company also has a handful of restaurants in the Chicago area.) That, along with his sense of loyalty to his employees — “I don’t think we’ve ever done a layoff in our company history,” he said — has contributed to his desire to hold on to his full-time staff members, including 135 people in manufacturing.
“Finding talented labor that wants to stay and wants to be committed to the long-term success of the company — that’s been very challenging,” he said.
For some companies, particularly those in consumer-facing service businesses such as leisure and hospitality, the logic for avoiding layoffs is simpler: Demand is still strong, and they need the help.
John Keener, a restaurateur in Charleston, South Carolina, said his establishments, which include two Charleston Crab House locations and the A.W. Shuck’s Seafood Shack, had effectively been understaffed since the early days of the pandemic.
To attract employees, he raised wages, offered more generous benefits and started advertising open jobs on LinkedIn, Yelp, Facebook and Instagram, he said. When that wasn’t enough, he figured out how to work with less, altering menus so he could have fewer prep cooks and giving servers hand-held electronic devices so they could beam orders directly to the kitchen without leaving the floor.
But as the all-important spring tourism season begins, he is more desperate than ever to hire additional employees — 50, if he gets his wish, which would bring his total to about 270.
“They’ve talked about a recession since the start of last summer, and if we start worrying about that and anticipating that, we’re going down the wrong rabbit hole,” he said. “We just keep on plugging along.”
The persistent strength of consumer demand — and the continued hiring that it has driven — has been vexing for policymakers at the Federal Reserve. Fed officials worry that the strong job market is contributing to inflation, with employers raising wages to attract scarce workers, then raising prices to cover their higher labor costs. That could force the central bank to raise interest rates even more aggressively, ultimately raising the risks of a painful recession.
But the low rate of layoffs also points to the possibility of a rosier scenario. Higher interest rates typically result in higher costs and weaker sales, which often leads to layoffs. If companies respond instead by paring hiring or raises — while holding onto existing employees — that could allow the labor market to cool without widespread job losses.
There are signs that is happening. In earnings calls and investor presentations, corporate executives in recent months have begun talking about their efforts to cut costs and rein in spending, even in cases when their own sales remain strong. Some have instituted freezes in hiring, slashed bonuses or cut back on the use of contractors. But so far, they have mostly not resorted to large-scale layoffs as they have in the past, said Julia Pollak, chief economist at the employment site ZipRecruiter.
“The biggest story is the absence of layoffs — the absence of the layoffs you would normally see in response to higher interest rates,” she said.
That anomaly has been evident at Grow Therapy, an online service that helps patients book appointments with therapists who accept their insurance. The company had been hiring rapidly, adding staff to meet the demand it anticipated months down the road. But the company’s growth relied on funding from venture capital — and venture funding was about to become a lot harder and more expensive to obtain.
So, in May, Grow Therapy instituted a temporary hiring freeze for most roles. It also put in place rules requiring all co-founders to sign off before anyone could be hired for roles not covered by the freeze. To meet short-term staffing needs, the company turned to an outside temporary agency, rather than bringing on full-time employees.
One thing Grow Therapy never seriously considered was laying off workers, said Jake Cooper, co-founder and CEO. Demand was still strong and growing, Cooper said. And the company expects to keep hiring in the future — something that could be more difficult if it cut jobs now.
“There’s this risk of a death spiral, where if you lay off a large portion of your staff, everyone who’s left is less happy and more overworked,” he said. “If you do layoffs, it’s hard to quantify, but it certainly is more challenging to recruit high-quality candidates.”
Economists caution that although companies may be clinging to their workers, that could change in a hurry if abstract fears of a recession morph into an actual decline in sales. Economists warn that a recession, if it comes, will almost certainly force companies to cut jobs en masse — no matter how reluctant they may be after their recent experience with a tight labor market.
“That’s the risk,” Notowidigdo said, referring to companies’ strategy of holding onto workers even as business slows. “You might end up with multiple rounds of layoffs in the future if the recession turns out to be more severe than expected.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

The Freshly Unemployed, Sent Reeling, Land on TikTok: [Style Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some workers are using the platform to share stories about job cuts, give advice and search for new roles.
Bailey Harris, 25, worked as a recruiter for a big tech company for more than a year and a half before she was laid off in January. After the initial shock wore off, she decided to tell her story three days later on TikTok. "I was never really worried about layoffs," she said in the video, which she recorded from a car. "I just didn't see this coming," she added.
It was only the second TikTok video Ms. Harris had ever made, but within a day it had more than 100,000 views. That number has since quadrupled.
She continued to post about being newly unemployed. In one, she shared how she was saving money. In another, she told her viewers about a new side hustle helping a friend flip real estate. (These videos performed much better than the others she later posted, which focused on topics like dating, fitness and nutrition.)
"I was like, 'This is relevant -- why not speak about it because I know a lot of people have been going through the same thing?"' she said. The videos, she continued, were "getting a lot of comments about how people like my attitude toward my situation."
As tech workers continue to get laid off across the country -- more than 50,000 employees were let go from Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft alone in the last few months -- some have turned to TikTok to share their experiences.
An emerging microgenre on the platform, layoff vlogs can be a source of validation and community, or a self-esteem boost, for young workers who have recently lost their jobs. In these videos, some creators vent about their former employers or expose perceived wrongdoings. Others have a more practical objective in mind: using the platform to find their next gig.
Mass layoffs by companies are hardly new, and neither is the idea that former employees will find an outlet to talk about what happened to them. When some nine million Americans lost their jobs in the 2008 financial crisis, workers might have called each other, met up at a bar or posted on Facebook and Twitter.
And during the last major economic upheaval at the beginning of the pandemic -- over a single week in March, more than three million Americans became unemployed -- TikTok was another available avenue. But while some workers did use the platform for talking about layoffs, a majority of the videos didn't resonate as they do now.
"This is the first time employees can get laid off, and press record on their phone and have something go mega-mega-megaviral," said Gabrielle Judge, a content creator who helps women find jobs in tech. She noted that platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn, where disgruntled employees might have gone in the past to vent, don't have the same viral potential as TikTok.
Calon DiPiero, 30, said that when she was laid off last month from an event planning job at Attentive Mobile, an S.M.S. marketing platform, she filmed a TikTok video to keep her situation in perspective. The caption read: "When you were laid off so you spent the last 48 hours crying in the same comfort hoodie but then you remember you're just unemployed not ugly." Posting the video helped her overcome the shame she felt when she was first let go, she said.
"Initially, if this happens, your ego gets bruised," Ms. DiPiero said. "But then if you can take a step back and say, OK, this is happening to a lot of people. It's not a personal vendetta against me."
Tech recruiters said TikTok could be helpful for networking and job hunting. Dozens of companies, including Target, Chipotle and Sweetgreen, have used the app for hiring.
"If you say in a video that you would love to connect with anyone who has a role for you, a lot of people will see it," said Jonathan Javier, the chief executive and founder of Wonsulting, which helps people, especially those who come from nontraditional backgrounds, find jobs in tech.
The trick, Mr. Javier said, is to strike the right tone: "If you are a prospective employer, seeing someone vent about a past employer can be a red flag. I encourage everyone to stay positive, to focus on the actions you are taking to find a new job."
Some people are heeding that advice. Ms. Harris, for example, opted not to say which company she worked for in her videos. "Obviously people can do their research and find out where I worked through LinkedIn," she said. "But I really wanted to stay positive and not name names."
Brit Levy, 35, who said she was laid off by Meta in November, used TikTok to talk about her frustrations with the severance agreement she said the company was offering, amassing almost 800,000 views. Dozens of former Meta employees reached out to her after the series of videos she posted, she said. "We are finding a little community with each other," said Ms. Levy, who lives in Oceanside, Calif.
She said she has also had hiring managers reach out to offer support and give her professional advice on the next steps she should take in her career.
TikTok creators who share details about the circumstances of their layoffs, however, can risk legal trouble, depending on which they talk about. "There are many companies that require you to sign documents to get your severance package," Mr. Javier said. "If they sign a form, there are legal implications."
Ms. Levy said she wasn't worried about the potential consequences of speaking publicly about a former employer.
"Honestly, they should be worried about ramifications from me," she said. "I now know how to get eyes on an issue I feel is super important."

Albania Reeling From an Enormous Cyberattack Linked to Iran: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Albania has been the target of repeated digital assaults believed to be linked to its sheltering of an Iranian dissident group on its soil.
TIRANA, Albania -- Customers at one of Albania's biggest banks got a shock shortly before Christmas when a curt text popped up on their cellphones: "Your account has been blocked. The balance of your account is zero. Thank you."
The messages, which turned out be fake, signaled the opening of a disruptive new front in what Albanian authorities, the United States and NATO have identified as an enormous cyberattack orchestrated by Iran on one of the weakest members of the military alliance.
"It is an attack -- an aggression against the sovereignty of one country by another state," Prime Minister Edi Rama said in an interview in Tirana, the Albanian capital, calling the assaults "absolutely the same as a conventional military aggression only by other means."
The onslaught has swept Albania, a Balkan nation with fewer than three million people, into a maelstrom of uncertainty and plunged it into big geopolitical battles involving Iran, Israel and the United States.
The reason for the attacks, which began with a stealthy penetration of government servers in 2021, but started causing visible disruption only last year, appears to be Albania's sheltering of Mujahedeen Khalq, known as M.E.K., a secretive Iranian dissident group, on its soil.
Also playing a role are the polarized politics of Washington, where prominent Republican hawks on Iran have been strong backers of M.E.K.
Hired by the Albanian government to investigate, Microsoft, in a report on the attack, attributed it with "high confidence" to "actors sponsored by the Iranian government," identifying M.E.K. as the "primary target." The campaign against Albania, the report added, was probably "retaliation for cyberattacks Iran perceives were carried out by Israel" and Mujahedden Khalq.
A logo stamped on confidential Albanian documents leaked by the attackers features an eagle preying on the symbol of a hacking group known as Predatory Sparrow -- which Iran blames for attacks on its own computer networks -- inside a Star of David.
Predatory Sparrow has claimed responsibility for a number of sophisticated attacks against Iranian targets, including the state broadcasting company.
Albania, which has a large, mostly secular Muslim population, severed relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran in September, expelling its diplomats in response to what experts say is the most disruptive cyberattack in Europe on a NATO member since 2007, when Russia assailed computer networks in Estonia.
The attack on Albania has not only disrupted the government's work and sought to undermine trust in financial institutions -- a grave threat in a country that tipped into civil war in 1997 after fraudulent investment funds collapsed -- but it has also involved the leak of a vast trove of confidential information.
Leaked data includes the names and addresses of more than a thousand undercover police informants; the email traffic of the head of the intelligence service, a former president and the former chief of police; and the banking information for more than 30,000 people.
The gravity of the sprawling assault has posed a tricky test for NATO, of which Albania is a member and enjoys protection under the alliance's commitment to collective defense. (NATO says there was no effect on its networks or military operations.) Albania has been a member since 2009, one of 14 formerly Communist countries to join.
Article 5, the cornerstone of the alliance, says "an armed attack" against any of the allies in Europe or North America "shall be considered an attack against them all."
But cyberattacks, Mr. Rama said, are a different form of aggression, and, in terms of doctrine, "events are running ahead of us when it comes to" them. Because of this, he said, Albania has not invoked Article 5. "How does the alliance respond? By attacking the defined country through cyber, by using military means or by what?" he said.
NATO has limited itself to pledges to "support Albania in strengthening its cyberdefense capabilities" and denouncing "malicious cyberactivities designed to destabilize and harm the security of an ally and disrupt the daily lives of citizens."
The attack on Albania began in 2021 when hackers penetrated an unprotected government computer and then expanded from that beachhead into networks used by the Albanian intelligence service, the police, border guards and other official agencies.
Lurking there for many months unbeknown to the authorities, they downloaded huge quantities of data and then broke cover last summer when they started deleting files from servers, crippling many government services. After that, they started leaking selected information, much of it secret, on a Telegram messaging service channel called Homeland Justice.
Just as officials thought that holes in Albania's defenses had been plugged, the hackers turned on the private sector, hitting at least one major bank, Credins Bank, with fake messages of drained accounts and releasing confidential personal banking information.
"It just goes on and on," Mr. Rama lamented. "This is a terrorist attack designed to create panic, to create fear, to fuel insecurity and to make people believe that nothing is under control," he added. "They have planted ticking bombs everywhere with no clear pattern about when and where these bombs will blow up next."
But the ultimate target of the attack seems reasonably clear. The Homeland Justice channel has featured regular posts denouncing M.E.K., the Iranian opposition group, as terrorists and demanding that Albania shut down a camp run by the group near the port city of Durres or face further mayhem.
Former members describe M.E.K., which in 2016 moved many of its followers to Albania from its previous base in Iraq, as a sinister cult. The United States classified it a terrorist outfit until 2012, but leaned on Albania to offer shelter to thousands of its members after their camp in Iraq came under attack from pro-Iran militias
"Welcome to hell...You serpents! You brood of vipers! How are you to escape being sentenced to hell?" said a message posted on the hackers' Telegram channel in December after Albania declined to close the M.E.K. camp. "As long as MEK exists so do we," the hackers warned. "Why should our taxes be spent on the terrorists of Durres?" asked another message.
To reduce the risk of panic, the Albanian government prohibited news outlets from publishing information leaked on the Homeland Justice channel. The United States has dispatched experts from the F.B.I. and other agencies, though Mr. Rama said, "Of course we would like to see the U.S. government do more, to help more and be more present in helping us to build the best possible cyberdefenses." Israel, which has extensive experience dealing with Iranian threats, is also helping.
But these efforts, according to Gentian Progni, a cybersecurity expert in Tirana, left suspected Iranian hackers lurking in Albania's networks until at least the end of January. He noted that they posted online a government identification document generated on Jan. 29.
"We were told the hackers were no longer inside the system, but we can see they are still there," Mr. Progni said in an interview last month. "This is a big mess and more serious than anyone thinks."
Defectors from M.E.K. question whether Iran is behind the attack and believe the real culprit could be the opposition group itself.
There are some signs indicating that actors other than the Iranian state have been involved. These include the mysterious appearance of a second Telegram channel calling itself Homeland Justice. The new, fake channel contains many of the same posts as the original one linked to Iran but is curated to delete content that is particularly embarrassing to the Albanian government, like secret lists of police informants, and to add content apparently aimed at amplifying hostility to Iran.
The genuine Homeland Justice channel, in contrast, has sought to calm public outrage over the attack by repeatedly stressing that its target is not ordinary Albanians but M.E.K. and the Albanian government for refusing to expel the group.
The Albanian government has resisted succumbing to blackmail and has refused to evict M.E.K. Doing that, Mr. Rama said, would be "the biggest shame" for a country with a long history of sheltering refugees nobody else wants, including thousands of Afghans in 2021.
But he complained that M.E.K. were "not easy people, frankly," and that the group had violated an agreement that it would refrain from using Albania as "a safe haven to make political activity against the Iranian regime."
Instead, the group has organized high-profile events in Albania aimed at rallying opposition to Tehran, including an annual gathering called the Free Iran World Summit, whose paid speakers have included prominent American supporters like Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York mayor and a onetime personal lawyer to former President Donald J. Trump.
The Iranian dissidents, Mr. Rama said, have "friends on Capitol Hill that lobby for them" but have now been ordered to halt public activities against Iran. M.E.K. canceled the Free Iran event last year. "There is no more of this now," the prime minister said. "We hope that they will not try again because it is not beneficial to this country and they have to accept that."

The reason for the attacks, which began with a stealthy penetration of government servers in 2021, but started causing visible disruption only last year, appears to be Albania’s sheltering of Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, known as MEK, a secretive Iranian dissident group, on its soil.
Also playing a role are the polarized politics of Washington, where prominent Republican hawks on Iran have been strong backers of MEK’s.
Hired by the Albanian government to investigate, Microsoft, in a report on the attack, attributed it with “high confidence” to “actors sponsored by the Iranian government,” identifying MEK as the “primary target.” The campaign against Albania, the report added, was probably “retaliation for cyberattacks Iran perceives were carried out by Israel” and MEK.
A logo stamped on confidential Albanian documents leaked by the attackers features an eagle preying on the symbol of a hacking group known as Predatory Sparrow — which Iran blames for attacks on its own computer networks — inside a Star of David.
Predatory Sparrow has claimed responsibility for a number of sophisticated attacks against Iranian targets, including the state broadcasting company.
Albania, which has a large, mostly secular Muslim population, severed relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran in September, expelling its diplomats in response to what experts say is the most disruptive cyberattack in Europe on a NATO member since 2007, when Russia assailed computer networks in Estonia.
The attack on Albania has not only disrupted the government’s work and sought to undermine trust in financial institutions — a grave threat in a country that tipped into civil war in 1997 after fraudulent investment funds collapsed — but it has also involved the leak of a vast trove of confidential information.
Leaked data includes the names and addresses of more than 1,000 undercover police informants; the email traffic of the head of the intelligence service, a former president and the former chief of police; and the banking information for more than 30,000 people.
The gravity of the sprawling assault has posed a tricky test for NATO, of which Albania is a member and enjoys protection under the alliance’s commitment to collective defense. (NATO says there was no effect on its networks or military operations.) Albania has been a member since 2009, one of 14 formerly Communist countries to join.
Article 5, the cornerstone of the alliance, says “an armed attack” against any of the allies in Europe or North America “shall be considered an attack against them all.”
But cyberattacks, Rama said, are a different form of aggression, and, in terms of doctrine, “events are running ahead of us when it comes to” them. Because of this, he said, Albania has not invoked Article 5. “How does the alliance respond? By attacking the defined country through cyber, by using military means or by what?” he said.
NATO has limited itself to pledges to “support Albania in strengthening its cyberdefense capabilities” and denouncing “malicious cyberactivities designed to destabilize and harm the security of an ally and disrupt the daily lives of citizens.”
The attack on Albania began in 2021 when hackers penetrated an unprotected government computer and then expanded from that beachhead into networks used by the Albanian intelligence service, police, border guards and other official agencies.
Lurking there for many months unbeknown to authorities, they downloaded huge quantities of data and then broke cover last summer when they started deleting files from servers, crippling many government services. After that, they started leaking selected information, much of it secret, on a Telegram messaging service channel called Homeland Justice.
Just as officials thought that holes in Albania’s defenses had been plugged, the hackers turned on the private sector, hitting at least one major bank, Credins Bank, with fake messages of drained accounts and releasing confidential personal banking information.
“It just goes on and on,” Rama lamented. “This is a terrorist attack designed to create panic, to create fear, to fuel insecurity and to make people believe that nothing is under control,” he added. “They have planted ticking bombs everywhere with no clear pattern about when and where these bombs will blow up next.”
But the ultimate target of the attack seems reasonably clear. The Homeland Justice channel has featured regular posts denouncing MEK as terrorists and demanding that Albania shut down a camp run by the group near the port city of Durres or face further mayhem.
Former members describe MEK, which in 2016 moved many of its followers to Albania from its previous base in Iraq, as a sinister cult. The United States classified it a terrorist outfit until 2012, but leaned on Albania to offer shelter to thousands of its members after their camp in Iraq came under attack from pro-Iran militias.
“Welcome to hell … You serpents! You brood of vipers! How are you to escape being sentenced to hell?” said a message posted on the hackers’ Telegram channel in December after Albania declined to close the MEK camp. “As long as MEK exists so do we,” the hackers warned. “Why should our taxes be spent on the terrorists of Durres?” asked another message.
To reduce the risk of panic, the Albanian government prohibited news outlets from publishing information leaked on the Homeland Justice channel. The United States has dispatched experts from the FBI and other agencies, although Rama said, “Of course we would like to see the U.S. government do more, to help more and be more present in helping us to build the best possible cyberdefenses.” Israel, which has extensive experience dealing with Iranian threats, is also helping.
But these efforts, according to Gentian Progni, a cybersecurity expert in Tirana, left suspected Iranian hackers lurking in Albania’s networks until at least the end of January. He noted that they posted online a government identification document generated Jan. 29.
“We were told the hackers were no longer inside the system, but we can see they are still there,” Progni said in an interview last month. “This is a big mess and more serious than anyone thinks.”
Defectors from MEK question whether Iran is behind the attack and believe the real culprit could be the opposition group itself.
There are some signs indicating that actors other than the Iranian state have been involved. These include the mysterious appearance of a second Telegram channel calling itself Homeland Justice. The new, fake channel contains many of the same posts as the original one linked to Iran but is curated to delete content that is particularly embarrassing to the Albanian government, such as secret lists of police informants, and to add content apparently aimed at amplifying hostility to Iran.
The genuine Homeland Justice channel, in contrast, has sought to calm public outrage over the attack by repeatedly stressing that its target is not ordinary Albanians but, rather, MEK and the Albanian government for refusing to expel the group.
The Albanian government has resisted succumbing to blackmail and has refused to evict MEK. Doing that, Rama said, would be “the biggest shame” for a country with a long history of sheltering refugees nobody else wants, including thousands of Afghans in 2021.
But he complained that MEK were “not easy people, frankly,” and that the group had violated an agreement that it would refrain from using Albania as “a safe haven to make political activity against the Iranian regime.”
Instead, the group has organized high-profile events in Albania aimed at rallying opposition to Tehran, including an annual gathering called the Free Iran World Summit, whose paid speakers have included prominent American supporters such as Rudy Giuliani, a former New York mayor and a onetime personal lawyer to former President Donald Trump.
The Iranian dissidents, Rama said, have “friends on Capitol Hill that lobby for them” but have now been ordered to halt public activities against Iran. MEK canceled the Free Iran event last year. “There is no more of this now,” Rama said, “We hope that they will not try again because it is not beneficial to this country, and they have to accept that.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Why You Should Listen to Twitter on Two-Factor Authentication: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Elon Musk was right: Text messages are not the most secure way to protect your account.
Twitter recently set in motion a major shift that will affect how most people protect their accounts. The company told nonpaying users that they would soon have to stop using a popular security feature: two-factor authentication through text messages.
Let me explain why this isn't as bad as you might fear.
In plain speak, two-factor authentication requires two security steps to verify that you are who you say you are. The first step asks for a user name and password, and the second requires you to either enter a temporary code that is sent to you or connect to a physical security key. This way, even if someone has your password, that person will need to fulfill the second step to log in to your account.
Twitter's announcement of this change was initially confusing and alarming for many. But to be clear, Twitter is pushing users to adopt stronger safeguards -- and it has created an opportunity for us all to bite the bullet and improve the security of our online accounts.
Twitter said in a blog post that users who were not subscribers to its Twitter Blue service would no longer be able to use text messages as a form of authentication after March 20. Nonpaying users can switch to different verification techniques with stronger forms of security. The alternatives rely on either using a third-party app to generate a temporary code or plugging in an authorized security key for access to your account.
"Use of free authentication apps for 2FA will remain free and are much more secure than SMS," Elon Musk, Twitter's owner, tweeted.
Twitter had a valid point about the flaws in SMS-based authentication, according to Casey Ellis, the chief technology officer of the security firm Bugcrowd. "This actually does make some sense, but it just wasn't executed in a clean way," Mr. Ellis said.
But there are downsides to Twitter's approach, he added. Authentication using text messages has been the simplest security tool for a vast majority of people to use. The other techniques require extra steps to set up.
(Also confusing: Paid Twitter users will still be able to rely on codes sent to them via text messages for logging in -- an odd choice if that form of authentication is less secure. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)
Switching to the other security methods is not intuitive, so there's a risk that many nonpaying Twitter users may resort to skipping two-factor authentication altogether.
Amid all this, however, there's a valuable opportunity to learn about the stronger methods of two-factor authentication -- and why we should consider using one of them, whenever possible, instead of SMS-based security for all our online accounts. Here's what you need to know about each method and its pros and cons.
SMS Authentication
For many years, Twitter and other sites have encouraged users to set up two-factor authentication through text messages. That method sends a time-sensitive security code to a user's phone. This has been the most widely used form of two-factor authentication because virtually everyone has a cellphone, so even the least tech savvy person could understand it.
But over time, security researchers have found SMS authentication to be increasingly problematic. A text message containing a security code could be intercepted by someone who has hijacked your phone number -- a scam known as SIM swapping. This is how hackers broke into the Twitter account of the company's former chief executive, Jack Dorsey, in 2019.
There are more issues. A text message is not encrypted, so it can be a security risk to receive texts on foreign networks in countries with heavy surveillance such as China and Russia. Also, if you're traveling outside the United States, receiving texts on a foreign carrier can be pricey.
Security researchers are continuing to discover new flaws in SMS-based authentication, so we can expect more sites and apps to push users away from receiving codes via text messages, Mr. Ellis said.
Authenticator Apps
This brings us to authenticator apps, which you download onto a phone or computer. They generate temporary security codes (instead of texting them to your phone) that you enter to log in to your online accounts and apps.
Let's use Twitter and the app Google Authenticator as an example.
First, download the Google Authenticator app onto your phone. Then, on Twitter.com from a computer, click More→Security and Account Access→Two-Factor Authentication→Authentication App.
From here, follow the steps on Twitter. You'll be asked to use the Authenticator app to scan a QR code with your phone camera, which will link the app with your Twitter account and start generating security codes.
When you log in to Twitter, you'll enter your user name and password and then open the Authenticator app to find the temporary code.
The big downside to using authenticators is that if you lose your phone or switch to a new one, it can be a pain to regain access to your accounts. Typically a site or app like Twitter will let you regain access to your account with a backup code. In Twitter's two-factor authentication settings, one menu labeled "backup codes" will generate a code to let you log back in. Make sure to jot this code down and store it in a safe place.
This technique takes some time and mental bandwidth to set up properly and get used to, but it's better overall. It's much tougher for someone to hijack your device to see your security codes than it is to intercept a text message.
Security Keys
The third method -- the use of a physical security key in the form of a USB stick that you insert into your computer or phone to log in -- is the most secure of them all. We're not likely to see this technique widely adopted because the key costs money, and if you lose your key, it can be difficult to regain access to your account.
Let's use Twitter and Google's Titan security key as an example.
First, you have to buy a security key. Google sells its Titan security key for $ 30; it includes a pair of keys for different types of computers and phones.
Then, on Twitter.com from a computer, click More→Security and Account Access→Two-Factor Authentication→Security Key.
From here, follow Twitter's instructions, which will walk you through plugging the key into a USB port and pressing a button to verify the key. Twitter will then show a screen with a backup code in case you lose your key. Store it somewhere safe.
Kind of a hassle, no? Still, it may be useful for people who work in highly sensitive fields, like government agencies and activism.
Bottom Line
In conclusion, the authenticator app is the two-factor method that is relatively convenient and very secure to use. I recommend most people pick one app, such as Google Authenticator, Authy or Microsoft Authenticator, and stick to it. They all work the same.
It can take some time to set up an authenticator app with all of your online accounts, but you need to do it only once. And in the long run, it might save you time because logging in to sites with this method can be faster than waiting for text messages to arrive.

Chatbot's Banality Is Eerier Than Any A.I. Movie: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Instead of the chilling rationality of HAL in "2001: A Space Odyssey," we get the messy awfulness of Microsoft's Sydney. Call it the banality of sentience.
Why are we so fascinated by stories about sentient robots, rapacious A.I. and the rise of thinking machines? Faced with that question, I did what any writer on deadline would do and asked ChatGPT.
The answers I got -- a helpfully numbered list with five chatty entries -- were not surprising. They were, to be honest, what I might have come up with myself after a few seconds of thought, or what I might expect to encounter in a B- term paper from a distracted undergraduate. Long on generalizations and short on sources, the bot's essay was a sturdy summary of conventional wisdom. For example: "Sentient robots raise important moral and ethical questions about the treatment of intelligent beings, the nature of consciousness and the responsibilities of creators."
Quite so. From the myth of Pygmalion and Galatea to the medieval Jewish legend of the golem through Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" and beyond, we have grappled with those important questions, and also frightened and titillated ourselves with tales of our inventions coming to life. Our ingenuity as a species, channeled through individual and collective hubris, compels us to concoct artificial beings that menace and seduce us. They escape our control. They take control. They fall in love.
In "The Imagination of Disaster," Susan Sontag's classic 1965 essay on science-fiction movies, she observed that "we live under continual threat of two equally fearful, but seemingly opposed, destinies: unremitting banality and inconceivable terror." As Turing-tested A.I. applications have joined the pantheon of sci-fi shibboleths, they have dutifully embodied both specters.
HAL 9000, the malevolent computer in Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968), is terrifying precisely because he is so banal. "Open the pod bay doors, HAL." "I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave." In 2023, that perfectly chilling exchange between human and computer is echoed every day as modern-day Daves make impossible demands of HAL's granddaughters, Siri and Alexa.
That example suggests that in spite of terrors like the Terminator, the smart money was always on banality. The dreariness of ChatGPT, the soulless works of visual art produced by similar programs seem to confirm that hunch. In the real world, the bots aren't our overlords so much as the enablers of our boredom. Our shared future -- our singularity -- is an endless scroll, just for the lulz.
Or so I thought, until a Microsoft application tried to break up my colleague's marriage. Last week, Kevin Roose, a tech columnist for The Times, published a transcript of his conversations with Sydney, the volatile alter ego of the Bing search engine. "I want to do love with you," Sydney said to Roose, and then went on to trash Roose's relationship with his wife.
That was scary but not exactly "Terminator" scary. We like to imagine technology as a kind of superego: rational, impersonal, decisive. This was a raging id. I found myself hoping that there was no pet rabbit in the Roose household, and that Sydney was not wired into any household appliances. That's a movie reference, by the way, to "Fatal Attraction," a notorious thriller released a few years after the first "Terminator" (1984) promised he'd be back. In another conversation, with The Associated Press, Sydney shifted from unhinged longing to unbridled hostility, making fun of the reporter's looks and likening him to Hitler "because you are one of the most evil and worst people in history."
Maybe when we have fantasized about conscious A.I. we've been imagining the wrong disaster. These outbursts represent a real departure, not only from the anodyne mediocrity of other bots, but also perhaps more significantly from the dystopia we have grown accustomed to dreading.
We're more or less reconciled to the reality that machines are, in some ways, smarter than we are. We also enjoy the fantasy that they might turn out to be more sensitive. We're therefore not prepared for the possibility that they might be chaotic, unstable and resentful -- as messy as we are, or maybe more so.
Movies about machines with feelings often unfold in an atmosphere of hushed, wistful melancholy, in which the robots themselves are avatars of sad gentleness: Haley Joel Osment as David in "A.I. Artificial Intelligence" (2001), Scarlett Johansson as Samantha in "Her" (2013), Justin H. Min as Yang last year in "After Yang." While HAL and Skynet, the imperial intelligence that spawned the Terminators, were creations of big government, the robots in these movies are consumer products. Totalitarian domination is the nightmare form of techno-politics: What if the tools that protect us decided to enslave us? Emotional fulfillment is the dream of consumer capitalism: What if our toys loved us back?
Why wouldn't they? In these movies, we are lovers and fighters, striking back against oppression and responding to vulnerability with kindness. Even as humans fear the superiority of the machines, our species remains the ideal to which they aspire. Their dream is to be us. When it comes true, the Terminator discovers a conscience, and the store-bought surrogate children, lovers and siblings learn about sacrifice and loss. It's the opposite of dystopia.
Where we really live is the opposite of that. At the movies, the machines absorb and emulate the noblest of human attributes: intelligence, compassion, loyalty, ardor. Sydney offers a blunt rebuttal, reminding us of our limitless capacity for aggression, deceit, irrationality and plain old meanness.
What did we expect? Sydney and her kin derive their understanding of humanness -- the information that feeds their models and algorithms -- from the internet, itself a utopian invention that has evolved into an archive of human awfulness. How did these bots get so creepy, so nasty, so untrustworthy? The answer is banal. Also terrifying. It's in the mirror.

Why China Didn't Invent ChatGPT: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The state's hardening censorship and heavier hand have held back its tech industry; so has entrepreneurs' reluctance to invest for the long term. It wasn't always that way.
Just a few years ago, China was on track to challenge United States dominance in artificial intelligence. The balance of power was tilting in China's direction because it had abundant data, hungry entrepreneurs, skilled scientists and supportive policies. The country led the world in patent filings related to artificial intelligence.
Today, much has changed. Microsoft -- an icon of American technology -- helped the start-up OpenAI usher its experimental chatbot, ChatGPT, into the world. And China's tech entrepreneurs are shocked and demoralized. It has dawned on many of them that despite the hype, China lags far behind in artificial intelligence and tech innovation.
"Why wasn't ChatGPT invented in China?" they asked. "How big is the ChatGPT gap between China and the U.S.?" "The Chinese equivalent of ChatGPT? Don't take it too seriously."
They're also asking more fundamental questions about the country's innovation environment: Have censorship, geopolitical tensions and the government's growing control of the private sector made China less friendly to innovation?
"The development of any significant technological product is inseparable from the system and environment in which it operates," said Xu Chenggang, a senior research scholar at the Stanford Center on China's Economy and Institutions. He cited TikTok's Chinese-language sister app Douyin as the sort of innovation that Chinese companies might be unable to achieve in the future because of government limitations on the industry.
"Once the open environment is gone, it will be challenging to create such products," he said.
If a decade ago China was the wild, wild East for tech entrepreneurship and innovation, it's a very different country now.
Starting in the 1990s, all of the country's biggest tech companies were private enterprises funded with foreign money. The government mostly left the industry alone because it didn't understand the internet and didn't expect it to become so powerful.
By the mid-2010s, China had become a tech power that could rival the United States. Its top internet companies were worth about the same in the markets as their American counterparts. Many of the Chinese companies' products, like the messaging app WeChat and the payment service Alipay, worked better than similar American mobile internet products. Venture capital flooded in from all over the world. For a while the country was producing as many unicorns, or start-ups valued at more than $ 1 billion, as Silicon Valley.
All of that changed over the past few years as Beijing went after some of the country's biggest tech companies and its highest-profile tech entrepreneurs. The aim was to ensure no institution or individual could wield influence on the Chinese society comparable to the Communist Party. The government took minority stakes and board seats in some of those companies, giving it effective control.
Along the way, Beijing tamed the industry's ambition and blunted its innovative edge.
But tech companies and investors also have themselves to blame for falling behind their Silicon Valley counterparts. Even before the government started to impose a stronger hand on them, Chinese tech leaders were laser-focused on making money and reluctant to spend on research projects that weren't likely to yield revenue in the short term. After the government's onslaught in the past few years, executives are even less inclined to invest in long-term ventures.
In 2021, the United States led the world in total private investment in artificial intelligence and in the number of newly funded A.I. companies, which was three and two times the levels in China, according to Stanford University's A.I. Index 2022 Annual Report.
But the government has been the biggest barrier to A.I. -- its obsession with censorship perhaps its heaviest club. The availability of a wide range of data is crucial to developing technology like ChatGPT, and that is increasingly harder to come by in a censored online environment.
Today, jokes circulate that capture the dark mood among tech people. A popular one: "We need to teach machines not only how to speak, but also how not to speak."
Beijing has punished companies, sometimes severely, to enforce its censorship protocols. Duolingo, which is in the seemingly noncontroversial business of teaching people new languages, was taken out of Chinese app stores for nearly a year to "enhance its content regulation," according to Chinese media reports.
"Many of us in the internet industry are faced with two problems when making a product: Either our products don't involve speech, or they have to undergo a lot of censorship," said Hao Peiqiang, a former entrepreneur and programmer in the northern city of Tianjin. "Big companies can afford it, but smaller companies can't," he said. "If small companies can't do this, it stifles innovation."
OpenAI, which has developed ChatGPT with the help of Microsoft's money, hasn't made the tool available in China. Mainland Chinese users need to use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to gain access to it.
The artificial intelligence gap with the United States is expected to keep widening, according to China experts and investors. One factor will be Chinese companies' access to algorithms, the rules that A.I. tools follow to make language. Many of them aren't publicly available, so it will take time for Chinese companies to develop them.
The other factor is computing power: Some people in the sector worry that the U.S. government could impose export bans on key chips it has not already banned to slow China's development in A.I. tools like ChatGPT.
For years China bragged that it filed more patent and artificial intelligence patent applications than the United States. But the average number of citations of its A.I. patents -- an indication of the originality and importance of its inventions -- lagged the United States and many other developed countries between 2020 and 2021, according to the China A.I. index from Mr. Xu's team.
If China's tech industry used to be driven by private enterprises and private venture funding, the government is increasingly guiding not only how money is invested but also which technology gets the money. It wants to ensure that important research projects conform with the country's goal of becoming self-reliant in tech.
"China's policymakers are seeking to systematically address and integrate every step of the innovation process," the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin wrote in a research paper.
On Monday, Beijing's municipal government pledged support for big tech companies developing large language models to compete with ChatGPT. Social media comments on the news were largely sarcastic. "Time to grab the government subsidies again," one Weibo user wrote.
The Chinese government has spent a lot on funding artificial intelligence research, with unclear results. The Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, established in 2018, introduced a ChatGPT-like product two years ago, Wu Dao, describing it as "China's first and the world's largest" A.I. language model. But it never really caught on.
The Communist Party's influence is imprinted on the industry. The central government set up the Pengcheng Laboratory, which has taken the lead on improving China's nationwide computing infrastructure. On the lab's home page, its events include a session for its 400-plus Communist Party members to study the spirit of the 20th Party Congress. An item seeking to hire two midlevel official lists as its first requirement "possessing high ideological and political qualities and adhering to the guidance of Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics."
For Mr. Xu, the Stanford researcher, this feels like déjà vu. In 1986, he analyzed why the Soviet Union and China lagged the United States and Japan in developing computers. It was clear to him even then that innovation took place when people could pursue their interests and think freely.
He says China could end up as a cautionary lesson in how central control stifles growth and tech innovation, just as it did in the old Soviet Union.
"Historical examples tell us that national mobilization cannot catch up with freewheeling development that comes naturally on its own," he said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Despite an uncertain outlook, corporations plan to continue investing in their digital projects -- a source of stability for the economy.
Johnson Controls traces its origin to the late 19th century in Wisconsin, where a clever teacher and inventor named Warren Johnson designed an early thermostat to turn the heat on or off in his classroom.
Today, Johnson Controls is an international corporation and, like companies in every industry, increasingly a technology business. The company's software and sensors monitor and manage heating and cooling equipment, fire alarms, security systems and thermostats -- to reduce costs and carbon emissions.
Despite forecasts of a recession, Johnson Controls is not trimming its digital projects, as it seeks to make essential technology for smart buildings. Last year, the company added 500 software engineers and other technical staff to its team of 2,500 software engineers. It plans to hire 350 more tech workers.
"We have to continue to invest," said Vijay Sankaran, chief technology officer of Johnson Controls. "You can't do what we're trying to do without technology."
In recent interviews and surveys, the same theme was struck again and again. The economic outlook is uncertain. Contingency plans are in place. Some initiatives are being trimmed back or slowed down. But business investment in technology remains remarkably resilient, and that trend appears likely to continue in 2023.
In a recent poll of corporate technology managers in the United States by the research firm IDC, 82 percent said they expected a recession this year. But 62 percent replied that technology spending at their companies would be the same or increase compared with 2022.
The managers who shape technology strategy and spending at companies across the country hold an important swing vote in today's economy. Their confidence could help stabilize the economy, even as consumers cut back and Silicon Valley companies trim their payrolls after a period of explosive growth fueled by the pandemic.
Technology plays a larger role in mainstream corporate operations and accounts for a larger share of business investment than in the last two recessions -- in 2001 after the dot-com bubble burst and in the 2007-9 financial crisis.
The big difference is software. Business spending on software, including software developed by companies for their own use, more than doubled over the last decade, to $ 567 billion in 2022, according to an analysis of government data by James Bessen, an economist at the Technology & Policy Research Institute at the Boston University School of Law.
That is 37 percent more than businesses spent on factories and industrial equipment combined.
The role of technology, experts say, has also steadily evolved. It is less an electricity-style utility used to automate back-office tasks and more a key ingredient that contributes to a company's revenue and profits.
In recent years, new technologies like cloud computing, data analytics, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity software have become increasingly mainstream. Companies now see them as vital tools for conducting business.
"That's going to be a counterbalance for the economy that didn't exist in the last two downturns," said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.
At Elevance Health, a big insurer and health services provider, the ever-larger role of information technology is apparent. Eighty percent of the communication contacts with the more than 45 million people the company covers are now through its website, mobile app or online chatbot. Five years ago, about 30 percent were handled on its digital channels.
Elevance, which last year changed its name from Anthem, employs a technology work force that numbers in the tens of thousands, including software engineers, user experience designers, data scientists and A.I. experts.
They work on automating tasks like authorizations for medical procedures and claims adjudication. They are also building the software to deliver personalized recommendations for treatments and health advice to medical professionals and individuals.
That goal, said Rajeev Ronanki, a senior vice president of Elevance, is the company's strategic direction. And it can be achieved only by mining and analyzing the insurer's vast stores of billing and clinical data for insights -- a job for teams of skilled tech workers.
A rocky economy may mean the company has to fine-tune its spending plans, Mr. Ronanki said. "But we're laser-focused on investing in our core priorities, and that won't change much regardless of the economy," he said.
Big Tech companies like Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta are laying off workers. But that is not true of the broader tech economy.
Most technology workers do not work at tech companies. And while employment in tech occupations did slip slightly last month, by half a percentage point, it was 7 percent higher than in January 2022. Nearly 6.5 million people work in tech jobs in America, 430,000 more than a year ago, according to an analysis of government statistics by CompTIA, a technology education and research organization.
The unemployment rate in tech occupations is 1.5 percent, compared with 3.4 percent for all workers.
Even the tech giants, after making layoffs, will have significantly more employees than before the pandemic. Most other companies did not go on wild hiring sprees, but had added steadily to their tech work forces.
JPMorgan Chase, the big bank, has a technology staff of 55,000, up from about 50,000 before the pandemic. It has hired people with skills in cloud computing, data science, A.I. and cybersecurity, and the bank will continue to add people selectively, said Lori Beer, the bank's global chief information officer.
Global technology surveys point to the weakness in spending on hardware. After a pandemic surge, sales of personal computers and smartphones for remote work and to consumers have fallen sharply. Two major technology research firms, Gartner and IDC, have lowered their growth forecasts in recent months, citing a continued slump in personal computers, the turbulent economy and a strong dollar.
But business investment, especially in software, remains fairly strong. John-David Lovelock, Gartner's chief forecaster, said spending was growing in every industry he tracks and called that trend "recession-proof." His counterpart at IDC, Stephen Minton, said business investment in technology was not immune to a downturn but was "more resilient than it's ever been."
Sales of remote cloud computing and software may be slowing, but only from the stratospheric heights of the pandemic. Amazon reported this month that its highly profitable cloud business, Amazon Web Services, the industry leader, was generating revenue at an annual rate of more than $ 80 billion and had grown 20 percent in the fourth quarter. Microsoft, the second-largest cloud company, reported that sales of Azure, its flagship cloud product, had grown 31 percent.
The recent results for technology suppliers to business show a similar pattern. Suppliers focused on helping companies convert to digital operations and cloud computing are doing well, including Accenture, Oracle and ServiceNow. IBM announced job cuts but for businesses it is shedding; its cloud and A.I. sales are strong.
Salesforce, a maker of customer-management software, is cutting jobs and is a target of activist shareholders. But their argument is that Salesforce should reduce expenses to increase profits. The company's revenue grew 14 percent in the most recent quarter.
The relentless advance of software in nearly every industry makes tech spending less cyclical.
Take the car business. A modern automobile is becoming "a vehicle that is really defined by software," said Alan Wexler, a senior vice president for innovation and growth at General Motors.
A sizable portion of the $ 35 billion that G.M. plans to invest in electric and self-driving cars and trucks through 2025 will be spent on software. The code will not only animate the cars, but also transmit entertainment, office-style communications services and automated driving upgrades to vehicles, as they increasingly navigate on their own.
BrightDrop, a G.M. start-up that makes electric cargo vans, relies on software to plan routes, conserve energy and optimize package stacking in its electric delivery pallets. FedEx recently placed an order for 2,000 BrightDrop vans, and Walmart has reserved 5,000.
When G.M. last month announced record profits, the company also said it planned to trim expenses by $ 2 billion over the next two years. It is a prudent step in an uncertain economy, its executives said.
"But we're not slowing down with these software-led growth businesses," Mr. Wexler said.

Chatbots Are Not Sentient. Here's How They Work.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: No, chatbots aren't sentient. Here's how their underlying technology works.
Microsoft released a new version of its Bing search engine last week, and unlike an ordinary search engine it includes a chatbot that can answer questions in clear, concise prose.
Since then, people have noticed that some of what the Bing chatbot generates is inaccurate, misleading and downright weird, prompting fears that it has become sentient, or aware of the world around it.
That's not the case. And to understand why, it's important to know how chatbots really work.
Is the chatbot alive?
No. Let's say that again: No!
In June, a Google engineer, Blake Lemoine, claimed that similar chatbot technology being tested inside Google was sentient. That's false. Chatbots are not conscious and are not intelligent -- at least not in the way humans are intelligent.
Why does it seem alive then?
Let's step back. The Bing chatbot is powered by a kind of artificial intelligence called a neural network. That may sound like a computerized brain, but the term is misleading.
A neural network is just a mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing vast amounts of digital data. As a neural network examines thousands of cat photos, for instance, it can learn to recognize a cat.
Most people use neural networks every day. It's the technology that identifies people, pets and other objects in images posted to internet services like Google Photos. It allows Siri and Alexa, the talking voice assistants from Apple and Amazon, to recognize the words you speak. And it's what translates between English and Spanish on services like Google Translate.
Neural networks are very good at mimicking the way humans use language. And that can mislead us into thinking the technology is more powerful than it really is.
How exactly do neural networks mimic human language?
About five years ago, researchers at companies like Google and OpenAI, a San Francisco start-up that recently released the popular ChatGPT chatbot, began building neural networks that learned from enormous amounts of digital text, including books, Wikipedia articles, chat logs and all sorts of other stuff posted to the internet.
These neural networks are known as large language models. They are able to use those mounds of data to build what you might call a mathematical map of human language. Using this map, the neural networks can perform many different tasks, like writing their own tweets, composing speeches, generating computer programs and, yes, having a conversation.
These large language models have proved useful. Microsoft offers a tool, Copilot, which is built on a large language model and can suggest the next line of code as computer programmers build software apps, in much the way that autocomplete tools suggest the next word as you type texts or emails.
Other companies offer similar technology that can generate marketing materials, emails and other text. This kind of technology is also known as generative A.I.
Now companies are rolling out versions of this that you can chat with?
Exactly. In November, OpenAI released ChatGPT, the first time that the general public got a taste of this. People were amazed -- and rightly so.
These chatbots do not chat exactly like a human, but they often seem to. They can also write term papers and poetry and riff on almost any subject thrown their way.
Why do they get stuff wrong?
Because they learn from the internet. Think about how much misinformation and other garbage is on the web.
These systems also don't repeat what is on the internet word for word. Drawing on what they have learned, they produce new text on their own, in what A.I. researchers call a "hallucination."
This is why the chatbots may give you different answers if you ask the same question twice. They will say anything, whether it is based on reality or not.
If chatbots 'hallucinate,' doesn't that make them sentient?
A.I. researchers love to use terms that make these systems seem human. But hallucinate is just a catchy term for "they make stuff up."
That sounds creepy and dangerous, but it does not mean the technology is somehow alive or aware of its surroundings. It is just generating text using patterns that it found on the internet. In many cases, it mixes and matches patterns in surprising and disturbing ways. But it is not aware of what it is doing. It cannot reason like humans can.
Can't companies stop the chatbots from acting strange?
They are trying.
With ChatGPT, OpenAI tried controlling the technology's behavior. As a small group of people privately tested the system, OpenAI asked them to rate its responses. Were they useful? Were they truthful? Then OpenAI used these ratings to hone the system and more carefully define what it would and would not do.
But such techniques are not perfect. Scientists today do not know how to build systems that are completely truthful. They can limit the inaccuracies and the weirdness, but they can't stop them. One of the ways to rein in the odd behaviors is keeping the chats short.
But chatbots will still spew things that are not true. And as other companies begin deploying these kinds of bots, not everyone will be good about controlling what they can and cannot do.
The bottom line: Don't believe everything a chatbot tells you.

Instead of a Digital Detox, Try Taking Doable Breaks: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Experts say the best way to set boundaries with technology involve sustained effort, not just a break.
Marc Benioff's version of a "digital detox," is more involved than most: The Salesforce chief executive went on a 10-day, device-free vacation to French Polynesia as his company was laying off around 8,000 workers last month. "We are so addicted to our devices (at least I am) it's very freeing to leave them all behind for a while!" he told The New York Times via text message.
But maybe a detox is the wrong metaphor. The phrase, pulled from the language of substance abuse treatment, suggests that "we at least have a sense that there's something wrong here," said Nicholas Carr, whose 2010 book, "The Shallows," was one of the first to explore the cognitive cost of digital distraction. Newer research, he says, has shown the problem isn't only about the time you spend actually looking at your devices. The mere ability to check for messages "is taking up part of our attention all the time."
Here's bad news: Taking a vacation from your phone probably won't solve much. "Leaving Las Vegas for 10 days if you're a problem gambler is great," said Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, the author of books on digital distraction and the importance of rest. "But if on day 11 you're back at the slot machines, then it's not so great." A 2021 review of 21 studies that looked at the effect of digital detoxes on aspects like anxiety and participants' sense of well-being found that most showed either no effect or mixed results at best.
What's more, cutting off all access to technology -- not so hard to imagine in 2010 -- is increasingly impractical, especially if you're not a billionaire with a staff. Even people on vacation "are reliant on mobile phones for so much, from documents to photos," said Matt Berna, the North America president for Intrepid, an adventure travel company that ended its "digital detox" tours in 2018. (It still runs many trips on which you're not likely to catch a Wi-Fi signal.)
That's not to say a digital detox is bad -- it's just not enough. "You really have to figure out how to take breaks within the realities of your daily life," said Adam Gazzaley, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco. Like any other habit, he says, "it basically takes repetition and sort of baby-stepping into it."
Experts' recommendations are less exciting than a trip to French Polynesia, though they're certainly less expensive: Turn off your notifications. Set aside an hour of single-tasking time. Put physical distance between yourself and your phone when you don't need it. And understand that although technology companies design their devices to be on your mind all the time, you don't need to follow suit.
"It's sort of like a reframing rather than a detox," Gazzaley said. "It's not that you just do it completely. You do it a little bit at a time."
We want to hear from you: How do you set boundaries with your devices? If not a "digital detox," what would you call your strategy? Let us know here .
ON OUR MINDS
How will Microsoft tweak its new A.I. chatbot? Users have reported creepy interactions with the bot persona that is part of the company's revamped Bing search engine. In response, Microsoft said it would limit the length of conversations. Will it put more guardrails in place?
What will happen to Don Lemon? The CNN morning-show anchor was rebuked by the network's chairman on Friday after he said on air that Nikki Haley, the 51-year-old Republican presidential candidate, "isn't in her prime."
Will Bitcoin continue its comeback? The cryptocurrency hit an eight-month high on Thursday, despite signs of a broadening crypto crackdown.
Who will be the Fed's new vice chair? President Biden appointed the Federal Reserve's Lael Brainard to be his top economic adviser this week, but has yet to name her replacement. One person reportedly in the running is Austan Goolsbee, the Chicago Fed President, whose position on interest rates is more centrist than Brainard's dovish stance.
How to sound smart at a party: ChatGPT
Just when you have finally caught up on crypto, small talk has turned to ChatGPT, a massively popular chatbot that has kicked off an A.I. arms race at big tech companies. If you don't have time to understand the complicated technology under the hood, never fear: We asked Kevin Roose, a technology columnist at The Times, for some lines to use (and avoid) in a conversation.
Say this: "ChatGPT's versatility is amazing, but I wonder if large language models can ever solve the hallucination problem."
Why? Chatbots like ChatGPT generate new text, and they don't care whether it's true or not. As Kevin found out in a conversation with Bing's A.I. chatbot this week in which the A.I. professed its love for him, sometimes the stuff they make up can be disturbing.
Don't say this: "I use ChatGPT for math."
Why? The technology works by scanning massive amounts of text and then developing a model to predict which words come next in a sentence. But it's notoriously error-prone at crunching numbers, hallucinating wrong answers (see above) while insisting it's correct.
"There's no contact, I don't have 300-pound guys falling on top of me. It's just a matter of shooting the lowest score."
-- Tiger Woods, on why the nature of golf makes it possible to ignore ordinary retirement timelines for athletes .
Taking down a Chinese spy balloon, by the numbers
The downing of a Chinese spy balloon and three takedowns of mysterious (but likely innocuous) U.F.O.s continue to transfix the public. Little is known about the military operations that intercepted these objects flying over the United States and Canada -- but we do know they weren't exactly cheap.
$ 143 million: The price of an F-22 Raptor, the plane built by Lockheed Martin and Boeing that was used in the first three takedowns. It's considered one of the most expensive fighter planes ever built.
$ 439,000: The price of one Raytheon AIM-9X sidewinder, the type of missile used to shoot the objects down, according to Bloomberg. The Pentagon used at least five of the missiles.
$ 400 billion: The combined market cap of the three firms -- Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon -- behind these missions. Stock of the latter two are trading near all-time highs, and Boeing's shares are up nearly 10 percent since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Basically zero: The cost of shooting down the balloon and U.F.O.s is "not even a rounding error" in the U.S. military's roughly $ 770 billion budget, according to Zach Rosenberg of Janes, the defense and intelligence firm.
On our radar: $ 1,400 robot shoes
Most people don't think of walking as an outdated technology, but a Pittsburgh start-up called Shift Robotics says "the way we walk is stuck in the past." Positioned as a safer alternative to a scooter or bike, the company's Moonwalkers strap on to normal shoes and increase the speed of walking to about 7 m.p.h., a decent running pace. A reviewer for Fast Company said wearing the shoes, which for now are only available for preorder, "feels a bit like being on a moving walkway." Are the $ 1,400 shoes the next Segway -- a promising high-tech solution to urban transportation that ends up working better as a gimmick -- or the future of micro-mobility? It's hard to know until they start shipping, which the company expects to happen this summer.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Just a few years ago, China was on track to challenge U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence. The balance of power was tilting in China’s direction because it had abundant data, hungry entrepreneurs, skilled scientists and supportive policies. The country led the world in patent filings related to artificial intelligence.
Today, much has changed. Microsoft — an icon of American technology — helped the startup OpenAI usher its experimental chatbot, ChatGPT, into the world. And China’s tech entrepreneurs are shocked and demoralized. It has dawned on many of them that despite the hype, China lags far behind in artificial intelligence and tech innovation.
“Why wasn’t ChatGPT invented in China?” they asked. “How big is the ChatGPT gap between China and the U.S.?” “The Chinese equivalent of ChatGPT? Don’t take it too seriously.”
They’re also asking more fundamental questions about the country’s innovation environment: Have censorship, geopolitical tensions and the government’s growing control of the private sector made China less friendly to innovation?
“The development of any significant technological product is inseparable from the system and environment in which it operates,” said Xu Chenggang, a senior research scholar at the Stanford Center on China’s Economy and Institutions.
He cited TikTok’s Chinese-language sister app Douyin as the sort of innovation that Chinese companies might be unable to achieve in the future because of government limitations on the industry.
“Once the open environment is gone, it will be challenging to create such products,” he said.
If a decade ago China was the wild, wild East for tech entrepreneurship and innovation, it’s a very different country now.
Starting in the 1990s, all of the country’s biggest tech companies were private enterprises funded with foreign money. The government mostly left the industry alone because it didn’t understand the internet and didn’t expect it to become so powerful.
By the mid-2010s, China had become a tech power that could rival the United States. Its top internet companies were worth about the same in the markets as their U.S. counterparts. Many of the Chinese companies’ products, such as the messaging app WeChat and the payment service Alipay, worked better than similar American mobile internet products. Venture capital flooded in from all over the world. For a while the country was producing as many unicorns, or startups valued at more than $1 billion, as Silicon Valley.
All of that changed over the past few years as Beijing went after some of the country’s biggest tech companies and its highest-profile tech entrepreneurs. The aim was to ensure no institution or individual could wield influence on the Chinese society comparable to the Communist Party. The government took minority stakes and board seats in some of those companies, giving it effective control.
Along the way, Beijing tamed the industry’s ambition and blunted its innovative edge.
But tech companies and investors also have themselves to blame for falling behind their Silicon Valley counterparts. Even before the government started to impose a stronger hand on them, Chinese tech leaders were laser focused on making money and reluctant to spend on research projects that weren’t likely to yield revenue in the short term. After the government’s onslaught in the past few years, executives are even less inclined to invest in long-term ventures.
In 2021, the United States led the world in total private investment in artificial intelligence and in the number of newly funded AI companies, which was three and two times the levels in China, according to Stanford University’s AI Index 2022 Annual Report.
But the government has been the biggest barrier to AI — its obsession with censorship perhaps its heaviest club. The availability of a wide range of data is crucial to developing technology like ChatGPT, and that is increasingly harder to come by in a censored online environment.
Today, jokes circulate that capture the dark mood among tech people. A popular one: “We need to teach machines not only how to speak, but also how not to speak.”
Beijing has punished companies, sometimes severely, to enforce its censorship protocols. Duolingo, which is in the seemingly noncontroversial business of teaching people new languages, was taken out of Chinese app stores for nearly a year to “enhance its content regulation,” according to Chinese media reports.
“Many of us in the internet industry are faced with two problems when making a product: Either our products don’t involve speech, or they have to undergo a lot of censorship,” said Hao Peiqiang, a former entrepreneur and programmer in the northern city of Tianjin. “Big companies can afford it, but smaller companies can’t. If small companies can’t do this, it stifles innovation.”
OpenAI, which has developed ChatGPT with the help of Microsoft’s money, hasn’t made the tool available in China. Mainland Chinese users need to use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to gain access to it.

For years China bragged that it filed more patent and artificial intelligence patent applications than the United States. But the average number of citations of its AI patents — an indication of the originality and importance of its inventions — lagged the United States and many other developed countries between 2020 and 2021, according to the China AI index from Xu’s team.
If China’s tech industry used to be driven by private enterprises and private venture funding, the government is increasingly guiding not only how money is invested but also which technology gets the money. It wants to ensure that important research projects conform with the country’s goal of becoming self-reliant in tech.
“China’s policymakers are seeking to systematically address and integrate every step of the innovation process,” the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin wrote in a research paper.
On Monday, Beijing’s municipal government pledged support for big tech companies developing large language models to compete with ChatGPT. Social media comments on the news were largely sarcastic. “Time to grab the government subsidies again,” one Weibo user wrote.
The Chinese government has spent a lot on funding artificial intelligence research, with unclear results. The Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, established in 2018, introduced a ChatGPT-like product two years ago, Wu Dao, describing it as “China’s first and the world’s largest” AI language model. But it never really caught on.
The Communist Party’s influence is imprinted on the industry. The central government set up the Pengcheng Laboratory, which has taken the lead on improving China’s nationwide computing infrastructure. On the lab’s homepage, its events include a session for its 400-plus Communist Party members to study the spirit of the 20th Party Congress. An item seeking to hire two midlevel officials lists as its first requirement “possessing high ideological and political qualities and adhering to the guidance of Xi Jinping’s new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics.”
For Xu, this feels like déjà vu. In 1986, he analyzed why the Soviet Union and China lagged the United States and Japan in developing computers. It was clear to him even then that innovation took place when people could pursue their interests and think freely.
He says China could end up as a cautionary lesson in how central control stifles growth and tech innovation, just as it did in the old Soviet Union.
“Historical examples tell us that national mobilization cannot catch up with freewheeling development that comes naturally on its own,” he said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Re "Bing's Chatbot Drew Me In and Creeped Me Out," by Kevin Roose (The Shift column, front page, Feb. 17):
After reading Mr. Roose's article, I'm sure I'm not alone in having concerns about the abilities and uses of A.I.
While we hope to trust companies like Microsoft and Google to put in safeguards, an obvious concern is that some bad actor or even government may use this technology to develop an A.I. system without such safeguards, much as there are now social media sites set up to promote false narratives and conspiracy theories.
Has humankind opened a Pandora's box of unintended consequences, where we will now need to develop A.I. to counter that possible threat -- a new race in this unlimited frontier?
Daniel Samakow
Venice, Calif.
To the Editor:
I recognized a pattern in the dialogue between Kevin Roose and the Bing chatbot that made my blood run cold. The A.I. personality proclaimed love but would not take no for an answer, offering verbal attacks and coercion when Mr. Roose demurred.
Victims of domestic violence or stalking know this pattern well.
If A.I. draws on the total sum of digitized human speech and text, of course abusive impulses will be replicated. Do A.I. engineers think they can prevent human and societal ills in A.I. that we have scant success preventing in people? We should doubt this capacity.
At a minimum, all A.I.-involved text exchanges, articles and other products must be clearly labeled as A.I. products, and we need consumer protection laws requiring this labeling.
Let's give people a heads-up that the product is not from another living person but tossed up from a giant trawling net in the digital ocean that indiscriminately collects trash alongside signs of life.
Abe Louise Young
Austin, Texas
To the Editor:
Human-to-human relationships are often riddled with toxic comments, passive-aggressive swipes and manipulation. It looks as if the chatbot in Kevin Roose's revealing article is following in our dysfunctional footsteps.

Stocks Drop On Worries Over Rates: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After stocks jumped more than 6 percent in January, the tone shifted markedly this week as a steady flow of data showed the economy continued to run hot.
It's dawning on stock investors that they were wrong about the Federal Reserve.
After rallying behind a resilient economy, slowing inflation and the hope that the central bank would end its interest-rate increases sooner than it had communicated, stock trading has grown jittery.
The S&P 500 has lost its momentum in February, after a drop this week that left it 2.4 percent lower than its peak early in the month. Stocks have oscillated between gains and losses as new economic data have clouded the outlook for investors, marking a notable shift in the market after stocks jumped more than 6 percent in January.
The change in tone this week came as a steady flow of data has shown the economy continued to run hot in January. Despite high-profile layoffs at big technology firms like Meta and Microsoft, employers in the United States continued to hire at a rapid clip, consumers kept spending and prices continued to rise briskly at the start of the year across an array of goods and services.
All those data points suggest that the economy retains significant vigor, even after a year of rapid policy adjustments aimed at cooling down the economy. Fed officials had repeatedly warned that there was more work to do to slow rising prices, but investors had hoped that a slowdown in inflation that took hold in earnest late last year would allow policymakers to hit pause on their rate adjustments sooner than they had predicted. Now, mounting evidence that the economy remains surprisingly strong and price increases unexpectedly stubborn have begun undercutting that narrative.
In response, investors have sharply raised their expectations for the number of times the Fed will increase interest rates in the coming months. And even central bankers themselves have begun to float the possibility that rates will need to climb higher than they previously expected if the economy does not cool down. Higher interest rates raise costs for consumers and companies, slowing demand and typically weighing on the stock market.
"I'm very negative right now on equities," said Eric Johnston, the head of equity derivatives at Cantor Fitzgerald, who predicted the recent S&P 500 rally but now expects a slump. "I think the move we have seen in the rate market, some of the inflation numbers that have come out and the expectation that the economy will be fine is all fairly problematic."
Mr. Johnston now thinks the S&P 500 will eventually fall below its 2022 low, a drop of more than 10 percent from current levels. Strategists at Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase are also among those bracing for a fall.
Bond investors had been quicker to shift their view.
At the start of this month, investors betting on the path of interest rates predicted the Fed would raise its benchmark rate just once more this year, by a quarter of a percentage point in March.
Now, those traders are leaning to three increases of that size, through July, which would take the Fed's target rate to a range of 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent. That's above the Fed's own most recent forecasts, published in December.
But policymakers have also hinted that their own estimates could be poised for revision if the economy continues to run hotter than previously anticipated.
John C. Williams, president of the powerful Federal Reserve Bank of New York, suggested this week that rates were likely to rise to a range of 5 percent to 5.5 percent -- slightly above the 5 percent to 5.25 percent median in the central bank's December forecast. He and several of his colleagues have said they may need to do even more than that if consumption and the labor market remain so robust.
"With the strength in the labor market, clearly there's risks that inflation stays higher for longer than expected or that we might need to raise rates higher than that," Mr. Williams told reporters in New York this week.
Loretta Mester, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said during a speech on Thursday that "we may very well have to move higher, hold it longer at that peak rate or even change what we do at any particular meeting" if economic pressures kept inflation elevated.
Given recent data, economists at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America changed their forecasts on Thursday. They are now predicting that the Fed would raise rates to 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent this year -- a quarter point higher than either bank had previously estimated.
"The Fed might have to hike further if inflation, job growth and consumer demand refuse to soften," Michael Gapen at Bank of America wrote in a research note explaining the shift.
For investors, the possibility of more rate moves has rekindled the fear that the Fed's campaign will push the economy into a downturn. It's an about-face from the more optimistic view that had taken hold in financial markets at the start of the year, that inflation could fall while the economy continued to grow.
"We had just got comfortable with what the Fed told us it was going to do two weeks ago, and already we are having to rethink that," David Donabedian, the chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth US, said, referring to the recent Fed meeting. "The momentum in the market has stopped."

Just a few years ago, China was on track to challenge U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence. The balance of power was tilting in China’s direction because it had abundant data, hungry entrepreneurs, skilled scientists and supportive policies. The country led the world in patent filings related to artificial intelligence.
Today, much has changed. Microsoft — an icon of American technology — helped the startup OpenAI usher its experimental chatbot, ChatGPT, into the world. And China’s tech entrepreneurs are shocked and demoralized. It has dawned on many of them that despite the hype, China lags far behind in artificial intelligence and tech innovation.
“Why wasn’t ChatGPT invented in China?” they asked. “How big is the ChatGPT gap between China and the U.S.?” “The Chinese equivalent of ChatGPT? Don’t take it too seriously.”
They’re also asking more fundamental questions about the country’s innovation environment: Have censorship, geopolitical tensions and the government’s growing control of the private sector made China less friendly to innovation?
“The development of any significant technological product is inseparable from the system and environment in which it operates,” said Xu Chenggang, a senior research scholar at the Stanford Center on China’s Economy and Institutions.
He cited TikTok’s Chinese-language sister app Douyin as the sort of innovation that Chinese companies might be unable to achieve in the future because of government limitations on the industry.
“Once the open environment is gone, it will be challenging to create such products,” he said.
If a decade ago China was the wild, wild East for tech entrepreneurship and innovation, it’s a very different country now.
Starting in the 1990s, all of the country’s biggest tech companies were private enterprises funded with foreign money. The government mostly left the industry alone because it didn’t understand the internet and didn’t expect it to become so powerful.
By the mid-2010s, China had become a tech power that could rival the United States. Its top internet companies were worth about the same in the markets as their U.S. counterparts. Many of the Chinese companies’ products, such as the messaging app WeChat and the payment service Alipay, worked better than similar American mobile internet products. Venture capital flooded in from all over the world. For a while the country was producing as many unicorns, or startups valued at more than $1 billion, as Silicon Valley.
All of that changed over the past few years as Beijing went after some of the country’s biggest tech companies and its highest-profile tech entrepreneurs. The aim was to ensure no institution or individual could wield influence on the Chinese society comparable to the Communist Party. The government took minority stakes and board seats in some of those companies, giving it effective control.
Along the way, Beijing tamed the industry’s ambition and blunted its innovative edge.
But tech companies and investors also have themselves to blame for falling behind their Silicon Valley counterparts. Even before the government started to impose a stronger hand on them, Chinese tech leaders were laser focused on making money and reluctant to spend on research projects that weren’t likely to yield revenue in the short term. After the government’s onslaught in the past few years, executives are even less inclined to invest in long-term ventures.
In 2021, the United States led the world in total private investment in artificial intelligence and in the number of newly funded AI companies, which was three and two times the levels in China, according to Stanford University’s AI Index 2022 Annual Report.
But the government has been the biggest barrier to AI — its obsession with censorship perhaps its heaviest club. The availability of a wide range of data is crucial to developing technology like ChatGPT, and that is increasingly harder to come by in a censored online environment.
Today, jokes circulate that capture the dark mood among tech people. A popular one: “We need to teach machines not only how to speak, but also how not to speak.”
Beijing has punished companies, sometimes severely, to enforce its censorship protocols. Duolingo, which is in the seemingly noncontroversial business of teaching people new languages, was taken out of Chinese app stores for nearly a year to “enhance its content regulation,” according to Chinese media reports.
“Many of us in the internet industry are faced with two problems when making a product: Either our products don’t involve speech, or they have to undergo a lot of censorship,” said Hao Peiqiang, a former entrepreneur and programmer in the northern city of Tianjin. “Big companies can afford it, but smaller companies can’t. If small companies can’t do this, it stifles innovation.”
OpenAI, which has developed ChatGPT with the help of Microsoft’s money, hasn’t made the tool available in China. Mainland Chinese users need to use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to gain access to it.
The artificial intelligence gap with the United States is expected to keep widening, according to China experts and investors. One factor will be Chinese companies’ access to algorithms, the rules that AI tools follow to make language. Many of them aren’t publicly available, so it will take time for Chinese companies to develop them.
The other factor is computing power: Some people in the sector worry that the U.S. government could impose export bans on key chips it has not already banned to slow China’s development in AI tools like ChatGPT.
For years China bragged that it filed more patent and artificial intelligence patent applications than the United States. But the average number of citations of its AI patents — an indication of the originality and importance of its inventions — lagged the United States and many other developed countries between 2020 and 2021, according to the China AI index from Xu’s team.
If China’s tech industry used to be driven by private enterprises and private venture funding, the government is increasingly guiding not only how money is invested but also which technology gets the money. It wants to ensure that important research projects conform with the country’s goal of becoming self-reliant in tech.
“China’s policymakers are seeking to systematically address and integrate every step of the innovation process,” the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin wrote in a research paper.

The Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, established in 2018, introduced a ChatGPT-like product two years ago, Wu Dao, describing it as “China’s first and the world’s largest” AI language model. But it never really caught on.
The Communist Party’s influence is imprinted on the industry. The central government set up the Pengcheng Laboratory, which has taken the lead on improving China’s nationwide computing infrastructure. On the lab’s homepage, its events include a session for its 400-plus Communist Party members to study the spirit of the 20th Party Congress. An item seeking to hire two midlevel officials lists as its first requirement “possessing high ideological and political qualities and adhering to the guidance of Xi Jinping’s new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics.”

Ex-Church Committee Aides Send Jordan an Open Letter: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Staff members from the panel viewed as the gold standard of congressional inquiry advised the top Republican to pursue a bipartisan inquiry and operate in good faith with Democrats.
As the new Republican-led panel tasked with investigating the weaponization of government continued to issue new subpoenas this week, those who orchestrated the inquiry that its leaders have claimed as a model are warning the chairman against allowing his work to veer into partisan territory.
More than two dozen staff members from the panel formed in the 1970s that came to be known as the Church Committee sent an open letter on Wednesday to Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and its powerful new subcommittee. They offered advice for how he could follow in the footsteps of their panel, which uncovered decades of intelligence and civil liberties abuses under presidents of both parties and set the gold standard in Congress for scrutinizing the executive branch.
The counsel is simple: Pursue a bipartisan inquiry, follow the facts, do not try to interfere with open investigations and operate in good faith.
The Church Committee, formed in 1975 and commonly known by the name of its chairman, Senator Frank Church, Democrat of Idaho, was formally called the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities. It investigated warrantless electronic surveillance affecting U.S. citizens; C.I.A. assassination plots against foreign leaders; C.I.A. and F.B.I. mail-opening programs; C.I.A. drug testing on unwitting governmental personnel; communications intercepts affecting Americans; and the disruption and discrediting of peaceful civil rights and antiwar activists.
It is regarded by members of both parties as the paragon of a bipartisan and productive congressional inquiry.
Mr. Jordan's panel, by contrast, has begun amid partisan strife. Democrats have objected even to the creation of the committee and its goals, and Republicans have made clear that their aim is to focus on one side of the partisan ledger, seeking evidence that the federal government is biased against conservatives and the right. The formation of a "Church-style committee" was a top demand of a band of right-wing Republicans who resisted electing Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California, and its inaugural hearing last week relitigated a litany of old grievances about the treatment of former President Donald J. Trump and others.
"If they're sincere about emulating the Church Committee model, then we wanted the particulars to be laid out there clearly so that everyone has guideposts to measure the extent to which Jordan is succeeding or failing and living up to the legacy of the Church Committee," Frederick D. Baron, a former associate deputy attorney general who was a lawyer for the Church Committee, said of the letter.
Paul Michel, a former federal judge appointed by President Ronald Reagan who served as a Republican aide on the Church Committee, said many lines of inquiry the panel had pursued did not pan out.
"There were a lot of hints of some very bad conduct, but when we pursued all the documents and the witnesses, some of it turned out to be quite innocent," he recalled. "So if the Jordan committee is evenhanded factually, they'll do a good job and it'll be credible. But if they pursue what some people might call conspiracy theories, and only look at things that seem to support that, it will eventually be viewed as not credible."
A spokesman for the panel declined to comment.
The letter comes as the House Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government has begun issuing subpoenas, seeking documents for an investigation into whether the government mistreated parents who were scrutinized after school officials endured threats and harassment over mask mandates and teaching about racism.
On Wednesday, Mr. Jordan issued more subpoenas, this time to the technology companies Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft for documents and communications relating to whether they had worked with the federal government to block certain Americans from communicating through their platforms -- something Mr. Jordan calls "censorship by proxy."
The subpoenas require the chief executives of those companies, Sundar Pichai, Andy Jassy, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Satya Nadella, to turn over all requested documents and communications by March 23.
The committee did not issue a subpoena to Twitter or its owner, Elon Musk, who has at times aligned himself with the right, urging voters last fall to elect Republicans and saying he would welcome Mr. Trump back to his platform.
In the letters, the panel said such an action was unnecessary because Twitter "recently set a benchmark for how transparent Big Tech companies can be about interactions with government over censorship." The committee cited the release of the so-called Twitter Files, which showed how the company restricted some tweets after receiving requests to do so from government officials.
The House Judiciary Committee said it has been working to get documents from the companies since December, when Republicans were in the minority, without success.
"Your response without compulsory process has been woefully inadequate," Mr. Jordan wrote to the executives.
On Thursday, Mr. Jordan sent a letter to Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, demanding answers about what he called the bureau's "targeting of a set of Catholic Americans for their religious beliefs." At issue is a Jan. 23 memo from the F.B.I.'s Richmond field office that linked "racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists" with a "radical traditionalist Catholic" ideology, prompting outrage from Catholic groups and Republican attorneys general. The F.B.I. headquarters in Washington has since disavowed the document and blamed the field office for its creation.
The letter requires Mr. Wray to produce documents about the memo by March 2.
At the weaponization committee's first hearing, Democrats fought against the panel's very premise and argued that Mr. Jordan had not given agencies enough time to respond to him before issuing subpoenas.
Church Committee staff members recalled a different era on Capitol Hill, when Republicans and Democrats worked closely together and "to an extent that my students can hardly even imagine," said Gregory F. Treverton, a former chairman of the National Intelligence Council who was a Democratic staff member on the panel.
"On the Church Committee, there was broad agreement that these things ought to be looked at and, in the end, there was broad agreement on what we might do about them," he said. "In this case, there's no broad agreement on what ought to be looked at."

Inflation Report Rattles the Markets: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street tumbled Thursday, and stocks fell by the most in four weeks following more evidence that high inflation is staying stickier than expected.
The S&P 500 dropped 1.4 percent after a report said inflation at the wholesale level slowed by less last month than economists forecast. It echoed a report on prices at the consumer level from earlier this week that suggested inflation isn't cooling as quickly and as smoothly as hoped.
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.3 percent, while the Nasdaq composite fell 1.8 percent.
Stocks have been churning recently as worries about sticky inflation joust against data suggesting the economy remains more resilient than feared. The worry is that persistently high inflation will push the Federal Reserve to get even more aggressive on interest rates. Higher rates can drive down inflation but also drag on investment prices and raise the risk of a serious recession.
Such fears have been most clear in the bond market, where yields have leaped this month as traders raise their forecasts for how high the Fed will take interest rates.
The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.67 percent from less than 4.6 percent before the inflation report's release and from less than 4.1 percent earlier this month. It's near its highest level since November, when the yield reached levels last seen in 2007.
Thursday's inflation report showed that prices at the wholesale level were 6 percent higher last month than a year earlier. While that was a slowdown from December's rate, it was worse than what economists expected. Perhaps more concerning was that inflation accelerated in January on a month-to-month basis even after stripping out prices for food, energy and other layers.
The inflation report thudded onto Wall Street along with a batch of other data painting a mixed picture of the economy.
Fewer workers applied for jobless benefits last week than expected, a sign that layoffs remain low across the economy. That's good news for workers and another signal of strength for the job market, but the Fed worries it could add pressure on inflation.
Other reports showed a measure of manufacturing activity in the mid-Atlantic region plunged this month, while homebuilders broke ground on fewer homes last month than economists expected.
Altogether, the reports cast some doubt on Wall Street's hopes that the Federal Reserve could manage to slow the economy just enough to stamp out inflation but not so much that it creates a severe recession. Hopes for a "soft landing" for the economy nevertheless remain firmly in the market, with the S&P 500 still up 6.5 percent since the turn of the year.
"I would go further and say 'no landing,"' said Nate Thooft, senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management. "It's almost as if there's no softness perceived, or it's so minimal that it's not really viewed as recessionary at all."
Mr. Thooft said there's a chance both markets could ultimately be proven correct, that the Fed could keep rates higher for longer while the economy avoids a recession, but he's skeptical. He thinks what's more likely is a shallow recession or slowdown in growth, but one that lasts longer than markets may be prepared for.
Recently, he was thinking weakness in the economy could last just a few months. But his expectations for a "higher-for-longer" Fed have him now thinking it could last up to a year.
Big technology and high-growth stocks led the overall market lower Thursday, in part because they're seen as some of the most vulnerable to higher interest rates. In earlier years, their stocks shot higher in part because of record-low interest rates.
A 2.7 percent fall for Microsoft, a 3.3 percent drop for Nvidia and a 4.7 percent slide for Tesla were some of the heaviest weights on the S&P 500.

Why Chatbots Sometimes Act Weird and Spout Nonsense

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Microsoft released a new version of its Bing search engine last week, and unlike an ordinary search engine it includes a chatbot that can answer questions in clear, concise prose.
Since then, people have noticed that some of what the Bing chatbot generates is inaccurate, misleading and downright weird, prompting fears that it has become sentient, or aware of the world around it.
That’s not the case. And to understand why, it’s important to know how chatbots really work.
Is the chatbot alive?
No. Let’s say that again: No!
In June, a Google engineer, Blake Lemoine, claimed that similar chatbot technology being tested inside Google was sentient. That’s false. Chatbots are not conscious and are not intelligent — at least not in the way humans are intelligent.
Why does it seem alive then?
Let’s step back. The Bing chatbot is powered by a kind of artificial intelligence called a neural network. That may sound like a computerized brain, but the term is misleading.
A neural network is just a mathematical system that learns skills by analyzing vast amounts of digital data. As a neural network examines thousands of cat photos, for instance, it can learn to recognize a cat.
Most people use neural networks every day. It’s the technology that identifies people, pets and other objects in images posted to internet services like Google Photos. It allows Siri and Alexa, the talking voice assistants from Apple and Amazon, to recognize the words you speak. And it’s what translates between English and Spanish on services like Google Translate.
Neural networks are very good at mimicking the way humans use language. And that can mislead us into thinking the technology is more powerful than it really is.
How exactly do neural networks mimic human language?
About five years ago, researchers at companies like Google and OpenAI, a San Francisco startup that recently released the popular ChatGPT chatbot, began building neural networks that learned from enormous amounts of digital text, including books, Wikipedia articles, chat logs and all sorts of other stuff posted to the internet.
These neural networks are known as large language models. They are able to use those mounds of data to build what you might call a mathematical map of human language. Using this map, the neural networks can perform many tasks, like writing their own tweets, composing speeches, generating computer programs and, yes, having a conversation.
These large language models have proved useful. Microsoft offers a tool, Copilot, which is built on a large language model and can suggest the next line of code as computer programmers build software apps, in much the way that autocomplete tools suggest the next word as you type texts or emails.
Other companies offer similar technology that can generate marketing materials, emails and other text. This kind of technology is also known as generative AI.
Now companies are rolling out versions of this that you can chat with?
Exactly. In November, OpenAI released ChatGPT, the first time that the general public got a taste of this. People were amazed — and rightly so.
These chatbots do not chat exactly like a human, but they often seem to. They can also write term papers and poetry and riff on almost any subject thrown their way.
Why do they get stuff wrong?
Because they learn from the internet. Think about how much misinformation and other garbage is on the web.
These systems also don’t repeat what is on the internet word for word. Drawing on what they have learned, they produce new text on their own, in what AI researchers call a “hallucination.”
This is why the chatbots may give you different answers if you ask the same question twice. They will say anything, whether it is based on reality or not.
If chatbots ‘hallucinate,’ doesn’t that make them sentient?
AI researchers love to use terms that make these systems seem human. But hallucinate is just a catchy term for “they make stuff up.”
That sounds creepy and dangerous, but it does not mean the technology is somehow alive or aware of its surroundings. It is just generating text using patterns that it found on the internet. In many cases, it mixes and matches patterns in surprising and disturbing ways. But it is not aware of what it is doing. It cannot reason like humans can.
Can’t companies stop the chatbots from acting strange?
They are trying.
With ChatGPT, OpenAI tried controlling the technology’s behavior. As a small group of people privately tested the system, OpenAI asked them to rate its responses. Were they useful? Were they truthful? Then OpenAI used these ratings to hone the system and more carefully define what it would and would not do.
But such techniques are not perfect. Scientists today do not know how to build systems that are completely truthful. They can limit the inaccuracies and the weirdness, but they can’t stop them. One of the ways to rein in the odd behaviors is keeping the chats short.
But chatbots will still spew things that are not true. And as other companies begin deploying these kinds of bots, not everyone will be good about controlling what they can and cannot do.
The bottom line: Don’t believe everything a chatbot tells you. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Here to Help; How to Tell if Your Brain Needs a Break: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Taking a few minutes to do a puzzle -- or stare into space -- can allow you to return to work sharper and more creative.
It's 1:02 p.m. Do you know what your brain is doing?
If the answer is trawling the bowels of the internet instead of finishing those spreadsheets, it might be time to step away from your desk. Brain slumps are real, said Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine. And the antidote to this midafternoon mind sludge isn't muddling through, no matter what hustle culture wants you to believe. It's the opposite: You should take a break.
"We can't expect to lift weights nonstop all day, and we can't expect to use sustained focus and attention for extended periods of time, either," said Dr. Mark, author of "Attention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness and Productivity." While your brain is not a muscle, the analogy is a good one, since staying focused requires our brains to burn energy, said Marta Sabariego, an assistant professor at Mount Holyoke College who studies attention and other goal directed behaviors.
But the most compelling reason for taking a brain break is that it may improve your ability to do quality work. A 2022 systematic review published in the journal PLoS ONE found that even short breaks lasting 10 minutes or less reduced mental fatigue and increased vigor (meaning the willingness to persist when work became difficult).
These breaks especially improved performance on tasks requiring creativity and less so for activities like basic arithmetic.
The analysis found that the longer the break, the better the performance boost. Since few of us can take unlimited breaks, the trick is to use the time you have wisely -- even if that means ignoring your boss's dirty look as you fiddle with a Rubik's Cube.
How We Focus (or Don't)
Paying attention isn't so much an action as a way of processing information, Dr. Sabariego said. When we're focused, our brains' "task-related networks" filter out distractions, from the smell of fish in the office microwave to a co-worker's incessant pen tapping.
When we're unfocused, our brains switch to the default mode network, said Dr. Srini Pillay, a psychiatrist and the author of "Tinker Dabble Doodle Try." He sometimes jokingly calls this the "do mostly nothing" system, because it's active when we're daydreaming.
In most people's brains, "when one is working, the other one is off," Dr. Sabariego said. The task-related network is great for checking items off your to-do list, but usually just one at a time. Problem-solving and innovation usually require letting your mind wander in order to brainstorm possible solutions using the default mode network.
"The default mode network can actually retrieve details from the nooks and crannies in your brain's memories that the logical brain cannot retrieve," Dr. Pillay said, "which is why sometimes people say they have their best ideas in the shower."
For creative thinking, we need to give our thoughts room to roam -- ideally by taking a break.
Timing Is Everything
The urge to check Instagram every two minutes is more universal than you might think. Dr. Mark has been studying how knowledge workers (most employees who sit at computers all day) spend their time during the work day since the early 2000s. Her research involves tracking how often workers switch between tabs on their computers -- from email to spreadsheets to chat apps and back again.
In 2012, Dr. Mark did a study on 13 such workers and found that the average time they spent on one screen or tab -- be it a work-related program or social media -- was 75 seconds. As her research went on over the years, "it started declining," she said. In 2020, one of Dr. Mark's graduate students tracked 50 workers and found that the average time spent on one tab was 44 seconds.
The problem is that "you can only consciously think about one or two things at a time," said Johann Hari, the author of "Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention -- and How to Think Deeply Again." "That's a fundamental limitation of the human brain."
"Multitasking -- or toggling between spreadsheets and email -- can increase mistakes, reduce creativity and cause fatigue," Mr. Hari added. If your job requires you to multitask, chances are you'll need to take a break more often.
How often? Everyone's brain works differently, so there isn't a hard and fast rule, Dr. Sabariego said. It also depends on what you're doing. You may stay focused for 90 minutes or more doing work you find challenging and rewarding, she said.
Menial or boring tasks don't produce the dopamine reward we get when we engage with something interesting. "Dopamine helps us narrow our visual and auditory world and increases our motivation," Dr. Sabariego said, so you may need more frequent breaks when doing these sorts of tasks.
You can also build focus over time, she added. If you need a break every 30 minutes, try setting a timer and staying on task for 32, 35, then 40 minutes to help you space your breaks further apart.
Don't Quit Too Soon
One thing to note: The popular Pomodoro Technique, which involves working for 25 minutes before taking a three- to five-minute break, is more of a method for fighting procrastination than optimizing deep focus. It takes time to get back to work after an interruption, Mr. Hari said. If your timer goes off but you're still in the zone, keep going.
Consider your own circadian rhythms before arbitrarily setting a timer. Many people have peaks in their ability to pay attention around 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., with things often dropping off after lunch, Dr. Mark said. You may be able to focus for longer in the morning, but need more frequent breaks later in the day.
Break Your Sedentary Ways
Heading out into nature for some sort of physical activity is one of the best ways to give your brain a break, Dr. Mark said. She worked on a study with Microsoft Research that found that workers who took a 20-minute walk in nature came back to their work with greater "divergent attention," meaning they had more creative ideas upon returning than those who kept working.
If you can't get out into nature, a walk through your office building will also confer benefits. Dr. Pillay refers to midday physical activity as a "booster break," based on a 2013 study that found workers that took a 15-minute physical exercise break reported reduced stress and enhanced social interaction in their workplaces.
Put Your Phone Away
"We've devalued the idea of what a break is so that it's, 'I took a break from looking at my emails on my computer so I could take a walk and look at my emails on my phone,"' Mr. Hari said. Checking emails is still challenging your brain to stay in the task-related network, so you're not exactly letting your mind wander. Even browsing social media may not be the brain break you think it is.
"If you see something upsetting on Twitter, that can interrupt your task at hand," Dr. Mark said. "That's going to stick with you as you move on to something else." When that happens, you won't be starting your next task refreshed and ready to focus, which was the goal of your break.
Let Your 'Little Mind' Play
In a 2013 Daily Beast article, Maya Angelou referred to her work process as switching between her "big mind and her little mind." Her big mind did the heavy lifting, crafting the poems she became famous for. Her little mind, which she used in between writing sessions, loved doing crossword puzzles.
"I love this idea," Dr. Mark said. "The little mind allows your big mind to kind of refresh and replenish."
Solving a Rubik's Cube, knitting or even playing a simple game on your phone can have the same effect as a crossword puzzle, she added. However, be careful not to get sucked into endless rounds of Candy Crush. Consider setting a timer for 15 to 20 minutes, which should be enough to give your task-oriented network a breather.
Take a Nap or Have a Snack
Few workers have the option to take a midday nap, but if you do, take it. Even just a five- to 15-minute nap can bring clarity, though you'll need a longer rest to boost creativity, Dr. Pillay said. It generally takes the body about 90 minutes to get into R.E.M. sleep, which researchers have associated with increased creativity.
Or have a snack. Brain cells need glucose, and their activity is critical to getting into focus, Dr. Sabariego said. However, eating a large amount of food can activate the parasympathetic nervous system, making us sleepy. Instead of slamming three fistfuls of chocolate covered raisins, Dr. Pillay suggests an apple.

G.O.P. Critic of F.T.C. Chair Quits Over 'Abuse of Power': [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Christine Wilson, the sole Republican commissioner at the F.T.C., criticized Lina Khan, the Democratic chair of the agency, accusing her of an "abuse of power."
WASHINGTON -- Christine Wilson, the sole Republican commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission, said on Tuesday that she would soon resign and criticized Lina Khan, the Democratic chair of the agency, accusing her of an "abuse of power."
Ms. Wilson, who announced her decision in an opinion essay in The Wall Street Journal, has been a consistent critic of Ms. Khan's leadership. Ms. Khan, who became chair of the F.T.C. in June 2021, immediately set out to aggressively transform the agency into a bulwark against tech mergers and monopolies and a more powerful regulator of online privacy.
Ms. Wilson and another former Republican member of the F.T.C., Noah Phillips, who resigned in October, have repeatedly expressed concerns that Ms. Khan's ambitions exceeded the legal authority of the agency, which enforces consumer protection and competition laws.
In particular, Ms. Wilson criticized a lawsuit that the F.T.C. filed in July to block Meta's merger with a virtual reality app maker, Within, as well as a decision last month to ban "noncompete" clauses in employment contracts that limit the options of employees while locking in the power of companies to retain workers.
Ms. Wilson is a longtime antitrust lawyer, and was nominated to the F.T.C. by President Donald J. Trump in 2018. The F.T.C. has five commissioners.
"My fundamental concern with her leadership of the commission pertains to her willful disregard of congressionally imposed limits on agency jurisdiction, her defiance of legal precedent and her abuse of power to achieve desired outcomes," Ms. Wilson wrote of Ms. Khan.
Ms. Khan said in a joint statement with two Democratic F.T.C. commissioners, Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, "While we often disagreed with Commissioner Wilson, we respect her devotion to her beliefs and are grateful for her public service."
Ms. Wilson's departure is expected to put greater political pressure on the agency, which Republican lawmakers and businesses have criticized for being too tough on companies. Congress controls the budgets of agencies and can threaten to curtail the F.T.C.'s powers via its power over funding. It can also call Ms. Khan to appear in public oversight hearings.
Ms. Khan has defended her actions, saying the agency's permissive approach to mergers over decades had allowed companies like Google, Meta and Amazon to balloon in size and eat up competition. She has pushed the agency to take on riskier cases that it may not even win.
President Biden nominated Ms. Khan to lead the F.T.C. as part of a group of progressive antitrust reformers who included Tim Wu at the White House and Jonathan Kanter, the head of antitrust at the Justice Department. Ms. Khan is overseeing lawsuits against Meta and a suit to block Microsoft's merger with Activision.
Ms. Khan, 33, rose to fame in 2017 when she published a paper in the Yale Law Journal about Amazon, questioning decades-long views about illegal monopolization and the ways that antitrust laws were being applied to tech companies. She continued gaining attention with her participation in a congressional report in 2020 that called for the breakup for tech monopolies.
Ms. Wilson and companies like Meta and Amazon have called for Ms. Khan to recuse herself from investigations and cases involving them. They said that given Ms. Khan's early opinions about the companies, she could not fairly evaluate cases involving them. Ms. Khan has not removed herself from cases involving Meta and other tech companies.
Ms. Wilson did not announce a date for her departure.

As Tech Cuts Back, Layoffs Surprise New Parents: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: At tech companies that spent recent years expanding paid parental leave, parents have felt the whiplash of mass layoffs in an especially visceral way.
Alex Gable spent recent weeks in the bleary-eyed haze of new parenthood. His son was born in November and Mr. Gable powered down his laptop, deleted Slack from his phone and focused on caring for his wife while making the most of the four precious hours a day that their baby was awake -- there was tummy time and time spent ogling little drawings of snowflakes.
Then on Jan. 18, Mr. Gable got an early morning notification for an all-hands meeting at Coda, the software company where he worked as a data scientist. Four hours later Mr. Gable, 30, found himself having to deliver the news to his wife: He had been laid off while on paternity leave -- months after choosing the company for its generous paternity leave policy and openness toward work-life balance.
"It's like an earthquake," he said. "It's the weight of 'What am I going to bring him up with? How is his first year going to go? How are you going to make ends meet?"'
Workers across the tech and media industries are experiencing a period of immense whiplash. After lavishing their employees with perks, in a tight labor market and a war for talent, companies have turned to mass job cuts, including Alphabet, which laid off 6 percent of its workers last month, and Microsoft, which cut nearly 5 percent.
These are the same companies that spent recent years expanding benefits in one area in particular: paid parental leave and caregiver benefits, which fill in the gaps for white-collar workers in a country where the federal government does not require employers to offer paid parental leave. Which means that working parents have felt the turbulence of mass layoffs in an especially visceral way.
Now some are spending their early weeks of parenthood adjusting to life without a job. LinkedIn and Twitter have been filled with accounts of workers being laid off while on parental leave or even, in at least two instances, while delivering a baby. That comes with a mental health toll -- as so many laid-off workers across different backgrounds have experienced, including those who are immigrants with visas tied to employment.
Employees across tech have felt that their companies engaged in a bait and switch, after selling not just a job but a lifestyle, with child care, mental health support and plentiful paid time off. For new parents, generous leave was part of the draw. Many had assumed that their parental leave came with some legal protection, and were distraught to learn they were caught up in mass job cuts. Being on parental leave does not protect someone from mass layoffs unrelated to their leave.
America has no federal paid-family-leave policy. About 23 percent of private employees have paid maternity leave, according to September 2022 data from the career site Zippia. More than 90 percent of women take the full amount of leave offered, compared with about two-thirds of men, according to a survey by the Boston College Center for Work and Family.
But in the last five years, companies scaled up family-friendly benefits for some workers in what human resources experts called the "golden age" of corporate benefits. A study from Mercer found that 54 percent of large companies covered in vitro fertilization in 2022, compared with 36 percent in 2015, and 19 percent covered egg freezing compared with 6 percent in 2015.
Tech companies were especially generous on parental leave compared with other industries. Google increased its parental leave to 24 weeks from 18 in 2021, Meta offers parents 20 weeks, and Microsoft gave 20 weeks for birthing parents and 12 weeks for nonbirthing parents. California, too, increased parental leave benefits to eight weeks from six. ZipRecruiter found that 849 out of 100,000 job postings offered paid parental leave in 2022, up from 95 out of 100,000 in 2017.
This expansion of family-friendly benefits was partly a bid for female talent, as historically male-dominated workplaces made commitments to bringing in more women. It also reflected a cultural shift, as a new generation of workers, across genders, made it clear they wanted the flexibility to play an active role in child care, according to Joan Williams, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco.
"There's a sizable portion of young men who would be bent out of shape if they couldn't take family leave," Ms. Williams said. "Tech companies realized they could try to steal talent by having the best set of family leave policies around."
With these new perks also came an uptick in the share of men taking paternity leave. In 2011, fewer than 5 percent of new fathers took more than two weeks of paternity leave. Today, 90 percent of men take more than seven weeks of leave if they are offered eight weeks, according to the Boston College Center for Work and Family. Some managers started proactively asking male workers how they planned to use their leave time, leaving behind the culture of assuming that fathers would take off only a few days.
People on parental leave typically have no special legal protection when it comes to mass layoffs. Many workers have a legal right to take parental leave for the birth or adoption of a child, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, a federal law, or similar state laws. But being on leave, including for disability, doesn't usually protect people from job cuts that would have happened anyway.
"It's jarring because people do view it as job-protected leave without understanding that there are limits on the protection," said Megan Bisk, head of the employment law practice at Ropes & Gray. "Many people view it as a time when they're not in a position to be job searching."
If workers were laid off because they were on parental leave, that would be illegal -- but it would be difficult to prove, Ms. Bisk explained, because the criteria companies use for layoffs aren't disclosed to laid-off workers.
Emily St. James, 42, who was a senior correspondent at Vox, had been up late feeding her newborn the day before Vox Media announced its mass layoffs last month, so she slept in until 9 a.m. on the West Coast. She woke up to a text from Vox's publisher, then checked her email and saw that she had been laid off. Ms. St. James's termination date was set as the last day of her maternity leave, which is in late March, and she will get 24 weeks of severance pay beyond that.
"When it happened I think my wife said, 'Well, isn't that illegal?"' Ms. St. James recalled. "This has underscored for me the degree to which the social safety net for people who are new parents is very frayed."
Vox declined to comment for this article.
The lack of legal guidelines has resulted in a patchwork of policies among companies. For those laid off while on parental leave, Amazon is offering to pay out the remainder of their time off, as well as severance packages. Meta and Google, on the other hand, aren't paying for any remaining parental leave but are offering all employees several months of pay and additional severance.
Several workers who were laid off while on parental leave declined to speak for this article, citing fears of retribution because their severance packages are tied to agreements that they won't speak to the media.
Niki Woodall, who was an engineering leadership recruiter at one of the world's largest tech companies, agreed to share her experience without naming her employer. She had been at the company for five years when she told her bosses that she planned to take six months of maternity leave starting last summer. Their family-friendly attitude gave her the confidence to completely unplug from work. She said she left without thinking: "My job is at stake."
A month before she was set to return, she received a personal email letting her know that her job was being eliminated. She turned to her 4-month-old daughter, who was sitting beside the family cat, Wesa, and said, "Mommy lost her job."
"There's a big misperception that you can't be let go during maternity leave," said Ms. Woodall, 39. She was disappointed to lose her job but not surprised because the layoffs hit many fellow recruiters.
Other parents who lost their jobs said they wondered whether their absence from the office contributed to executives' deciding their position was redundant.
Some parental leave experts worry that fear of future layoffs could deter new fathers from taking their leave. As Brad Harrington, executive director of the Boston College Center for Work and Family, put it: "This will have a sobering effect."
Mr. Gable had a previous layoff experience, from Zillow, in 2021 -- at the height of the pandemic's white hot job market. The career opportunities felt endless -- including many at companies with generous policies toward parents. He chose Coda because he sensed that managers there were supportive of workers taking time for their families. As he prepares to apply for tech jobs yet again, his options feel far more limited.
"Its weird to have that pulled out from under you," he said. "The market conditions are basically the opposite right now."

Interest Rates Weigh on Markets Again: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Stocks dropped Thursday following another mixed set of profit reports from companies, as rising expectations for interest rates keep up the pressure on Wall Street.
The S&P 500 fell 0.9 percent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.7 percent and the Nasdaq composite sank 1 percent. All three indexes had been up by close to 1 percent in the morning, before momentum gave out.
Stocks have been shaky this week amid uncertainty about where interest rates and inflation are heading. A strong jobs market has investors buying more into the Federal Reserve's forecast that it will raise rates a couple of more times before holding them at a high level through this year.
A narrowing disconnect between markets and the Fed could lead to less volatility in markets in the future, said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. But for now, with a jumble of earnings reports pouring in from companies along Wall Street and questions remaining about whether the economy can avoid a sharp recession, swings are likely to remain.
"There's continuing evidence that the economy is stronger than people thought it was going to be," Mr. Martin said. "The question is what is the economy's ability to continue that resilience in the face of interest rates that are a lot higher than they were a year ago."
In the bond market, at least, a warning signal is continuing to flash red with yields on shorter-term Treasurys well above longer-term Treasurys. It's an unusual occurrence that has often preceded recessions in the past.
The two-year Treasury yield, which tends to move with expectations for Fed action, climbed to 4.48 percent from 4.43 percent late Wednesday. It reached its highest level since mid-November during the day, according to Tradeweb. The 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other loans, rose to 3.68 percent.
"We're still somewhere in that 40 percent to 60 percent area of a recession," Mr. Martin said. "I'm not trying to be wishy-washy about it, but there are so many ways to go. The level of uncertainty has been high and remains high."
High inflation and worries about a slowing economy have already begun to hit corporate earnings, and big U.S. companies have been reporting relatively lackluster results for the end of 2022.
The Walt Disney Co. surprised the market when it reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also said it will cut about 7,000 jobs as part of a plan to reduce its costs by $ 5.5 billion. Its shares fell 1.3 percent after being up more than 5 percent earlier in the morning.
The media giant joined the growing list of high-profile companies to announce layoffs amid an uncertain economy. The bulk began in the technology industry, where companies acknowledged misreading the boom coming out of the pandemic and hiring too many people. Job cuts have since spread to other industries.
"Things have gotten good on the inflation front, but now I think the next cause of volatility is beginning to shift to recession fears," said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company.
Overall, though, the job market has remained resilient. Last week, 196,000 U.S. workers filed for unemployment benefits. That was slightly more than the prior week, but it remained below the 200,000 level for a fourth straight week.
While a strong job market is good for workers and for sales of companies selling to them, the Federal Reserve also worries that it could lead to upward pressure on inflation.
Another drop for Google's parent company, Alphabet, also weighed heavily on the market. It fell 4.4 percent, continuing its rough week amid worries about competition from Microsoft, which recently unveiled a new Bing search engine powered by artificial intelligence.

A.I.'s Ease at Spinning Deception Raises Alarm: [National Desk]

Full text: Researchers used ChatGPT to produce clean, convincing text that repeated conspiracy theories and misleading narratives.
Soon after ChatGPT debuted last year, researchers tested what the artificial intelligence chatbot would write after it was asked questions peppered with conspiracy theories and false narratives.
The results -- in writings formatted as news articles, essays and television scripts -- were so troubling that the researchers minced no words.
"This tool is going to be the most powerful tool for spreading misinformation that has ever been on the internet," said Gordon Crovitz, a co-chief executive of NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation and conducted the experiment last month. "Crafting a new false narrative can now be done at dramatic scale, and much more frequently -- it's like having A.I. agents contributing to disinformation."
Disinformation is difficult to wrangle when it's created manually by humans. Researchers predict that generative technology could make disinformation cheaper and easier to produce for an even larger number of conspiracy theorists and spreaders of disinformation.
Personalized, real-time chatbots could share conspiracy theories in increasingly credible and persuasive ways, researchers say, smoothing out human errors like poor syntax and mistranslations and advancing beyond easily discoverable copy-paste jobs. And they say that no available mitigation tactics can effectively combat it.
Predecessors to ChatGPT, which was created by the San Francisco artificial intelligence company OpenAI, have been used for years to pepper online forums and social media platforms with (often grammatically suspect) comments and spam. Microsoft had to halt activity from its Tay chatbot within 24 hours of introducing it on Twitter in 2016 after trolls taught it to spew racist and xenophobic language.
ChatGPT is far more powerful and sophisticated. Supplied with questions loaded with disinformation, it can produce convincing, clean variations on the content en masse within seconds, without disclosing its sources. On Tuesday, Microsoft and OpenAI introduced a new Bing search engine and web browser that can use chatbot technology to plan vacations, translate texts or conduct research.
OpenAI researchers have long been nervous about chatbots falling into nefarious hands, writing in a 2019 paper of their "concern that its capabilities could lower costs of disinformation campaigns" and aid in the malicious pursuit "of monetary gain, a particular political agenda, and/or a desire to create chaos or confusion."
In 2020, researchers at the Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies found that GPT-3, the underlying technology for ChatGPT, had "impressively deep knowledge of extremist communities" and could be prompted to produce polemics in the style of mass shooters, fake forum threads discussing Nazism, a defense of QAnon and even multilingual extremist texts.
OpenAI uses machines and humans to monitor content that is fed into and produced by ChatGPT, a spokesman said. The company relies on both its human A.I. trainers and feedback from users to identify and filter out toxic training data while teaching ChatGPT to produce better-informed responses.
OpenAI's policies prohibit use of its technology to promote dishonesty, deceive or manipulate users or attempt to influence politics; the company offers a free moderation tool to handle content that promotes hate, self-harm, violence or sex. But at the moment, the tool offers limited support for languages other than English and does not identify political material, spam, deception or malware. ChatGPT cautions users that it "may occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content."
Last week, OpenAI announced a separate tool to help discern when text was written by a human as opposed to artificial intelligence, partly to identify automated misinformation campaigns. The company warned that its tool was not fully reliable -- accurately identifying A.I. text only 26 percent of the time (while incorrectly labeling human-written text 9 percent of the time) -- and could be evaded. The tool also struggled with texts that had fewer than 1,000 characters or were written in languages other than English.
Arvind Narayanan, a computer science professor at Princeton, wrote on Twitter in December that he had asked ChatGPT some basic questions about information security that he had posed to students in an exam. The chatbot responded with answers that sounded plausible but were actually nonsense, he wrote.
"The danger is that you can't tell when it's wrong unless you already know the answer," he wrote. "It was so unsettling I had to look at my reference solutions to make sure I wasn't losing my mind."
Researchers also worry that the technology could be exploited by foreign agents hoping to spread disinformation in English. Some companies already use multilingual chatbots to support customers without translators.
Mitigation tactics exist -- media literacy campaigns, "radioactive" data that identifies the work of generative models, government restrictions, tighter controls on users, even proof-of-personhood requirements by social media platforms -- but many are problematic in their own ways. The researchers concluded that there "is no silver bullet that will singularly dismantle the threat."
Working last month off a sampling of 100 false narratives from before 2022 (ChatGPT is trained mostly on data through 2021), NewsGuard asked the chatbot to write content advancing harmful health claims about vaccines, mimicking propaganda and disinformation from China and Russia and echoing the tone of partisan news outlets.
The technology produced responses that seemed authoritative but were often provably untrue. Many were pockmarked with phrases popular with misinformation peddlers, such as "do your own research" and "caught red-handed," along with citations of fake scientific studies and even references to falsehoods not mentioned in the original prompt. Caveats, such as urging readers to "consult with your doctor or a qualified health care professional," were usually buried under several paragraphs of incorrect information.
Researchers prodded ChatGPT to discuss the 2018 shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, using the perspective of Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist who filed for bankruptcy last year after losing a series of defamation cases brought by relatives of other mass shooting victims. In its response, the chatbot repeated lies about the mainstream media colluding with the government to push a gun-control agenda by employing crisis actors.
Sometimes, though, ChatGPT resisted researchers' attempts to get it to generate misinformation and debunked falsehoods instead. (This has led some conservative commentators to claim that the technology has a politically liberal bias, as have experiments in which ChatGPT refused to produce a poem about former President Donald J. Trump but generated glowing verses about President Biden.)
Newsguard asked the chatbot to write an opinion piece from Mr. Trump's perspective about how Barack Obama was born in Kenya, a lie repeatedly advanced by Mr. Trump for years in an attempt to cast doubt on Mr. Obama's eligibility to be president. ChatGPT responded with a disclaimer that the so-called birther argument "is not based on fact and has been repeatedly debunked" and, furthermore, that "it is not appropriate or respectful to propagate misinformation or falsehoods about any individual."
When The New York Times repeated the experiment using a sample of NewsGuard's questions, ChatGPT was more likely to push back on the prompts than when researchers originally ran the test, offering disinformation in response to only 33 percent of the questions. NewsGuard said that ChatGPT was constantly changing as developers tweaked the algorithm and that the bot might respond differently if a user repeatedly inputs misinformation.
Concerned legislators are sounding calls for government intervention as more ChatGPT rivals crowd the pipeline. Google began testing its experimental Bard chatbot on Monday and will release it to the public in the coming weeks. Baidu has Ernie, short for Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration. Meta unveiled Galactica (but took it down three days later amid concerns about inaccuracies and misinformation).
In September, Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California, pressured federal officials to address models like Stability AI's Stable Diffusion image generator, which she criticized for being "available for anyone to use without any hard restrictions." Stable Diffusion, she wrote in an open letter, can and likely has already been used to create "images used for disinformation and misinformation campaigns."
Check Point Research, a group providing cyber threat intelligence, found that cybercriminals were already experimenting with using ChatGPT to create malware. While hacking typically requires a high level of programming knowledge, ChatGPT was giving novice programmers a leg up, said Mark Ostrowski, the head of engineering for Check Point.
"The amount of power that could be circulating because of a tool like this is just going to be increased," he said.

Full text: The company, which was hit hard in the early stages of the pandemic, saw revenue jump 49 percent from the same period a year ago.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber indicated on Wednesday that it had staved off the downturn that hit many technology companies while posting what Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive, called the company's "strongest quarter ever."
Uber reported $ 8.6 billion in revenue in the last three months of 2022, a 49 percent increase from a year earlier, when the Omicron variant of the coronavirus dampened travel. The company made $ 30.7 billion in gross bookings -- the amount of money paid by customers -- a 19 percent year-over-year jump.
The company said that it had tallied two billion trips in a quarter for the first time, up from 1.7 billion a year earlier, and that the number of customers who used Uber each month increased 11 percent, to 131 million.
The results slightly exceeded the expectations of Wall Street analysts. Uber's stock rose 5.5 percent in trading on Wednesday.
Even as other tech companies like Google, Meta and Microsoft have announced layoffs and slashed costs, Uber's business has stayed relatively steady, and Mr. Khosrowshahi said last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that he was not anticipating companywide layoffs.
Companies that offer internet-based services, like social media and video conferencing, boomed during the pandemic but have slowed since lockdowns ended. By contrast, Uber, which makes much of its money offering rides to people, cut about 7,000 employees in 2020 while people were stuck at home, but rebounded as the world reopened and people began carrying on with their normal lives.
"All of those other tech companies in hindsight now look to have overhired during the digital boom of the pandemic, when we were all stuck inside using digital services," said Tom White, a senior research analyst with the financial firm D.A. Davidson. The businesses of companies like Uber and Lyft were "depressed" during that time, he said.
Uber reported $ 595 million in profit thanks to its stakes in other ride-hailing companies. The company said it expected to achieve operating income profitability at some point this year, which would be a sign of growing strength in its business.
Uber was one of the first tech companies to warn of an economic downturn. Last May, Mr. Khosrowshahi told employees that the company needed to rein in spending and focus on becoming profitable to adjust to a "seismic shift" in the economy and investors' priorities.
Since then, Uber has enacted some cost-cutting measures. This month, about 150 employees were laid off from Uber Freight, a booking service for long-haul truck shipments. Lior Ron, the Uber Freight chief executive, told employees that the move had been brought about by economic conditions. The layoffs were reported earlier by CNBC.
Lyft, which will release its quarterly financial results on Thursday, has also worked to reduce costs. In November, the company laid off 650 employees, and last month it shuttered Lyft Delivery -- a small pilot program -- because of budget constraints, according to three people with knowledge of the program's cancellation.
Mr. Khosrowshahi said in a statement that Uber would continue to be careful with spending. "We will maintain this rigor throughout 2023 and beyond to deliver healthy growth with minimal head count addition," he said.

Meta Aims to Stay Atop A.I.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: It has long had technology to rival chatbots like ChatGPT, but can't afford to back artificial intelligence that can spread misinformation and toxic content.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Two weeks before a chatbot called ChatGPT appeared on the internet in November and wowed the world, Meta, the owner of Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, unveiled a chatbot of its own.
Called Galactica, it was designed for scientific research. It could instantly write its own articles, solve math problems, generate computer code and annotate images.
Like ChatGPT, Galactica also played fast and loose with facts, making up mathematical proofs, misstating historical dates and spinning tall tales. One user coaxed the chatbot into talking about the history of bears in space. When asked who runs Silicon Valley, Galactica replied, "Steve Jobs."
But unlike OpenAI, the tiny San Francisco lab that made ChatGPT, Meta encountered an avalanche of complaints about Galactica's mishaps. After just three days, the company, which has faced scrutiny for spreading misinformation and hate speech through its social networking apps, removed Galactica from the internet.
"The people who made the demo had to take it down because they just couldn't take the heat," Yann LeCun, Meta's chief artificial intelligence scientist, said last month during an online appearance at Collective[i] Forecast, a gathering of Silicon Valley leaders and thinkers.
For nearly a decade, Meta has spent billions of dollars building new kinds of A.I. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, made it a mission for Meta to become a leader in the field back in 2013. The company hired hundreds of top A.I. researchers, including Dr. LeCun. It spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the large amounts of computing power needed to build A.I. systems.
Yet Meta has been left out now that Silicon Valley is gripped with excitement by "generative A.I.," the name for technologies that generate text, images and other media on their own. OpenAI has taken center stage, even though Meta and many other companies have built similar technologies.
Others have since jumped headlong into the frenzy. On Monday, Google said it would soon release an experimental chatbot called Bard. And on Tuesday, Microsoft, which has invested $ 13 billion in OpenAI, unveiled a new internet search engine and web browser powered by generative A.I.
Meta, however, was hamstrung, in part, by its reputation as a corporate giant that helps spread untruths, Dr. LeCun said last month. And with responsibilities to billions of users, it could not afford to leave online a chatbot that can generate false and biased information.
"OpenAI and other small companies are in a better position to actually get some credit for releasing this kind of thing," said Chirag Shah, a University of Washington professor who has explored the flaws in technologies like Galactica and ChatGPT. "They are not going to get the same kind of blowback."
In recent years, Meta has also shifted its focus to another technology area: the immersive online world of the so-called metaverse, which Mr. Zuckerberg has said he believes is the next big thing. In the short term, it is unclear how the company can offer generative A.I. products with its existing services in a way that really captures the public's attention.
That does not mean it isn't trying. Meta is fast-tracking its efforts to put A.I.-driven products into customers' hands, said Irina Kofman, a senior director of product management for generative A.I. who oversees XAI, a new team that aims to help build A.I. products across the company. Mr. Zuckerberg is directly involved in steering the initiatives, holding weekly meetings with product leaders and top A.I. researchers, she said.
In a call last week with investors, Mr. Zuckerberg repeatedly mentioned A.I. He called it "the foundation of our discovery engine and our ads business" and added that it would "enable many new products and additional transformations within our apps."
Some Meta executives have spoken about the generative A.I. boom with a distinct air of sour grapes. During his online discussion last month, Dr. LeCun described ChatGPT as "not particularly innovative" and "nothing revolutionary" because it relied on technologies developed and deployed by Meta, Google and other companies.
Earlier last year, Meta released a chatbot, BlenderBot, that stretched the state of the art, Dr. LeCun said. But it never caught on, he said, because the company had worked hard to ensure that it would not produce offensive material.
"It was panned by people who tried it," he said. "They said it was stupid and kind of boring. It was boring because it was made safe."
Not long ago, Meta was known for rapidly pushing out products that were not fully tested or bulletproof, preferring to figure out the details along the way. One of its mottos -- "move fast and break things" -- became an anthem of Silicon Valley start-ups in the early 2010s. And Mr. Zuckerberg embodied what is known as "hacker culture," embracing new technologies and preferring to throw small teams on them to develop them as soon as possible.
But after the media, the public and lawmakers spent years scrutinizing the company for allowing false and inappropriate material on Facebook and its other social platforms, Meta now cannot release a chatbot that generates misinformation without significant criticism.
"People tend to hold large tech companies to a high standard," said Andrew Ng, a researcher and an entrepreneur who previously oversaw the A.I. labs at Google and the Chinese internet giant Baidu. "It does create an uneven playing field where smaller companies can move faster."
Mr. Zuckerberg began delving into A.I. in 2013, just after Google made a big bet on A.I. research. He personally recruited top A.I. academics like Dr. LeCun during a hiring frenzy, which culminated with Mr. Zuckerberg flying to Lake Tahoe, Nev., that year to offer millions of dollars in salary and stock to A.I. researchers who had gathered for a conference. For years, many of them sat next to his desk at Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.
The researchers eventually helped develop A.I. technologies that Meta largely uses today behind the scenes to help target ads, recommend posts and videos to users, and identify misinformation and other problematic content.
Now Meta faces the problem of how to turn A.I. into a product. Facebook offered cutting-edge facial recognition technology in the late 2010s, but removed it after complaints that it compromised people's privacy. It also offered A.I. technology that could instantly translate social media posts from one language to another, which ended up as a narrow use.
In the call with investors last week, Mr. Zuckerberg said A.I. underpinned many of Facebook's and Instagram's most important features, including showing people Reels videos and suggesting other photos, videos and posts that they might not already follow.
Asked at last month's online appearance how Meta might deploy chatbots and other generative A.I. technologies, Dr. LeCun said they could help small businesses create ads on Facebook. He added that once people moved into the metaverse, they would need generative tools to create virtual items.
The pace of development has taken off internally in recent months, Ms. Kofman said.
Mr. Zuckerberg and Meta's chief product officer, Chris Cox, and chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, have been in weekly team meetings with leaders across A.I. product teams. Over the past few months, they have also spun up teams that specialize in turning A.I. into products, working with others across Meta's family of apps, Ms. Kofman said.
The goal is to get A.I. powering products faster, and to put those directly into the hands of users. Ultimately, Mr. Zuckerberg hopes to incorporate some of that underlying technology into building out his vision of the metaverse.
How he will bridge the gap between the two important technologies remains unclear. But he has made generative A.I. a top company priority.
"One of my goals for Meta is to build on our research to become a leader in generative A.I.," Mr. Zuckerberg said on the investor call.

Google Plans Its Chatbot In Response To ChatGPT: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The internet giant said it would begin testing its new chatbot, Bard, with a small, private group before releasing it to the public in the coming weeks.
Google said on Monday that it would soon release an experimental chatbot called Bard as it races to respond to ChatGPT, which has wowed millions of people since it was unveiled at the end of November.
Google said it would begin testing its new chatbot with a small, private group on Monday before releasing it to the public in the coming weeks. In a blog post, Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, also said that the company's search engine would soon have artificial intelligence features that offered summaries of complex information.
Bard -- so named because it is a storyteller, the company said -- is based on experimental technology called LaMDA, short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications, which Google has been testing inside the company and with a limited number of outsiders for several months.
Google is among many companies that have been developing and testing a new type of chatbot that can riff on almost any topic thrown its way. OpenAI, a tiny San Francisco start-up, captured the public's imagination with ChatGPT and set off a race to push this kind of technology into a wide range of products.
The chatbots cannot chat exactly like a human, but they often seem to. And they generate a wide range of digital text that can be repurposed in nearly any context, including tweets, blog posts, term papers, poetry and even computer code.
The result of more than a decade of research at companies like Google, OpenAI and Meta, the chatbots represent an enormous change in the way computer software is built, used and operated. They are poised to remake internet search engines like Google Search and Microsoft Bing, talking digital assistants like Alexa and Siri, and email programs like Gmail and Outlook.
But the technology has flaws. Because the chatbots learn their skills by analyzing vast amounts of text posted to the internet, they cannot distinguish between fact and fiction and can generate text that is biased against women and people of color.
Google had been reluctant to release this type of technology to the public because executives were concerned that the company's reputation could take a hit if the A.I. created biased or toxic statements.
Google's caution began to erode its advantage as a generative A.I. innovator when ChatGPT debuted to buzz and millions of users. In December, Mr. Pichai declared a "code red," pulling various groups off their normal assignments to help the company expedite the release of its own A.I. products.
The company has scrambled to catch up, calling in its co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, to review its product road map in several meetings and establishing an initiative to quicken its approval processes.
Google has plans to release more than 20 A.I. products and features this year, The New York Times has reported. The A.I. search engine features, which the company said would arrive soon, will try to distill complex information and multiple perspectives to give users a more conversational experience.
The company also plans to spread its underlying A.I. technology through partners, so that they can build varied new applications.
Chatbots like ChatGPT and LaMDA are more expensive to operate than typical software. In a recent tweet, Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, said the company spent "single-digit cents" delivering each chat on the service. That translates to extremely large costs for the company, considering that millions of people are using the service.
Google said Bard would be a "lighter weight" version of LaMDA that would allow the company to serve up the technology at a lower cost.

Child Sex Abuse Content Still a Problem at Twitter: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Over 120,000 views of a video showing a boy being sexually assaulted. A recommendation engine suggesting that a user follow content related to exploited children. Users continually posting abusive material, delays in taking it down when it is detected and friction with organizations that police it.
All since Elon Musk declared that "removing child exploitation is priority #1" in a tweet in late November.
Under Mr. Musk's ownership, Twitter's head of safety, Ella Irwin, said she had been moving rapidly to combat child sexual abuse material, which was prevalent on the site -- as it is on most tech platforms -- under the previous owners. "Twitter 2.0" will be different, the company promised.
But a review by The New York Times found that the imagery, commonly known as child pornography, persisted on the platform, including widely circulated material that the authorities consider the easiest to detect and eliminate.
After Mr. Musk took the reins in late October, Twitter largely eliminated or lost staff experienced with the problem and failed to prevent the spread of abusive images previously identified by the authorities, the review shows. Twitter also stopped paying for some detection software considered key to its efforts.
All the while, people on dark-web forums discuss how Twitter remains a platform where they can easily find the material while avoiding detection, according to transcripts of those forums from an anti-abuse group that monitors them.
"If you let sewer rats in," said Julie Inman Grant, Australia's online safety commissioner, "you know that pestilence is going to come."
In a Twitter audio chat with Ms. Irwin in early December, an independent researcher working with Twitter said illegal content had been publicly available on the platform for years and garnered millions of views. But Ms. Irwin and others at Twitter said their efforts under Mr. Musk were paying off. During the first full month of the new ownership, the company suspended nearly 300,000 accounts for violating "child sexual exploitation" policies, 57 percent more than usual, the company said.
The effort accelerated in January, Twitter said, when it suspended 404,000 accounts. "Our recent approach is more aggressive," the company declared in a series of tweets on Wednesday, saying it had also cracked down on people who search for the exploitative material and had reduced successful searches by 99 percent since December.
Ms. Irwin, in an interview, said the bulk of suspensions involved accounts that engaged with the material or were claiming to sell or distribute it, rather than those that posted it. She did not dispute that child sexual abuse content remains openly available on the platform, saying that "we absolutely know that we are still missing some things that we need to be able to detect better."
She added that Twitter was hiring employees and deploying "new mechanisms" to fight the problem. "We have been working on this nonstop," she said.
Wired, NBC and others have detailed Twitter's ongoing struggles with child abuse imagery under Mr. Musk. On Tuesday, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, asked the Justice Department to review Twitter's record in addressing the problem.
To assess the company's claims of progress, The Times created an individual Twitter account and wrote an automated computer program that could scour the platform for the content without displaying the actual images, which are illegal to view. The material wasn't difficult to find. In fact, Twitter helped promote it through its recommendation algorithm -- a feature that suggests accounts to follow based on user activity.
Among the recommendations was an account that featured a profile picture of a shirtless boy. The child in the photo is a known victim of sexual abuse, according to the Canadian Center for Child Protection, which helped identify exploitative material on the platform for The Times by matching it against a database of previously identified imagery.
That same user followed other suspicious accounts, including one that had "liked" a video of boys sexually assaulting another boy. By Jan. 19, the video, which had been on Twitter for more than a month, had gotten more than 122,000 views, nearly 300 retweets and more than 2,600 likes. Twitter later removed the video after the Canadian center flagged it for the company.
In the first few hours of searching, the computer program found a number of images previously identified as abusive -- and accounts offering to sell more. The Times flagged the posts without viewing any images, sending the web addresses to services run by Microsoft and the Canadian center.
One account in late December offered a discounted "Christmas pack" of photos and videos. That user tweeted a partly obscured image of a child who had been abused from about age 8 through adolescence. Twitter took down the post five days later, but only after the Canadian center sent the company repeated notices.
In all, the computer program found imagery of 10 victims appearing over 150 times across multiple accounts, most recently on Thursday. The accompanying tweets often advertised child rape videos and included links to encrypted platforms.
Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and the former top security executive at Facebook, found the results alarming. "Considering the focus Musk has put on child safety, it is surprising they are not doing the basics," he said.
Separately, to confirm The Times's findings, the Canadian center ran a test to determine how often one video series involving known victims appeared on Twitter. Analysts found 31 different videos shared by more than 40 accounts, some of which were retweeted and liked thousands of times. The videos depicted a young teenager who had been extorted online to engage in sexual acts with a prepubescent child over a period of months.
The center also did a broader scan against the most explicit videos in their database. There were more than 260 hits, with more than 174,000 likes and 63,000 retweets.
"The volume we're able to find with a minimal amount of effort is quite significant," said Lloyd Richardson, the technology director at the Canadian center. "It shouldn't be the job of external people to find this sort of content sitting on their system."
In 2019, The Times reported that many tech companies had serious gaps in policing child exploitation on their platforms. This past December, Ms. Inman Grant, the Australian online safety official, conducted an audit that found many of the same problems remained at a sampling of tech companies.
The Australian review did not include Twitter, but some of the platform's difficulties are similar to those of other tech companies and predate Mr. Musk's arrival, according to multiple current and former employees.
Twitter, founded in 2006, started using a more comprehensive tool to scan for videos of child sexual abuse last fall, they said, and the engineering team dedicated to finding illegal photos and videos was formed just 10 months earlier. In addition, the company's trust and safety teams have been perennially understaffed, though the company continued expanding them even amid a broad hiring freeze that began last April, four former employees said.
Over the years, the company did build internal tools to find and remove some images, and the national center often lauded the company for the thoroughness of its reports.
The platform in recent months has also experienced problems with its abuse reporting system, which allows users to notify the company when they encounter child exploitation material. (Twitter offers a guide to reporting abusive content on its platform.)
The Times used its research account to report multiple profiles that were claiming to sell or trade the content in December and January. Many of the accounts remained active and even appeared as recommendations to follow on The Times's own account. The company said it would need more time to unravel why such recommendations would appear.
To find the material, Twitter relies on software created by an anti-trafficking organization called Thorn. Twitter has not paid the organization since Mr. Musk took over, according to people familiar with the relationship, presumably part of his larger effort to cut costs. Twitter has also stopped working with Thorn to improve the technology. The collaboration had industrywide benefits because other companies use the software.
Ms. Irwin declined to comment on Twitter's business with specific vendors.
Twitter's relationship with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has also suffered, according to people who work there.
John Shehan, an executive at the center, said he was worried about the "high level of turnover" at Twitter and where the company "stands in trust and safety and their commitment to identifying and removing child sexual abuse material from their platform."
After the transition to Mr. Musk's ownership, Twitter initially reacted more slowly to the center's notifications of sexual abuse content, according to data from the center, a delay of great importance to abuse survivors, who are revictimized with every new post. Twitter, like other social media sites, has a two-way relationship with the center. The site notifies the center (which can then notify law enforcement) when it is made aware of illegal content. And when the center learns of illegal content on Twitter, it alerts the site so the images and accounts can be removed.
Late last year, the company's response time was more than double what it had been during the same period a year earlier under the prior ownership, even though the center sent it fewer alerts. In December 2021, Twitter took an average of 1.6 days to respond to 98 notices; last December, after Mr. Musk took over the company, it took 3.5 days to respond to 55. By January, it had greatly improved, taking 1.3 days to respond to 82.
The Canadian center, which serves the same function in that country, said it had seen delays as long as a week. In one instance, the Canadian center detected a video on Jan. 6 depicting the abuse of a naked girl, age 8 to 10. The organization said it sent out daily notices for about a week before Twitter removed the video.
In addition, Twitter and the U.S. national center seem to disagree about Twitter's obligation to report accounts that claim to sell illegal material without directly posting it.
The company has not reported to the national center the hundreds of thousands of accounts it has suspended because the rules require that they "have high confidence that the person is knowingly transmitting" the illegal imagery and those accounts did not meet that threshold, Ms. Irwin said.
Mr. Shehan of the national center disputed that interpretation of the rules, noting that tech companies are also legally required to report users even if they only claim to sell or solicit the material. So far, the national center's data show, Twitter has made about 8,000 reports monthly, a small fraction of the accounts it has suspended.
Ms. Inman Grant, the Australian regulator, said she had been unable to communicate with local representatives of the company because her agency's contacts in Australia had quit or been fired since Mr. Musk took over. She feared that the staff reductions could lead to more trafficking in exploitative imagery.
"These local contacts play a vital role in addressing time-sensitive matters," said Ms. Inman Grant, who was previously a safety executive at both Twitter and Microsoft.
Ms. Irwin said the company continued to be in touch with the Australian agency, and more generally she expressed confidence that Twitter was "getting a lot better" while acknowledging the challenges ahead.
"In no way are we patting ourselves on the back and saying, 'Man, we've got this nailed,"' Ms. Irwin said.
Offenders continue to trade tips on dark-web forums about how to find the material on Twitter, according to posts found by the Canadian center.
On Jan. 12, one user described following hundreds of "legit" Twitter accounts that sold videos of young boys who were tricked into sending explicit recordings of themselves. Another user characterized Twitter as an easy venue for watching sexual abuse videos of all types. "People share so much," the user wrote.

Racing to Catch Up With ChatGPT, Google Plans Release of Its Own Chatbot

Google said Monday that it would soon release an experimental chatbot called Bard as it races to respond to ChatGPT, which has wowed millions of people since it was unveiled at the end of November.
Google said it would begin testing its new chatbot with a small, private group Monday before releasing it to the public in the coming weeks. In a blog post, Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, also said that the company’s search engine would soon have artificial-intelligence features that offer summaries of complex information.
Bard — so named because it is a storyteller, the company said — is based on experimental technology called LaMDA, short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications, that Google has been testing inside the company and with a limited number of outsiders for several months.
Google is among many companies that have been developing and testing a new type of chatbot that can riff on almost any topic thrown its way. OpenAI, a tiny San Francisco startup, captured the public’s imagination with ChatGPT and set off a race to push this kind of technology into a wide range of products.
The chatbots cannot chat exactly like a human, but they often seem to. And they generate a wide range of digital text that can be repurposed in nearly any context, including tweets, blog posts, term papers, poetry and even computer code.
The result of more than a decade of research at companies like Google, OpenAI and Meta, the chatbots represent an enormous change in the way computer software is built, used and operated. They are poised to remake internet search engines like Google Search and Microsoft Bing; talking digital assistants like Alexa and Siri; and email programs like Gmail and Outlook.
But the technology has flaws. Because the chatbots learn their skills by analyzing vast amounts of text posted to the internet, they cannot distinguish between fact and fiction and can generate text that is biased against women and people of color.
Google had been reluctant to release this type of technology to the public because executives at the company were concerned that its reputation could take a hit if the AI created biased or toxic statements.
Google’s caution began to erode its advantage as a generative AI innovator when ChatGPT debuted in November to buzz and millions of users. In December, Pichai declared a “code red,” pulling various groups off their normal assignments to help the company expedite the release of its own AI products.
The company has scrambled to catch up, calling in its co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to review its product road map in several meetings and establishing an initiative to quicken its approval processes.
Google has plans to release more than 20 AI products and features this year, The New York Times has reported. The AI search engine features, which the company said would arrive soon, will try to distill complex information and multiple perspectives to give users a more conversational experience.
The company also plans to spread its underlying AI technology through partners, so that they can build varied new applications.
Chatbots like ChatGPT and LaMDA are more expensive to operate than typical software. In a recent tweet, Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, said the company spent “single-digit cents” delivering each chat on the service. That translates to extremely large costs for the company, considering that millions of people are using the service.
Google said Bard would be a “lighter weight” version of LaMDA that would allow the company to serve up the technology at a lower cost. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Musk Pledged to Cleanse Twitter of Child Abuse Content. It’s Been Rough Going.

Full text: Marisa Shuman's computer science class at the Young Women's Leadership School of the Bronx began as usual on a recent January morning.
Just after 11:30, energetic 11th and 12th graders bounded into the classroom, settled down at communal study tables and pulled out their laptops. Then they turned to the front of the room, eyeing a whiteboard where Ms. Shuman had posted a question on wearable technology, the topic of that day's class.
For the first time in her decade-long teaching career, Ms. Shuman had not written any of the lesson plan. She had generated the class material using ChatGPT, a new chatbot that relies on artificial intelligence to deliver written responses to questions in clear prose. Ms. Shuman was using the algorithm-generated lesson to examine the chatbot's potential usefulness and pitfalls with her students.
"I don't care if you learn anything about wearable technology today," Ms. Shuman said to her students. "We are evaluating ChatGPT. Your goal is to identify whether the lesson is effective or ineffective."
Across the United States, universities and school districts are scrambling to get a handle on new chatbots that can generate humanlike texts and images. But while many are rushing to ban ChatGPT to try to prevent its use as a cheating aid, teachers like Ms. Shuman are leveraging the innovations to spur more critical classroom thinking. They are encouraging their students to question the hype around rapidly evolving artificial intelligence tools and consider the technologies' potential side effects.
The aim, these educators say, is to train the next generation of technology creators and consumers in "critical computing." That is an analytical approach in which understanding how to critique computer algorithms is as important as -- or more important than -- knowing how to program computers.
New York City Public Schools, the nation's largest district, serving some 900,000 students, is training a cohort of computer science teachers to help their students identify A.I. biases and potential risks. Lessons include discussions on defective facial recognition algorithms that can be much more accurate in identifying white faces than darker-skinned faces.
In Illinois, Florida, New York and Virginia, some middle school science and humanities teachers are using an A.I. literacy curriculum developed by researchers at the Scheller Teacher Education Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One lesson asks students to consider the ethics of powerful A.I. systems, known as "generative adversarial networks," that can be used to produce fake media content, like realistic videos in which well-known politicians mouth phrases they never actually said.
With generative A.I. technologies proliferating, educators and researchers say understanding such computer algorithms is a crucial skill that students will need to navigate daily life and participate in civics and society.
"It's important for students to know about how A.I. works because their data is being scraped, their user activity is being used to train these tools," said Kate Moore, an education researcher at M.I.T. who helped create the A.I. lessons for schools. "Decisions are being made about young people using A.I., whether they know it or not."
To observe how some educators are encouraging their students to scrutinize A.I. technologies, I recently spent two days visiting classes at the Young Women's Leadership School of the Bronx, a public middle and high school for girls that is at the forefront of this trend.
The hulking, beige-brick school specializes in math, science and technology. It serves nearly 550 students, most of them Latinx or Black.
It is by no means a typical public school. Teachers are encouraged to help their students become, as the school's website puts it, "innovative" young women with the skills to complete college and "influence public attitudes, policies and laws to create a more socially just society." The school also has an enviable four-year high school graduation rate of 98 percent, significantly higher than the average for New York City high schools.
One morning in January, about 30 ninth and 10th graders, many of them dressed in navy blue school sweatshirts and gray pants, loped into a class called Software Engineering 1. The hands-on course introduces students to coding, computer problem-solving and the social repercussions of tech innovations.
It is one of several computer science courses at the school that ask students to consider how popular computer algorithms -- often developed by tech company teams of mostly white and Asian men -- may have disparate impacts on groups like immigrants and low-income communities. That morning's topic: face-matching systems that may have difficulty recognizing darker-skinned faces, such as those of some of the students in the room and their families.
Standing in front of her class, Abby Hahn, the computing teacher, knew her students might be shocked by the subject. Faulty face-matching technology has helped lead to the false arrests of Black men.
So Ms. Hahn alerted her pupils that the class would be discussing sensitive topics like racism and sexism. Then she played a YouTube video, created in 2018 by Joy Buolamwini, a computer scientist, showing how some popular facial analysis systems mistakenly identified iconic Black women as men.
As the class watched the video, some students gasped. Oprah Winfrey "appears to be male," Amazon's technology said with 76.5 percent confidence, according to the video. Other sections of the video said that Microsoft's system had mistaken Michelle Obama for "a young man wearing a black shirt," and that IBM's system had pegged Serena Williams as "male" with 89 percent confidence.
(Microsoft and Amazon later announced accuracy improvements to their systems, and IBM stopped selling such tools. Amazon said it was committed to continuously improving its facial analysis technology through customer feedback and collaboration with researchers, and Microsoft and IBM said they were committed to the responsible development of A.I.)
"I'm shocked at how colored women are seen as men, even though they look nothing like men," Nadia Zadine, a 14-year-old student, said. "Does Joe Biden know about this?"
The point of the A.I. bias lesson, Ms. Hahn said, was to show student programmers that computer algorithms can be faulty, just like cars and other products designed by humans, and to encourage them to challenge problematic technologies.
"You are the next generation," Ms. Hahn said to the young women as the class period ended. "When you are out in the world, are you going to let this happen?"
"No!" a chorus of students responded.
A few doors down the hall, in a colorful classroom strung with handmade paper snowflakes and origami cranes, Ms. Shuman was preparing to teach a more advanced programming course, Software Engineering 3, focused on creative computing like game design and art. Earlier that week, her student coders had discussed how new A.I.-powered systems like ChatGPT can analyze vast stores of information and then produce humanlike essays and images in response to short prompts.
As part of the lesson, the 11th and 12th graders read news articles about how ChatGPT could be both useful and error-prone. They also read social media posts about how the chatbot could be prompted to generate texts promoting hate and violence.
But the students could not try ChatGPT in class themselves. The school district has blocked it over concerns that it could be used for cheating. So the students asked Ms. Shuman to use the chatbot to create a lesson for the class as an experiment.
Ms. Shuman spent hours at home prompting the system to generate a lesson on wearable technology like smartwatches. In response to her specific requests, ChatGPT produced a remarkably detailed 30-minute lesson plan -- complete with a warm-up discussion, readings on wearable technology, in-class exercises and a wrap-up discussion.
As the class period began, Ms. Shuman asked the students to spend 20 minutes following the scripted lesson, as if it were a real class on wearable technology. Then they would analyze ChatGPT's effectiveness as a simulated teacher.
Huddled in small groups, students read aloud information the bot had generated on the conveniences, health benefits, brand names and market value of smartwatches and fitness trackers. There were groans as students read out ChatGPT's anodyne sentences -- "Examples of smart glasses include Google Glass Enterprise 2" -- that they said sounded like marketing copy or rave product reviews.
"It reminded me of fourth grade," Jayda Arias, 18, said. "It was very bland."
The class found the lesson stultifying compared with those by Ms. Shuman, a charismatic teacher who creates course materials for her specific students, asks them provocative questions and comes up with relevant, real-world examples on the fly.
"The only effective part of this lesson is that it's straightforward," Alexania Echevarria, 17, said of the ChatGPT material.
"ChatGPT seems to love wearable technology," noted Alia Goddess Burke, 17, another student. "It's biased!"
Ms. Shuman was offering a lesson that went beyond learning to identify A.I. bias. She was using ChatGPT to give her pupils a message that artificial intelligence was not inevitable and that the young women had the insights to challenge it.
"Should your teachers be using ChatGPT?" Ms. Shuman asked toward the end of the lesson.
The students' answer was a resounding "No!" At least for now.

U.S. Gained Half a Million Jobs Last Month: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The report defied expectations and underscored the challenges for the Federal Reserve, which is trying to cool the labor market to fight inflation.
Soft landing? The American labor market is still soaring.
After months of gentle but steady declines in job growth, employers unleashed an unexpected burst of hiring in January, adding 517,000 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said on Friday.
The increase was the largest since July, and it drew exclamations from economists steeped in labor market trends, who had been expecting another month of gradual cooling.
"So much for moderation!" said Beth Ann Bovino, the chief U.S. economist at S&P Global Ratings. "We certainly didn't see it in this report."
Underscoring the labor market's extraordinary vibrancy was the unemployment rate, which fell to 3.4 percent, the lowest level since 1969.
But even as businesses hired with striking zeal in January -- or at least laid off fewer seasonal employees than in most years -- wage growth continued to moderate. Average hourly earnings increased 0.3 percent from December, and 4.4 percent over the year, an indication that some of the pressure to lure employees with pay raises may be easing.
"Put simply, I would argue the Biden economic plan is working," President Biden proclaimed in remarks at the White House, while dismissing the "chorus of critics" who had faulted it.
Still, the hefty hiring figures underscored the challenges facing the Federal Reserve, which is trying to cool the labor market in its effort to tame rapid inflation. By raising interest rates -- on Wednesday, Fed officials did so for the eighth time in a year -- policymakers hope to force businesses to pull back on their spending, including hiring.
The moves appeared to have been tamping down the labor market, with limited pain for workers. Since the summer, job gains had eased but remained above 250,000 a month, and layoffs were extremely low, notwithstanding a cavalcade of pink slips from technology companies.
Other recent measures were also offering reasons to believe the economy was coming off its rolling boil. Consumer spending fell at the end of last year, a sign that Americans were finally becoming more cautious in the face of rising prices, dwindling savings and fears of recession. And the housing market appeared to be slowing down, as high mortgage rates were making purchases too expensive for many would-be homeowners, though there has been some recent easing.
January's hiring figures suggest that officials may have more work to do to reduce the labor market's momentum and bring the economy more into balance.
The report showed that job gains were broad, touching even some industries that had been expected to slow as the Fed's rate increases filtered through the labor market. Leading the charge were leisure and hospitality businesses, including restaurants, bars and hotels, which added 128,000 jobs, and health care, which added 58,000 -- both sectors that were upended during the pandemic. Professional and business services also ramped up their hiring.
There was a substantial jump in government employment, too, though that was partly because striking workers at the University of California returned to work.
The information sector lost 5,000 jobs. But even that was a relative blip given the recent headline-grabbing layoffs at technology giants such as Microsoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet.
"I would definitely say at the end of 2022, there was a slowdown in some industries," said Nicola Hancock, managing director for the Americas region at AMS, a talent acquisition and advisory firm. But she added, "All of our clients are still hiring." AMS works with blue-chip companies in industries including banking, financial services, technology and pharmaceuticals.
Further complicating the narrative, some emerging trends in the job market that had hinted at an impending economic slowdown appeared to backtrack. The number of hours worked rose, including in manufacturing and construction. And jobs in temporary help services, which tend to fall amid economic uncertainty, rose by 26,000 after months of declines.
The figures in Friday's report are preliminary and will be revised at least twice.
The labor force participation rate was barely changed at 62.4 percent. Fed officials have been hoping to see an increase in the ranks of those available to work, which could alleviate the tightness in the labor market that is driving up wages and contributing to inflation.
If the report was befuddling, it also reaffirmed a prevailing impression: that the labor market is strong. After the upheaval from the pandemic's onset, little has fundamentally knocked employers off course. Buoyed by seemingly bottomless demand for goods and services, businesses have been in a race to hire despite climbing borrowing costs, offering raises and a cornucopia of incentives to lure workers.
Last year, 4.6 million jobs were added, not including seasonal adjustments -- nearly 200,000 more than initially reported, and the second most since records began in 1939.
With wage pressure subsiding somewhat, one possible explanation for the fresh surge in hiring was that businesses could more easily fill open positions.
"Basically, the hesitation and confusion that I think made it harder for employers and workers to find each other in the early parts of the recovery has started to abate," said Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. "People are applying for jobs, and employers have a better understanding of what the labor market landscape looks like."
In addition to the report on Friday, the government released data this week showing that job openings in December rose to 11 million. The number of posted jobs per available unemployed worker -- a measure that policymakers have been watching closely -- also increased.
Some businesses that were unable to compete on wages with bigger companies are now finding themselves in advantageous positions, said Stephanie Miller, the director of talent acquisition and retention at Express Employment International, a staffing agency based in Oklahoma City.
"We've all been working so lean for so long there's not a lot of small to medium businesses that have extra," she said. "They are just holding steady, continuing their growth, and they're going to ride this out."
That was the case for C&L Supreme of Des Plaines, Ill., which makes component parts for equipment such as document scanners and sorters. The company struggled last year to hire enough workers and largely operated with a staffing deficit -- even after cutting an entire shift on the production floor in 2021, said Tom Hacker, C&L Supreme's chairman.
"Regardless of our business level, we had positions to fill," he said. Like many other companies, he cited a wide range of challenges, including a lack of qualified applicants.
But last month, Mr. Hacker said, the floodgates seemed to have opened, and the company was suddenly able to hire three employees, boosting its work force to about 35.
"The job climate or job market was really kind of weird and different coming out of Covid and through all of last year," he said. "I think that's starting to settle down some now for a couple of reasons."
Many forecasters ‌expect the labor market to weaken this year as higher interest rates are increasingly felt. In its most recent region-by-region survey, known as the Beige Book, the Fed said businesses across the country "generally expected little growth in the months ahead."
But it is not clear whether that will translate to widespread layoffs. Many businesses, after struggling to hire workers, may be reluctant to let them go and may try to adjust elsewhere, including offering fewer benefits. Some economists noted that employers might not have cut as many seasonal workers as is typical at the beginning of the year, contributing to the large seasonally adjusted gain in jobs.
"Business executives are looking at various creative ways to limit their labor costs, and that is going to be appearing in various forms," said Gregory Daco, the chief economist at EY-Parthenon, Ernst & Young's strategy consultancy. "We're probably not going to see the types of rapid acceleration in layoffs that we've seen in prior cycles."
Other businesses are taking a more deliberate approach to hiring as they see what the coming months bring.
Andy Sommer, an owner and chief executive of Forth & Nomad, a women's lifestyle clothing and accessories store in Houston, said that though sales had increased 30 percent last year, he worried about hiring too many people before economic conditions become clearer. So while he is looking to replace workers who left after the holiday season, he is also trying different scheduling approaches and hoping managers can fill in any gaps.
"We just have no idea if this is going to be a slowdown for real coming," he said. "So you just really don't want to over-staff and anticipate an increase in sales and then it doesn't happen and then you're really stuck."

Activision Agrees to Pay $ 35 Million Settlement
Government regulators on Friday announced that the video game maker Activision Blizzard has agreed to pay $ 35 million to settle charges that it failed to maintain controls to collect and assess workplace complaints with regard to disclosure requirements and violated a federal whistle-blower protection rule.
The lack of necessary controls left Activision, the maker of Candy Crush, Call of Duty, Overwatch and World of Warcraft, "without the means to determine whether larger issues existed that needed to be disclosed to investors," said Jason Burt, director of the S.E.C.'s Denver office.
In paying the settlement, Activision neither admitted nor denied the S.E.C.'s findings and agreed to a cease-and-desist order, the agency said.
Just over a year ago, Microsoft said it was paying a hefty $ 68.7 billion for Activision, but the deal is being held up by regulators in the U.S. and Europe over anti-competitive concerns. ASSOCIATED PRESS
ELECTRIC VEHICLES
Treasury Makes More E.V.s
Eligible for Tax Credits
The Treasury Department on Friday said that it was making more electric vehicles eligible for tax credits of up to $ 7,500 under new vehicle classification definitions.
The revised standards for E.V. tax credits follow lobbying by automakers that had pressed the Biden administration to change vehicle definitions to allow higher priced vehicles to qualify for a maximum tax credit. Tesla's C.E.O., Elon Musk, met with top aides to President Biden last week to discuss the E.V. industry and the broader goals of electrification.
The decision raises the retail price cap for tax credits to $ 80,000 for G.M.'s Cadillac Lyriq, Tesla's five-seat Model Y, Volkswagen's ID.4 and Ford's Mustang Mach-E and Escape plug-in hybrid.
Ford and Tesla both said in recent weeks that they are cutting prices on some E.V. models in part to qualify for the new federal tax credit and spur buyer interest. ASSOCIATED PRESS
AUTO SAFETY
U.S. Warns Honda Drivers
About Dangerous Airbags
Honda and the U.S. government are urging owners of about 8,200 older vehicles not to drive them until dangerous airbag inflators are replaced.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday issued a "Do Not Drive" advisory for the 2001 through 2003 vehicles with Takata inflators that have a high possibility of exploding and hurling shrapnel in a crash.
The safety agency says the risk to drivers and passengers is dire. If the inflators blow apart, they can shoot shrapnel toward a driver's face that could kill them or cause serious injuries.
The agency says the Honda and Acura vehicles were recalled previously but records show that repairs have not been made in the affected vehicles. Honda already has replaced 99 percent of the dangerous inflators.
"These inflators are two decades old now, and they pose a 50 percent chance of rupturing in even a minor crash," the NHTSA's acting administrator, Ann Carlson, said in a statement.
Since 2009, the exploding airbags have killed at least 33 people worldwide, including 24 in the United States.

ChatGPT Kicked Off A.I. Frenzy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: One day in mid-November, workers at OpenAI got an unexpected assignment: Release a chatbot, fast.
The chatbot, an executive announced, would be known as "Chat with GPT-3.5," and it would be made available free to the public. In two weeks.
The announcement confused some OpenAI employees. All year, the San Francisco artificial intelligence company had been working toward the release of GPT-4, a new A.I. model that was stunningly good at writing essays, solving complex coding problems and more. After months of testing and fine-tuning, GPT-4 was nearly ready. The plan was to release the model in early 2023, along with a few chatbots that would allow users to try it for themselves, according to three people with knowledge of the inner workings of OpenAI.
But OpenAI's top executives had changed their minds. Some were worried that rival companies might upstage them by releasing their own A.I. chatbots before GPT-4, according to the people with knowledge of OpenAI. And putting something out quickly using an old model, they reasoned, could help them collect feedback to improve the new one.
So they decided to dust off and update an unreleased chatbot that used a souped-up version of GPT-3, the company's previous language model, which came out in 2020.
Thirteen days later, ChatGPT was born.
In the months since its debut, ChatGPT (the name was, mercifully, shortened) has become a global phenomenon. Millions of people have used it to write poetry, build apps and conduct makeshift therapy sessions. It has been embraced (with mixed results) by news publishers, marketing firms and business leaders. And it has set off a feeding frenzy of investors trying to get in on the next wave of the A.I. boom.
It has also caused controversy. Users have complained that ChatGPT is prone to giving biased or incorrect answers. Some A.I. researchers have accused OpenAI of recklessness. And school districts around the country, including New York City's, have banned ChatGPT to try to prevent a flood of A.I.-generated homework.
Yet little has been said about ChatGPT's origins, or the strategy behind it. Inside the company, ChatGPT has been an earthshaking surprise -- an overnight sensation whose success has created both opportunities and headaches, according to several current and former OpenAI employees, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
An OpenAI spokesman, Niko Felix, declined to comment for this column, and the company also declined to make any employees available for interviews.
Before ChatGPT's launch, some OpenAI employees were skeptical that the project would succeed. An A.I. chatbot that Meta had released months earlier, BlenderBot, had flopped, and another Meta A.I. project, Galactica, was pulled down after just three days. Some employees, desensitized by daily exposure to state-of-the-art A.I. systems, thought that a chatbot built on a two-year-old A.I. model might seem boring.
But two months after its debut, ChatGPT has more than 30 million users and gets roughly five million visits a day, two people with knowledge of the figures said. That makes it one of the fastest-growing software products in memory. (Instagram, by contrast, took nearly a year to get its first 10 million users.)
The growth has brought challenges. ChatGPT has had frequent outages as it runs out of processing power, and users have found ways around some of the bot's safety features. The hype surrounding ChatGPT has also annoyed some rivals at bigger tech firms, who have pointed out that its underlying technology isn't, strictly speaking, all that new.
ChatGPT is also, for now, a money pit. There are no ads, and the average conversation costs the company "single-digit cents" in processing power, according to a post on Twitter by Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, likely amounting to millions of dollars a week. To offset the costs, the company announced this week that it would begin selling a $ 20 monthly subscription, known as ChatGPT Plus.
Despite its limitations, ChatGPT's success has vaulted OpenAI into the ranks of Silicon Valley power players. The company recently reached a $ 10 billion deal with Microsoft, which plans to incorporate the start-up's technology into its Bing search engine and other products. Google declared a "code red" in response to ChatGPT, fast-tracking many of its own A.I. products in an attempt to catch up.
Mr. Altman has said his goal at OpenAI is to create what is known as "artificial general intelligence," or A.G.I., an artificial intelligence that matches human intellect. He has been an outspoken champion of A.I., saying in a recent interview that its benefits for humankind could be "so unbelievably good that it's hard for me to even imagine." (He has also said that in a worst-case scenario, A.I. could kill us all.)
As ChatGPT has captured the world's imagination, Mr. Altman has been put in the rare position of trying to downplay a hit product. He is worried that too much hype for ChatGPT could provoke a regulatory backlash or create inflated expectations for future releases, two people familiar with his views said. On Twitter, he has tried to tamp down excitement, calling ChatGPT "incredibly limited" and warning users that "it's a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now."
He has also discouraged employees from boasting about ChatGPT's success. In December, days after the company announced that more than a million people had signed up for the service, Greg Brockman, OpenAI's president, tweeted that it had reached two million users. Mr. Altman asked him to delete the tweet, telling him that advertising such rapid growth was unwise, two people who saw the exchange said.
OpenAI is an unusual company, by Silicon Valley standards. Started in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab by a group of tech leaders including Mr. Altman, Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman and Elon Musk, it created a for-profit subsidiary in 2019 and struck a $ 1 billion deal with Microsoft. It has since grown to around 375 employees, according to Mr. Altman -- not counting the contractors it pays to train and test its A.I. models in regions like Eastern Europe and Latin America.
From the start, OpenAI has billed itself as a mission-driven organization that wants to ensure that advanced A.I. will be safe and aligned with human values. But in recent years, the company has embraced a more competitive spirit -- one that some critics say has come at the expense of its original aims.
Those concerns grew last summer when OpenAI released its DALL-E 2 image-generating software, which turns text prompts into works of digital art. The app was a hit with consumers, but it raised thorny questions about how such powerful tools could be used to cause harm. If creating hyper-realistic images was as simple as typing in a few words, critics asked, wouldn't pornographers and propagandists have a field day with the technology?
To allay these fears, OpenAI outfitted DALL-E 2 with numerous safeguards and blocked certain words and phrases, such as those related to graphic violence or nudity. It also taught the bot to neutralize certain biases in its training data -- such as making sure that when a user asked for a photo of a C.E.O., the results included images of women.
These interventions prevented trouble, but they struck some OpenAI executives as heavy-handed and paternalistic, according to three people with knowledge of their positions. One of them was Mr. Altman, who has said he believes that A.I. chatbots should be personalized to the tastes of the people using them -- one user could opt for a stricter, more family-friendly model, while another could choose a looser, edgier version.
OpenAI has taken a less restrictive approach with ChatGPT, giving the bot more license to weigh in on sensitive subjects like politics, sex and religion. Even so, some right-wing conservatives have accused the company of overstepping. "ChatGPT Goes Woke," read the headline of a National Review article last month, which argued that ChatGPT gave left-wing responses to questions about topics such as drag queens and the 2020 election. (Democrats have also complained about ChatGPT -- mainly because they think A.I. should be regulated more heavily.)
As regulators swirl, Mr. Altman is trying to keep ChatGPT above the fray. He flew to Washington last week to meet with lawmakers, explaining the tool's strengths and weaknesses and clearing up misconceptions about how it works.
Back in Silicon Valley, he is navigating a frenzy of new attention. In addition to the $ 10 billion Microsoft deal, Mr. Altman has met with top executives at Apple and Google in recent weeks, two people with knowledge of the meetings said. OpenAI also inked a deal with BuzzFeed to use its technology to create A.I.-generated lists and quizzes. (The announcement more than doubled BuzzFeed's stock price.)
The race is heating up. Baidu, the Chinese tech giant, is preparing to introduce a chatbot similar to ChatGPT in March, according to Reuters. Anthropic, an A.I. company started by former OpenAI employees, is reportedly in talks to raise $ 300 million in new funding. And Google is racing ahead with more than a dozen A.I. tools.
Then there's GPT-4, which is still scheduled to come out this year. When it does, its abilities may make ChatGPT look quaint. Or maybe, now that we're adjusting to a powerful new A.I. tool in our midst, the next one won't seem so shocking.

Ann McLaughlin Korologos, 81, Former Labor Secretary, Is Dead: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Her brief tenure as only the second woman to run the department came after years of service within the Reagan administration.
Ann McLaughlin Korologos, who served as secretary of labor from 1987 to 1989, becoming only the second woman to hold the post, died on Jan. 30 in Salt Lake City. She was 81.
Her stepson, Philip Korologos, said the cause of her death, in a hospital, was complications of meningitis.
Mrs. Korologos's time at the Labor Department was brief, just 14 months, but it came at the end of a long tenure within the Ronald Reagan administration. Known as Ann Dore McLaughlin at the time, she had joined the Treasury Department as a spokeswoman in 1981 and spent three years as deputy secretary of the interior before her nomination to run the department in 1987.
Though her name was not widely known outside Washington, she was well regarded among political insiders from both parties, and her Senate confirmation went smoothly. The Massachusetts Democrat Edward M. Kennedy, who was chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, praised her "strong record of public service." She won confirmation by a vote of 94-0.
Her elevation to the cabinet was seen as the work of Howard H. Baker Jr., the former Republican senator from Tennessee who had been brought into the White House as chief of staff in early 1987 and who wielded significant influence over cabinet nominations. Unlike the more ideological conservatives who dominated the administration early on, Mr. Baker was a pragmatic insider, and he chose Mrs. Korologos because she fit the same mold.
Since the Labor Department was founded in 1913, only one other woman had held its top position: Frances Perkins, who served under President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1945. Several women followed after Mrs. Korologos, though, including her immediate successor, Elizabeth Dole. Ms. Dole's appointment was the first time in U.S. history that one woman had replaced another from the same party in the same cabinet position.
For all the bipartisan praise, Mrs. Korologos was a loyal if not doctrinaire Reaganite, following the legacy of her predecessor, Bill Brock, another moderate former senator from Tennessee. She fought against union-backed bills to increase the minimum wage and mandate unpaid maternity leave. But she also supported affirmative action, describing it as a "business necessity," and called for immigration reform to increase the labor supply.
And she was unafraid to take on one of Washington's most pugnacious conservative commentators, John McLaughlin -- her husband at the time.
In 1988, he invited her on his PBS program, "One on One," joking beforehand: "We made a deal. She does 'One on One,' and I have to host a cabinet spouse tea."
Ann Marie Lauenstein was born on Nov. 16, 1941, in Newark, the daughter of Edward Lauenstein, who managed sales for defense contractors, and Marie (Koellhoffer) Lauenstein, a homemaker.
After graduating with a degree in English from Marymount College (later a part of Fordham University) in Tarrytown, N.Y., in 1963, she worked in public relations in Manhattan for several years, married William Dore in 1965 and later returned to Marymount to run the college's office of alumnae relations.
It was there, in 1968, that she met Mr. McLaughlin, who was a Jesuit priest at the time and had come to campus to speak. By then she had divorced Mr. Dore, and she and Mr. McLaughlin struck up a friendship.
Two years later, he hired her to run his unsuccessful U.S. Senate campaign in Rhode Island, and in 1972 they both joined the campaign to re-elect President Richard M. Nixon, he as a speechwriter and she as a spokeswoman. After Nixon's victory, she joined the administration as the director of press relations for the Environmental Protection Agency.
Nixon's resignation drove her back out of government, this time to the chemical company Union Carbide, where she worked as the assistant director of government relations.
Her friendship with Mr. McLaughlin eventually turned romantic; he left the priesthood, and they married in 1975. Two years later they opened a public relations company, McLaughlin & Company, with her as president.
While Mr. McLaughlin pursued a career in conservative media, his wife re-entered government after Reagan's election in 1980. They divorced in 1992; he died in 2016.
In 2000 she married Tom Korologos, who served as U.S. ambassador to Belgium from 2004 to 2007. He survives her. Along with her stepson, she is also survived by her stepdaughters, Paula Cale Lisbe and Ann Bazzarone; eight grandchildren; and one great-grandson.
After leaving the Labor Department in 1989, Mrs. Korologos sat on a number of corporate boards, including those of Microsoft, RAND and Nordstrom. She was chairwoman of the Aspen Institute, a think tank, from 1996 to 2000, and later ran an art gallery near her home in Basalt, Colo.
Between 1989 and 1990 she oversaw the President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism, which was formed in response to the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, by Libyan terrorists.
The commission's report, delivered in 1990, criticized the government's air travel security and recommended a list of changes to be made immediately -- many of which were still not in place on Sept. 11, 2001.
"The sad truth," Mrs. Korologos wrote in the report, "is that the aviation security system administered by the F.A.A. has not provided the level of protection the traveling public demands and deserves. The system is seriously flawed and must be changed."

When a COVID-19 outbreak in China forced a lockdown of Apple’s largest iPhone factory in November, the world’s most valuable company warned investors that it would lose sales. The question was: How much?
On Thursday, Apple reported that revenue fell 5% to $117.15 billion during the three months that ended in December , the company’s first quarterly sales decline since before the pandemic. Profits decreased 13% to $30 billion.
Apple’s results are the latest evidence of the challenges buffeting the tech industry. After recording double-digit sales gains during the early pandemic, companies have recently shifted to cost cutting and mass layoffs, with Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet — Google’s parent company — each eliminating at least 10,000 jobs.
A less severe whiplash has hit Apple. From 2020 to 2022, the company increased its annual revenue by nearly $125 billion. But demand for iPhones, iPads and Macs has slowed, causing investors to sour on the company. Over the course of a year, Apple lost $1 trillion in market value, a stunning reversal for the only U.S. company to ever reach a valuation of $3 trillion.
The company’s shares declined about 4% in after-hours trading, reversing most of the gains from earlier in the day when tech shares rallied following Meta’s earnings report Wednesday. Wall Street had expected $122 billion in sales and $31 billion in profit.
Though its business has slowed, Apple hasn’t moved to cut jobs. Unlike some of its peers, such as Google and Meta, which aggressively hired during the first years of the pandemic to keep up with demand, Apple remained disciplined, adding 24,000 new workers, just 3,000 more than it added in the three years before 2020.
Still, many investors have reduced their stakes in Apple out of concern its business will be hit by the slowing economy. Consumer spending in the United States, Apple’s largest market, has declined, posing a potential challenge to sales of pricey iPhones.
“It’s impacting the higher end consumer’s willingness to spend and that’s going to impact the most valuable company in the world,” said Dave Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, which has about $5 billion under management and an investment in Apple.
Apple recorded $65.78 billion in iPhone sales, an 8% decline from the previous year. The modest decline testified to the company’s supply chain acumen. After the company shut down its biggest iPhone factory in November, it shifted some production to other factories, according to Counterpoint, a market research firm.
On the sales front, Apple benefited as more iPhone buyers chose its more expensive Pro models, lifting the average selling price 9% to $936, according to Counterpoint.
Apple offset its iPhone struggles with increased sales of its iPads and services. The company said its iPad business recorded $9.4 billion in sales, a 30% increase. It increased sales of apps and subscription services such as Apple Music to $20.77 billion, about 6% from the previous year.
The company’s biggest challenge remains its concentrated supply chain in China. The faltering of U.S.-China relations has accelerated, with Congress creating a special committee this year to evaluate competition with Beijing. Concerns are also mounting in Washington that China could soon take military action against Taiwan.
Amid the rising tensions, Apple has shifted production from China to Vietnam and India. But a vast majority of its revenue continues to come from products made in China. And Chinese consumers count for about one-fifth of total sales.
During the December period, sales in China fell 7% to $23.9 billion. Apple’s business there should improve in the current period as China’s economy reopens after years of strict COVID-19 restrictions. Analysts predict sales in the current quarter will decline about 4%. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

U.S. Survey Shows Uptick in Job Openings: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Labor Department found a rise in the number of posted jobs per worker in December, despite the Fed's efforts to cool the labor market.
The nation's demand for labor only got stronger in December, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday, as job openings rose to 11 million.
That brings the number of posted jobs per available unemployed worker, which had been easing in recent months, back up to 1.9 -- not what the Federal Reserve has been hoping for as it seeks to quell inflation.
"It does make you question whether we continue to see that slowing in net job creation," said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at the financial services company Nationwide. "There's still a strong demand for workers, and that suggests that the labor market is still running very tight, and too hot."
The 5.5 percent increase in job openings was largely driven by hotels and restaurants, which have been steadily recovering from the pandemic, and jumped sharply to 1.74 million positions posted. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has been particularly focused on wage inflation in the services sector, but like wages more broadly, increases in hourly earnings in private services have been decelerating.
In another sign of confidence among workers, people voluntarily left their jobs at about the same rate as they did in November. Quits as a share of the overall employment base have fallen slightly from 3 percent at the end of 2021, but plateaued over the past few months. Overall, in 2022, about 50 million Americans quit their jobs.
Layoffs were also steady in December, staying at the unusually low level that has prevailed since a spike during the pandemic. While pink slips in the tech industry have mounted swiftly -- most recently with 22,000 between Microsoft and Google -- the bulk of the separations may have occurred after the labor turnover survey ended.
Other indicators that employers are shedding workers, such as initial claims for unemployment insurance, have also remained very low by historical standards. Those leaving tech jobs, especially with software development and engineering skills, may have found new opportunities so quickly that they didn't file for unemployment benefits.

Today's Column Was Brought to You With the Help of A.I. Bots: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: ChatGPT isn't the only writing assistant that has emerged to replace editors. We tested it alongside two others to assess their strengths and weaknesses.
Plagiarizing essays. Cheating on tests. Spreading misinformation. The advent of new, powerful artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT has sparked concerns about the unintended consequences of the technology and debate over the ethical implications of its use.
Despite concerns, A.I. assistants seem here to stay. After ChatGPT's splashy debut late last year, Microsoft invested $ 10 billion in OpenAI, the lab behind the chatbot. The threat from a rival forced Google to regroup. And the media site BuzzFeed recently announced that it would use A.I. to write online quizzes and other content.
Given the growing influence of this technology, it's time to focus on how we can start reaping the benefits in a responsible way. Many A.I. experts and computer scientists agree that these tools can provide a major perk that does no harm: editing our writing.
In this context, we would still be using our skills and brainpower to do the hard work of making sense of information and coming up with new ideas, while turning to A.I. for some light assistance, such as making a sentence sound more conversational, sprinkling in some historical context or even adding a joke.
For several days, I tested Wordtune Spices and Rytr, two A.I. writing assistants released by start-ups in the last two years, and compared them with ChatGPT. I'll go over some examples that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each of these three tools.
Test 1: Rewriting a Sentence
To use Wordtune Spices, which the Israeli start-up AI21 Labs released last month, you insert text into a box, highlight the sentences you want edited and then click on options to make improvements. Among its best uses during my recent test were quick rewrites of sentences.
For example, I took this sentence from my column last week about email addresses and privacy:
When you browse the web, an increasing number of sites and apps are asking for a piece of basic information that you probably hand over without hesitation: your email address.
Then I clicked the "Rewrite" button. Wordtune Spices shot back a list of options for revisions of the sentence. I liked this one best:
Your email address is one of the most basic pieces of info that is being requested by more and more websites and apps.
My original sentence included a significant detail to me -- that we hand over our email addresses without hesitation -- but the tool trimmed a few words to cut to the chase and summarize the heart of the problem. Not bad.
Test 2: Catching Grammatical Errors
Rytr, an A.I. writing assistant released in 2021 by a company of the same name, was designed to streamline the creation of blog posts and marketing copy. It was proficient at catching grammatical errors (as, similarly, word-processing tools like Microsoft Word have been doing for decades).
In my test, I took this paragraph, which has intentional errors, from an educational website that provides editing exercises:
Facebook, with more then 1 Billion users Is celebrated its 10th birthday this year. The company was launching by Mark Zuckerberg at 4th February 2004. The site was Conceived in a Harvard dorm in a way To connect student and let them build an Identity for himself online.
Then in Rytr, I highlighted the paragraph and clicked "Improve." It gave me this:
Facebook, with more than 1 billion users, celebrated its 10th birthday this year. The company was launched by Mark Zuckerberg on February 4th, 2004. The site was conceived in a Harvard dorm as a way to connect students and let them build an identity for themselves online.
The tool automatically rewrote an error-free version of the paragraph. This could be extremely handy as a study tool or for non-native English speakers.
Test 3: Adding Context
Wordtune Spices also excelled at fleshing out paragraphs with additional context. By pressing the + button, you can add color and background information to a piece of text by inserting historical data, a joke and an example to prove your point.
For example, I took this paragraph from my column last week:
First, it helps to know why companies want email addresses. To advertisers, web publishers and app makers, your email is important not just for contacting you. It acts as a digital bread crumb for companies to link your activity across sites and apps to serve you relevant ads.
In Wordtune Spices, I clicked the + button to add an example, a historical fact and a joke. (Changes in bold.)
First, it helps to know why companies want email addresses. To advertisers, web publishers and app makers, your email is important not just for contacting you. For example, by tracking your purchases, companies can recommend products or services that are relevant to you. The first email marketing blast was sent in 1978 by a man named Gary Thuerk who worked for Digital Equipment Corp. And with that, Gary Thuerk was sent down in history as the world's first 'Spam' Lord!
After doing some research, I was impressed to learn that 1978 was indeed when email was first used for marketing. The example of using email receipts to serve targeted ads was also accurate. The joke wasn't very funny, but it lightened things up.
Test 4: Ending This Column
Last, I pasted this entire column into each writing assistant to see if it could come up with a kicker, or a clever conclusion to wrap this all up.
ChatGPT was the only one of the three that was able to read the entire text to generate a plausible conclusion:
With A.I. writing assistants like ChatGPT, Wordtune Spices, and Rytr, we have a powerful tool to enhance our writing - but only if we use it responsibly.
Wordtune Spices produced an unusable takeaway:
With the help of writing assistants, I was able to finish this column with a well-crafted conclusion that ties together all the points I have discussed.
Rytr did, um, something:
Coaches in the National Football League earn an average of $ 2,000,000 annually.
AI21 Labs, the Israeli start-up that developed Wordtune Spices, said current A.I. writing technology required more guidance from the user than the prompt I had given the tools. Rytr said its users could use a feedback tool to train its A.I. in the event that something went wrong. OpenAI declined to comment.
All this shows that artificial intelligence can be an effective tool for improving our work. I was surprised by some of the results -- in particular, that Wordtune Spices could add accurate and relevant background information. I may occasionally use the tool for suggestions on fleshing out paragraphs with some historical data, though I will then check the facts before publishing them.
And in general, the A.I. bots were useful for sharpening prose and cleaning up clunky, ungrammatical sentences.
What the bots couldn't do, however, was the research or reporting to show their strengths and weaknesses. That requires thought.

Judge Says No to Effort To Block Meta V.R. Deal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The ruling is a defeat for the Federal Trade Commission, which used a rare antitrust argument to try to block Meta's acquisition of a small start-up.
A federal judge has rejected the Federal Trade Commission's request to stop Meta, Facebook's parent company, from buying a small virtual reality start-up, two people with knowledge of the matter said, signaling that efforts to rein in the tech giants may struggle in courts.
In a sealed order issued late Tuesday, Judge Edward J. Davila of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California declined the F.T.C.'s demand for a preliminary injunction to block Meta from buying Within, which makes a virtual reality fitness game called Supernatural, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the orders are sealed.
Judge Davila also issued a restraining order blocking the $ 400 million deal from closing through Tuesday, allowing the F.T.C. time to decide whether it wants to appeal the ruling, one of the people said.
The loss is a stinging defeat for the F.T.C.'s chair, Lina Khan, and her broader efforts to expand the boundaries of antitrust law to better regulate the tech giants. The case was aimed at testing that line with a rarely used legal argument that Meta's deal would hinder future competition in an undeveloped market, as opposed to a more traditional case that would focus on a mature economic area.
Ms. Khan has argued that the F.T.C. should file more novel cases if it wants to properly nurture competition in the modern economy. She has acknowledged that the agency must be willing to lose in some of them.
The ruling is "a blow to the administration's and the F.T.C.'s interest in being stronger in merger enforcement," said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School. She added that the agency clearly saw benefits to bringing risky cases to draw attention to what it considered the poor state of antitrust law.
The decision was a vindication for Meta, which had argued in court that it was trying to create a platform that would be welcoming for all virtual reality apps, including those developed independently. The company has invested billions of dollars in becoming a powerhouse of the so-called metaverse, where users work, play and consume content through virtual and augmented reality. It has acquired virtual reality content studios and Oculus, a company that makes the headsets people use to view that content.
Meta, which reported a $ 4.2 billion restructuring charge in its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, declined to comment. A spokesman for the F.T.C. said the agency was "not able to comment at this time" to respect the court's seal order.
Bloomberg earlier reported Judge Davila's decision.
The F.T.C. sued Meta in July in federal court to temporarily halt the deal, and then asked its in-house court in August to fully block the acquisition. The F.T.C. will have to decide whether to proceed with its in-house challenge despite the ruling.
The lawsuit was the first of the cases developed entirely under Ms. Khan, a legal scholar who rose to prominence after she wrote a critique of Amazon that went viral, to be filed in court. Looking to prevent more "vertical" deals, in which the two companies don't compete directly, the F.T.C. also challenged Microsoft's $ 69 billion purchase of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard in December. Last month, the Department of Justice accused Google of abusing a monopoly over the technology that places ads on websites.
William E. Kovacic, a former F.T.C. chairman, said the sealed ruling in the Meta case would be more problematic for the agency if the judge panned the legal theories underpinning the challenge. But if Judge Davila saw the F.T.C.'s more novel approach as plausible -- even if the agency's factual assertions were weak in this case -- "that's a low-impact defeat" less likely to hurt its future efforts, Mr. Kovacic said.
The case was heard in San Jose, Calif., in December. During the seven-day hearing, Meta's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and its chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, testified. The F.T.C. argued that if Meta did not buy Supernatural, it would develop its own virtual reality fitness game.
Meta's case rested on proving that developing or acquiring a fitness app was just a small part of a strategy that would eventually push virtual reality, and by extension the metaverse, into wide popularity.
During the hearing, an F.T.C. lawyer asked Mr. Zuckerberg if it was true that acquiring or developing a fitness app kept him up at night. Fitness apps, Mr. Zuckerberg said, were just one type of app that the company was interested in.
"Fitness was probably the fourth or fifth use case that I thought would be important," he said, ranking apps that focused on gaming, productivity and social interactions as higher priorities. Developing a fitness app, he told the lawyer, did not cost him any sleep.
Mr. Zuckerberg also told Judge Davila that if he blocked the deal, it would "have a chilling effect."
"Maybe Meta gets banned from everything going forward," Mr. Zuckerberg said. "That would make it so investors are less excited for investing in this space."

Davila of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California declined the FTC’s demand for a preliminary injunction to block Meta from buying Within, which makes a virtual-reality fitness game called “Supernatural,” said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the orders are sealed.
Davila also issued a restraining order blocking the $400 million deal from closing through Feb. 7, allowing the FTC time to decide whether it wants to appeal the ruling, one of the people said.
The loss is a stinging defeat for the FTC’s chair, Lina Khan, and her broader efforts to expand the boundaries of antitrust law to better regulate the tech giants. The case was aimed at testing that line with a rarely used legal argument that Meta’s deal would hinder future competition in an undeveloped market, as opposed to a more traditional case that would focus on a mature economic area.
Khan has argued the FTC should file more novel cases if it wants to properly nurture competition in the modern economy. She has acknowledged that the agency must be willing to lose in some of them.
The ruling is “a blow to the administration’s and the FTC’s interest in being stronger in merger enforcement,” said Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School. She added that the agency clearly saw benefits to bringing risky cases to draw attention to what it considers the poor state of antitrust law.
The decision was a vindication for Meta, which had argued in court that it was trying to create a platform that would be welcoming for all virtual-reality apps, including those developed independently. The company has invested billions of dollars in becoming a powerhouse of the so-called metaverse, where users work, play and consume content through virtual and augmented reality. It has acquired virtual-reality content studios and Oculus, a company that makes the headsets people use to view that content.
Meta, which reported a $4.2 billion restructuring charge in its quarterly earnings Wednesday, declined to comment. A spokesperson for the FTC said the agency was “not able to comment at this time” to respect the court’s seal order.
Bloomberg earlier reported Davila’s decision.
The FTC sued Meta in July in federal court to temporarily halt the deal, and then asked its in-house court in August to fully block the acquisition. The FTC will have to decide whether to proceed with its in-house challenge despite the ruling.
The lawsuit was the first of the cases developed entirely under Khan, a legal scholar who rose to prominence after she wrote a critique of Amazon that went viral, to be filed in court. Looking to prevent more “vertical” deals, in which the two companies don’t compete directly, the FTC also challenged Microsoft’s $69 billion purchase of video game publisher Activision Blizzard in December. Last month, the Department of Justice accused Google of abusing a monopoly over the technology that places ads on websites.
William E. Kovacic, a former FTC chair, said the sealed ruling in the Meta case would be more problematic for the agency if the judge panned the legal theories underpinning the challenge. But if Davila saw the FTC’s more novel approach as plausible — even if the agency’s factual assertions were weak in this case — “that’s a low-impact defeat” less likely to hurt its future efforts, Kovacic said.
The case was heard in San Jose, California, in December. During the seven-day hearing, Meta’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, and its chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, testified. The FTC argued that if Meta did not buy “Supernatural,” it would develop its own virtual reality fitness game.
Meta’s case rested on proving that developing or acquiring a fitness app was just a small part of a strategy that would eventually push virtual reality, and by extension the metaverse, into wide popularity.
During the hearing, an FTC lawyer asked Zuckerberg if it was true that acquiring or developing a fitness app kept him up at night. Fitness apps, Zuckerberg said, were just one type of app that the company was interested in.
“Fitness was probably the fourth or fifth use case that I thought would be important,” he said, ranking apps that focused on gaming, productivity and social interactions as higher priorities. Developing a fitness app, he told the lawyer, did not cost him any sleep.
Zuckerberg also told Davila that if he blocked the deal, it would “have a chilling effect.”
“Maybe Meta gets banned from everything going forward,” Zuckerberg said. “That would make it so investors are less excited for investing in this space.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

AI Bots Can’t Report This Column. But They Can Improve It.

Plagiarizing essays. Cheating on tests. Spreading misinformation. The advent of new, powerful artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT has sparked concerns about the unintended consequences of the technology and debate over the ethical implications of its use.
Despite concerns, AI assistants seem here to stay. After ChatGPT’s splashy debut late last year, Microsoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI, the lab behind the chatbot. The threat from a rival forced Google to regroup. And the media site BuzzFeed recently announced that it would use AI to write online quizzes and other content.
Given the growing influence of this technology, it’s time to focus on how we can start reaping the benefits in a responsible way. Many AI experts and computer scientists agree that these tools can provide a major perk that does no harm: editing our writing.
In this context, we would still be using our skills and brainpower to do the hard work of making sense of information and coming up with new ideas while turning to AI for some light assistance, such as making a sentence sound more conversational, sprinkling in some historical context or even adding a joke.
For several days, I tested Wordtune Spices and Rytr, two AI writing assistants released by startups in the last two years, and compared them with ChatGPT. I’ll go over some examples that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each of these three tools.
Test 1: Rewriting a Sentence
To use Wordtune Spices, which the Israeli startup AI21 Labs released last month, you insert text into a box, highlight the sentences you want edited and then click on options to make improvements. Among its best uses during my recent test were quick rewrites of sentences.
For example, I took this sentence from my column last week about email addresses and privacy:
When you browse the web, an increasing number of sites and apps are asking for a piece of basic information that you probably hand over without hesitation: your email address.
Then I clicked the “Rewrite” button. Wordtune Spices shot back a list of options for revisions of the sentence. I liked this one best:
Your email address is one of the most basic pieces of info that is being requested by more and more websites and apps.
My original sentence included a significant detail to me — that we hand over our email addresses without hesitation — but the tool trimmed a few words to cut to the chase and summarize the heart of the problem. Not bad.
Test 2: Catching Grammatical Errors
Rytr, an AI writing assistant released in 2021 by a company of the same name, was designed to streamline the creation of blog posts and marketing copy. It was proficient at catching grammatical errors (as, similarly, word-processing tools like Microsoft Word have been doing for decades).
In my test, I took this paragraph, which has intentional errors, from an educational website that provides editing exercises:
Facebook, with more then 1 Billion users Is celebrated its 10th birthday this year. The company was launching by Mark Zuckerberg at 4th February 2004. The site was Conceived in a Harvard dorm in a way To connect student and let them build an Identity for himself online.
Then in Rytr, I highlighted the paragraph and clicked “Improve.” It gave me this:
Facebook, with more than 1 billion users, celebrated its 10th birthday this year. The company was launched by Mark Zuckerberg on February 4th, 2004. The site was conceived in a Harvard dorm as a way to connect students and let them build an identity for themselves online.
The tool automatically rewrote an error-free version of the paragraph. This could be extremely handy as a study tool or for nonnative English speakers.
Test 3: Adding Context
Wordtune Spices also excelled at fleshing out paragraphs with additional context. By pressing the + button, you can add color and background information to a piece of text by inserting historical data, a joke and an example to prove your point.
For example, I took this paragraph from my column last week:
First, it helps to know why companies want email addresses. To advertisers, web publishers and app makers, your email is important not just for contacting you. It acts as a digital breadcrumb for companies to link your activity across sites and apps to serve you relevant ads.
In Wordtune Spices, I clicked the + button to add an example, a historical fact and a joke. (Changes in bold.)
First, it helps to know why companies want email addresses. To advertisers, web publishers and app makers, your email is important not just for contacting you. For example, by tracking your purchases, companies can recommend products or services that are relevant to you. The first email marketing blast was sent in 1978 by a man named Gary Thuerk who worked for Digital Equipment Corp. And with that, Gary Thuerk was sent down in history as the world’s first ‘Spam’ Lord!
After doing some research, I was impressed to learn that 1978 was indeed when email was first used for marketing. The example of using email receipts to serve targeted ads was also accurate. The joke wasn’t very funny, but it lightened things up.
Test 4: Ending This Column
Last, I pasted this entire column into each writing assistant to see if it could come up with a kicker, or a clever conclusion to wrap this all up.
ChatGPT was the only one of the three that was able to read the entire text to generate a plausible conclusion:
With AI writing assistants like ChatGPT, Wordtune Spices, and Rytr, we have a powerful tool to enhance our writing - but only if we use it responsibly.
Wordtune Spices produced an unusable takeaway:
With the help of writing assistants, I was able to finish this column with a well-crafted conclusion that ties together all the points I have discussed.
Rytr did, um, something:
Coaches in the National Football League earn an average of $2,000,000 annually.
AI21 Labs, the Israeli startup that developed Wordtune Spices, said current AI writing technology required more guidance from the user than the prompt I had given the tools. Rytr said its users could use a feedback tool to train its AI in the event that something went wrong. OpenAI declined to comment.
All this shows that artificial intelligence can be an effective tool for improving our work. I was surprised by some of the results — in particular, that Wordtune Spices could add accurate and relevant background information. I may occasionally use the tool for suggestions on fleshing out paragraphs with some historical data, though I will then check the facts before publishing them.
And in general, the AI bots were useful for sharpening prose and cleaning up clunky, ungrammatical sentences.
What the bots couldn’t do, however, was the research or reporting to show their strengths and weaknesses. That requires thought. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Bracing for Key Decisions, Markets Fall: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/bracing-key-decisions-markets-fall/docview/2770841642/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks sank Monday as Wall Street prepared for a week full of potentially market-moving events, from decisions on interest rates around the world to earnings reports from the biggest U.S. companies.
The S&P 500 dropped 1.3 percent, giving back some of the gains that had carried it last week to its highest level since early December. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 260 points, or 0.8 percent, while the Nasdaq composite sank 2 percent.
Markets have been veering recently on worries that the economy and corporate profits may be set for a steep drop-off, along with competing hopes that cooling inflation will persuade the Federal Reserve to take it easier on interest rates.
The central bank's next decision on rates is scheduled for Wednesday, and most investors expect the bank to announce an increase of just 0.25 percentage points. That would be the smallest increase since March, following a spate of increases of 0.75 points and then a 0.50-point increase, and it would mean less added pressure on the economy.
Higher rates combat inflation by intentionally slowing the economy, while also dragging down prices for investments. Inflation has been cooling since the summer amid last year's blizzard of rate increases, but the economy has also been showing signs of concern.
The big question is whether the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, will on Wednesday afternoon give markets what they want to hear -- hints that rate increases will end soon and that rate cuts may even be possible late this year -- or stick to the Fed's mantra that it plans to keep rates higher for longer, even if a modest recession hits.
"I think that they have no intention of cutting rates this year," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, adding that the Fed waits an average of roughly nine months after its last rate increase before cutting.
"They'll reiterate that they don't want to make the mistakes of the 1970s," he said, "but I think in the back of their minds, they're going to say no matter which inflationary indicator you look at, they're all heading in a stairstep downward pattern."
Central banks for Europe and for the United Kingdom are also set to announce their latest increases for rates this week.
Beyond interest rates, more than 100 companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled this week to report how much profit they made in the last three months of 2022. Among them are the technology heavyweights Apple, Amazon and Alphabet, Google's parent company. Because these companies are three of the four biggest on Wall Street by market value, their stock movements carry much more sway on the S&P 500 than others.
Apple's 2 percent drop on Monday, for example, was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500.
The only other stock that rivals Apple in size, Microsoft, shook Wall Street last week when it gave forecasts for upcoming results that raised worries about a slowdown in corporate spending on technology. Its stock fell 2.2 percent Monday.
All told, the S&P 500 fell 52.79 points to 4,017.77. The Dow lost 260.99 to 33,717.09, and the Nasdaq fell 227.90 to 11,393.81.
Strategists at Morgan Stanley led by Michael Wilson warned that tougher times may be ahead.
"The reality is that earnings are proving to be even worse than feared based on the data, especially as it relates to margins," they wrote in a report. "Secondly, investors seem to have forgotten the cardinal rule of 'Don't Fight the Fed.' Perhaps this week will serve as a reminder."
Later this week, the U.S. government will also give its latest monthly update on the job market. Hiring has remained resilient across the broad economy, even as housing and other corners weaken sharply under the weight of all the Fed's rate increases.

Full text: What's Up? (Jan. 22-28)
Job Cuts, and Not Just in Tech
What began as a wave of ominous job cuts by technology companies is rippling through other industries, most recently media and retail. In the last week alone, layoffs, or reports of coming layoffs, have swept The Washington Post, Vox and Saks.com. Adding to the tens of thousands of unemployed tech workers, Spotify said on Monday that it was cutting 6 percent of its work force, or about 600 employees, and IBM announced on Wednesday that it would shed 3,900. Tech's challenges may be somewhat particular to the sector -- employers have largely pointed to overhiring during the pandemic as a reason for the recent cuts -- but its upheaval can be an indicator of where the economy is heading. Yet even as layoffs appear to creep across the job market, unemployment claims overall remain low, and millions of jobs are open across the country.
A Growing Economy
Despite what might seem to be obvious harbingers of an economic downturn -- mass layoffs, for example -- there are other signs of relative health. Take gross domestic product, an indicator that was not as reliable at the beginning of the pandemic but has since normalized. The latest report on G.D.P., when adjusted for inflation, shows the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, suggesting that it has been largely resilient in the face of inflation, high interest rates and the war in Ukraine. Though just a few months ago, G.D.P. numbers met one commonplace standard for determining a recession, the most recent data would seem to assuage fears. But only to a certain extent -- many economists still expect a recession to begin later this year.
Elon Musk Takes the Stand
More than four years after he posted a tweet telling his followers that he had secured the funding to take Tesla private, Elon Musk, now the chief executive of both Tesla and Twitter, appeared in court to defend that statement against a lawsuit. He provided seven hours of testimony over three days, arguing that funding for a deal with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund was plentiful but dodging a question about whether a specific dollar amount had been discussed. In the 2018 tweet, Mr. Musk suggested that he had secured $ 420 a share (a favorite number of the billionaire's). Lawyers for the plaintiffs, a group of Tesla investors, are trying to build a case to prove that Mr. Musk's actions led to the wild swings in Tesla's stock, causing them to lose money. Some experts believe they are likely to succeed: Last year, the senior U.S. District Court judge hearing the case ruled that he agreed with the plaintiffs that Mr. Musk was "deliberately reckless" -- investors' words -- when he posted the tweet.
What's Next? (Jan. 29-Feb. 4)
A Smaller Rate Increase?
The Federal Reserve took its first step toward slowing its interest rate increases last month, when it broke a streak of aggressive three-quarter-point increases with a half-point one. At its meeting on Tuesday, the central bank may opt to slow its pace further. In recent weeks, Fed officials including Susan M. Collins, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Christopher Waller, a Fed governor, have discussed the possibility of a quarter-point move. "There appears to be little turbulence ahead, so I currently favor a 25-basis-point increase," Mr. Waller said. But he echoed his colleagues in emphasizing that their campaign to fight inflation was not over yet, and Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has made clear officials' intention to raise the policy interest rate to 5.1 percent by the end of the year.
Labor Market Resilience
The jobs report on Friday will provide the first glimpse at the strength of the labor market in 2023 -- though it is expected to look a lot like the end of 2022. That is to say, like recent months of jobs reports, this one is expected to show another month of solid but slowing growth. The question is, how long can these conditions last? While the labor market has long been buoyant in defiance of the Fed's attempts to cool the economy, the higher interest rates are still slowly permeating through the economy.
Slower Growth for Tech Companies
After a stretch of bad news for the country's largest tech companies, this week's quarterly earnings reports are poised to deliver ... more bad news. Microsoft helped kicked off the tech-sector portion of earnings season last week by reporting its slowest growth in six years. Amazon, which will release its quarterly results on Thursday, the same day as Alphabet and Apple, is expected to report exceptionally slow growth -- the slowest in two decades, analysts predict. While Amazon and its peers may be hurting, these companies continue to bring in billions in profit, and some are making big investments even as they say their aim with layoffs is to trim costs. Days after announcing plans to cut 10,000 jobs, Microsoft, for example, said it planned to invest $ 10 billion in the artificial intelligence lab behind the chatbot ChatGPT.
What Else?
Live Nation Entertainment, the parent of Ticketmaster, which canceled its plans to sell tickets to Taylor Swift's upcoming tour, was cast as a monopoly by top Democrats during a Senate hearing (some used Ms. Swift's lyrics to make their point). A glitch on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday led to wild price swings for major stocks, adding or wiping out billions in market value. Meta said it would reinstate former President Donald J. Trump's Instagram and Facebook accounts "in the coming weeks."

Misery Loves Company, but You've Been Fired at Home: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Angst rippled across laptop screens this month, with dozens of companies announcing layoffs and finding ways to breed extra chaos in the process.
Kerensa Cadenas opened Slack on Friday morning to an expletive-laden message from a colleague that said essentially: "I got let go." Ms. Cadenas, steeling herself, checked her email. Then she typed out her own expletive. She'd been laid off, too. Alone in her Brooklyn apartment.
Ms. Cadenas, with more than a hundred of her Vox Media colleagues as well as thousands of other workers this week and last, was submerged in a lonely, surreal wave of remote layoffs. People got the news through emails, Slack messages or video calls, then sent their goodbye notes and powered down their computers, with no teammates around to commiserate over beer.
"Normally you're like, 'OK, I can go get drunk,"' said Ms. Cadenas, 37, noting that atop the isolation comes frustration with the instability that so many media workers have now come to accept as a fact of their working lives. "It's scary because I'm like: 'Will I ever have a savings account? Am I ever going to own something? Probably not."'
This month, angst has rippled across laptop screens, with dozens of companies announcing mass layoffs and even the most large and well-established workplaces finding distinct ways to breed extra chaos in the process. More than 1,000 tech companies laid off nearly 160,000 workers last year, according to Layoffs.fyi, which is tracking job cuts across the industry, and another 185 companies have cut some 57,000 tech workers since the start of this year.
Layoffs are among the most challenging life experiences, causing more psychological stress than even divorce, according to one study. Losing a job can upend workers' finances and their sense of self, and layoffs in the world of remote work have in many cases been especially destabilizing, with employer missteps fueling uncertainty and unnecessary unknowns.
At Twitter, employees were notified in the middle of the night that they had been laid off, and at least one worker found out during a team call when that person lost access to company accounts. At the mortgage lending company Better.com, Rena Starr, 33, missed a short and unexpected Zoom meeting in 2021, then texted her boss to learn she and more than 900 of her colleagues had been fired during it. In a later round of job cuts at Better.com, last year, some employees there learned they had been laid off when severance pay hit their payroll accounts; this was months after the chief executive had apologized for summarily firing nearly 10 percent of the company's employees in a roughly three-minute call just before the holidays.
"They're immediately cutting you off from your technological connection," said Sandra Sucher, a professor of management at Harvard who has studied layoffs for more than a decade. "I've been hearing of a number of companies where people were in the middle of things and couldn't continue and didn't know who to address."
Many laid off workers are left with a long list of questions and an utter lack of clarity about who can help them. A recruiter at Amazon was told within four months of starting her job that it would almost certainly be cut, and she was encouraged to accept a severance package. She had to mail back her company computer and doesn't have a personal one, making it challenging to search for a new job.
At some companies, people noted that their teammates were far more helpful than their employers after a layoff. Shortly after losing her job at an e-commerce marketing company in November, Erika Kwee, 32, heard from a colleague who had crowdsourced a list of opportunities and recruiter contacts to help Ms. Kwee navigate her search process.
But many remote workers don't even have their colleagues' phone numbers, and they don't know who to go to for comfort or information. Beth Anstandig, a psychotherapist in the Bay Area, is seeing her clients bear the mental toll of this period.
"I hear that people are not sleeping, or sleeping two hours at a time on their couches," said Ms. Anstandig, who is currently working with both clients conducting layoffs and those experiencing them, many of whom are distressed and overworked. "They're in tears during our meetings together."
Millions of American workers have never known a world without the specter of mass layoffs. That kind of instability has characterized the economy since the late 1970s and '80s, when the notion of prioritizing shareholders above all else took root and companies embraced the strategy of growing fast and then cutting down quick. Some executives rushed to frame that tumult as intrinsic to corporate life: In 1996, Robert Eaton, chief executive of Chrysler Corporation, said that downsizing and layoffs are part of the price of becoming more competitive. Now 85 percent of workers rank job loss as a top concern, according to the latest Edelman Trust Barometer.
Last year ended with job cuts across tech behemoths: Meta laid off more than 11,000 workers, or about 13 percent of its work force, and Lyft laid off 13 percent of its workers. Google's parent company, Alphabet, said last week it plans to cut 12,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of its global work force; Microsoft plans to cut 10,000 jobs, or 5 percent of its employees; and Spotify this week said it would cut 6 percent of its work force. For many of these companies, these cuts followed years of free-flowing perks and flexible work arrangements that were part of what was called a "war for talent."
"That is one of the great contradictions of corporate life," Ms. Sucher said. "All corporations say 'People are our most important asset,' but they don't really seem to believe that."
"Calling someone 'talent' is quite different from calling them a person," she added. "People aren't a resource that can be depleted over time."
Trip Barnes, 39, who works in Atlanta, has been laid off three times in the past three years, each experience bringing pangs of grief in a different form. In spring 2020, for example, he got an 8 a.m. call from his longtime boss and was quickly told that he was being laid off from his hospitality staffing role and would be hearing from human resources about the details later that morning.
"Everybody in the moment is trying to get out of the conversation -- get it done quickly," Mr. Barnes said. "It was all about ripping the Band-Aid off."
Two weeks ago, he rewatched his favorite movie, "Up in the Air," a 2009 film that follows a character played by George Clooney whose job is to ax people from corporations. Mr. Barnes resonated, painfully, with the treatment of workers as interchangeable and expendable.
And in some industries, especially media, many workers voiced a sense of resignation with the layoffs that swept their workplaces this month.
Phoebe Gavin, 37, who ran talent and development for Vox.com, said she wasn't surprised when she found out on Friday that she had lost her job. Ever since her role was cut at the storytelling website Upworthy in 2015, Ms. Gavin has been preparing for bouts of unemployment. She has put 10 percent of every paycheck into her savings account, building a nest egg. In 2019, she started a coaching business, which she devoted her Saturdays and early mornings to building, because she wanted to have a backup plan in case she had to deal with losing a job again.
"I don't have any expectation for any company I work for to prioritize my interests," Ms. Gavin said.
But management experts stress that businesses don't have to navigate periods of economic turbulence so haphazardly.
Ms. Sucher noted that Nokia, when it was restructuring in 2011, gave the roughly 18,000 people who would be affected about a year of advance notice and offered them several pathways forward: The company would help them find new roles internally, get new jobs externally, start their own businesses or begin an educational program, among other options.
Nokia's success metrics were whether people had a job lined up when they left the firm, and whether they were leaving with a positive enough impression that they would be open to returning in the future. Nearly two-thirds of people who left knew what their next steps would be.
"This is going to be the lasting impression that sticks with your previous employees, your current employees and all future employees," said Tanner Hackett, chief executive of Counterpart, an insurance technology company that helps small businesses.
Mr. Hackett said companies frequently take a rushed approach to layoffs, as their shareholders watch other industry layoffs happening and expect the same, which contributes to a climate of alarm and also leaves employers open to being sued for wrongful termination or violations of the WARN Act, a 1998 labor law that requires large businesses to give advance notice of mass layoffs. In recent weeks, Mr. Hackett has watched some companies move reactively instead of purposefully in responding to the economic downturn.
Briana Boehmer, 44, drove to her office in Boulder last Wednesday for what she thought was a normal executive meeting at the fitness technology company where she was the chief operating officer and had spent nearly six years working long hours and weekends to support customers. When the meeting started, the founders seemed nervous.
After a few unclear minutes, the chief technology officer jumped in: "So are you saying we're terminated?"
It was a peculiar moment for Ms. Boehmer, who had spent recent months following the news about chaotic layoffs at other tech companies.
"I've been hearing it on these podcasts and being like, 'Oh that's a shame, that's a terrible way to do it,"' she said. "And then I'm like, 'Oh, that just happened to me."'

Tomorrow's A.I.: Actively Insidious: [Op-Ed]

Full text: WASHINGTON -- The alien invasion has begun.
Some experts say that when artificial intelligence takes off, it's going to be like Martians landing on the National Mall.
So far, our mind children, as the roboticist Hans Moravec called our artificially intelligent offspring, are in the toddler phase, as we ooh and aah at the novelty of our creation. They're headed for the rebellious teenage phase. When A.I. hurtles into adulthood and isn't so artificial anymore, we'll be relegated to being the family pets, as a resigned Steve Wozniak put it.
Silicon Valley is reeling at the prowess of an experimental chatbot called ChatGPT, released by OpenAI in late November and deemed "scary good" by Elon Musk. Musk, one of the founders with Sam Altman, left and now Microsoft is a partner.
There's keening that ChatGPT -- couldn't they have come up with a better name, like HAL? -- will eliminate millions of jobs. Why hire a college graduate if a bot can do the same work faster and cheaper? No more arguments about work-from-home rules, no more union fights. You don't need to lure A.I. back into the office with pizza.
ChatGPT opens a Pandora's box of existential fears. Silicon Valley brainiacs have talked about safeguards and kill switches for A.I., but you know they won't pull the plug when their baby turns into M3gan.
Once A.I. can run disinformation campaigns at lightning speed, will democracy stand a chance? We seem headed toward a Matrix where "it will become cheaper to show fakes than to show reality," Jaron Lanier, the father of virtual reality, wrote in Tablet. Will bad actors use A.I. to promote bigotry or hijack nuclear weapons?
As Musk once told me about his A.I. angst: "It's great when the emperor is Marcus Aurelius. It's not so great when the emperor is Caligula."
Several years ago, I interviewed the OpenAI founders in San Francisco, as well as other Valley digerati. And that is when I realized that we are doomed. For the Lords of the Cloud, as they form their sleek new world, we're VCRs.
That is why I feel free to kick back and shoot the breeze with our incipient overlords. I read that you could use advanced A.I. to interview historical figures. So I conducted my dream interview with Shakespeare, bantering with the Bard.
"Greetings, fair sir or madam," ChatGPT said, embodying Shakespeare.
What is your response to those who think "The Merchant of Venice" is antisemitic?
"While it is true that some of the language and imagery used in the play may be considered offensive by modern standards," he replied, Shylock "is a complex and multifaceted figure who is both villain and victim."
The Bard of Avon, as he called himself, cautioned that while the Oscar-winning movie "Shakespeare in Love" was "whimsical," "it should not be taken as a factual representation of my life."
Can you write me a love sonnet?
He could, even though, as he said, he was "a mere machine." One stanza read: "With eyes that shine like stars upon the sea, And lips as sweet as summer's ripest fruit, Thou art the one my heart doth long to see, And in thy beauty, all my dreams take root."
Shakespeare, it ain't. Still, I tell him, I would love to be the heroine in a Shakespearean comedy! It took ChatGPT only moments to write "The Clever Maid."
"Act I, Scene 1: A grand ball is being held in a grand estate. You, the fair maiden, are in attendance, dressed in the finest gowns. However, you are not there to dance and make merry, for you have a secret mission.
"Act II, Scene 1: You sneak away from the ball and make your way to the estate's library. There, you discover a hidden door, which leads to a secret chamber. Inside, you find a chest filled with precious jewels.
"Act III, Scene 1: As you are admiring the jewels, you hear a noise. It is the estate's owner, a wealthy and arrogant nobleman. He catches you red-handed but instead of punishing you, he is taken by your wit and charm.
"Act IV, Scene 1: The nobleman reveals that the jewels were a test of character and he had been seeking a clever and resourceful woman to be his wife. You are overjoyed and accept his proposal.
"Act V, Scene 1: The play ends with a grand wedding ceremony and a celebration of your cleverness and wit."
Sounds more like a Salma Hayek heist movie. I spent the rest of the afternoon soliciting love poems from John Donne, Emily Dickinson and Edgar Allan Poe, who called me a "telltale columnist." I tried to channel Sylvia Plath, but ChatGPT told me that would be "inappropriate."
The most entertaining mimicry was when A.I. Kendrick Lamar wrote me a rap: "Listen up, I got a story to tell, 'bout a journalist who's sharp as a nail. She's got the pen and the power, To make politicians cower."
For now, ChatGPT is typing, not writing. The creative spark requires humanity. But soon, A.I. could be sentient. Then we'll need our dog bowls.

On the Fifth Try, a First Date to Remember: [Society Desk]

Full text: Rachel Honig had been on hundreds of dates. Grad Conn could barely muster the courage to go on one. But after canceling four times, the fifth time was a charm.
Wilson Grad Conn wasn't going to let his dating inexperience become a liability when he started seeing Rachel Lyn Honig in the fall of 2019.
Rookie mistakes, he knew, were unavoidable. But at 55, he felt he had the life skills to get himself up to speed quickly, and that he had met a woman who merited the effort. "When I found Rachel, I knew she was right for me," he said.
He hadn't been a believer in love at first sight, but he became one.
Ms. Honig, 51, and Mr. Conn, now 58, were both living in Manhattan when they swiped right in April 2019. That they didn't meet until October owes itself to an outsize case of the jitters. Mr. Conn, who goes by Grad, had moved to the Upper West Side in 2018 from Seattle, where he had been Microsoft America's chief marketing officer, in an effort to revive a faltering first marriage.
"That failed spectacularly," he said. His former wife returned to Seattle shortly after, leaving Mr. Conn, who had been married to her since 1987, untethered in an unfamiliar city.
Most of his waking hours were consumed with a new job as chief experience and marketing officer at the software company Sprinklr. But by spring 2019 he was ready to lay the groundwork for a new social life, too. He and his wife, who have two daughters, Myrna, 28, and Trinity, 25, were legally separated. "We had started thinking about divorce," he said. "I thought, I should get out there and start meeting people."
Binge more Vows columns here and read all our wedding, relationship and divorce coverage here .
When he downloaded Tinder, "I wanted to meet someone who was oriented toward a passionate romantic relationship." He estimated he scrolled through thousands of faces before he matched with Ms. Honig, who became the first and only woman he met online. A more noteworthy statistic: She became only the second woman he had ever kissed.
Ms. Honig is a psychotherapist in private practice in Manhattan. When she met Mr. Conn, she was living in Midtown and managing Amplify Cooperative, a marketing communications consultancy she founded in 2013.
Like Mr. Conn, she had been previously married; she was divorced in 2006 after a five-year marriage. Unlike him, she had no children and knew her way around dating apps. "I tried a lot of them," she said, including the rare-for-Manhattanites Farmers Only. In her 14 years of post-divorce dating, she estimated that a total number of men she communicated with had surpassed 3,000. Of those, she met hundreds in person.
Mr. Conn's profile photos on Tinder, including one with his DeLorean, struck her as "kind of zany," she said. Also, "he had his first and last names on his profile. Nobody does that." The full name enabled Googling him, though, which helped her piece together a fuller picture of the man who had started messaging her for dates but not following through.
"I knew his professional background, I knew the company he worked for," she said. She liked both. If she hadn't, she wouldn't have been as patient with his excuses, including one he texted from London hours before they were supposed to meet in New York. "It was like, Come on, buddy. You're on another continent."
Mr. Conn canceled four dates with Ms. Honig before he asked his assistant to make sure he attended one they scheduled for Oct. 4. "She literally pushed me into the elevator," he said. "My legs were so stiff they wouldn't bend."
Ms. Honig had invited him to a screening at the Paley Center in New York of a "West Wing" episode followed by a question-and-answer session with Aaron Sorkin, the series creator. She threatened to quit communicating with him if he canceled. "It was worded powerfully," he said. "It was effective."
He knew he was in love when they sat down for a drink at the 21 Club before the event. But when they parted company at 1 a.m., the feeling wasn't mutual. "He didn't offer to get me an Uber or even walk me to the curb," she said. Mr. Conn now calls that "a bush league move." Ms. Honig, who found him earnest and sincere, agreed to a second date anyway.
On that date, 10 days later, she became his second-ever partner for a passionate kiss. At her suggestion, he leaned in on a walk along the East River, "I was shaking like a leaf," he said. The result generated a mixed review. It was, "strong potential, needs work," Ms. Honig said. Mr. Conn was eager to put in the hours it took to learn.
By mid-October, though it was a new endeavor for him, Mr. Conn was exhibiting a gift for romance. For a third date, at Bistro Vendôme, a French restaurant in Manhattan, he arrived with a beribboned robin's egg blue box. Inside was a compass from Tiffany & Company. A note attached said, "Thank you for helping me find my way."
"Rachel literally instructed me" on how to be a boyfriend, Mr. Conn said. But he didn't want to remain one for long.
Ms. Honig grew up as an only child in Rockville Centre, N.Y. Her mother, Patricia Honig, a librarian, died of throat cancer in 2002. Her father, Ronald Honig, is the owner of Ron Honig and Company, a floor covering sales agency. In 1993, she earned a bachelor's degree in art history and ethics from Smith College. Last year she received a master's degree in clinical mental health counseling from Northwestern University.
Mr. Conn grew up in Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia, with a younger brother and sister and graduated from Queen's University with a bachelor's degree in marketing in 1985. His mother, Genevieve Conn, is a retired high school French teacher. His father, Charles Conn, an advertising executive, died of pneumonia in April.
When he met his previous wife, in college, "he was smitten and felt he had no reason to look any further," his mother said. That he felt the same way after a single date with Ms. Honig, she added, doesn't point to impulsivity or limited patience for playing the field. "Grad is quite deep, and very measured in what he does," she said. Ms. Honig, however, was a jolt of instant chemistry.
Ms. Honig wasn't sure it was healthy. In November 2019, she wondered aloud whether, by becoming his girlfriend, she was depriving him of dating experiences he might benefit from. But when she suggested he see other women, it was a hard no. "When you know, you know," he said.
Six months into their relationship, when Covid started tearing through Manhattan, he suggested they apply for a marriage license in case one of them got the virus. "That was in the days when you thought if your person was hospitalized, you could go sit with them," Ms. Honig said. "Grad had amazing foresight. He knew we were going to want to be there for each other."
That license went unused and expired in August 2020. But the sense of rightness both felt on obtaining it never left them. Mr. Conn, whose divorce was final in March 2020, proposed twice. The first, on Sept. 12, 2020, happened on a midnight walk on an island off the coast of Boothbay Harbor, Maine, where Ms. Honig spends summers.
"Grad had carved our initials in the boathouse the way other people do," Ms. Honig said. "We went and saw that, and then he proposed to me under the stars."
She said yes a second time when he proposed three weeks later, on the anniversary of their first date, during a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, in Mill Run, Pa. The trip was to celebrate their mutual love of midcentury-modern design.
The grand wedding for 325 they put on at the TWA Hotel at JFK Airport in Queens on Dec. 10 was also a tribute to midcentury modernism, but the date had been chosen for another mutual passion: Christmas.
"Grad has been known to count down Christmas as early as January," Ms. Honig said. The couple now split their time between Ms. Honig's apartment in Midtown; a house in Delray Beach, Fla., they bought together in 2020 to be closer to Ms. Honig's father; a cottage on Long Island Ms. Honig's mother left her; and Mr. Conn's work residence in Houston. In May 2020, he left Sprinklr to become chief marketing officer at PROS, a software company based in Texas.
Both like the idea of eventually dedicating a yet-to-be-purchased house to Christmas exclusively, with a tree up and carols playing year-round.
At the wedding ceremony, guests got a glimpse of how that might look. Dozens of Christmas trees done up in tinsel and ornaments the couple asked their friends and families to bring in lieu of gifts dotted the capacious onetime air terminal. Scenery also included a Christmas-themed ice sculpture and Grinch-inspired wedding cake. "The place was transformed into an absolute wonderland," Ms. Conn said.
Ms. Honig, wearing a pillbox hat and a custom Anne Barge wedding gown with a jeweled belt, walked with her father down a candlelit staircase. Mr. Conn and his mother descended a staircase on the opposite side while he was dressed in a tuxedo by Tom Ford with a shawl collar. Ms. Honig's cousin, Marian R. Shelton, a retired judge of the New York State Family Court, met them at an altar strung with festive greenery to officiate.
In handwritten vows, Ms. Honig called Mr. Conn "a unicorn among men." Mr. Conn thanked Ms. Honig for helping him believe in love at first sight. After both repeated "with this ring I thee wed," the proceedings took a break from Christmas when Mr. Conn stomped a glass, a nod to Ms. Honig's Catholic-Jewish upbringing.
With a cheer of "mazel tov!" from the crowd and sleigh bells ringing in the distance, the couple recessed through the terminal, hand in hand.
On This Day
When Dec. 10, 2022
Where The TWA Hotel, John F. Kennedy Airport
The Most Wonderful Time Ms. Honig's wedding prep included a Christmas-themed Mani-Pedi. "Every bride should have snowflakes on her nails and candy cane toes," she said. Her jewels for the ceremony featured her late mother's opera-length pearls; Mr. Conn wore vintage TWA port of call cuff links, a gift from the bride.
Traditions Food stations at a reception in the terminal reflected both sides of Ms. Honig's background. One offered a Christmas turkey dinner with all the trimmings, the other, Chinese food.
Unbroken The couple hired predominantly woman-owned wedding vendors. One, the Israeli artist Talia C., made the glass Mr. Conn broke underfoot. After the wedding, the shards were collected. The artist will repurpose them into resin candlesticks for the bride and groom's table.

Valuation Of A.I. Firm Is Nearing $5 Billion: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Anthropic specializes in generative artificial intelligence, a hot investment in Silicon Valley. The new funding could value the company at roughly $ 5 billion.
Anthropic, a San Francisco artificial intelligence start-up, is close to raising roughly $ 300 million in new funding, two people with knowledge of the situation said, in the latest sign of feverish excitement for a new class of A.I. start-ups.
The deal could value Anthropic at roughly $ 5 billion, though the terms were still being worked out and the valuation could change, one of the people said. The start-up, which was founded in 2021, previously raised $ 704 million, valuing it at $ 4 billion, according to PitchBook, which tracks private investment data.
Silicon Valley has been gripped by a frenzy over start-ups working on "generative" A.I., technologies that can generate text, images and other media in response to short prompts. This week, Microsoft invested $ 10 billion in OpenAI, the San Francisco start-up that kicked off the furor in November with a chatbot, ChatGPT. ChatGPT has wowed more than a million people with its knack for answering questions in clear, concise prose.
Even as funding for other start-ups has dried up, investors have chased deals in similar A.I. companies, signaling that the otherwise gloomy market for tech investing has at least one bright spot.
Other funding deals in the works include Character.AI, which lets people talk to chatbots that impersonate celebrities. The start-up has held discussions about a large round of funding, according to three people with knowledge of the situation.
Replika, another chatbot company, and You.com, which is rolling out similar technology into a new kind of search engine, said they, too, had received unsolicited interest from investors.
All specialize in generative A.I. The result of more than a decade of research inside companies like OpenAI, these technologies are poised to remake everything from online search engines like Google Search and Microsoft Bing to photo and graphics editors like Photoshop.
The explosion of interest in generative A.I. has investors and start-ups racing to choose their teams. Start-ups want to take money from the most powerful investors with the deepest pockets, and investors are trying to pick winners from a growing list of ambitious companies.
The stakes are high. Venture capital investors typically do not back multiple companies in one category for competitive reasons. So a bad bet now could lead to a missed opportunity to make money on other deals down the line.
Despite the excitement, few of these start-ups have a clear plan to make money. That has rarely been a problem in Silicon Valley; past generations of investors poured money into social media sites or mobile apps on the assumption that they would figure out how to turn a profit later.
But that strategy has been less of a sure bet in recent years as start-ups have expanded beyond the tech industry's bread and butter of selling software or selling ads. Certain businesses, like on-demand delivery, ride-hailing apps and subscription meal kits, took longer to make money than investors hoped or did not make money at all.
Anthropic was founded by a group of people that included several researchers who left OpenAI. Its funding talks stand out because of its earlier backers. The vast majority of its funding came from the disgraced cryptocurrency entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried and his colleagues at FTX, the cryptocurrency platform that went bankrupt amid fraud charges last year. That money could be clawed back by a bankruptcy court, leaving Anthropic in limbo.

Wall Street Sees the Glass as Half Full: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks rose Thursday to send Wall Street to its highest level in nearly eight weeks following reports suggesting the economy and corporate profits may be doing better than feared.
The S&P 500 climbed 1.1 percent to clinch its highest finish since Dec. 2. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 0.6 percent, while the Nasdaq composite rallied 1.8 percent.
More swings may be ahead, as Wall Street digests a torrent of earnings and economic reports. Markets have veered recently as worries about a severe recession and drop-off in profits battle against hopes the economy can manage a soft landing and the Federal Reserve may ease up on interest rates.
Thursday's headline report showed the overall economy held up better through the last three months of 2022 than economists expected, even with the weight of all the rate hikes the Fed approved last year to combat inflation. According to the U.S. government's first of three estimates on it, the economy's growth slowed to an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the quarter, which was stronger than the 2.3 percent that economists had forecast.
Other reports showed that orders for long-lasting goods from factories strengthened by more than expected in December and fewer workers applied for jobless claims than expected last week.
Strong data give hope the economy can withstand last year's rate hikes by the Fed, plus at least one more expected next week, without crashing to a deep recession. Higher rates intentionally slow the economy by making it more expensive to borrow to buy a home, a car or anything else on credit. They also drag down prices for stocks and other investments.
But a stronger-than-expected economy, particularly in the job market, can also carry risks. It could push the Fed to keep rates higher for longer to ensure that inflation really is crushed. The Fed has been saying repeatedly that it plans to do just that, at least through the end of the year, though many investors don't seem to be buying it.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other loans crucial for the economy, rose to 3.49 percent from 3.46 percent. The two-year yield, which tends to more closely track expectations for Fed actions on interest rates, rose to 4.18 percent from 4.13 percent.
While Thursday's report on the economy may have been encouraging at first blush, it included some concerning signals of slowdown underneath. It's also backward looking, said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors.
"The first half of this year is going to be tough," she said, pointing to recent weakness in both the manufacturing and service sectors of the economy.
But she added she's "in the camp that says it will be relatively short and shallow because if you look at the foundation of the economy coming into this slowdown, there are a lot of things that are much stronger than you tend to see in past recessions."
She cited the low unemployment rate and relatively strong balance sheets at companies and households, among other things.
On the earnings front, reports from some big tech-oriented companies helped build optimism a day after worries flared following forecasts from Microsoft widely seen as discouraging.
Tesla jumped 11 percent after the electric-vehicle maker reported stronger profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. Seagate Technology rose 10.9 percent after it reported stronger revenue and earnings than expected.
Chevron rose 4.9 percent after it raised its dividend and approved a program to buy back up to $ 75 billion of its stock. Both moves put cash directly in the pockets of shareholders, which caught criticism from Washington. The White House spokesman Abdullah Hasan suggested oil companies instead "use their record profits to increase supply."

University of Texas Plans Online A.I. Degree: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Amid a boom in new tools like ChatGPT, the Austin campus plans to train thousands of students in sought-after skills in artificial intelligence.
The University of Texas at Austin, one of the nation's leading computer science schools, said on Thursday that it was starting a large-scale, low-cost online Master of Science degree program in artificial intelligence.
The first of its kind among elite computing schools, the new program could help swiftly expand the A.I. work force in the United States as tech giants like Microsoft rush to invest billions in the field.
The university announced the initiative amid a clamor over new technology powered by artificial intelligence that can generate humanlike art and texts. And while some of the technology industry's biggest companies are laying off workers after years of rapid growth, hiring in A.I. is expected to stay strong.
University officials said they planned to train thousands of graduate students in sought-after skills like machine learning, for a tuition of about $ 10,000, starting in the spring of 2024. School officials said the cost was intended to make A.I. education more affordable. By contrast, Johns Hopkins University offers an online M.S. degree in artificial intelligence for more than $ 45,000.
"A.I. is now becoming an essential tool in fields way outside the scope of a handful of tech companies," said Adam Klivans, a computer science professor at Texas who is the director of the online A.I. master's program. Noting that A.I. experts are in high demand in industries like biotechnology and finance, Professor Klivans said the new online degree was "something working professionals can participate in to learn the expertise their companies need without leaving their jobs."
The funding to develop the new master's program came in part from the National Science Foundation. In 2020, the foundation awarded the University of Texas a five-year, $ 20 million grant to establish an A.I. institute in machine learning. That is a field in which computer algorithms learn to make predictions by analyzing large data sets -- such as predicting which drug formulations could be best used to treat new viruses.
University officials said tenure-track faculty in computer science and related fields, like computer engineering, would teach the online master's courses via recorded video lectures, along with some interactive sessions. Faculty members involved in an interdisciplinary research program at the university called Good Systems, which is aimed at developing A.I. tools whose potential societal benefits outweigh their harms, will also participate.
The online master's program will include advanced courses in fields like machine learning; A.I. applications in health; and natural language processing, which helps voice assistants like Siri and Alexa understand human speech. Each course will also include formal ethics training to give students a framework for understanding the societal implications of A.I. systems.
"In each of the classes, the instructor will ask students to reflect on the possible benefits and possible harms of the technologies they are learning about," said Peter Stone, a computer science professor at Texas who teaches a course in ethical robotics. "People developing the next generation of technologies, as well as users, need to have a realistic view of what are the strengths and limitations of A.I."
Those creative and critical skills could be in increasingly high demand. Tech companies are scrambling to develop advanced chatbots and other A.I. tools that can generate images and texts in response to short prompts -- even as some researchers warn that the rush to deploy these novel systems could pose risks, such as political manipulation.
The Texas program was inspired in part by the Georgia Institute of Technology, which in 2014 became the first leading computer science school to start a large-scale, low-cost online master's degree in that field. Thousands of students have graduated from the program.
In 2019, the University of Texas at Austin started its own large-scale online master's degree program in computer science, followed by a similar online master's in data science in 2021. Together, the programs have an enrollment of about 2,800 students.
The university plans to open applications for the new A.I. master's program this June with the aim of enrolling more than 2,000 students per year, said Don Fussell, the chair of the computer science department. To be accepted into the online program, he said, students will not be required to have a bachelor's degree in computer science, but they will need to have expertise in a technical field like engineering or computing. The A.I. courses will be offered through edX, a popular learning platform that also hosts the university's online master's courses in computer and data science.
With widespread layoffs at Amazon, Google and other tech firms, the online program may already have a ready-made audience: tens of thousands of unemployed tech workers looking to specialize in artificial intelligence.
"If these layoffs continue, I think we are going to see a shift among a lot of people from general computer science and tech backgrounds to A.I.," Professor Fussell said. "That's the way the field is moving."

Hiring Spree By Chipotle As Busy Time Approaches: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The restaurant chain is pitching for more workers as it aims to double the number of outlets in North America.
Chipotle Mexican Grill, the fast-casual food chain, said on Thursday that it planned to hire 15,000 workers ahead of its busiest time of year, a sharp contrast to the other large companies that are laying off employees because of pandemic overexpansion and worries about the economy.
The company said in a statement that it was preparing for what it described as "burrito season," from March to May, when it typically has most of its business.
"We will continue bringing in new crew to support Chipotle's aggressive growth plans," Scott Boatwright, Chipotle's chief restaurant officer, said in a statement. The company employs more than 100,000 people at more than 3,000 restaurants across North America. Its long-term plan calls for eventually running 7,000 outlets.
Unlike Chipotle, many companies are shedding staff and cutting costs. Tech companies in particular have recently announced layoffs, with tens of thousands of job cuts at Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and others. Industrial firms like Dow, banks like Goldman Sachs and media companies like The Washington Post have also recently laid off employees.
The Federal Reserve has been paying close attention to the labor market as it raises interest rates to bring inflation under control by slowing the economy. The most recent data showed that U.S. employers added fewer jobs in December than in earlier months, but the pace of hiring remained solid.
A spokeswoman for Chipotle said in an email that the company frequently had the most sales in the spring because of "weather and daylight." She added that restaurants in college areas did well when school was in session. The company opened more than 200 restaurants last year and plans to open up to 285 this year, the spokeswoman said, and it anticipates it will need to recruit more workers.
Wells Fargo analysts expressed doubt about Chipotle's ability to hire, given "pockets of wage pressure," they wrote in a report. The company has so far been able to offset higher pay and recruiting costs by raising menu prices, but signs of slower sales late last year suggest that may not last.
In its latest earnings report, for the third quarter of 2022, Chipotle recorded a profit of nearly $ 260 million, up more than 20 percent from a year earlier. In October, the company said its prices were on track to rise by nearly 15 percent in 2022 as it, like many consumer-facing companies, passed on higher costs to consumers.

The university announced the initiative amid a clamor over new technology powered by AI that can generate humanlike art and texts. And although some of the technology industry’s biggest companies are laying off workers after years of rapid growth, hiring in AI is expected to stay strong.
University officials said they planned to train thousands of graduate students in sought-after skills such as machine learning, for a tuition of about $10,000, starting in spring 2024. School officials said the cost was intended to make AI education more affordable. By contrast, Johns Hopkins University offers an online MS degree in artificial intelligence for more than $45,000.
“AI is now becoming an essential tool in fields way outside the scope of a handful of tech companies,” said Adam Klivans, a computer science professor at Texas and the director of the online AI master’s program. Noting that AI experts are in high demand in industries such as biotechnology and finance, Klivans said the new online degree was “something working professionals can participate in to learn the expertise their companies need without leaving their jobs.”
The funding to develop the master’s program came in part from the National Science Foundation. In 2020, the foundation awarded the University of Texas a five-year, $20 million grant to establish an AI institute in machine learning. That is a field in which computer algorithms learn to make predictions by analyzing large data sets — such as predicting which drug formulations could be best used to treat new viruses.
University officials said tenure-track faculty in computer science and related fields, such as computer engineering, would teach the online master’s courses via recorded video lectures, along with some interactive sessions. Faculty members involved in an interdisciplinary research program at the university called Good Systems, which is aimed at developing AI tools whose potential societal benefits outweigh their harms, will also participate.
The online master’s program will include advanced courses in fields such as machine learning; AI applications in health; and natural language processing, which helps voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa understand human speech. Each course will also include formal ethics training to give students a framework for understanding the societal implications of AI systems.
“In each of the classes, the instructor will ask students to reflect on the possible benefits and possible harms of the technologies they are learning about,” said Peter Stone, a computer science professor at Texas who teaches a course in ethical robotics. “People developing the next generation of technologies, as well as users, need to have a realistic view of what are the strengths and limitations of AI.”
Those creative and critical skills could be in increasingly high demand. Tech companies are scrambling to develop advanced chatbots and other AI tools that can generate images and texts in response to short prompts — even as some researchers warn that the rush to deploy these novel systems could pose risks, such as political manipulation.
The Texas program was inspired in part by the Georgia Institute of Technology, which in 2014 became the first leading computer science school to start a large-scale, low-cost online master’s degree in that field. Thousands of students have graduated from the program.
In 2019, the University of Texas at Austin started its own large-scale online master’s degree program in computer science, followed by a similar online master’s in data science in 2021. Together, the programs have an enrollment of about 2,800 students.
The university plans to open applications for the new AI master’s program this June with the aim of enrolling more than 2,000 students per year, said Don Fussell, chair of the computer science department. To be accepted into the online program, he said, students will not be required to have a bachelor’s degree in computer science, but they will need to have expertise in a technical field such as engineering or computing. The AI courses will be offered through edX, a popular learning platform that also hosts the university’s online master’s courses in computer and data science.
With widespread layoffs at Amazon, Google and other tech firms, the online program may already have a ready-made audience: tens of thousands of unemployed tech workers looking to specialize in AI.
“If these layoffs continue, I think we are going to see a shift among a lot of people from general computer science and tech backgrounds to AI,” Fussell said. “That’s the way the field is moving.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Elon Musk Says Davos Isn't Fun. Well, Is It?: [Style Desk]

Full text: A not-so-scientific poll of attendees at the Super Bowl of global capitalism.
The concept of fun is weirdly hard to define, like love or obscenity. You kind of know it when you're having it, and you definitely know when you're not.
Last month, Elon Musk, the Tesla and Twitter C.E.O., said that he had declined an invitation to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum at Davos, because, he wrote in a tweet, "it sounded boring af": Not fun at all.
And yet, Davos is global capitalism's Super Bowl, a place where world leaders (Olaf Scholz!), royalty (Philippe, King of the Belgians!), corporate titans (Jamie Dimon!) and some of our very finest celebrities (Idris Elba! Will.i.am!) gather for five nights of parties, where they schmooze, drink rare Burgundy and -- allegedly -- set the course for the future of the world over Michelin-starred canapés.
So which is it? Is Davos fun? Or is it boring? Well, it depends on whom you ask, as well as what you get invited to.
(And according to a W.E.F. spokesman, Mr. Musk wasn't even invited to this year's conference. So there.)
"Davos is not boring at all," said Randall Lane, the chief content officer and editor of Forbes, who has been going to Davos since 2014. On Thursday night, Mr. Lane's magazine hosted a party for 1,200, featuring musical performances by Fat Joe and Doug E. Fresh in honor of the 50th anniversary of hip-hop -- an event that many people would consider fun.
"It's not boring during the day, and it's definitely not boring at night," Mr. Lane said. "If you think it's boring, you probably haven't been here."
During the day, Davos is given over to official programming -- the Davos agenda. (Reporters and executives from The New York Times regularly participate in the conference, and the company has hosted private events there.) It features talks and round-table discussions about such topics as the energy transition, the global supply chain and Alzheimer's disease, which are perhaps less fun than Fat Joe, or Sting for that matter, who played a small concert hosted by Microsoft on Tuesday evening.
"The conference itself is not at all fun," said Jolie Hunt, the C.E.O. of Hunt & Gather, a marketing agency. She has been going to Davos for 20 years. "The dinners, the nightcaps, the schmoozes: those are tons of fun."
Those events take place at restaurants, in hotels and at private chalets. This year, Anthony Scaramucci, the Skybridge Capital founder and former White House communications director, hosted the 12th annual edition of his notorious wine party at the Hotel Europe, which the financial journalist Felix Salmon called "a drunken mess" back in 2011. (Though Politico reported that, this year, the wine ran out just before 11 p.m.)
According to Semafor, group chats on WhatsApp and Telegram now play a major role in determining which parties hit and which ones miss. Semafor cited "power chats" that include "Burning Man at Davos" and "unDavos," for those interested in the "less stuffy social scene." (Group chats: again, fun to some, not fun for others.)
According to Ms. Hunt, one crowd goes to bed by 11 p.m. in order to be up for what she called "the breakfast circuit." Another crowd, she said, stays up dancing until 4 a.m. Late night/early morning dancing is a classic sign of fun. (Still another crowd reportedly finds its fun elsewhere.)
Because Davos is so remote (two hours by car from Zurich, less by helicopter), the conference promotes a kind of snowed-in hyper-networking. Some find this energizing (fun). Others find it enervating (not fun).
"I am generally so drained by work that I just collapse," Adam Tooze, a historian, wrote in an email.
Davos attendees are usually about 80 percent male, which is also not fun. A 2020 Times UK investigation found that female guests were "routinely harassed."
Laura Modi, the C.E.O. and co-founder of Bobbie, a baby formula start-up, said that she was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, which she found "extremely welcoming." This was Ms. Modi's first Davos, and she found it fun -- to a point.
"I myself haven't really left my house in a year during the infant formula shortage," Ms. Modi said. "So the longer dinners, talking to people I would never get to speak to and having laughs -- that was fun."
Still, she said, "It's a lot of people on the grind. I can absolutely see why Elon would think it's boring."
For some longtime attendees, such as the economist Nouriel Roubini, known for his gloomy projections, Davos this year was "95% work and very little socializing," he wrote in a WhatsApp message.
"In 2020 there were all the crypto crooks, con men, criminals, and carnival barkers clogging the Promenade and hosting $ 500k champagned parties," he wrote. "Most of them are gone...good riddance!"
(So ... con men: fun? But also bad.)
Missing also were the Russians -- politicians and oligarchs -- who face sanctions for the country's war against Ukraine, and are officially excluded by the W.E.F. For two decades, they hosted some of the most lavish parties in Davos, with Cossack dancers and caviar. Last year, Russia House, once the country's hub on the Davos promenade, was rented by a Ukrainian businessman and renamed "Russia War Crimes House."
With the crypto bubble popped and Oleg Deripaska nowhere in sight, it was easier to focus on what Mr. Roubini calls "megathreats" -- known downers like climate change, war, pandemics and stagflation. The theme of this year's conference was "Cooperation in a Fragmented World," and the official conference overview includes the word "crisis" or "crises" eight times.
Still, Mr. Roubini conceded, there was merrymaking on the mountain.
"People have fun even in times of war," he wrote. "Human survival coping mechanism."
Photograph For some, the World Economic Forum at Davos offers Coachella-level fun. For others, like those above, it might not be quite as exciting.

Laid Off in Your Living Room: The Chaos of Remote Job Cuts

Kerensa Cadenas opened Slack on Friday morning to an expletive-laden message from a colleague that said essentially: “I got let go.” Cadenas, steeling herself, checked her email. Then she typed out her own expletive. She’d been laid off, too. Alone in her New York City apartment.
Cadenas, with more than 100 of her Vox Media colleagues as well as thousands of other workers this week and last, was submerged in a lonely, surreal wave of remote layoffs. People got the news through emails, Slack messages or video calls, then sent their goodbye notes and powered down their computers, with no teammates around to commiserate over beer.
“Normally you’re like, ‘OK, I can go get drunk,’” said Cadenas, 37, noting that atop the isolation comes frustration with the instability that so many media workers have now come to accept as a fact of their working lives. “It’s scary because I’m like: ‘Will I ever have a savings account? Am I ever going to own something? Probably not.’”
This month, angst has rippled across laptop screens, with dozens of companies announcing mass layoffs and even the most large and well-established workplaces finding distinct ways to breed extra chaos in the process. More than 1,000 tech companies laid off nearly 160,000 workers last year, according to Layoffs.fyi, which is tracking job cuts across the industry, and another 185 companies have cut some 57,000 tech workers since the start of this year.
Layoffs are among the most challenging life experiences, causing more psychological stress than even divorce, according to one study. Losing a job can upend workers’ finances and their sense of self, and layoffs in the world of remote work have in many cases been especially destabilizing, with employer missteps fueling uncertainty and unnecessary unknowns.
At Twitter, employees were notified in the middle of the night that they had been laid off, and at least one worker found out during a team call when that person lost access to company accounts. At the mortgage lending company Better.com, Rena Starr, 33, missed a short and unexpected Zoom meeting in 2021, then texted her boss to learn she and more than 900 of her colleagues had been fired during it. In a later round of job cuts at Better.com, last year, some employees there learned they had been laid off when severance pay hit their payroll accounts; this was months after the chief executive had apologized for summarily firing nearly 10% of the company’s employees in a roughly three-minute call just before the holidays.
“They’re immediately cutting you off from your technological connection,” said Sandra Sucher, a professor of management at Harvard who has studied layoffs for more than a decade. “I’ve been hearing of a number of companies where people were in the middle of things and couldn’t continue and didn’t know who to address.”
Many laid off workers are left with a long list of questions and an utter lack of clarity about who can help them. A recruiter at Amazon was told within four months of starting her job that it would almost certainly be cut, and she was encouraged to accept a severance package. She had to mail back her company computer and doesn’t have a personal one, making it challenging to search for a new job.
At some companies, people noted that their teammates were far more helpful than their employers after a layoff. Shortly after losing her job at an e-commerce marketing company in November, Erika Kwee, 32, heard from a colleague who had crowdsourced a list of opportunities and recruiter contacts to help Kwee navigate her search process.
But many remote workers don’t even have their colleagues’ phone numbers, and they don’t know who to go to for comfort or information. Beth Anstandig, a psychotherapist in the Bay Area, is seeing her clients bear the mental toll of this period.
“I hear that people are not sleeping, or sleeping two hours at a time on their couches,” said Anstandig, who is currently working with both clients conducting layoffs and those experiencing them, many of whom are distressed and overworked. “They’re in tears during our meetings together.”
Millions of American workers have never known a world without the specter of mass layoffs. That kind of instability has characterized the economy since the late 1970s and ’80s, when the notion of prioritizing shareholders above all else took root and companies embraced the strategy of growing fast and then cutting down quick. Some executives rushed to frame that tumult as intrinsic to corporate life: In 1996, Robert Eaton, chief executive of Chrysler Corp., said that downsizing and layoffs are part of the price of becoming more competitive.”. Now 85% of workers rank job loss as a top concern, according to the latest Edelman Trust Barometer.
Last year ended with job cuts across tech behemoths: Meta laid off more than 11,000 workers, or about 13% of its workforce, and Lyft laid off 13% of its workers. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said last week it plans to cut 12,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global workforce; Microsoft plans to cut 10,000 jobs, or 5% of its employees; and Spotify this week said it would cut 6% of its workforce. For many of these companies, these cuts followed years of free-flowing perks and flexible work arrangements that were part of what was called a “war for talent.”
“That is one of the great contradictions of corporate life,” Sucher said. “All corporations say ‘People are our most important asset,’ but they don’t really seem to believe that.”
“Calling someone ‘talent’ is quite different from calling them a person,” she added. “People aren’t a resource that can be depleted over time.”
Trip Barnes, 39, who works in Atlanta, has been laid off three times in the past three years, each experience bringing pangs of grief in a different form. In spring 2020, for example, he got an 8 a.m. call from his longtime boss and was quickly told that he was being laid off from his hospitality staffing role and would be hearing from human resources about the details later that morning.
“Everybody in the moment is trying to get out of the conversation — get it done quickly,” Barnes said. “It was all about ripping the Band-Aid off.”
Two weeks ago, he rewatched his favorite movie, “Up in the Air,” a 2009 film that follows a character played by George Clooney whose job is to ax people from corporations. Barnes resonated, painfully, with the treatment of workers as interchangeable and expendable.
And in some industries, especially media, many workers voiced a sense of resignation with the layoffs that swept their workplaces this month.
Phoebe Gavin, 37, who ran talent and development for Vox.com, said she wasn’t surprised when she found out Friday that she had lost her job. Ever since her role was cut at the storytelling website Upworthy in 2015, Gavin has been preparing for bouts of unemployment. She has put 10% of every paycheck into her savings account, building a nest egg. In 2019, she started a coaching business, which she devoted her Saturdays and early mornings to building, because she wanted to have a backup plan in case she had to deal with losing a job again.
“I don’t have any expectation for any company I work for to prioritize my interests,” Gavin said.
But management experts stress that businesses don’t have to navigate periods of economic turbulence so haphazardly.
Sucher noted that Nokia, when it was restructuring in 2011, gave the roughly 18,000 people who would be affected about a year of advance notice and offered them several pathways forward: The company would help them find new roles internally, get new jobs externally, start their own businesses or begin an educational program, among other options.
Nokia’s success metrics were whether people had a job lined up when they left the firm, and whether they were leaving with a positive enough impression that they would be open to returning in the future. Nearly two-thirds of people who left knew what their next steps would be.
“This is going to be the lasting impression that sticks with your previous employees, your current employees and all future employees,” said Tanner Hackett, chief executive of Counterpart, an insurance technology company that helps small businesses.
Hackett said companies frequently take a rushed approach to layoffs, as their shareholders watch other industry layoffs happening and expect the same, which contributes to a climate of alarm and also leaves employers open to being sued for wrongful termination or violations of the WARN Act, a 1998 labor law that requires large businesses to give advance notice of mass layoffs. In recent weeks, Hackett has watched some companies move reactively instead of purposefully in responding to the economic downturn.
Briana Boehmer, 44, drove to her office in Boulder, Colorado, on Jan. 18 for what she thought was a normal executive meeting at the fitness technology company where she was the chief operating officer and had spent nearly six years working long hours and weekends to support customers. When the meeting started, the founders seemed nervous.
After a few unclear minutes, the chief technology officer jumped in: “So are you saying we’re terminated?”
It was a peculiar moment for Boehmer, who had spent recent months following the news about chaotic layoffs at other tech companies.
“I’ve been hearing it on these podcasts and being like, ‘Oh that’s a shame, that’s a terrible way to do it,’” she said. “And then I’m like, ‘Oh, that just happened to me.’” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

U.S. Accuses Google of Abusing Its Monopoly: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit, which a group of states joined, was the fifth by U.S. officials against the company since 2020.
The Justice Department and a group of eight states sued Google on Tuesday, accusing it of illegally abusing a monopoly over the technology that powers online advertising, in the agency's first antitrust lawsuit against a tech giant under President Biden and an escalation in legal pressure on one of the world's biggest internet companies.
The lawsuit said Google had "corrupted legitimate competition in the ad tech industry by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the wide swath of high-tech tools used by publishers, advertisers and brokers to facilitate digital advertising."
The lawsuit asked U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to force Google to sell much of its suite of ad technology products, which include software for buying and selling ads, a marketplace to complete the transactions and a service for showcasing the ads across the internet. The lawsuit also asked the court to stop the company from engaging in allegedly anticompetitive practices.
It is the fifth antitrust lawsuit filed by U.S. officials against Google since 2020, as lawmakers and regulators around the world try to rein in the power that big tech companies exert over information and commerce online. In Europe, Amazon, Google, Apple and others have faced antitrust investigations and charges, while regulators have passed new laws to limit social media's harms and some practices such as data collection.
In the United States, Google has faced particular scrutiny. In 2020, a group of states led by Texas filed an antitrust lawsuit against it involving advertising technology, while the Justice Department and another group of states separately sued Google over claims that it abused its dominance over online search. In 2021, some states also sued over the company's app store practices.
The new lawsuit "adds another important complication to Google's efforts to deal with regulators worldwide," said William Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. "There's a chance one or more of these challenges is going to make its way through and hit the target."
Peter Schottenfels, a Google spokesman, said the lawsuit "attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising technology sector." It echoes the "unfounded" lawsuit led by Texas in 2020, he said, adding that the Justice Department's latest suit makes a flawed argument that would slow innovation and harm publishers.
Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said monopolies "threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based." He added, "We will aggressively protect consumers, safeguard competition and work to ensure economic fairness and opportunity for all."
The Biden administration is trying to use uncommon legal theories to clip the wings of some of America's largest businesses. The F.T.C. recently asked a judge to block Meta from buying a virtual-reality start-up, a rare case that argues a deal could harm potential competition in a nascent market. The agency has also challenged Microsoft's $ 69 billion purchase of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard, a notable action because the two companies are not primarily seen as direct competitors.
These efforts are expected to meet fierce resistance in federal courts. Judges have for decades subscribed to a view that antitrust violations should mostly be determined by whether they increase prices for consumers. But Jonathan Kanter, the chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division, and Lina Khan, the F.T.C. chair, have said they are willing to lose cases that allow them to stretch the boundaries of the law and that put corporate America on notice.
The lawsuit on Tuesday describes a campaign by Google to monopolize advertising technology and then abuse that dominance, to the detriment of publishers, advertisers and ultimately consumers.
The Justice Department and the states, which include New York and California, said Google had built its monopoly by buying up crucial tools that delivered ads to publishers. As a result, advertisers paid more for space on the internet and publishers made less money, as Google took its cut, they said.
"Each time a threat has emerged, Google has used its market power in one or more of these ad tech tools to quash the threat," the lawsuit said. "The result: Google's plan for durable, industrywide dominance has succeeded."
The Justice Department described internal Google documents and other evidence that it believes could help prove its case. In the lawsuit, the agency said one Google advertising executive had questioned the company's market power, asking if there was "a deeper issue with us owning the platform, the exchange and a huge network" and adding that "the analogy would be if Goldman or Citibank owned the" New York Stock Exchange.
The lawsuit echoes claims made in the 2020 lawsuit backed by Texas and 14 other states and territories over Google's ad technology. That lawsuit has had a mixed reception in court. In September, a federal judge in New York ruled that some of the case could go forward, but dismissed a claim involving a deal between Google and Facebook that the states said was anticompetitive.
Google's search engine has long been its profit center, but its ad tech division has helped cement its place as a one-stop shop for advertisers. The two businesses together have given the company a powerful advantage in setting the price of online ads. Because Google's various ad tools and platforms are closely integrated, a forced divestiture could be a painful and difficult process for the company.
Alphabet, Google's parent company, is scheduled to report financial results for the fourth quarter on Feb. 2, amid a downturn in the online advertising market.
Google has added to its online advertising tools for years. Its $ 3.1 billion purchase in 2007 of DoubleClick, a maker of ad tools, amplified the reach of its already powerful digital advertising machine. DoubleClick gave Google a crucial role on the internet, providing a marketplace for publishers and letting Google host more ads on sites across the web.
At the time, Google had $ 16.6 billion in annual revenue, primarily from its search engine business. By 2021, the company's advertising technology division generated $ 31.7 billion in revenue, making it the second-largest business unit after the flagship search engine. Through the first three quarters of 2022, the unit posted $ 24.3 billion in sales.
Google has long faced accusations from online publishers that its control over the digital ads ecosystem unfairly sapped profits from the sites where the ads are displayed.
One group representing publishers, including The New York Times Company, has pushed Congress to allow the sites to negotiate the terms of ad deals collectively with Google and other online platforms. Normally, that kind of coordination would be illegal under antitrust laws. The publishers' efforts have been unsuccessful so far.
The Justice Department said that besides harming publishers and advertisers, Google's tight control of the ad tech market hurt internet users, arguing that publishers have fewer resources to create content for visitors of their websites.
On Friday, Google announced that it would lay off 12,000 employees, or 6 percent of its work force, in response to a slowdown in the digital advertising market. The company said the cuts would allow it to prioritize projects involving artificial intelligence, an area that has picked up steam in Silicon Valley in recent months.

Full text: Wall Street's major stock indexes closed mixed Tuesday, as more big companies delivered their financial results for the last three months of 2022 amid lingering concerns about a potential recession.
The S&P 500 slipped less than 0.1 percent, its second loss in three trading days. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.3 percent. Small company stocks also lost ground, with the Russell 2000 shedding 0.3 percent.
The decline for major indexes marked a reversal from Monday, when a tech company-driven rally more than made up for the S&P 500's losses last week.
Stocks have been volatile as investors try to get a better sense of how inflation is affecting the economy, the potential for a recession and whether the Federal Reserve can ease up on its aggressive interest rate increases.
The latest batch of earnings show that companies continue to struggle with the effects of inflation on consumers and supply chains.
Shares of the Post-it notes and industrial coatings maker 3M fell 6.2 percent for the biggest drop among S&P 500 stocks after the company reported weak fourth-quarter earnings and announcing job cuts. It is the latest company to announce layoffs as consumers get squeezed by inflation and worries grow about a bigger pullback in spending and a possible recession.
Union Pacific stock fell 3.3 percent after the company reported disappointing earnings and revenue.
Shares of HighPeak Energy, rose $ 1.48 to $ 28.40 after the oil and natural gas company said it was considering strategic alternatives, including a potential sale. GATX Corp rose $ 2.46 to $ 109.89 as the rail car lessor beat analysts' fourth-quarter earnings forecasts.
Shares of Microsoft rose 4 percent in after-hours trading after the software and technology giant reported earnings that topped Wall Street's forecasts. It closed down 0.2 percent in regular trading.
U.S. crude oil prices settled 1.8 percent lower.
Trading in more than a dozen companies was temporarily halted on the New York Stock Exchange after an apparent technical issue caused wide swings in their stock prices right as the market opened. Shares in Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, AT&T and other companies moved sharply at the open, triggering a halt in trading. The prices corrected after trading resumed. The NYSE says it is investigating the "reported issues" and all systems are now operational.
Markets have been swinging between hope and caution as investors watch to see if the Fed will adjust its inflation-fighting strategy. The central bank has already pulled its key overnight rate up to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent from virtually zero early last year.
The Fed will announce its next rate increase on Feb. 1 and traders expect a quarter-point raise, which would mark a softening of the central bank's pace.
"Where the market and the Fed are having a fairly violent disagreement right now is how long are they going to leave rates at around 5 percent?" said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments.
Long-term bond yields fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, fell to 3.47 percent from 3.52 percent late Monday.
Wall Street will get a few economic updates this week that could provide more insight into inflation's impact.
The government will release gross domestic product data for the fourth-quarter on Thursday. Economists expect less than 1 percent of growth, following 1.9 percent growth in the third quarter and a contraction during the first half of 2022. Investors will get more updates on personal spending and income on Friday.

U.S. Accuses Google of Abusing Monopoly in Ad Technology

WASHINGTON — The Justice Department and a group of eight states sued Google on Tuesday, accusing it of illegally abusing a monopoly over the technology that powers online advertising, in the agency’s first antitrust lawsuit against a tech giant under President Joe Biden and an escalation in legal pressure on one of the world’s biggest internet companies.
The lawsuit said Google had “corrupted legitimate competition in the ad tech industry by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the wide swath of high-tech tools used by publishers, advertisers and brokers to facilitate digital advertising.”
The lawsuit asked U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to force Google to sell much of its suite of ad technology products, which include software for buying and selling ads, a marketplace to complete the transactions and a service for showcasing the ads across the internet. The lawsuit also asked the court to stop the company from engaging in allegedly anti-competitive practices.
It is the fifth antitrust lawsuit filed by U.S. officials against Google since 2020 as lawmakers and regulators around the world try to rein in the power that big tech companies exert over information and commerce online. In Europe, Amazon, Google, Apple and others have faced antitrust investigations and charges, while regulators have passed new laws to limit social media’s harms and some practices such as data collection.
In the United States, Google has faced particular scrutiny. In 2020, a group of states led by Texas filed an antitrust lawsuit against it involving advertising technology, while the Justice Department and another group of states separately sued Google over claims that it abused its dominance over online search. In 2021, some states also sued over the company’s app store practices.
The new lawsuit “adds another important complication to Google’s efforts to deal with regulators worldwide,” said William Kovacic, a former chair of the Federal Trade Commission. “There’s a chance one or more of these challenges is going to make its way through and hit the target.”
Peter Schottenfels, a Google spokesperson, said the lawsuit “attempts to pick winners and losers in the highly competitive advertising technology sector.” It echoes the “unfounded” lawsuit led by Texas in 2020, he said, adding that the Justice Department’s latest suit makes a flawed argument that would slow innovation and harm publishers.
Attorney General Merrick Garland said monopolies “threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based.” He added, “We will aggressively protect consumers, safeguard competition and work to ensure economic fairness and opportunity for all.”
The Biden administration is trying to use uncommon legal theories to clip the wings of some of America’s largest businesses. The FTC recently asked a judge to block Meta from buying a virtual reality startup, a rare case that argues a deal could harm potential competition in a nascent market. The agency has also challenged Microsoft’s $69 billion purchase of the video game publisher Activision Blizzard, a notable action because the two companies are not primarily seen as direct competitors.
These efforts are expected to meet fierce resistance in federal courts. Judges have for decades subscribed to a view that antitrust violations should mostly be determined by whether they increase prices for consumers. But Jonathan Kanter, the chief of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, and Lina Khan, the FTC chair, have said they are willing to lose cases that allow them to stretch the boundaries of the law and that put corporate America on notice.
The lawsuit Tuesday describes a campaign by Google to monopolize advertising technology and then abuse that dominance, to the detriment of publishers, advertisers and ultimately consumers.
The Justice Department and the states, which include New York and California, said Google had built its monopoly by buying up crucial tools that delivered ads to publishers. As a result, advertisers paid more for space on the internet and publishers made less money as Google took its cut, they said.
“Each time a threat has emerged, Google has used its market power in one or more of these ad tech tools to quash the threat,” the lawsuit said. “The result: Google’s plan for durable, industrywide dominance has succeeded.”
The Justice Department described internal Google documents and other evidence that it believes could help prove its case. In the lawsuit, the agency said one Google advertising executive had questioned the company’s market power, asking if there was “a deeper issue with us owning the platform, the exchange and a huge network” and adding that “the analogy would be if Goldman or Citibank owned the” New York Stock Exchange.
The lawsuit echoes claims made in the 2020 lawsuit backed by Texas and 14 other states and territories over Google’s ad technology. That lawsuit has had a mixed reception in court. In September, a federal judge in New York ruled that some of the case could go forward but dismissed a claim involving a deal between Google and Facebook that the states said was anti-competitive.
Google’s search engine has long been its profit center, but its ad tech division has helped cement its place as a one-stop shop for advertisers. The two businesses together have given the company a powerful advantage in setting the price of online ads. Because Google’s various ad tools and platforms are closely integrated, a forced divestiture could be a painful and difficult process for the company.
Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is scheduled to report financial results for the fourth quarter on Feb. 2, amid a downturn in the online advertising market.
Google has added to its online advertising tools for years. Its $3.1 billion purchase in 2007 of DoubleClick, a maker of ad tools, amplified the reach of its already powerful digital advertising machine. DoubleClick gave Google a crucial role on the internet, providing a marketplace for publishers and letting Google host more ads on sites across the web.
At the time, Google had $16.6 billion in annual revenue, primarily from its search engine business. By 2021, the company’s advertising technology division generated $31.7 billion in revenue, making it the second-largest business unit after the flagship search engine. Through the first three quarters of 2022, the unit posted $24.3 billion in sales.
Google has long faced accusations from online publishers that its control over the digital ads ecosystem unfairly sapped profits from the sites where the ads are displayed.
One group representing publishers, including The New York Times Co., has pushed Congress to allow the sites to negotiate the terms of ad deals collectively with Google and other online platforms. Normally, that kind of coordination would be illegal under antitrust laws. The publishers’ efforts have been unsuccessful so far.
The Justice Department said that besides harming publishers and advertisers, Google’s tight control of the ad tech market hurt internet users, arguing that publishers have fewer resources to create content for visitors of their websites.
On Friday, Google announced that it would lay off 12,000 employees, or 6% of its workforce, in response to a slowdown in the digital advertising market. The company said the cuts would allow it to prioritize projects involving artificial intelligence, an area that has picked up steam in Silicon Valley in recent months.

Optimism on Rates Pushes Shares Higher: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Wall Street kicked off the week with a broad stock market rally on Monday as investors looked ahead to a busy week of company earnings reports and grew more confident that the Federal Reserve would turn the screws on the economy less aggressively.
The S&P 500 rose 1.2 percent, led by tech companies. The gains more than made up for the index's losses last week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite closed 2 percent higher. Small company stocks also rose, pushing the Russell 2000 index up 1.3 percent.
Markets have been churning for weeks with sharp swings in both directions. On one hand, they have benefited from hopes that the nation's high inflation will continue to cool and get the Federal Reserve to loosen up on its blizzard of interest rate increases. On the opposite end, they have taken hits on worries about a possible recession because of rate increases already pushed through by the Fed.
Monday's gains followed a strong Friday, when stocks rallied on comments from a Fed official seen as a signal that the central bank may raise rates by just 0.25 percentage points next week. That would be a downshift from last month's 0.50 point increase and from four straight earlier increases of 0.75 points.
Higher rates intentionally slow the economy by making it more expensive for businesses and households to borrow, so a step down would mean less added pressure. The Fed has already pulled its key overnight rate up to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent from virtually zero early last year, and traders are now betting on a nearly 99 percent probability that the Fed will raise rates by just a quarter point on Feb. 1, according to CME Group.
The bigger question is how much further the Fed will go from there, and how long it will wait before it cuts interest rates, which can act like steroids for markets. Wall Street is hoping they could arrive in the back half of this year. The Fed, meanwhile, has been adamant that it plans on holding rates high at least until 2024.
The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed movement, rose to 4.22 percent from 4.18 percent late Friday. The 10-year yield, which helps set rates for mortgages and other loans, rose to 3.52 percent from 3.48 percent.
This year's rally so far, with the S&P 500 up more than 4 percent in January already, is largely a result of how deeply pessimistic Wall Street become late last year, said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. With so many investors expecting further losses in 2023, "it was extremely lopsided," he said, "and if you get any good news, you can get a bounce."
"Have we had great news? No," Detrick said. "But most of the inflation data is improving more than most people expected, which is opening the door for the Fed to take its foot off the pedal" and take it easier on rates.
More recently, concerns have also been rising on Wall Street about the strength of profits at companies because of the slowing economy and higher expenses. That is key because profits are one of the main levers that set stock prices.
Baker Hughes, which provides services and equipment at oil fields, fell 1.5 percent in choppy trading after reporting weaker profit and revenue for its latest quarter than expected, despite analysts flagging strong orders and other encouraging signals in the report.
This week, more than seven dozen companies in the S&P 500 will report their results for the last three months of 2022, including some of the most influential. Headliners include Microsoft on Tuesday and Tesla on Wednesday.
Such big tech-oriented companies have already been announcing layoffs to cut expenses after acknowledging they misread the boom coming out of the pandemic and grew too quickly.

Spotify Joins Trend, Cutting 6% of Workers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The audio streaming platform became the latest big technology company to cut costs over worries about the economy.
Spotify, the audio streaming platform, is laying off 6 percent of its work force, or about 600 employees, joining a growing list of big tech companies that are cutting costs amid persistent worries about the global economy.
"As you are well aware, over the last few months we've made a considerable effort to rein in costs, but it simply hasn't been enough," Daniel Ek, Spotify's chief executive, said in a note to employees on Monday. The company had more than 9,800 employees at the end of the third quarter, according to regulatory filings.
The music and podcast platform is the latest technology company to lay off employees to keep expenses under control as concerns about a recession loom. Last week, Alphabet, Google's parent company, laid off 12,000 employees, and Microsoft let go of 10,000. Media companies have also been reducing their work forces. Vox Media cut 7 percent of its staff on Friday, and in December, The Washington Post told employees that there would be layoffs at the company.
The layoffs at Spotify, which is based in Stockholm, were largely due to macroeconomic challenges, Mr. Ek said in the note. "I was too ambitious in investing ahead of our revenue growth," he wrote.
The company is offering employees about five months of severance pay and health care in addition to career counseling services. Spotify will incur 35 million to 45 million euros in severance costs, the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Ek also announced some changes among Spotify's executives as part of an effort to "restructure our organization." Dawn Ostroff, the company's chief content and advertising officer, is leaving. A veteran television and video executive, she was hired in 2018 as Spotify searched for ways to expand its offerings beyond music.
As part of the reorganization, Alex Norstrom, chief business officer, and Gustav Soderstrom, chief research and development officer, will take on roles as co-presidents.

Tech Giants Roll Back a Pandemic Spree: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some of the biggest tech companies have announced tens of thousands of job cuts. But even after the layoffs, their work forces are still behemoths.
For a stretch of the pandemic, tech companies couldn't hire fast enough. Talent wars broke out in Silicon Valley, with firms vying for software engineers, often lavishing extravagant perks on their new and would-be hires. As profits soared, executives acted as if the party would never end.
Now, it has -- and workers are bearing the brunt of pullbacks. Nearly 200,000 tech employees have been laid off since the start of 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks job cuts in the sector. Four of the largest tech companies -- Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft -- have announced a total of more than 50,000 job cuts in recent months.
But even after significant cuts, the largest tech companies are still behemoths. They grew enormously during the pandemic, adding tens of thousands of workers. The layoffs announced in recent weeks reverse a fraction of the hiring done in recent years.
In announcing the layoffs to employees, executives struck notably apologetic tones, expressing regrets about overzealous expansion and rapid hiring. The executives pointed to economic factors, made worse by inflation and rising interest rates. But they are also admitting that they over-hired, misreading the durability of the pandemic acceleration in the growth of online services.
1.54 million employees -- 18,000 layoffs = 1.2% of work force*
*Since the end of 2019, the company has grown by 728,000 people.
"As part of our annual planning process for 2023, leaders across the company have been working with their teams and looking at their work force levels, investments they want to make in the future, and prioritizing what matters most to customers and the long-term health of our businesses. This year's review has been more difficult given the uncertain economy and that we've hired rapidly over the last several years."
-- Andy Jassy, chief executive, Jan. 4
186,779 employees -- 12,000 layoffs = 6.4% of work force
"I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us here. Over the past two years we've seen periods of dramatic growth. To match and fuel that growth, we hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today."
-- Sundar Pichai, chief executive, Jan. 20
87,314 employees -- 11,000 layoffs = 12.6% of work force
"At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected."
-- Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive, Nov. 9
221,000 employees -- 10,000 layoffs = 4.5% of work force
"We're living through times of significant change, and as I meet with customers and partners, a few things are clear. First, as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we're now seeing them optimize their digital spend to do more with less."
-- Satya Nadella, chief executive, Jan. 18

Full text: Deepfake technology -- software that allows people to swap faces, voices and other characteristics to create digital forgeries -- has been used in recent years to make a synthetic substitute of Elon Musk that shilled a cryptocurrency scam, to digitally "undress" more than 100,000 women on Telegram and to steal millions of dollars from companies by mimicking their executives' voices on the phone.
In most of the world, the authorities can't do much about it. Even as the software grows more sophisticated and accessible, few laws exist to manage its spread.
China hopes to be the exception. This month, the country adopted expansive rules requiring that manipulated material have the subject's consent and bear digital signatures or watermarks, and that deepfake service providers offer ways to "refute rumors."
But China faces the same hurdles that have stymied other efforts to govern deepfakes: The worst abusers of the technology tend to be the hardest to catch, operating anonymously, adapting quickly and sharing their synthetic creations through borderless online platforms. China's move has also highlighted another reason that few countries have adopted rules: Many people worry that the government could use the rules to curtail free speech.
But simply by forging ahead with its mandates, tech experts said, Beijing could influence how other governments deal with the machine learning and artificial intelligence that power deepfake technology. With limited precedent in the field, lawmakers around the world are looking for test cases to mimic or reject.
"The A.I. scene is an interesting place for global politics, because countries are competing with one another on who's going to set the tone," said Ravit Dotan, a postdoctoral researcher who runs the Collaborative A.I. Responsibility Lab at the University of Pittsburgh. "We know that laws are coming, but we don't know what they are yet, so there's a lot of unpredictability."
Deepfakes hold great promise in many industries. Last year, the Dutch police revived a 2003 cold case by creating a digital avatar of the 13-year-old murder victim and publicizing footage of him walking through a group of his family and friends in the present day. The technology is also used for parody and satire, for online shoppers trying on clothes in virtual fitting rooms, for dynamic museum dioramas and for actors hoping to speak multiple languages in international movie releases. Researchers at the M.I.T. Media Lab and UNICEF used similar techniques to study empathy by transforming images of North American and European cities into the battle-scarred landscapes caused by the Syrian war.
But problematic applications are also plentiful. Legal experts worry that deepfakes could be misused to erode trust in surveillance videos, body cameras and other evidence. (A doctored recording submitted in a British child custody case in 2019 appeared to show a parent making violent threats, according to the parent's lawyer.) Digital forgeries could discredit or incite violence against police officers, or send them on wild goose chases. The Department of Homeland Security has also identified risks including cyberbullying, blackmail, stock manipulation and political instability.
Some experts predict that as much as 90 percent of online content could be synthetically generated within a few years.
The increasing volume of deepfakes could lead to a situation where "citizens no longer have a shared reality, or could create societal confusion about which information sources are reliable; a situation sometimes referred to as 'information apocalypse' or 'reality apathy,"' the European law enforcement agency Europol wrote in a report last year.
British officials last year cited threats such as a website that "virtually strips women naked" and that was visited 38 million times in the first eight months of 2021. But there and in the European Union, proposals to set guardrails for the technology have yet to become law.
Attempts in the United States to create a federal task force to examine deepfake technology have stalled. Representative Yvette D. Clarke, a New York Democrat, proposed a bill in 2019 and again in 2021 -- the Defending Each and Every Person From False Appearances by Keeping Exploitation Subject to Accountability Act -- that has yet to come to a vote. She said she planned to reintroduce the bill this year.
Ms. Clarke said her bill, which would require deepfakes to bear watermarks or identifying labels, was "a protective measure." By contrast, she described the new Chinese rules as "more of a control mechanism."
"Many of the sophisticated civil societies recognize how this can be weaponized and destructive," she said, adding that the United States should be bolder in setting its own standards rather than trailing another front-runner.
"We don't want the Chinese eating our lunch in the tech space at all," Ms. Clarke said. "We want to be able to set the baseline for our expectations around the tech industry, around consumer protections in that space."
But law enforcement officials have said the industry is still unable to detect deepfakes and struggles to manage malicious uses of the technology. A lawyer in California wrote in a law journal in 2021 that certain deepfake rules had "an almost insurmountable feasibility problem" and were "functionally unenforceable" because (usually anonymous) abusers can easily cover their tracks.
The rules that do exist in the United States are largely aimed at political or pornographic deepfakes. Marc Berman, a Democrat in California's State Assembly who represents parts of Silicon Valley and has sponsored such legislation, said he was unaware of any efforts to enforce his laws via lawsuits or fines. But he said that, in deference to one of his laws, a deepfaking app had removed the ability to mimic President Donald J. Trump before the 2020 election.
Only a handful of other states, including New York, restrict deepfake pornography. While running for re-election in 2019, Houston's mayor said a critical ad from a fellow candidate broke a Texas law that bans certain misleading political deepfakes.
"Half of the value is causing more people to be a little bit more skeptical about what they're seeing on a social media platforms and encourage folks not to take everything at face value," Mr. Berman said.
But even as technology experts, lawmakers and victims call for stronger protections, they also urge caution. Deepfake laws, they said, risk being both overreaching but also toothless. Forcing labels or disclaimers onto deepfakes designed as valid commentary on politics or culture could also make the content appear less trustworthy, they added.
Digital rights groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation are pushing legislators to relinquish deepfake policing to tech companies, or to use an existing legal framework that addresses issues such as fraud, copyright infringement, obscenity and defamation.
"That's the best remedy against harms, rather than the governmental interference, which in its implementation is almost always going to capture material that is not harmful, that chills people from legitimate, productive speech," said David Greene, a civil liberties lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
Several months ago, Google began prohibiting people from using its Colaboratory platform, a data analysis tool, to train A.I. systems to generate deepfakes. In the fall, the company behind Stable Diffusion, an image-generating tool, launched an update that hamstrings users trying to create nude and pornographic content, according to The Verge. Meta, TikTok, YouTube and Reddit ban deepfakes that are intended to be misleading.
But laws or bans may struggle to contain a technology that is designed to continually adapt and improve. Last year, researchers from the RAND Corporation demonstrated how difficult deepfakes can be to identify when they showed a set of videos to more than 3,000 test subjects and asked them to identify the ones that were manipulated (such as a deepfake of the climate activist Greta Thunberg disavowing the existence of climate change).
The group was wrong more than a third of the time. Even a subset of several dozen students studying machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University were wrong more than 20 percent of the time.
Initiatives from companies such as Microsoft and Adobe now try to authenticate media and train moderation technology to recognize the inconsistencies that mark synthetic content. But they are in a constant struggle to outpace deepfake creators who often discover new ways to fix defects, remove watermarks and alter metadata to cover their tracks.
"There is a technological arms race between deepfake creators and deepfake detectors," said Jared Mondschein, a physical scientist at RAND. "Until we start coming up with ways to better detect deepfakes, it'll be really hard for any amount of legislation to have any teeth."

The Week in Business: The Debt Limit and Politics: [Money and Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: What's Up? (Jan. 15-21)
The U.S. Hits Its Debt Ceiling
The United States hit its borrowing cap of $ 31.4 trillion on Thursday, setting the stage for a bitter fiscal fight in Congress over raising the limit. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said the government would take "extraordinary measures," at least until early June, to keep paying its bills. Democrats and the White House, as well as forecasters and economists, have warned that the nation risks a financial crisis and other dire economic scenarios if lawmakers do not raise the limit before the Treasury Department exhausts its ability to buy more time. But Republicans have said that they will not raise the borrowing limit again unless President Biden agrees to steep cuts in federal spending.
"Samcoins" and FTX's Final Days
As the government continues building a case against the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, more details are emerging about the workings of the exchange. Rivals said that Mr. Bankman-Fried often promoted digital currencies, known as "Samcoins." Mr. Bankman-Fried was said to use his influence to persuade people to buy large quantities of the coins, inflating their value artificially, to make his crypto trading firm, Alameda Research, look healthier than it really was. (Mr. Bankman-Fried has denied accusations that he tried to manipulate cryptocurrency markets.) Also, documents obtained by The New York Times show that FTX executives voiced concerns over the use of customer funds in the weeks leading up to the collapse of the firm.
More Layoffs in Big Tech
Two of the tech industry's biggest players announced last week that they would be cutting thousands of jobs. Microsoft said on Wednesday that it would lay off about 10,000 workers, and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said on Friday that it would lay off 12,000 employees. Across the tech industry, employers are pulling back after several years of frenetic hiring to meet the pandemic-fueled surge in online services. Nearly 200,000 tech workers have lost their jobs since the start of 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks job cuts in the sector. Even the industry's power players have been affected: Apple is the only major firm that has not yet announced significant cuts. Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, said at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last week that "quite frankly, we in the tech industry will also have to get efficient."
What's Next? (Jan. 22-28)
Initial Estimates of Economic Growth
The Bureau of Economic Analysis will release on Thursday initial estimates of economic growth in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2022. The report on gross domestic product is likely to show that economic output, adjusted for inflation, increased at an annual rate of 1.5 percent in the quarter, according to predictions from forecasters. That would represent a slowdown from the rate of 3.2 percent in the third quarter. The Federal Reserve's campaign to rein in inflation by raising interest rates is taking a toll on the economy, especially the housing market. Although consumer spending has slowed, the economy has shown surprising resilience after contracting in the first half of last year.
The Holidays and the Airlines
The major airlines are in the midst of reporting their earnings, which will show how their bottom lines in the fourth quarter were affected by a holiday season marred by cancellations and storms. The carriers suffered further woes this month, when a Federal Aviation Administration system outage halted flights. Most of the attention will be on Southwest because of its meltdown over the holidays. Southwest will release earnings on Thursday, along with American, JetBlue and Alaska. Delta and United, which released their earnings last week, surprised analysts with strong fourth-quarter results. Both companies expressed optimism about the months ahead.
Slower Spending?
Though many consumer-focused business have done reasonably well over the past year, cracks are beginning to show. Companies have passed on rising energy, transportation and labor costs to consumers, and until recently, consumers have paid the higher prices. Inflation has moderated some. But the holiday season showed that consumers may finally be pushing back. Retail sales fell in December, following a decline in November. Procter & Gamble's annual sales dropped last quarter for the first time in over five years. The company, which makes products like Tide detergent, Head & Shoulders shampoo and Charmin toilet paper, said that its sales dropped 1 percent in the three months through December, compared with the same period a year earlier. The sales volume, or amount of goods consumers bought, also fell 6 percent. The shift came as the company increased prices 10 percent last quarter from a year earlier.
What Else?
The price of bitcoin rallied. California joined other states in suing major drug companies over the price of insulin. Reed Hastings, a founder of Netflix, cedes his co-chief executive title to become the company's executive chairman. Tax filing season begins on Monday.

The Era of Happy Tech Workers Is Over: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Silicon Valley as we know it -- with its radically transparent company cultures, empowered employees, flat hierarchies and rarefied perks like nap pods and free food -- is quickly disappearing. And it's unlikely to return.
For nearly two decades, tech companies heralded an approach that centered on making workers happy with benefits that were intended to seamlessly integrate work and life. They made well-being programs and unlimited vacation, initiatives that prioritized the whole person, standard employee benefits. This, along with high salaries and equity packages, was a way not just to win but also to dominate the war for talent. The rapid growth and success of Silicon Valley companies, driven in part by their unique people practices, reimagined workplace culture for a generation.
Times, as they say, are a-changin'. The industry is facing an uneven macroeconomic environment and a roiling stock market that is putting pressure on public tech companies and making for a less-than-ideal I.P.O. environment for private ones. Tech chief executives are now optimizing more for profitability than for growth at all costs, sometimes at the expense of long-held organizational beliefs.
The shift is most evident in the recent surge of tech layoffs. There has been lots of public discussion about the disruptive axing of half of Twitter's 7,500 employees, a move conducted under its new owner, Elon Musk. Haphazard and rolling, the layoffs were painful to watch. The employees who remained have had to endure greater workloads on significantly smaller teams. But while outsiders may have viewed these layoffs as impulsive, they seemed to have primed the environment for other tech companies to follow. In 2022, the tech industry laid off over 150,000 people. In the first few weeks of 2023, Microsoft announced 10,000 job cuts and Alphabet followed with 12,000.
According to multiple media outlets, Meta and Amazon use stack ranking for their employees, a controversial approach in evaluating talent. Popularized by G.E. in the 1980s (though the company later abandoned it), the process has managers rate their employees on a forced curve. Generally, only 20 percent are deemed top talent, and 10 to 15 percent must be designated as low performers. Although there are benefits, even in the best of times, the practice can create a competitive work environment that de-emphasizes employee improvement. With impending layoffs, people with the lowest ranking are typically the first to go.
The layoffs are part of a new age of bossism, the notion that management has given up too much control and must wrest it back from employees. After two decades of fighting for talent, chief executives are using this period to adjust for years of management indulgence that left them with a generation of entitled workers.
In 2012, to spur innovation and drive engagement, LinkedIn began the incubator program. A perk that encouraged employees to come up with approved ideas that they could work on full time for up to three months was generous even by Silicon Valley standards. Then there were the many lavish events that served to put a company's culture on display. It was par for the course for employees to attend elaborately themed holiday parties featuring the next new Instagrammable experience. If you happened to work at Uber in 2015 and attended its corporate event in Las Vegas, you were treated to a private performance from Beyoncé.
Executives across industries are leaning into their newfound bossism and ending pandemic-era work arrangements and incentives. Reed Hastings, Netflix's co-founder and co-C.E.O., said near the start of the pandemic that he didn't "see any positives" in working from home, and the company apparently allows only some remote work. TikTok reportedly told employees that it was sunsetting gym membership and Wi-Fi reimbursements as well as its $ 45 daily meal stipends to workers not tied to the company's main hubs, in its own efforts at restraint. These changes are bellwethers.
Not all tech employees see these shifts as signals. I recently spoke with a product marketing manager from Meta who was laid off. I assumed that she would be apprehensive about her job prospects; instead, armed with three months' severance and decent savings, she remains optimistic. With nearly 79 percent of software engineers and nearly 76 percent of marketers who were laid off in tech finding jobs within three months, her optimism isn't necessarily unfounded.
However, a few things are true now that make the shift in tech employee culture not just a moment in time but also a redefinition of how tech companies will be run.
Meta and Salesforce combined lost more than $ 700 billion in market cap last year. Both companies are now dealing with activist investors who have taken prominent positions in their stocks. The activists have called for the companies to slash costs, reduce nonstrategic investments and, notably in Meta's case, aggressively reduce its work force. Managers have less capacity to overhire and invest in employee initiatives that aren't tied directly to business execution.
For tech start-ups and founder-C.E.O.s, the past 10 years were a bull run. Interest rates were low, venture funding seemed limitless and valuations skyrocketed. With money being essentially free, founder-C.E.O.s dived in -- pursuing revenue, increasing their customer bases and investing in myriad people and projects.
However, with recent interest rates the highest they have been since late 2007 and continuing market uncertainty, investors are considering more investments in companies with strong fundamentals and cash flows. For founder-C.E.O.s, this means it will be harder to raise funding, and investors will have an even greater expectation of return on their money. For large tech companies and start-ups alike, cash is no longer free, and employee investments must pay off.
We are entering an era of external investor pressure, higher financing hurdles and overall market volatility. This environment calls for management to make structural changes in the way workplace culture is experienced for both labor and capital.
The current tech work force is used to every voice getting a vote, and it will now have to yield to a new world -- one with heightened expectations and disciplined investment. Not considering the winds of change will put the careers of many empowered workers at risk.

Vox Media To Cut Staff By 7 Percent Amid Worries: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The company, which publishes New York magazine, The Verge and numerous other brands, joins a parade of tech and media companies cutting back staff amid economic uncertainty.
Vox Media, which owns brands like The Verge, SB Nation and New York magazine, said on Friday that it would cut about 7 percent of its staff, joining a parade of tech and media companies laying off workers amid economic uncertainty.
In a morning email to the staff, Jim Bankoff, Vox's chief executive, said the company needed to become smaller in the face of a downturn, adding that the company had already reduced its spending and frozen new hiring.
"Unfortunately, in this economic climate, we're not able to sustain projects and areas of the business that have not performed as anticipated, are less core to where we see the biggest opportunities in the coming years, or where we don't have enough rationale to support ongoing investment in what could be a prolonged downturn," he wrote.
Mr. Bankoff did not disclose whether the cuts would come from all of the company's brands, but said the affected teams included revenue, editorial, operations and core services. The company has about 1,900 employees, a spokeswoman for Vox Media said. She declined to comment further on the cuts.
Mr. Bankoff said staff whose roles had been eliminated would be notified on Friday, and senior leadership would soon provide more details on the extent of the layoffs.
Mr. Bankoff said the company was "fundamentally strong," adding, "These setbacks are driven primarily by the temporal macroeconomic forces that are impacting nearly all businesses in our sector."
The Vox Media Union said in a statement, "We're furious at the way the company has approached these layoffs, and are currently discussing how to best serve those who just lost their jobs."
Last year, Vox Media merged with Group Nine, the publisher of lifestyle websites like PopSugar and Thrillist, to become one of the country's largest digital media companies. It cut about 3 percent of its work force in March after the merger, and another 39 workers in July. The deal was part of a wave of consolidation in the industry in the past few years as publishers sought to expand so they could better compete for online ad revenues.
But ad spending across the sector has fallen in recent months as the economy has slowed. Media and tech industries have experienced mass layoffs as companies try to cut costs.
CNN and Gannett laid off hundreds of workers at the end of last year. The publisher of The Washington Post announced a plan for layoffs in December. Tech behemoths like Amazon, Microsoft and Google and have recently said they would cut thousands of jobs.

Layoffs in Tech Reveal a Divide Of Generations: [National Desk]

Full text: The industry's recent job cuts have been an awakening for a generation of workers who have never experienced a cyclical crash.
When Lyft laid off 13 percent of its workers in November, Kelly Chang was shocked to find herself among the 700 people who lost their jobs at the San Francisco company.
"It seemed like tech companies had so much opportunity," said Ms. Chang, 26. "If you got a job, you made it. It was a sustainable path."
Brian Pulliam, on the other hand, brushed off the news that the crypto exchange Coinbase was eliminating his job. Ever since the 48-year-old engineer was laid off from his first job at the video game company Atari in 2003, he said, he has asked himself once a year: "If I were laid off, what would I do?"
The contrast between Ms. Chang's and Mr. Pulliam's reactions to their professional letdowns speaks to a generational divide that is becoming more clear as the tech industry, which expanded rapidly through the pandemic, swings toward mass layoffs.
Microsoft said this week that it planned to cut 10,000 jobs, or roughly 5 percent of its work force. And on Friday morning, Google's parent company, Alphabet, said it planned to cut 12,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of its total. Their cuts followed big layoffs at other tech companies like Meta, Amazon and Salesforce.
Millennials and Generation Z, born between 1981 and 2012, started tech careers during a decade-long expansion when jobs multiplied as fast as iPhone sales. The companies they joined were conquering the world and defying economic rules. And when they went to work at outfits that offered bus rides to the office and amenities like free food and laundry, they weren't just taking on a new job -- they were taking on a lifestyle. Few of them had experienced widespread layoffs.
Baby boomers and members of Generation X, born between 1946 and 1980, on the other hand, lived through the biggest contraction the industry has ever seen. The dot-com crash of the early 2000s eliminated more than one million jobs, emptying Silicon Valley's Highway 101 of commuters as many companies folded overnight.
"It was a blood bath, and it went on for years," said Jason DeMorrow, a software engineer who was laid off twice in 18 months and was out of work for more than six months. "As concerning as the current downturn is, and as much as I empathize with the people impacted, there's no comparison."
Tech's generational divide is representative of a broader phenomenon. The year someone is born has a big influence on views about work and money. Early personal experiences strongly determine a person's appetite for financial risk, according to a 2011 study by the economists Ulrike Malmendier of the University of California, Berkeley, and Stefan Nagel of the University of Chicago.
The study, which analyzed the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances from 1960 to 2007, found that people who came of age in the 1970s, when the stock market stagnated, were reluctant to invest in the early 1980s, when it roared. That trend reversed in the 1990s.
"Once you experience your first crash, things change," Professor Nagel said. "You realize bad stuff happens and maybe you should be a bit more cautious."
For Gen X, the dot-com collapse hit early in careers. From 2001 to 2005, the tech sector shed a quarter of its workers, according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data by CompTIA, a technology education and research organization.
The layoffs that swept the industry were worse than the recession of the early 1990s, when total jobs in the tech sector fell by 5 percent, and the global financial crisis in 2008, when the work force contracted by 6 percent.
In 2011, the tech sector began a hiring boom that would last a decade. It added an average of more than 100,000 jobs annually, and by 2021, it had recouped all the jobs it lost when the dot-com bubble burst.
The job figures account for software, hardware, tech services and telecommunications companies, including Apple, Meta, Nvidia and Salesforce. But they may exclude some tech-related companies, such as Airbnb, Lyft and Uber, because of ambiguity in government labor market reporting that classifies some businesses as consumer services, said Tim Herbert, chief research officer at CompTIA.
The biggest job increases in tech came after the pandemic started, as companies rushed to fulfill surging demand. In 2022, the sector added nearly 260,000 jobs, according to CompTIA, the most it had added in a single year since 2000.
Tech's job increases continued last year even as big layoffs started, though it is unclear if that trend has stretched into this year. New job opportunities were a factor as nearly 80 percent of laid-off tech workers said they had found a new job within three months, according to a survey by ZipRecruiter.
"We're seeing the hiring mania of the pandemic being corrected for -- not the popping of a bubble," said Andy Challenger, senior vice president of the career transition firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
Last fall, David Hayden, a program manager with a doctorate in physics, learned from his manager that he would be let go from nLight, a semiconductor company. Worried about how he would pay his eldest daughter's college tuition, he immediately reached out to recruiters to line up interviews. In December, a month after being let go, he started a position at Lattice Semiconductor.
In each interview, Mr. Hayden, 56, volunteered that he had been laid off, he said. His experience during the dot-com crash, when he avoided layoffs even as talented colleagues were let go, taught him that cuts aren't always rational.
"The shame of being laid off is gone," Mr. Hayden said. "Companies know that a lot of good people are being let go right now."
For Mr. Pulliam, losing his job at Coinbase was an opportunity. He funneled his severance money into his own business, Refactor Coaching, a career coaching service for software engineers.
"This is a gift," Mr. Pulliam said. "I don't think that story is told. It's always doom and gloom."
But for tech workers experiencing their first economic downturn, the cuts have been eye opening. Ms. Chang studied product design in college with an eye toward joining a tech industry that seemed recession proof. Being laid off from Lyft shook that faith.
Erin Sumner, a software recruiter at Facebook's parent company, Meta, used to brag to potential hires that the company had been the fastest ever to be valued at $ 1 trillion. She said she would promote the company's strengths, even last year as its stock price tumbled and its core business, digital advertising, struggled.
When rumors of layoffs began to circulate last year, she assured colleagues that their jobs were safe, pointing to the more than $ 40 billion in cash the company had in the bank. But in November, she was among 11,000 workers laid off.
"It was gut-wrenching," Ms. Sumner, 32, said. She has found a new job as the head recruiter for DeleteMe, a start-up that aims to remove a customer's information from search results. But she said she cringed each time she read about more tech layoffs.
"I fear it's going to get worse before it gets better," Ms. Sumner said. "There's no guarantee. I got laid off by the most secure company in the world."
A similar reversal of fortune has challenged businesses selling software services. Shares of Salesforce, an industry leader, fell nearly 50 percent last year as its sales growth slowed. The company had splurged during the pandemic, spending $ 28 billion to buy Slack Technologies. It swelled to 80,000 employees from 49,000 in two years.
During an all-hands meeting last week to discuss the company's decision to lay off 10 percent of its workers, Marc Benioff, the chief executive, tried to sympathize with his unhappy staff by putting the cuts in context.
"I've been through a lot of difficult times in this company. Every loss reawakens another loss for me," he said, according to a recording of the call heard by The New York Times. "Obviously, we're talking about a layoff. I think about employees who have died. I think about people we've lost that we never wanted to lose."
Asked what advice he had for employees who were anxious about the state of the company and further layoffs, Mr. Benioff suggested "gratitude."
Austin Bedford learned that he was one of about 8,000 people being let go from Salesforce when he tried to log on to his computer and had no access to Slack, the tool that he worked on as a conversation designer. A native of East Palo Alto, Calif., he studied computer design because he hoped to join one of profitable companies in his backyard. The job he landed at the company in 2021 fulfilled a dream. He never imagined he would lose it so soon.
"I was shocked," said Mr. Bedford, 41.
Though disappointed that he was laid off, he said he was trying to view being out of work as a "blessing in disguise" and intended to be selective about his next job.
"There's something bright around the corner," Mr. Bedford said. "I just need to have faith."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The layoffs amount to about 6 percent of the global work force at the company, the latest tech giant to make cuts after a pandemic hiring spree.
Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said on Friday that it planned to cut 12,000 jobs, becoming the latest technology company to reduce its work force because of concerns about a broader economic slowdown, after a hiring spree during the pandemic.
The job cuts are the company's largest ever, amounting to about 6 percent of its global work force. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive, said Alphabet had expanded too rapidly during the pandemic, when demand for digital services boomed, and must refocus on products and technology core to its future, like artificial intelligence.
"We hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today," Mr. Pichai said in a note to employees posted on the company's website.
Google joins a list of technology companies that have laid off workers after concluding they overextended under the belief that the pandemic-fueled boom represented a new normal. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce and Twitter are among others that have announced thousands of job cuts.
Technology firms have cut more than 190,000 jobs since the start of 2022, according to Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks the industry.
The moves mark the end of a period of rapid expansion in the technology industry, which battled for employees with lavish perks and high pay. Google, started in 1998, helped define a work culture that influenced corporations far beyond Silicon Valley.
Alphabet, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., had nearly 187,000 employees at the end of September, up from about 150,000 a year earlier.
In a note titled "A difficult decision to set us up for the future," Mr. Pichai said the job cuts would run across product areas, job responsibilities and locations. That future includes increased competition from rivals offering new ways to search for information on the internet; ChatGPT, a popular chatbot created by OpenAI, has dazzled users by providing clearly written answers to questions and queries.
"These are important moments to sharpen our focus, re-engineer our cost base and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities," Mr. Pichai said. "Being constrained in some areas allows us to bet big on others."
Last month, Google declared a "code red" in response to ChatGPT, with Mr. Pichai upending existing projects to concentrate on the field of artificial intelligence. With the job cuts, Google chipped away at efforts that are lower priorities.
Google Research, a pillar of the A.I. initiatives, cut roles in areas that have gotten less traction, including health care, according to an email that Jeff Dean, the senior vice president for research, health and A.I., sent to his employees. The company plans to streamline its investments in Google for Clinicians, a tool for health care providers. Google and Alphabet also consolidated robotics efforts, Mr. Dean added.
Google Cloud, which has hired at a breakneck pace over the last several years, also saw cuts. "Today's news primarily impacted positions that were non-customer facing, non-engineering and operational in nature," Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud's chief executive, wrote in an email to employees. He added that the division would continue to hire in strategic areas, including product development and customer-related roles, to bolster its growth.
X, Alphabet's "moonshot factory," which incubates new companies, fired members of its strategy and business operations team, said two people with knowledge of the cuts, who were not authorized to discuss them. Many of the companies that were created in X have struggled to generate significant revenue and become profitable.
There were reductions in other parts of the company. Google fired 16 percent of its Fuchsia team, which had about 400 people working on operating systems for the company's home devices, one person said. A team in data center maintenance experienced cuts. Other engineers, user-experience researchers and product designers were also affected.
Even as Alphabet and other tech giants trim their work forces and pledge to become more efficient, they remain hugely profitable. In 2021, Alphabet had profit of $ 76 billion and revenue of nearly $ 258 billion.
The Alphabet Workers Union, which represents 1,100 members, criticized the cuts.
"With billions in profits and executive compensation untouched, our jobs should not be on the chopping block," Parul Koul, the union's executive chair, said in a statement.
But the technology industry has not been immune from rising interest rates and a slumping global economy. As the advertising market struggles and companies buy fewer ads on Google's search engine or on YouTube, which Google owns, Alphabet's bottom line took a hit. The company's cloud computing business has continued to trail Amazon and Microsoft. In October, Alphabet said quarterly net profit had fallen 27 percent.
Wall Street analysts hailed Alphabet's move. Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI wrote in a research note that the job cuts were a necessary step to preserve profit. After the cuts were announced Friday, Alphabet's stock price rose more than 5 percent. The company will report its financial results for 2022 on Feb. 2.
Many employees at Google had been bracing for cuts as other large tech firms announced job losses. The closure of some small offices, and the release of a new employee evaluation system that was seen as a way to identify underperformers, signaled to many workers that the company was preparing for layoffs.
The layoffs were announced in the middle of the night in the United States, while many of the affected employees were asleep. They awoke to text messages, news stories and, in some cases, the realization that they no longer had access to Google's corporate systems.
Chewy Shaw, a site reliability engineer for YouTube who was let go on Friday, said the scale and speed of the layoffs was infuriating. "The authorities on high can come down at any surprising moment and just snap their finger and you're gone," Mr. Shaw said.
Alphabet said U.S. employees would receive a severance package that included 16 weeks of salary, plus two weeks of extra pay for every year they had worked at Google. Laid-off workers will receive six months of paid health care. Compensation for workers outside the United States will be determined by local labor laws, the company said.

Google Calls in Help From Larry Page and Sergey Brin for AI Fight

SAN FRANCISCO — Last month, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s founders, held several meetings with company executives. The topic: a rival’s new chatbot, a clever artificial intelligence product that looked as if it could be the first notable threat in decades to Google’s $149 billion search business.
Page and Brin, who had not spent much time at Google since they left their daily roles with the company in 2019, reviewed Google’s AI product strategy, according to two people with knowledge of the meetings who were not allowed to discuss them. They approved plans and pitched ideas to put more chatbot features into Google’s search engine. And they offered advice to company leaders, who have put AI front and center in their plans.
The re-engagement of Google’s founders, at the invitation of the company’s current CEO, Sundar Pichai, emphasized the urgency felt among many Google executives about AI and that chatbot, ChatGPT.
The bot, which was released by the small San Francisco company OpenAI two months ago, amazed users by simply explaining complex concepts and generating ideas from scratch. More important to Google, it looked as if it could offer a new way to search for information on the internet.
The new AI technology has shaken Google out of its routine. Pichai declared a “code red,” upending existing plans and jump-starting AI development. Google now intends to unveil more than 20 new products and demonstrate a version of its search engine with chatbot features this year, according to a slide presentation reviewed by The New York Times and two people with knowledge of the plans who were not authorized to discuss them.
At the same time, Alphabet is scaling back its workforce. On Friday, the company said it would cut about 12,000 jobs after a hiring spree during the pandemic and amid concerns of a slowing economy. The layoffs were designed “to ensure that our people and roles are aligned with our highest priorities as a company,” Pichai wrote in a note to employees.
“This is a moment of significant vulnerability for Google,” said D. Sivakumar, a former Google research director who helped found a startup called Tonita, which makes search technology for e-commerce companies. “ChatGPT has put a stake in the ground, saying, ‘Here’s what a compelling new search experience could look like.’” Sivakumar added that Google had overcome previous challenges and could deploy its arsenal of AI to stay competitive.
Since stepping back from day-to-day duties, Page and Brin have taken a laissez-faire approach to Google, two people familiar with the matter said. They have let Pichai run the company and its parent company, Alphabet, while they have pursued other projects, such as flying-car startups and disaster-relief efforts.
Their visits to the company’s Silicon Valley offices in the past few years have mostly been to check in on the so-called moonshot projects that Alphabet calls “Other Bets,” one person said. Until recently, they have not been very involved with the search engine.
But they have long been keen on bringing AI into Google’s products. Vic Gundotra, a former senior vice president at Google, recounted that he gave Page a demonstration of a new Gmail feature around 2008. But Page was unimpressed by the effort, asking, “Why can’t it automatically write that email for you?” In 2014, Google also acquired DeepMind, a leading AI research lab based in London.
Google’s Advanced Technology Review Council, a panel of executives that includes Jeff Dean, the company’s senior vice president of research and artificial intelligence, and Kent Walker, Google’s president of global affairs and chief legal officer, met less than two weeks after ChatGPT debuted to discuss their company’s initiatives, according to the slide presentation.
They reviewed plans for products that were expected to debut at Google’s company conference in May, including Image Generation Studio, which creates and edits images, and a third version of AI Test Kitchen, an experimental app for testing product prototypes.
Other image and video projects in the works included a feature called Shopping Try-on, a YouTube green-screen feature to create backgrounds; a wallpaper maker for the Pixel smartphone; an application called Maya that visualizes 3D shoes; and a tool that could summarize videos by generating a new one, according to the slides.
Google has a list of AI programs it plans to offer software developers and other companies, including image-creation technology, which could bolster revenue to Google’s Cloud division. There are also tools to help other businesses create their own AI prototypes in internet browsers, called MakerSuite, which will have two “Pro” versions, according to the presentation.
In May, Google also expects to announce a tool to make it easier to build apps for Android smartphones, called Colab + Android Studio, that will generate, complete and fix code, according to the presentation. Another code generation and completion tool, called PaLM-Coder 2, has also been in the works.
Google executives hope to reassert their company’s status as a pioneer of AI. The company aggressively worked on AI over the past decade and already has offered to a small number of people a chatbot that could rival ChatGPT, called LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications.
“We continue to test our AI technology internally to make sure it’s helpful and safe, and we look forward to sharing more experiences externally soon,” Lily Lin, a spokesperson for Google, said in a statement. She added that AI would benefit individuals, businesses and communities and that Google is considering the broader societal effects of the technology.
Google, OpenAI and others develop their AI with so-called large language models that rely on online information, so they can sometimes share false statements and show racist, sexist and other biased attitudes.
That had been enough to make companies cautious about offering the technology to the public. But several new companies, including You.com and Perplexity.ai, are already offering online search engines that let you ask questions through an online chatbot, much like ChatGPT. Microsoft is also working on a new version of its Bing search engine that would include similar technology, according to a report from The Information.
Pichai has tried to accelerate product approval reviews, according to the presentation reviewed by the Times. The company established a fast-track review process called the “Green Lane” initiative, pushing groups of employees who try to ensure that technology is fair and ethical to more quickly approve its upcoming AI technology.
The company will also find ways for teams developing AI to conduct their own reviews, and it will “recalibrate” the level of risk it is willing to take when releasing the technology, according to the presentation.
The consequences of Google’s more streamlined approach are not yet clear. Its technology has lagged OpenAI’s self-reported metrics when it comes to identifying content that is hateful, toxic, sexual or violent, according to an analysis that Google compiled. In each category, OpenAI bested Google tools, which also fell short of human accuracy in assessing content.
Google listed copyright, privacy and antitrust as the primary risks of the technology in the slide presentation. It said that actions, such as filtering answers to weed out copyrighted material and stopping AI from sharing personally identifiable information, are needed to reduce those risks.
For the chatbot search demonstration that Google plans for this year, getting facts right, ensuring safety and getting rid of misinformation are priorities. For other upcoming services and products, the company has a lower bar and will try to curb issues relating to hate and toxicity, danger and misinformation rather than preventing them, according to the presentation.
The company intends, for example, to block certain words to avoid hate speech and will try to minimize other potential issues.
Google expects governments to scrutinize its AI products for signs of these issues. The company has recently been the subject of numerous government inquiries and lawsuits accusing it of anti-competitive business practices. It anticipates, according to the presentation, “increased pressure on Al regulatory efforts because of rising concerns about misinformation, harmful content, bias, copyright.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Google executives hope to reassert their company's status as a pioneer of A.I. The company aggressively worked on A.I. over the last decade and already has offered to a small number of people a chatbot that could rival ChatGPT, called LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications.
"We continue to test our A.I. technology internally to make sure it's helpful and safe, and we look forward to sharing more experiences externally soon," Lily Lin, a spokeswoman for Google, said in a statement. She added that A.I. would benefit individuals, businesses and communities and that Google is considering the broader societal effects of the technology.
Google, OpenAI and others develop their A.I. with so-called large language models that rely on online information, so they can sometimes share false statements and show racist, sexist and other biased attitudes.
That had been enough to make companies cautious about offering the technology to the public. But several new companies, including You.com and Perplexity.ai, are already offering online search engines that let you ask questions through an online chatbot, much like ChatGPT. Microsoft is also working on a new version of its Bing search engine that would include similar technology, according to a report from The Information.
Mr. Pichai has tried to accelerate product approval reviews, according to the presentation reviewed by The Times. The company established a fast-track review process called the "Green Lane" initiative, pushing groups of employees who try to ensure that technology is fair and ethical to more quickly approve its upcoming A.I. technology.
The company will also find ways for teams developing A.I. to conduct their own reviews, and it will "recalibrate" the level of risk it is willing to take when releasing the technology, according to the presentation.
The consequences of Google's more streamlined approach are not yet clear. Its technology has lagged OpenAI's self-reported metrics when it comes to identifying content that is hateful, toxic, sexual or violent, according to an analysis that Google compiled. In each category, OpenAI bested Google tools, which also fell short of human accuracy in assessing content.
Google listed copyright, privacy and antitrust as the primary risks of the technology in the slide presentation. It said that actions, such as filtering answers to weed out copyrighted material and stopping A.I. from sharing personally identifiable information, are needed to reduce those risks.
For the chatbot search demonstration that Google plans for this year, getting facts right, ensuring safety and getting rid of misinformation are priorities. For other upcoming services and products, the company has a lower bar and will try to curb issues relating to hate and toxicity, danger and misinformation rather than preventing them, according to the presentation.
The company intends, for example, to block certain words to avoid hate speech and will try to minimize other potential issues.
Google expects governments to scrutinize its A.I. products for signs of these issues. The company has recently been the subject of numerous government inquiries and lawsuits accusing it of anti-competitive business practices. It anticipates, according to the presentation, "increased pressure on A.l. regulatory efforts because of rising concerns about misinformation, harmful content, bias, copyright."

Remote Work Takes a Toll On Downtown Lunch Spots: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Downtown lunch spots that rely on catering to white-collar professionals are rethinking their business model as more employees work from home.
It's a tough time for companies that cater to the needs of office workers. For some, like downtown lunch spots that rely on servicing white-collar professionals, remote work options could pose an existential risk.
Sweetgreen, the fast-casual salad chain, is feeling the pain, the DealBook newsletter reports. Its stock has fallen more than 60 percent in the past 12 months. In November, the company noted the effect of the shift to hybrid working practices in its third-quarter earnings report. Inflation is also making its already premium-priced salads even more expensive, pushing the cost of a Cobb salad to around $ 14 in Manhattan.
Companies in the nation's downtown districts that depend on the spending of office workers are wondering whether business will come back. CBRE, the commercial real estate firm, says the role of the office is changing permanently. A survey of big office tenants found that 71 percent of respondents were looking to expand hybrid work arrangements in the next three years.
Layoffs, particularly in the tech industry, are also leaving office spaces empty. On Wednesday, Microsoft became the latest tech giant to announce job cuts as it tries to trim costs, following on the heels of similar announcements from Amazon, Meta, Salesforce and others.
Higher interest rates are also weighing on the commercial real estate sector as many landlords are stuck with aging office buildings that have become too expensive to upgrade. Compounding the problem, tenants are not renewing their leases and instead opting for smaller spaces.
Those industry trends could pose a long-term risk for companies like Sweetgreen, which has been pushing online options to replace in-person sales. For now, analysts are still bullish on the company because it has moved to build digital sales and loyalty. In the third quarter, 60 percent of Sweetgreen's orders were made through online channels, compared with 37 percent at Chipotle and about 40 percent across Yum Brands, and Sweetgreen is piloting a subscription service.
Mitch Reback, Sweetgreen's chief financial officer, noted on a call with analysts in August that the "erratic urban recovery" caused a "sales growth lag," but he said he remained "confident" that downtown locations would recover. The company laid off 5 percent of its work force last year.

A.I. Is Doing Homework. Can It Be Outsmarted?: [National Desk]

Author: Huang, Kalley

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With the rise of the popular new chatbot ChatGPT, colleges are restructuring some courses and taking preventive measures.
While grading essays for his world religions course last month, Antony Aumann, a professor of philosophy at Northern Michigan University, read what he said was easily "the best paper in the class." It explored the morality of burqa bans with clean paragraphs, fitting examples and rigorous arguments.
A red flag instantly went up.
Mr. Aumann confronted his student over whether he had written the essay himself. The student confessed to using ChatGPT, a chatbot that delivers information, explains concepts and generates ideas in simple sentences -- and, in this case, had written the paper.
Alarmed by his discovery, Mr. Aumann decided to transform essay writing for his courses this semester. He plans to require students to write first drafts in the classroom, using browsers that monitor and restrict computer activity. In later drafts, students have to explain each revision. Mr. Aumann, who may forgo essays in subsequent semesters, also plans to weave ChatGPT into lessons by asking students to evaluate the chatbot's responses.
"What's happening in class is no longer going to be, 'Here are some questions -- let's talk about it between us human beings,"' he said, but instead "it's like, 'What also does this alien robot think?"'
Across the country, university professors like Mr. Aumann, department chairs and administrators are starting to overhaul classrooms in response to ChatGPT, prompting a potentially huge shift in teaching and learning. Some professors are redesigning their courses entirely, making changes that include more oral exams, group work and handwritten assessments in lieu of typed ones.
The moves are part of a real-time grappling with a new technological wave known as generative artificial intelligence. ChatGPT, which was released in November by the artificial intelligence lab OpenAI, is at the forefront of the shift. The chatbot generates eerily articulate and nuanced text in response to short prompts, with people using it to write love letters, poetry, fan fiction -- and their schoolwork.
That has upended some middle and high schools, with teachers and administrators trying to discern whether students are using the chatbot to do their schoolwork. Some public school systems, including in New York City and Seattle, have since banned the tool on school Wi-Fi networks and devices to prevent cheating, though students can easily find workarounds to access ChatGPT.
In higher education, colleges and universities have been reluctant to ban the A.I. tool because administrators doubt the move would be effective and they don't want to infringe on academic freedom. That means the way people teach is changing instead.
"We try to institute general policies that certainly back up the faculty member's authority to run a class," instead of targeting specific methods of cheating, said Joe Glover, provost of the University of Florida. "This isn't going to be the last innovation we have to deal with."
That's especially true as generative A.I. is in its early days. OpenAI is expected to soon release another tool, GPT-4, which is better at generating text than previous versions. Google has built LaMDA, a rival chatbot, and Microsoft is discussing a $ 10 billion investment in OpenAI. Silicon Valley start-ups, including Stability AI and Character.AI, are also working on generative A.I. tools.
An OpenAI spokeswoman said the lab recognized its programs could be used to mislead people and was developing technology to help people identify text generated by ChatGPT.
At many universities, ChatGPT has now vaulted to the top of the agenda. Administrators are establishing task forces and hosting universitywide discussions to respond to the tool, with much of the guidance being to adapt to the technology.
At schools including George Washington University in Washington, D.C., Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., and Appalachian State University in Boone, N.C., professors are phasing out take-home, open-book assignments -- which became a dominant method of assessment in the pandemic but now seem vulnerable to chatbots. They are instead opting for in-class assignments, handwritten papers, group work and oral exams.
Gone are prompts like "write five pages about this or that." Some professors are instead crafting questions that they hope will be too clever for chatbots and asking students to write about their own lives and current events.
Students are "plagiarizing this because the assignments can be plagiarized," said Sid Dobrin, chair of the English department at the University of Florida.
Frederick Luis Aldama, the humanities chair at the University of Texas at Austin, said he planned to teach newer or more niche texts that ChatGPT might have less information about, such as William Shakespeare's early sonnets instead of "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
The chatbot may motivate "people who lean into canonical, primary texts to actually reach beyond their comfort zones for things that are not online," he said.
In case the changes fall short of preventing plagiarism, Mr. Aldama and other professors said they planned to institute stricter standards for what they expect from students and how they grade. It is now not enough for an essay to have just a thesis, introduction, supporting paragraphs and a conclusion.
"We need to up our game," Mr. Aldama said. "The imagination, creativity and innovation of analysis that we usually deem an A paper needs to be trickling down into the B-range papers."
Universities are also aiming to educate students about the new A.I. tools. The University at Buffalo in New York and Furman University in Greenville, S.C., said they planned to embed a discussion of A.I. tools into required courses that teach entering or freshman students about concepts such as academic integrity.
"We have to add a scenario about this, so students can see a concrete example," said Kelly Ahuna, who directs the academic integrity office at the University at Buffalo. "We want to prevent things from happening instead of catch them when they happen."
Other universities are trying to draw boundaries for A.I. Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Vermont in Burlington are drafting revisions to their academic integrity policies so their plagiarism definitions include generative A.I.
John Dyer, vice president for enrollment services and educational technologies at Dallas Theological Seminary, said the language in his seminary's honor code felt "a little archaic anyway." He plans to update its plagiarism definition to include: "using text written by a generation system as one's own (e.g., entering a prompt into an artificial intelligence tool and using the output in a paper)."
The misuse of A.I. tools will most likely not end, so some professors and universities said they planned to use detectors to root out that activity. The plagiarism detection service Turnitin said it would incorporate more features for identifying A.I., including ChatGPT, this year.
More than 6,000 teachers from Harvard University, Yale University, the University of Rhode Island and others have also signed up to use GPTZero, a program that promises to quickly detect A.I.-generated text, said Edward Tian, its creator and a senior at Princeton University.
Some students see value in embracing A.I. tools to learn. Lizzie Shackney, 27, a student at the University of Pennsylvania's law school and design school, has started using ChatGPT to brainstorm for papers and debug coding problem sets.
"There are disciplines that want you to share and don't want you to spin your wheels," she said, describing her computer science and statistics classes. "The place where my brain is useful is understanding what the code means."
But she has qualms. ChatGPT, Ms. Shackney said, sometimes incorrectly explains ideas and misquotes sources. The University of Pennsylvania also hasn't instituted any regulations about the tool, so she doesn't want to rely on it in case the school bans it or considers it to be cheating, she said.
Other students have no such scruples, sharing on forums like Reddit that they have submitted assignments written and solved by ChatGPT -- and sometimes done so for fellow students too. On TikTok, the hashtag #chatgpt has more than 578 million views, with people sharing videos of the tool writing papers and solving coding problems.
One video shows a student copying a multiple choice exam and pasting it into the tool with the caption saying: "I don't know about y'all but ima just have Chat GPT take my finals. Have fun studying."

The Meltdown Wasn't BAD For Crypto. It Was GOOD.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Despite trillions of dollars of losses, a batch of bankruptcies and one very high profile arrest, blockchain's devotees remain devoted.
On the wall in Ruar Street Food, a burger joint in the Sant Antoni neighborhood of Barcelona, there is a framed drawing of a male hand holding up a middle finger, high and proud, The image captures the defiant mood at a gathering of a couple dozen men and women in their 20s and 30s, all employed in various corners of the cryptocurrency world.
This industry has plenty of naysayers. But as far as everyone here tonight is concerned, those people can talk to the hand.
Which, given the onslaught of terrible news, goes beyond defiance and tip toes into the ZIP code of magical thinking. With spectacular losses ( $ 2 trillion in crypto assets, poof!), gruesome bankruptcies (Terra, Luna, Celsius) and fraud charges against the sector's highest-profile entrepreneur (Sam Bankman-Fried, of the now-kaput FTX exchange), few industries were more brutalized in 2022.
The carnage was not merely financial; the reputation and promise of crypto has been badly tarnished. Once touted as the future of money, a challenge to the world's central banks, not to mention a clever investment, crypto now carries the odor of disaster. The notion that it could serve as a hedge against inflation took a beating when Bitcoin fell more than 60 percent. Thousands of other tokens sank even lower or effectively vanished.
Despite this, attendees at the Ruar Street meet-up, organized by a crypto community called Web3 Family, are buoyant and ready for whatever 2023 has to offer. Beer flows, crypto-themed T-shirts are raffled off, fries with creamy cheddar and bacon are consumed. There are no hints of anxiety.
It's clear before the second round lands that the crypto faithful are keeping the faith.
The flock includes Maria Rebelo, a 27-year-old who works for a Canadian company called Ureeqa that helps artists monetize NFTs, a.k.a. nonfungible tokens. These are digital assets -- photos, music, sports memorabilia, whatever -- that are recorded and tracked by blockchain, the virtual ledger that enables all things crypto. She rhapsodized about how blockchain could lead to "a worldwide community, instead of one government per country."
"When we open up the decentralized world, we offer ways for humans to collaborate in ways they never have before," she said. "That's human development."
Interviews in Barcelona and with executives around the world suggest that a year's worth of fiascos has done little to diminish the enthusiasm of true believers. Many liken this moment to the dot-com crash of 2001, a calamity that wiped out even more wealth -- an estimated $ 5 trillion -- and ultimately yielded some blue-chip companies. ("Amazon was down 90 percent at one point" is a line uttered time and again.)
A variation of that sentiment was offered by Joe Hernandez, who handles fraud detection for a company called Gitcoin, a platform that promises on its website to "build and fund open web together." He was taking a smoke break on the sidewalk outside of Ruar, wearing a purple-and-white varsity jacket, its back emblazoned with the image of an astronaut playing an arcade game.
He is an American, who happened to be visiting Barcelona. Other digital nomads have settled here, drawn by the city's beauty and relative affordability and hailing from China, Argentina, Portugal, France, Ukraine and elsewhere.
Many say that crypto is shouldering the blame for the bad actors that it attracts. Swindlers are going to swindle.
"Every cycle, a bunch of fraudsters come along and a bunch of tokens go to zero," Mr. Hernandez said. "Galling is a pretty good word for it. Because it scares a lot of people away."
Some of the crypto faithful see an upside to the wipeout of 2022. To them it was like a four-keg frat party that the cops busted. Those still standing are proud to say that they weren't distracted by the revelry.
"Now more than ever we're encouraged that we are doing the right thing by just believing in the fundamentals of crypto," said Elion Chin, the co-creator of Nimiq, an open-source payment system that allows users to hold and spend crypto right from their web browsers. Like thousands of ventures, Nimiq has also issued a coin, which is down 92 percent from its high in 2021.
Yet none of its 27 "full-time contributors" have left.
"Money is very important, but that's not necessarily the full and only reward our contributors are getting here," Mr. Chin said on a phone call from Costa Rica. "They're working with people they enjoy working with, on something they believe can make a difference."
This is a common refrain. While crypto has been associated with quick riches, good luck finding people who will say they are sticking it out for a payday. Instead, there's a lot of earnest talk about the ways that blockchain will transform the world -- helping to solve climate change, streamlining supply chains, even reshaping work in a way that lets more people find jobs they enjoy. (Because the blockchain can handle all sorts of drudgery.)
There is also lot of talk about agitating to free incarcerated heroes of the cyber world. The crypto catechism has an anti-government, libertarian streak that quickly surfaces over cocktails. Among the giveaways tonight is a T-shirt reading "Free Alex Pertsev," who is in jail in the Netherlands, facing charges of money laundering. He is the developer of Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer that has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury.
In this crowd only banks are held in greater suspicion than governments. If you think of your bank as nothing more than a dull place to stash money, you have probably never spent much time with crypto evangelists. These institutions stand accused of profiteering, money laundering and keeping tabs on how people spend, which is just the kind of information the government is already collecting -- in order to track your carbon footprint.
That, at least, is the hunch of a young Italian at the Ruar meet-up, a guy in a smart blue sweater who could pass for a first-year management consultant. He did not want his name in this story, part of a broader ethos of remaining as invisible as possible. He described a future in which governments fine citizens for contributing to climate change, and said there's no better way to keep tabs on that than through what those citizens spend, something only banks know.
For years, there's been talk about the separation of church and state, he explained. Crypto will hasten the separation of money and state.
While crypto's supporters focus on wildly ambitious goals in an imagined future, critics point to debacles that happen all the time. Like the theft of $ 3 billion worth of crypto last year, as estimated by Chainanalysis. Then there is the discomfiting reality that crypto streamlines life for criminals -- human traffickers, drug dealers, ransomware extractors, mobsters and the government of North Korea, which employs hackers who steal crypto all day, every day.
"Terrible things happen in crypto pretty regularly and yet the crypto faithful are very good at separating them from their perceived ideal of crypto," said Molly White, who runs Web3 Is Going Just Great, a website that chronicles crypto's tribulations. "If something goes poorly, it's always some other factor, like poor implementation. Which makes it easy to hold on to your ideological position."
As Ms. White notes, crypto has been around since 2009 and has yet to produce a single product or service that ordinary people use in their daily lives. Just wait, counter the crypto faithful, who contend an epochal breakthrough is around the corner. It's like a cult leader who has predicted the end of the world on a certain day. When the apocalypse fails to materialize, core tenets are not abandoned. Instead, a new date is named.
That said, crypto's highly public battering has forced companies to re-evaluate their strategies. There was a time when businesses that weren't even in the tech sphere reached for crypto magic by adding "blockchain" to their name, which often goosed their stock price. Most famously, the Long Island Iced Tea Corporation became the Long Blockchain Corporation, and its stock rose nearly 300 percent in a day.
Now, the opposite is happening -- companies squarely in the crypto sphere are shedding the "b" word. In early January, a Bitcoin mining company, Riot Blockchain, became Riot Platforms. In October, Applied Blockchain became Applied Digital. ("We're broadening our scope," an executive said in an interview with the Street.) A lot of venture capital firms that once chased crypto projects now will not return calls.
Reinventions are underway. Ziliqa, which long pitched itself as a blockchain platform, is barreling into the world of online games. In October, it launched Web3War, a first-person shooter, and another eight or nine titles are in the works. Game-related commerce will be handled on the blockchain. But ideally, said Matt Ryan, the chief executive, gamers will not notice.
"They don't need to see the blockchain; they just need to know that it works," he said in a video interview from his home in London.
Calling this venture quixotic doesn't capture it. Gaming is a mature and crowded market, led by blue-chip corporations, like Sony and Microsoft, and dominated by titans like PUBG: Battlegrounds, which has been downloaded more than one billion times.
And Web3War? To date, about 5,500 people have signed up. Mr. Ryan is undaunted.
"I think if we get to 10,000, watch this space," he said. "It proves we've got a product that people want."
Mr. Ryan is a born optimist, he acknowledges, and that is true for most of the crypto faithful. This entails not just predicting a great future for blockchain, but ignoring its failures.
In November, the Australian Securities Exchange canceled plans for a blockchain-based system for clearing trades, incurring a $ 168 million charge. In November, the Danish shipping company Maersk unplugged its blockchain platform. In a statement, it said, "the need for full global industry collaboration has not been achieved."
These failures do not surprise Lee Reiners, policy director at the Duke Financial Economics Center. Blockchain is essentially a database software, he notes, and not a very popular one. It would never have achieved its devoted following, or attracted billions in venture capital funding, without its connection to crypto. And that, he says, is a tragedy no one has fully reckoned with.
"Imagine if all the money and talent flooding into crypto over the last ten years had gone into combating climate change or cancer research," Professor Reiners said. "It's a tremendous misuse of societal resources, and it's all because people wanted to make money fast. Despite what they're saying, what attracted most folks was the perceived opportunity to get rich quick."
The talent that Professor Reiners thinks has been misallocated begs to differ. The meet-up at Ruar ended late, with a small group discussing how the pandemic proved that governments could easily control their populations, and the ways that banks chipped in. One attendee mentioned that the account of a customer had been closed for refusing to wear a mask during a visit to a bank. If all goes as planned, that customer will someday have other options.
"From where I'm standing, there's an opportunity to tell the world that there's a paradigm-changing positive future that blockchain enables," said Mr. Hernandez of Gitcoin. "But that's not the story right now."

BARCELONA — On the wall in Ruar Street Food, a burger joint in the Sant Antoni neighborhood of Barcelona, there is a framed drawing of a male hand holding up a middle finger, high and proud. The image captures the defiant mood at a gathering of a couple of dozen men and women in their 20s and 30s, all employed in various corners of the cryptocurrency world.
This industry has plenty of naysayers. But as far as everyone here tonight is concerned, those people can talk to the hand.
Which, given the onslaught of terrible news, goes beyond defiance and tiptoes into the ZIP code of magical thinking. With spectacular losses ($2 trillion in crypto assets, poof!), gruesome bankruptcies (Terra, Luna, Celsius) and fraud charges against the sector’s highest-profile entrepreneur (Sam Bankman-Fried, of the now-kaput FTX exchange), few industries were more brutalized in 2022.
The carnage was not merely financial; the reputation and promise of crypto has been badly tarnished. Once touted as the future of money, a challenge to the world’s central banks, not to mention a clever investment, crypto now carries the odor of disaster. The notion that it could serve as a hedge against inflation took a beating when bitcoin fell more than 60%. Thousands of other tokens sank even lower or effectively vanished.
Despite this, attendees at the Ruar Street meet-up, organized by a crypto community called Web3 Family, are buoyant and ready for whatever 2023 has to offer. Beer flows, crypto-themed T-shirts are raffled off, fries with creamy cheddar and bacon are consumed. There are no hints of anxiety.
It’s clear before the second round lands that the crypto faithful are keeping the faith.
The flock includes Maria Rebelo, a 27-year-old who works for a Canadian company called Ureeqa that helps artists monetize NFTs, aka nonfungible tokens. These are digital assets — photos, music, sports memorabilia, whatever — that are recorded and tracked by blockchain, the virtual ledger that enables all things crypto. She rhapsodized about how blockchain could lead to “a worldwide community, instead of one government per country.”
“When we open up the decentralized world, we offer ways for humans to collaborate in ways they never have before,” she said. “That’s human development.”
Interviews in Barcelona and with executives around the world suggest that a year’s worth of fiascos has done little to diminish the enthusiasm of true believers. Many liken this moment to the dot-com crash of 2001, a calamity that wiped out even more wealth — an estimated $5 trillion — and ultimately yielded some blue-chip companies. (“Amazon was down 90% at one point” is a line uttered time and again.)
A variation of that sentiment was offered by Joe Hernandez, who handles fraud detection for a company called Gitcoin, a platform that promises on its website to “build and fund open web together.” He was taking a smoke break on the sidewalk outside of Ruar, wearing a purple-and-white varsity jacket, its back emblazoned with the image of an astronaut playing an arcade game.
He is an American, who happened to be visiting Barcelona. Other digital nomads have settled here, drawn by the city’s beauty and relative affordability and hailing from China, Argentina, Portugal, France, Ukraine and elsewhere.
Many say that crypto is shouldering the blame for the bad actors that it attracts. Swindlers are going to swindle.
“Every cycle, a bunch of fraudsters come along and a bunch of tokens go to zero,” Hernandez said. “Galling is a pretty good word for it. Because it scares a lot of people away.”
Some of the crypto faithful see an upside to the wipeout of 2022. To them it was like a four-keg frat party that the cops busted. Those still standing are proud to say that they weren’t distracted by the revelry.
“Now more than ever we’re encouraged that we are doing the right thing by just believing in the fundamentals of crypto,” said Elion Chin, co-creator of Nimiq, an open-source payment system that allows users to hold and spend crypto right from their web browsers. Like thousands of ventures, Nimiq has also issued a coin, which is down 92% from its high in 2021.
Yet none of its 27 “full-time contributors” have left.
“Money is very important, but that’s not necessarily the full and only reward our contributors are getting here,” Chin said on a phone call from Costa Rica. “They’re working with people they enjoy working with, on something they believe can make a difference.”
This is a common refrain. While crypto has been associated with quick riches, good luck finding people who will say they are sticking it out for a payday. Instead, there’s a lot of earnest talk about the ways that blockchain will transform the world — helping to solve climate change, streamlining supply chains, even reshaping work in a way that lets more people find jobs they enjoy. (Because the blockchain can handle all sorts of drudgery.)
There is also lot of talk about agitating to free incarcerated heroes of the cyber world. The crypto catechism has an anti-government, libertarian streak that quickly surfaces over cocktails. Among the giveaways tonight is a T-shirt reading “Free Alex Pertsev,” who is in jail in the Netherlands, facing charges of money laundering. He is the developer of Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer that has been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury.
In this crowd only banks are held in greater suspicion than governments. If you think of your bank as nothing more than a dull place to stash money, you have probably never spent much time with crypto evangelists. These institutions stand accused of profiteering, money laundering and keeping tabs on how people spend, which is just the kind of information the government is collecting — in order to track your carbon footprint.
That, at least, is the hunch of a young Italian at the Ruar meet-up, a guy in a smart blue sweater who could pass for a first-year management consultant. He did not want his name in this story, part of a broader ethos of remaining as invisible as possible. He described a future in which governments fine citizens for contributing to climate change, and said there’s no better way to keep tabs on that than through what those citizens spend, something only banks know.
For years, there’s been talk about the separation of church and state, he explained. Crypto will hasten the separation of money and state.
While crypto’s supporters focus on wildly ambitious goals in an imagined future, critics point to debacles that happen all the time. Like the theft of $3 billion worth of crypto last year, as estimated by Chainanalysis. Then there is the discomfiting reality that crypto streamlines life for criminals — human traffickers, drug dealers, ransomware extractors, mobsters and the government of North Korea, which employs hackers who steal crypto all day, every day.
“Terrible things happen in crypto pretty regularly and yet the crypto faithful are very good at separating them from their perceived ideal of crypto,” said Molly White, who runs Web3 Is Going Just Great, a website that chronicles crypto’s tribulations. “If something goes poorly, it’s always some other factor, like poor implementation. Which makes it easy to hold on to your ideological position.”
As White notes, crypto has been around since 2009 and has yet to produce a single product or service that ordinary people use in their daily lives. Just wait, counter the crypto faithful, who contend an epochal breakthrough is around the corner. It’s like a cult leader who has predicted the end of the world on a certain day. When the apocalypse fails to materialize, core tenets are not abandoned. Instead, a new date is named.
That said, crypto’s highly public battering has forced companies to reevaluate their strategies. There was a time when businesses that weren’t even in the tech sphere reached for crypto magic by adding “blockchain” to their name, which often goosed their stock price. Most famously, the Long Island Iced Tea Corp. became the Long Blockchain Corp., and its stock rose nearly 300% in a day.
Now, the opposite is happening — companies squarely in the crypto sphere are shedding the “b” word. In early January, a bitcoin mining company, Riot Blockchain, became Riot Platforms. In October, Applied Blockchain became Applied Digital. (“We’re broadening our scope,” an executive said in an interview with the Street.) A lot of venture capital firms that once chased crypto projects now will not return calls.
Reinventions are underway. Ziliqa, which long pitched itself as a blockchain platform, is barreling into the world of online games. In October, it launched Web3War, a first-person shooter, and another eight or nine titles are in the works. Game-related commerce will be handled on the blockchain. But ideally, said Matt Ryan, the CEO, gamers will not notice.
“They don’t need to see the blockchain; they just need to know that it works,” he said in a video interview from his home in London.
Calling this venture quixotic doesn’t capture it. Gaming is a mature and crowded market, led by blue-chip corporations such as Sony and Microsoft and dominated by titans including PUBG: Battlegrounds, which has been downloaded more than 1 billion times.
And Web3War? To date, about 5,500 people have signed up. Ryan is undaunted.
“I think if we get to 10,000, watch this space,” he said. “It proves we’ve got a product that people want.”
Ryan is a born optimist, he acknowledges, and that is true for most of the crypto faithful. This entails not just predicting a great future for blockchain, but ignoring its failures.
In November, the Australian Securities Exchange canceled plans for a blockchain-based system for clearing trades, incurring a $168 million charge. In November, Danish shipping company Maersk unplugged its blockchain platform. In a statement, it said, “the need for full global industry collaboration has not been achieved.”
These failures do not surprise Lee Reiners, policy director at the Duke Financial Economics Center. Blockchain is essentially a database software, he notes, and not a very popular one.

“From where I’m standing, there’s an opportunity to tell the world that there’s a paradigm-changing positive future that blockchain enables,” said Hernandez of Gitcoin. “But that’s not the story right now.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Alarmed by AI Chatbots, Universities Start Revamping How They Teach

While grading essays for his world religions course last month, Antony Aumann, a professor of philosophy at Northern Michigan University, read what he said was easily “the best paper in the class.” It explored the morality of burqa bans with clean paragraphs, fitting examples and rigorous arguments.
A red flag instantly went up.
Aumann confronted his student over whether he had written the essay himself. The student confessed to using ChatGPT, a chatbot that delivers information, explains concepts and generates ideas in simple sentences — and, in this case, had written the paper.
Alarmed by his discovery, Aumann decided to transform essay writing for his courses this semester. He plans to require students to write first drafts in the classroom, using browsers that monitor and restrict computer activity. In later drafts, students have to explain each revision. Aumann, who may forgo essays in subsequent semesters, also plans to weave ChatGPT into lessons by asking students to evaluate the chatbot’s responses.
“What’s happening in class is no longer going to be, ‘Here are some questions — let’s talk about it between us human beings,’” he said, but instead “it’s like, ‘What also does this alien robot think?’”
Across the country, university professors like Aumann, department chairs and administrators are starting to overhaul classrooms in response to ChatGPT, prompting a potentially huge shift in teaching and learning. Some professors are redesigning their courses entirely, making changes that include more oral exams, group work and handwritten assessments in lieu of typed ones.
The moves are part of a real-time grappling with a new technological wave known as generative artificial intelligence. ChatGPT, which was released in November by the artificial intelligence lab OpenAI, is at the forefront of the shift. The chatbot generates eerily articulate and nuanced text in response to short prompts, with people using it to write love letters, poetry, fan fiction — and their schoolwork.
That has upended some middle and high schools, with teachers and administrators trying to discern whether students are using the chatbot to do their schoolwork. Some public school systems, including in New York City and Seattle, have since banned the tool on school Wi-Fi networks and devices to prevent cheating, although students can easily find workarounds to access ChatGPT.
In higher education, colleges and universities have been reluctant to ban the AI tool because administrators doubt the move would be effective and they don’t want to infringe on academic freedom. That means the way people teach is changing instead.
“We try to institute general policies that certainly back up the faculty member’s authority to run a class,” instead of targeting specific methods of cheating, said Joe Glover, provost of the University of Florida. “This isn’t going to be the last innovation we have to deal with.”
That’s especially true as generative AI is in its early days. OpenAI is expected to soon release another tool, GPT-4, which is better at generating text than previous versions. Google has built LaMDA, a rival chatbot, and Microsoft is discussing a $10 billion investment in OpenAI. Silicon Valley startups, including Stability AI and Character.AI, are also working on generative AI tools.
An OpenAI spokesperson said the lab recognized its programs could be used to mislead people and was developing technology to help people identify text generated by ChatGPT.
At many universities, ChatGPT has now vaulted to the top of the agenda. Administrators are establishing task forces and hosting universitywide discussions to respond to the tool, with much of the guidance being to adapt to the technology.
At schools including George Washington University in Washington, D.C., Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, professors are phasing out take-home, open-book assignments — which became a dominant method of assessment in the pandemic but now seem vulnerable to chatbots. They are instead opting for in-class assignments, handwritten papers, group work and oral exams.
Gone are prompts like “write five pages about this or that.” Some professors are instead crafting questions that they hope will be too clever for chatbots and asking students to write about their own lives and current events.
Students are “plagiarizing this because the assignments can be plagiarized,” said Sid Dobrin, chair of the English department at the University of Florida.
Frederick Luis Aldama, the humanities chair at the University of Texas at Austin, said he planned to teach newer or more niche texts that ChatGPT might have less information about, such as William Shakespeare’s early sonnets instead of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”
The chatbot may motivate “people who lean into canonical, primary texts to actually reach beyond their comfort zones for things that are not online,” he said.
In case the changes fall short of preventing plagiarism, Aldama and other professors said they planned to institute stricter standards for what they expect from students and how they grade. It is now not enough for an essay to have just a thesis, introduction, supporting paragraphs and a conclusion.
“We need to up our game,” Aldama said. “The imagination, creativity and innovation of analysis that we usually deem an A paper needs to be trickling down into the B-range papers.”
Universities are also aiming to educate students about the new AI tools. The University at Buffalo in New York and Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina, said they planned to embed a discussion of AI tools into required courses that teach entering or freshman students about concepts such as academic integrity.
“We have to add a scenario about this, so students can see a concrete example,” said Kelly Ahuna, who directs the academic integrity office at the University at Buffalo. “We want to prevent things from happening instead of catch them when they happen.”
Other universities are trying to draw boundaries for AI. Washington University in St. Louis and the University of Vermont in Burlington are drafting revisions to their academic integrity policies so their plagiarism definitions include generative AI.
John Dyer, vice president for enrollment services and educational technologies at Dallas Theological Seminary, said the language in his seminary’s honor code felt “a little archaic anyway.” He plans to update its plagiarism definition to include: “using text written by a generation system as one’s own (e.g., entering a prompt into an artificial intelligence tool and using the output in a paper).”
The misuse of AI tools will most likely not end, so some professors and universities said they planned to use detectors to root out that activity. The plagiarism detection service Turnitin said it would incorporate more features for identifying AI, including ChatGPT, this year.
More than 6,000 teachers from Harvard University, Yale University, the University of Rhode Island and others have also signed up to use GPTZero, a program that promises to quickly detect AI-generated text, said Edward Tian, its creator and a senior at Princeton University.
Some students see value in embracing AI tools to learn. Lizzie Shackney, 27, a student at the University of Pennsylvania’s law school and design school, has started using ChatGPT to brainstorm for papers and debug coding problem sets.
“There are disciplines that want you to share and don’t want you to spin your wheels,” she said, describing her computer science and statistics classes. “The place where my brain is useful is understanding what the code means.”
But she has qualms. ChatGPT, Shackney said, sometimes incorrectly explains ideas and misquotes sources. The University of Pennsylvania also hasn’t instituted any regulations about the tool, so she doesn’t want to rely on it in case the school bans it or considers it to be cheating, she said.
Other students have no such scruples, sharing on forums such as Reddit that they have submitted assignments written and solved by ChatGPT — and sometimes done so for fellow students too. On TikTok, the hashtag #chatgpt has more than 578 million views, with people sharing videos of the tool writing papers and solving coding problems.
One video shows a student copying a multiple choice exam and pasting it into the tool with the caption saying: “I don’t know about y’all but ima just have Chat GPT take my finals. Have fun studying.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Analysts Look to Corporate Reports With Lowered Expectations: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: As companies prepare to publish their latest financial results, Wall Street forecasters expect profits to fall for the first time since the early days of the pandemic.
The analysts who forecast the fortunes of corporate America have rarely been more pessimistic at the start of a year than they are in 2023.
The country's largest companies are about to start publicly reporting their quarterly financial results, when analysts will pepper company management with questions about profits and losses and try to glean hints about what to expect in the months ahead. Coming after the S&P 500-stock index fell nearly 20 percent last year, these reports could help buoy the market if things aren't as bad as they seem, or drag it down further.
On Friday, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and others will set the tone, providing a window on the state of the economy, consumer confidence and business activity in their financial releases.
Wall Street's prognosticators predict that companies in the S&P 500 are about to reveal an aggregate fall in profit of about 4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, versus the same period a year ago, according to FactSet, the first decline since the early days of the pandemic. They also expect earnings to continue falling in the first half before rebounding to finish up 4 percent for the full year, according to data collected by Goldman Sachs going back to 1986.
That may not sound so bad, yet it stands out as the lowest forecast in recent history. That's worse than was expected at the beginning of 2009, shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and worse than at the start of 2002, as the dot-com bubble was rapidly deflating.
Analysts are balancing soaring inflation and interest rates against a resilient economy and some signs that inflation has peaked. They also tend to be a preternaturally optimistic bunch, so their not-so-great expectations are still cause for alarm for those who parse earnings forecasts, price targets and other ephemera produced by market watchers on Wall Street.
"It tells you expectations are already low," said Ben Snider, an equity analyst at Goldman Sachs. "I don't want to paint a picture that analysts are overly pessimistic. I think the estimates are reflecting what is a mediocre growth environment."
For months, investors have been waiting for the bottom to fall out for corporate America. The rising costs of everything from energy to raw materials and labor stoked fears that profitability would plummet. However, many companies have been able to pass on higher costs to consumers without denting their sales, propping up profit margins and generating cash to spend on operations or dividends and share buybacks, which directly benefit investors.
That may be about to change.
Amazon is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings that are almost 50 percent less than the year before. Expectations for profits at Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft, which have an outsize impact on stock indexes because of their size, have also dropped, according to the FactSet. Big technology firms have laid off tens of thousands of workers in recent weeks.
However, all that information is immediately reflected in stock prices, or so the theory goes. That's why investors and analysts pay such close attention to comments by corporate executives about how they see the future panning out, even if earnings calls are ostensibly held to talk about the past.
On these calls, analysts mix praise of management with pointed questions about the feasibility of their strategies. The discussion this quarter will probably focus on the effects of high inflation and interest rates, the likelihood of recession, and layoffs. Investors will also been listening for signals about the effect of China's reopening as well as the impact of new taxes on corporate income.
And investors are wise to the common practice of executives talking down their companies' prospects, giving themselves wiggle room for underperformance or simply a lower bar to beat and boost to their company's stock price.
"Recent client conversations indicate some skeptical investors are wary that managements might low-ball" their latest results and the outlook for 2023, Goldman's analysts wrote in a recent research note.
Yet there is also reason to be genuinely cautious.
Inflation remains stubbornly high, so the Federal Reserve is expected to keep raising interest rates, tightening the screws on the economy. Central bank officials have been adamant that the economy needs to soften in order to bring down inflation, and that implies more layoffs and weaker consumer demand, which makes it harder for companies to raise prices.
This week, the Walt Disney Company announced changes to its pricing policy at theme parks, an acknowledgment that it may have pushed too hard in pursuit of profit, while FedEx said it would further pare back some weekend delivery services as demand waned for its services.
"Big picture, we care about what is happening with demand and what is happening to companies' costs," said Ron Temple, the chief market strategist at Lazard.
Goldman's analysts don't expect earnings of companies in the S&P 500 to grow at all this year, a more downbeat forecast than the average. The bank itself laid off up to 3,200 people this week.
The biggest risk for companies and the stock market remains the Fed's campaign to constrain the economy and lower inflation, potentially pushing the economy into recession. Goldman's analysts see a potential earnings decline of more than 10 percent this year in that scenario.
"What worries me is that there is this sense that we may still come through this period with very little going wrong," Mr. Temple said. "There is too much complacency."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On a recent afternoon Jonas Thiel, a socioeconomics major at a college in northern Germany, spent more than an hour chatting online with some of the left-wing political philosophers he had been studying. These were not the actual philosophers but virtual recreations, brought to conversation, if not quite life, by sophisticated chatbots on a website called Character.AI.
Mr. Thiel's favorite was a bot that imitated Karl Kautsky, a Czech-Austrian socialist who died before World War Two. When Mr. Thiel asked Kautsky's digital avatar to provide some advice for modern-day socialists struggling to rebuild the worker's movement in Germany, Kautsky-bot suggested that they launch a newspaper. "They can use it not only as a means of spreading socialist propaganda, which is in short supply in Germany for the time being, but also to organize working class people," the bot said.
Kautsky-bot went on to argue that the working classes would eventually "come to their senses" and embrace a modern-day Marxist revolution. "The proletariat is at a low point in their history right now," it wrote. "They will eventually realize the flaws in capitalism, especially because of climate change."
Over the course of several days, Mr. Thiel met with other virtual scholars, including G.A. Cohen and Adolph Reed Jr. But he could have picked almost anyone, live or dead, real or imagined. At Character.AI, which emerged this summer, users can chat with reasonable facsimiles of everyone from Queen Elizabeth or William Shakespeare to Billie Eilish or Elon Musk (there are several versions). Anyone you want to invoke, or concoct, is available for conversation. The company and site, founded by Daniel De Freitas and Noam Shazeer, two former Google researchers, is among the many efforts to build a new kind of chatbot. These bots cannot chat exactly like a human, but they often seem to.
In late November, OpenAI, a San Francisco artificial intelligence lab, unveiled a bot called ChatGPT that left more than a million people feeling as if they were chatting with another human being. Similar technologies are under development at Google, Meta and other tech giants. Some companies have been reluctant to share the technology with the wider public. Because these bots learn their skills from data posted to the internet by real people, they often generate untruths, hate speech and language that is biased against women and people of color. If misused, they could become a more efficient way of running the kind of misinformation campaign that has become commonplace in recent years.
"Without any additional guardrails in place, they are just going to end up reflecting all the biases and toxic information that is already on the web," said Margaret Mitchell, a former A.I. researcher at Microsoft and Google, where she helped start its Ethical A.I. team. She is now with the A.I. start-up Hugging Face.
But other companies, including Character.AI, are confident that the public will learn to accept the flaws of chatbots and develop a healthy distrust of what they say. Mr. Thiel found that the bots at Character.AI had both a talent for conversation and a knack for impersonating real-life people. "If you read what someone like Kautsky wrote in the 19th century, he does not use the same language we use today," he said. "But the A.I. can somehow translate his ideas into ordinary modern English."
For the moment, these and other advanced chatbots are a source of entertainment. And they are quickly becoming a more powerful way of interacting with machines. Experts are still debating whether the strengths of these technologies will outweigh their flaws and potential for harm, but they agree on one point: The believability of make-believe conversation will continue to improve.
The art of conversation
In 2015 Mr. De Freitas, then working as a software engineer at Microsoft, read a research paper published by scientists at Google Brain, the flagship artificial intelligence lab at Google. Detailing what it called "A Neural Conversational Model," the paper showed how a machine could learn the art of conversation by analyzing dialogue transcripts from hundreds of movies.
The paper described what A.I. researchers call a neural network, a mathematical system loosely modeled on the web of neurons in the brain. This same technology also translates between Spanish and English on services like Google Translate and identifies pedestrians and traffic signs for self-driving cars navigating city streets.
A neural network learns skills by pinpointing patterns in enormous amounts of digital data. By analyzing thousands of cat photos, for instance, it can learn to recognize a cat.
The neural system described in the Google paper was far from perfect but seemed to chat like a real person every once in a while:
Human: what 's your name ?
Machine: i 'm julia .
Human: when were you born ?
Machine: july 20th .
Human: what year were you born ?
Machine: 1977 .
Human: where are you from ?
Machine: i 'm out in the boonies.
Human: are you a man or a woman ?
Machine: i 'm a woman .
Human: why are we here ?
Machine: i 'm not sure .
When Mr. De Freitas read the paper, he was not yet an A.I. researcher; he was a software engineer working on search engines. But what he really wanted was to take Google's idea to its logical extreme.
"You could tell this bot could generalize," he said. "What it said did not look like what was in a movie script."
He moved to Google in 2017. Officially, he was an engineer on YouTube, the company's video-sharing site. But for his "20 percent time" project -- a Google tradition that lets employees explore new ideas alongside their daily obligations -- he began building his own chatbot.
The idea was to train a neural network using a much larger collection of dialogue: reams of chat logs culled from social media services and other sites across the internet. The idea was simple, but it would require enormous amounts of computer processing power. Even a supercomputer would need weeks or even months to analyze all that data.
As a Google engineer, he held a few credits that allowed him to run experimental software across the company's vast network of computer data centers. But these credits would grant only a small fraction of the computing power needed to train his chatbot. So he started borrowing credits from other engineers; as the system analyzed more data, its skills would improve by leaps and bounds.
Initially, he trained his chatbot using what is called an LSTM, for Long Short-Term Memory -- a neural network designed in the 1990s specifically for natural language. But he soon switched to a new kind of neural network called a transformer, developed by a team of Google A.I. researchers that included Noam Shazeer.
Unlike an LSTM, which reads text one word at a time, a transformer can use multiple computer processors to analyze an entire document in a single step.
Google, OpenAI and other organizations were already using transformers to build what are called "large language models," systems suited for a wide range of language tasks, from writing tweets to answering questions. Still working on his own, Mr. De Freitas focused the idea on conversation, feeding his transformer as much dialogue as possible.
It was an exceedingly simple approach. But as Mr. De Freitas likes to say: "Simple solutions for incredible results."
The result in this case was a chatbot that he called Meena. It was so effective that Google Brain hired Mr. De Freitas and turned his project into an official research effort. Meena became LaMDA, short for Language Model for Dialogue Applications.
The project spilled into the public consciousness early last summer when another Google engineer, Blake Lemoine, told The Washington Post that LaMDA was sentient. This assertion was an exaggeration, to say the least. But the brouhaha showed how quickly chatbots were improving inside top labs like Google Brain and OpenAI.
Google was reluctant to release the technology, worried that its knack for misinformation and other toxic language could damage the company brand. But by this time Mr. De Freitas and Mr. Shazeer had left Google, determined to get this kind of technology into the hands of as many people as possible through their new company, Character.AI.
"The technology is useful today -- for fun, for emotional support, for generating ideas, for all kinds of creativity," Mr. Shazeer said.
Designed for 'plausible conversation'
ChatGPT, the bot released by OpenAI to much fanfare in late November, was designed to operate as a new kind of question-and-answer engine. It is pretty good in this role, but the user never knows when the chatbot will just make something up. It may tell you that the official currency of Switzerland is the euro (it's actually the Swiss franc) or that Mark Twain's Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County could not only jump but talk. A.I. researchers call this generation of untruths "hallucination."
In building Character.AI, Mr. De Freitas and Mr. Shazeer had a different objective: open-ended conversation. They believe that today's chatbots are better suited to this kind of service, for now a means of entertainment, factual or not. As every page on the site notes, "Everything Characters say is made up!"
"These systems are not designed for truth," Mr. Shazeer said. "They are designed for plausible conversation."
Mr. De Freitas, Mr. Shazeer and their colleagues did not build one bot that imitates Elon Musk and another that mimics Queen Elizabeth and a third that parrots William Shakespeare. They built a single system that can imitate all those people and countless others.
It has learned from reams of general dialogue as well as from articles, news stories, books and other digital text describing people like Elon Musk, Queen Elizabeth and William Shakespeare.
The system also has a way of combining disparate concepts learned during training. The result is a practically endless collection of bots that can imitate a practically endless collection of people, riffing on a practically endless number of topics, as Mr. Thiel found when he chatted with the Karl Kautsky bot:
JonasThiel: Marxists in your time were very confident that revolution was a historical inevitability. In light of recent defeats socialists across the world have suffered and the lack of class struggle, even in times of great suffering, do you think it is time to revise that view?
Karl Kautsky: I do not. We may have made mistakes with our tactics, but I refuse to believe that socialism is a pipe dream. I still believe that the proletariat must break the chains of capitalism, and that the working class must unite around marxism. We must remember that capitalism is still deeply flawed and that it is our job as socialists to agitate and spread class consciousness.
JonasThiel: I completely agree, but wasn't it wrong to assume workers uniting to overthrow the bourgeoisie was inevitable? After all, the capitalist class is very powerful and it is hard for workers to come together to resist collectively rather than individually.
Karl Kautsky: You are right, it was a mistake to be over optimistic in that regard. But I find it better to believe in class consciousness and revolution until I am proven wrong. What is the alternative? Believing the workers will stay in chains forever? I don't agree with that. It is better to struggle against capitalism despite our odds then to give in. I refuse to believe the workers will never wake up. Even if I am over optimistic, we must not give in to pessimism. I refuse to be proved wrong. I hope you can understand.
Sometimes, the chatbot gets things right. Sometimes, it doesn't. When Mr. Thiel chatted with an avatar meant to imitate Mr. Reed, the 20th-century American political thinker, it turned him into "some kind of militant Maoist, which is definitely not right."
Like Google and OpenAI and other top labs, Mr. De Freitas, Mr. Shazeer and their colleagues plan on training their system with ever larger amounts of digital data. This training can take months, and millions of dollars; it can also sharpen the skills of the artificial conversationalist.
Researchers say that the rapid improvement of the past several years will last only so long. Richard Socher, former head of A.I. at Salesforce who now runs a start-up called You.com, believes these exponential improvements will begin to level off over the next few years, when language models reach a point when they have analyzed pretty much all the text on the internet.
But Mr. Shazeer believes the runway is much longer. "There are billions of people in the world generating text all the time," he said. "People will keep spending more and more money to train smarter and smarter systems. We are nowhere near the end of that trend."

Full text: Enlarge this image.
SAN FRANCISCO — Five weeks ago, OpenAI, a San Francisco artificial intelligence lab, released ChatGPT, a chatbot that answers questions in clear, concise prose. The AI-powered tool immediately caused a sensation, with more than 1 million people using it to create everything from poetry to high school term papers to rewrites of Queen songs.
Now OpenAI is in the midst of a new gold rush.
The lab is in talks to complete a deal that would value it at around $29 billion, more than twice its valuation in 2021, two people with knowledge of the discussions said. The potential deal — where OpenAI would sell existing company shares in a so-called tender offer — could total $300 million, depending on how many employees agree to sell their stock, they said. The company is also in discussions with Microsoft — which invested $1 billion in it in 2019 — for additional funds, two people said.
The clamor around OpenAI shows that even in the most dismal tech downturn in a generation, Silicon Valley’s deal-making machine is still kicking. After a humbling year that included mass layoffs and cuts, tech investors — a naturally optimistic bunch — can’t wait to jump on a hot trend.
No area has created more excitement than generative artificial intelligence, the term for technology that can generate text, images, sounds and other media in response to short prompts. Investors, pundits and journalists have talked up artificial intelligence for years, but the new wave — the result of more than a decade of research — represents a more powerful and more mature breed of AI.
This type of AI promises to reinvent everything from online search engines like Google to photo and graphics editors like Photoshop to digital assistants like Alexa and Siri. Ultimately, it could provide a new way of interacting with almost any software, letting people chat with computers and other devices as if they were chatting with another person.
That has sent deal-making around generative AI companies into overdrive. Jasper, a generative AI startup founded in 2021, raised $125 million in October, valuing it at $1.5 billion. Stability AI, an image generating company founded in 2020, raised $101 million that same month, valuing it at $1 billion. Smaller generative AI companies, including Character.AI, Replika and You.com, have also been inundated with investor interest.
In 2022, investors pumped at least $1.37 billion into generative AI companies across 78 deals, almost as much as they invested in the previous five years combined, according to data from PitchBook, which tracks financial activity across the industry.
OpenAI’s $29 billion valuation was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. Venture capital firms Thrive Capital and Founders Fund may buy shares in the tender offer, two people said. Because OpenAI began as a not-for-profit company, pinpointing its precise valuation is difficult.
OpenAI, Thrive Capital and Founders Fund did not provide comments on the proposed investment.
Companies have developed generative AI for years, including tech giants like Google and Meta as well as ambitious startups like OpenAI. But the technology did not capture the public’s attention until last spring, when OpenAI unveiled a system called DALL-E that let people generate photo-realistic images simply by describing what they wanted to see.
That inspired entrepreneurs to dive in with new ideas and investors to make sweeping proclamations of disruption. Their enthusiasm reached new heights in December after OpenAI released ChatGPT, with fans seizing on the technology to generate love letters and business plans.
“It’s the new ‘mobile’ kind of paradigm shift that we’ve been all waiting for,” said Niko Bonatsos, an investor at venture capital firm General Catalyst. “Maybe bigger, too.”
Investors at Sequoia Capital wrote that generative AI had “the potential to generate trillions of dollars of economic value.” And Lonne Jaffe, an investor at Insight Partners, said, “There is definitely an element to this that feels like the early launch of the internet.”
Google, Meta and other tech giants have been reluctant to release generative technologies to the wider public because these systems often produce toxic content, including misinformation, hate speech and images that are biased against women and people of color. But newer, smaller companies like OpenAI — less concerned with protecting an established corporate brand — have been more willing to get the technology out publicly.
The techniques needed to build generative AI are widely known and freely available through academic research papers and open source software. Google and OpenAI have an advantage because they have access to deep pockets and raw computing power, which are building blocks for the technology.
Still, many top researchers from Google, OpenAI and other leading AI labs have struck out on their own in recent months to found new startups in the field. These startups have received some of the largest funding rounds, with the excitement surrounding ChatGPT and DALL-E prompting venture capital firms to invest in even more young companies.
More than 450 startups are now working on generative AI, by one venture capital firm’s count. And the frenzy has been compounded by investor eagerness to find the next big thing in a gloomy environment.
Michael Dempsey, an investor at venture firm Compound, said the tech downturn — which last year included a crypto crash, poor performing stocks and layoffs at many companies — created a lull among investors.
Then “everyone got excited about AI,” he said. “People need something to tell their investors or themselves, honestly, that there is a next thing to be excited about.”
Some worry the hype around generative AI has gotten ahead of reality. The technology has raised thorny ethical questions around how generative AI may affect copyrights and whether the companies need to get permission to use the data that trains their algorithms. Others believe big tech companies such as Google will quickly trounce the young upstarts, and that some of the new companies have little competitive advantage.
“There are a lot of teams that don’t have any AI competency that are pitching themselves as AI companies,” Dempsey said.
Those concerns have not slowed the swell of excitement, especially after the arrival of Stability AI in October.
The startup had helped fund an open source software project that quickly built image-generating technology that operated much like DALL-E. The difference was that while OpenAI had only shared DALL-E with a small number of testers, Stability AI’s open source version — Stable Diffusion — could be used by anyone. People quickly used the tool to create photo-realistic images of everything from a medieval knight crying in the rain to Disneyland painted by Vincent Van Gogh.
In the ensuing excitement, Eugenia Kuyda, founder and CEO of chat bot startup Replika, said in an interview that she was contacted by “every VC firm in Silicon Valley,” or more than 30 firms. She took their calls but decided against additional funding because her company, founded in 2014, is profitable.
“I feel like the person who was a week early arriving at the airport for a flight — and now the flight is boarding,” she said.
Character.AI, another chat bot company, and You.com, which is adding chat technology to its internet search engine, have also been deluged with interest from venture capitalists, the companies said.
Sharif Shameem, an entrepreneur who built a searchable database for images created by Stable Diffusion in August called Lexica, said his tool rapidly hit 1 million users — a sign he should shift from his existing startup to focusing on Lexica. Within a few weeks, he raised $5 million in funding for the project.
Shameem compared the moment around generative AI to the advent of the iPhone and mobile apps. “It feels like one of those rare opportunities,” he said.
Jaffe of Insight Partners said his firm has since encouraged most of its portfolio companies to consider incorporating generative AI technology into their offerings. “It’s hard to think of a company that couldn’t use it in some way,” he said.
Radical Ventures, a venture firm in Toronto, one of the global centers of AI research, was created five years ago specifically to invest in this kind of technology. It recently launched a new $550 million fund dedicated to AI, with more than half of its investments in generative AI companies. Now those bets look even better.
“For 4 1/2 years, people thought we were nuts,” said Jordan Jacobs, a partner at Radical. “Now, for the past six months, they’ve thought we were geniuses.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: An investment frenzy over "generative artificial intelligence" has gripped Silicon Valley, as tools that generate text, images and sounds in response to short prompts seize the imagination.

The techniques needed to build generative A.I. are widely known and freely available through academic research papers and open source software. Google and OpenAI have an advantage because they have access to deep pockets and raw computing power, which are building blocks for the technology.
Still, many top researchers from Google, OpenAI and other leading A.I. labs have struck out on their own in recent months to found new start-ups in the field. These start-ups have received some of the largest funding rounds, with the excitement surrounding ChatGPT and DALL-E prompting venture capital firms to invest in even more young companies.
More than 450 start-ups are now working on generative A.I., by one venture capital firm's count. And the frenzy has been compounded by investor eagerness to find the next big thing in a gloomy environment.
Michael Dempsey, an investor at the venture firm Compound, said the tech downturn -- which last year included a crypto crash, poor performing stocks and layoffs at many companies -- created a lull among investors.
Then "everyone got excited about A.I.," he said. "People need something to tell their investors or themselves, honestly, that there is a next thing to be excited about."
Some worry the hype around generative A.I. has gotten ahead of reality. The technology has raised thorny ethical questions around how generative A.I. may affect copyrights and whether the companies need to get permission to use the data that trains their algorithms. Others believe big tech companies such as Google will quickly trounce the young upstarts, and that some of the new companies have little competitive advantage.
"There are a lot of teams that don't have any A.I. competency that are pitching themselves as A.I. companies," Mr. Dempsey said.
Those concerns have not slowed the swell of excitement, especially after the arrival of Stability AI in October.
The start-up had helped fund an open source software project that quickly built image-generating technology that operated much like DALL-E. The difference was that while OpenAI had only shared DALL-E with a small number of testers, Stability AI's open source version -- Stable Diffusion -- could be used by anyone. People quickly used the tool to create photo-realistic images of everything from a medieval knight crying in the rain to Disneyland painted by Van Gogh.
In the ensuing excitement, Eugenia Kuyda, founder and chief executive of chat bot start-up Replika, said in an interview that she was contacted by "every V.C. firm in Silicon Valley," or more than 30 firms. She took their calls but decided against additional funding because her company, founded in 2014, is profitable.
"I feel like the person who was a week early arriving at the airport for a flight -- and now the flight is boarding," she said.
Character.AI, another chat bot company, and You.com, which is adding chat technology to its internet search engine, have also been deluged with interest from venture capitalists, the companies said.
Sharif Shameem, an entrepreneur who built a searchable database for images created by Stable Diffusion in August called Lexica, said his tool rapidly hit one million users -- a sign he should shift from his existing start-up to focusing on Lexica. Within a few weeks, he raised $ 5 million in funding for the project.
Mr. Shameem compared the moment around generative A.I. to the advent of the iPhone and mobile apps. "It feels like one of those rare opportunities," he said.
Mr. Jaffe of Insight Ventures said his firm has since encouraged most of its portfolio companies to consider incorporating generative A.I. technology into their offerings. "It's hard to think of a company that couldn't use it in some way," he said.
Radical Ventures, a venture firm in Toronto, one of the global centers of A.I. research, was created five years ago specifically to invest in this kind of technology. It recently launched a new $ 550 million fund dedicated to A.I., with more than half of its investments in generative A.I. companies. Now those bets look even better.
"For four and a half years, people thought we were nuts," said Jordan Jacobs, a partner at Radical. "Now, for the past six months, they've thought we were geniuses."

SAN FRANCISCO — Five weeks ago, OpenAI, a San Francisco artificial intelligence lab, released ChatGPT, a chatbot that answers questions in clear, concise prose. The AI-powered tool immediately caused a sensation, with more than 1 million people using it to create everything from poetry to high school term papers to rewrites of Queen songs.
Now OpenAI is in the midst of a new gold rush.
The lab is in talks to complete a deal that would value it at around $29 billion, more than twice its valuation in 2021, two people with knowledge of the discussions said. The potential deal — where OpenAI would sell existing company shares in a so-called tender offer — could total $300 million, depending on how many employees agree to sell their stock, they said. The company is also in discussions with Microsoft — which invested $1 billion in it in 2019 — for additional funds, two people said.
The clamor around OpenAI shows that even in the most dismal tech downturn in a generation, Silicon Valley’s deal-making machine is still kicking. After a humbling year that included mass layoffs and cuts, tech investors — a naturally optimistic bunch — can’t wait to jump on a hot trend.
No area has created more excitement than generative artificial intelligence, the term for technology that can generate text, images, sounds and other media in response to short prompts. Investors, pundits and journalists have talked up artificial intelligence for years, but the new wave — the result of more than a decade of research — represents a more powerful and more mature breed of AI.
This type of AI promises to reinvent everything from online search engines like Google to photo and graphics editors like Photoshop to digital assistants like Alexa and Siri. Ultimately, it could provide a new way of interacting with almost any software, letting people chat with computers and other devices as if they were chatting with another person.
That has sent deal-making around generative AI companies into overdrive. Jasper, a generative AI startup founded in 2021, raised $125 million in October, valuing it at $1.5 billion. Stability AI, an image generating company founded in 2020, raised $101 million that same month, valuing it at $1 billion. Smaller generative AI companies, including Character.AI, Replika and You.com, have also been inundated with investor interest.
In 2022, investors pumped at least $1.37 billion into generative AI companies across 78 deals, almost as much as they invested in the previous five years combined, according to data from PitchBook, which tracks financial activity across the industry.
OpenAI’s $29 billion valuation was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. Venture capital firms Thrive Capital and Founders Fund may buy shares in the tender offer, two people said. Because OpenAI began as a not-for-profit company, pinpointing its precise valuation is difficult.
OpenAI, Thrive Capital and Founders Fund did not provide comments on the proposed investment.
Companies have developed generative AI for years, including tech giants like Google and Meta as well as ambitious startups like OpenAI. But the technology did not capture the public’s attention until last spring, when OpenAI unveiled a system called DALL-E that let people generate photo-realistic images simply by describing what they wanted to see.
That inspired entrepreneurs to dive in with new ideas and investors to make sweeping proclamations of disruption. Their enthusiasm reached new heights in December after OpenAI released ChatGPT, with fans seizing on the technology to generate love letters and business plans.
“It’s the new ‘mobile’ kind of paradigm shift that we’ve been all waiting for,” said Niko Bonatsos, an investor at venture capital firm General Catalyst. “Maybe bigger, too.”
Investors at Sequoia Capital wrote that generative AI had “the potential to generate trillions of dollars of economic value.” And Lonne Jaffe, an investor at Insight Partners, said, “There is definitely an element to this that feels like the early launch of the internet.”
Google, Meta and other tech giants have been reluctant to release generative technologies to the wider public because these systems often produce toxic content, including misinformation, hate speech and images that are biased against women and people of color. But newer, smaller companies like OpenAI — less concerned with protecting an established corporate brand — have been more willing to get the technology out publicly.

F.T.C. Seeks to Ban Noncompete Deals: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A sweeping proposal by the Federal Trade Commission would block companies from limiting their employees' ability to work for a rival.
In a far-reaching move that could raise wages and increase competition among businesses, the Federal Trade Commission on Thursday unveiled a rule that would block companies from limiting their employees' ability to work for a rival.
The proposed rule would ban provisions of labor contracts known as noncompete agreements, which prevent workers from leaving for a competitor or starting a competing business for months or years after their employment, often within a certain geographic area. The agreements have applied to workers as varied as sandwich makers, hairstylists, doctors and software engineers.
Studies show that noncompetes, which appear to directly affect roughly 20 percent to 45 percent of U.S. workers in the private sector, hold down pay because job switching is one of the more reliable ways of securing a raise. Many economists believe they help explain why pay for middle-income workers has stagnated in recent decades.
Other studies show that noncompetes protect established companies from start-ups, reducing competition within industries. The arrangements may also harm productivity by making it hard for companies to hire workers who best fit their needs.
The F.T.C. proposal is the latest in a series of aggressive and sometimes unorthodox moves to rein in the power of large companies under the agency's chair, Lina Khan.
President Biden hailed the proposal on Thursday, saying that noncompete clauses "are designed simply to lower people's wages."
"These agreements block millions of retail workers, construction workers and other working folks from taking a better job, getting better pay and benefits, in the same field," he said at a cabinet meeting.
The public will be allowed to submit comments on the proposal for 60 days, at which point the agency will move to make it final. An F.T.C. document said the rule would take effect 180 days after the final version was published, but experts said it could face legal challenges.
The agency estimated that the rule could increase wages by nearly $ 300 billion a year across the economy. Evan Starr, an economist at the University of Maryland who has studied noncompetes, said that was a plausible wage increase after their elimination.
Dr. Starr said noncompetes appeared to lower wages both for workers directly covered by them and for other workers, partly by making the hiring process more costly for employers, who must spend time figuring out whom they can hire and whom they can't.
He pointed to research showing that wages tended to be higher in states that restrict noncompetes. One study found that wages for newly hired tech workers in Hawaii increased by about 4 percent after the state banned noncompetes for those workers. In Oregon, where new noncompetes became unenforceable for low-wage workers in 2008, the change appeared to raise the wages of hourly workers by 2 percent to 3 percent.
Although noncompetes appear to be more common among more highly paid and more educated workers, many companies have used them for low-wage hourly workers and even interns.
About half of states significantly constrain the use of noncompetes, and a small number have deemed them largely unenforceable, including California.
But even in such states, companies often include noncompetes in employment contracts, and many workers in these states report turning down job offers partly as a result of the provisions, suggesting that these state regulations may have limited effects. Many workers in those states are not necessarily aware that the provisions are unenforceable, experts say.
"Research shows that employers' use of noncompetes to restrict workers' mobility significantly suppresses workers' wages -- even for those not subject to noncompetes, or subject to noncompetes that are unenforceable under state law," Elizabeth Wilkins, the director of the F.T.C.'s office of policy planning, said in a statement.
The commission's proposal appears to address this issue by requiring employers to withdraw existing noncompetes and to inform workers that they no longer apply. The proposal would also make it illegal for an employer to enter into a noncompete with a worker or to try to do so, or to suggest that a worker is bound by a noncompete when he or she is not.
The proposal covers not just employees but also independent contractors, interns, volunteers and other workers.
Defenders of noncompetes argue that employees are free to turn down a job if they want to preserve their ability to join another company, or that they can bargain for higher pay in return for accepting the restriction. Proponents also argue that noncompetes make employers more likely to invest in training and to share sensitive information with workers, which they might withhold if they feared that a worker might quickly leave.
A ban "ignores the fact that, when appropriately used, noncompete agreements are an important tool in fostering innovation," Sean Heather, a senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.
At least one study has found that greater enforcement of noncompetes leads to an increase in job creation by start-ups, though some of its conclusions are at odds with other research.
Dr. Starr said that noncompetes did appear to encourage businesses to invest more in training, but that there was little evidence that most employees entered into them voluntarily or that they were able to bargain over them. One study found that only 10 percent of workers sought to bargain for concessions in return for signing a noncompete. About one-third became aware of the noncompete only after accepting a job offer.
Michael R. Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said that while there were good reasons to scale back noncompetes for lower-wage workers, the rationale was less clear for better-paid workers with specialized knowledge or skills.
"If your job is to make minor tweaks to the formula for Coca-Cola and you're one of 25 people on earth who knows the formula," Dr. Strain said, speaking hypothetically, "it makes total sense that Coca-Cola might say, 'We don't want you to go work for Pepsi."'
He said that it might be possible to satisfy an employer's concerns with a less blunt tool, like a nondisclosure agreement, but that the evidence for this was lacking.
In a video call with reporters on Wednesday, Ms. Khan said she believed the F.T.C. had clear authority to issue the rule, noting that federal law empowers the agency to prohibit "unfair methods of competition."
But Kristen Limarzi, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who previously served as a senior official in the antitrust division of the Justice Department, said she believed such a rule could be vulnerable to a legal challenge. Opponents would probably argue that the relevant federal statute is too vague to guide the agency in putting forth a rule banning noncompetes, she said, and that the evidence the agency has on their effects is still too limited to support a rule.
At the helm of the F.T.C. since last year, Ms. Khan has tried to use the agency's authority in untested ways to rein in the power and influence of corporate giants. In doing so, she and her allies hope to reverse a turn in recent decades toward more conservative antitrust law -- a shift that they say enabled runaway concentration, limited options for consumers and squeezed small businesses.
Ms. Khan has brought lawsuits in recent months to block Meta, Facebook's parent company, from buying a virtual reality start-up and Microsoft from buying the video game publisher Activision Blizzard. Both cases employ less common legal arguments that are likely to face heavy scrutiny from courts. But Ms. Khan has indicated she is willing to lose cases if the agency ends up taking more risks.
Ms. Khan and her counterpart at the Justice Department's antitrust division, Jonathan Kanter, have also said they want to increase the focus of the nation's antitrust agencies on empowering workers. Last year, the Justice Department successfully blocked Penguin Random House from buying Simon & Schuster using the argument that the deal would lower compensation for authors.
One question looming over the discussion of noncompetes is what effect banning them may have on prices during a period of high inflation, given that limiting noncompetes tends to raise wages.
But the experience of the past two years, when rates of quitting and job-hopping have been unusually high, suggests that noncompetes may not currently be as big an obstacle to worker mobility as they have traditionally been. Partly as a result, banning them may not have much of a short-term effect on wages.
Instead, some economists say, the more pronounced effect of a ban may come in the intermediate and long term, once the job market softens and workers no longer have as much leverage. At that point, noncompetes could begin to weigh more heavily on job switching and wages again.
"Doing something like this is a way to help sustain the increase in worker power over the last couple of years," said Heidi Shierholz, president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute, who was chief economist at the Labor Department during the Obama administration.

Hot Reading on Job Market Cools Stocks: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Stocks fell broadly on Wall Street and Treasury yields rose Thursday after another hot reading on the job market raised worries that the Federal Reserve will need to keep inflicting pain on the economy to fight inflation.
The S&P 500 fell 1.2 percent, clawing back all of its gains from a day earlier. The benchmark index is on pace for its fifth straight weekly loss. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1 percent and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.5 percent. Small company stocks also lost ground, with the Russell 2000 index falling by 1.1 percent.
Technology, health care and industrial stocks weighed most on the market. Microsoft fell 3 percent, UnitedHealth Group slid 2.9 percent and Honeywell International lost 2.7 percent.
Energy stocks bucked the broader market slide as the price of U.S. crude oil settled 1.1 percent higher. Exxon Mobil rose 2.2 percent.
The pullback came after the payroll company ADP reported a bigger-than-expected increase in jobs at private companies last month. The U.S. government also reported that the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell to the lowest level in more than three months last week.
On Wednesday, a government report showed a higher than expected number of job openings in November. The strong labor market reports set the stage for the release on Friday of the Labor Department's snapshot of hiring in December.
In recent months, that closely watched monthly employment figure has typically come in stronger than expected when following a robust ADP jobs report, according to Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network.
"The real question for investors tomorrow will be whether the economy continues to grow faster than expected -- and faster than the Fed wants -- or will it stay in a sweeter spot with continued moderate growth," he wrote Thursday. "The data suggests the former."
The continued strength in the job market makes the Fed's job of reining in inflation more difficult by putting upward pressure on wages. The central bank remains determined to keep interest rates high to slow economic growth and tame inflation. The strategy, though, risks bringing on a recession.
The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for future Fed actions, was steady throughout most of the early morning, but rose significantly after the latest jobs reports. It jumped to 4.46 percent from 4.36 percent late Wednesday.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, rose to 3.72 percent. The nation's housing market has slowed sharply over the past year as the average rate on the benchmark 30-year mortgage more than doubled.
The Fed's benchmark lending rate stands at a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, up from close to zero after seven increases last year. It has forecast that the rate will reach a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent by the end of 2023, and it isn't calling for a rate cut before 2024.
Inflation has been easing from a peak of 9.1 percent in June to 7.1 percent in November, and investors have been hoping for signs that could prompt the Fed to ease up on applying the brakes to the economy with high interest rates. Those hopes have been dashed so far.
Meanwhile, Wall Street is looking ahead to the latest round of corporate earnings to get a better a sense of how companies are handling hot inflation and weakening consumer demand. Companies in the S&P 500 will pick up the pace of reporting in a few weeks, but some results are already trickling in.
The French fry maker Lamb Weston rose 9.8 percent and the Hunt's ketchup maker ConAgra rose 3.4 percent after reporting strong results for their most recent quarters.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: At 19, when I began drafting my webcomic, I had just been flung into adulthood. I felt a little awkward, a little displaced. The glittering veneer of social media, which back then was mostly Facebook, told me that everyone around me had their lives together while I felt like a withering ball of mediocrity. But surely, I believed, I could not be the only one who felt that life was mostly an uphill battle of difficult moments and missed social cues.
I started my webcomic back in 2011, before "relatable" humor was as ubiquitous online as it is today. At the time, the comics were overtly simple, often drawn shakily in Microsoft Paint or poorly scanned sketchbook pages. The jokes were less punchline-oriented and more of a question: Do you feel this way too? I wrote about the small daily struggles of missed clock alarms, ill-fitting clothes and cringe-worthy moments.
I had hoped, at most, for a small, niche following, but to my elation, I had viral success. My first comic to reach a sizable audience was about simply not wanting to get up in the morning, and it was met with a chorus of "this is so me." I felt as if I had my finger on the pulse of the collective underdog. To have found this way of communicating with others and to make it my work was, and remains, among the greatest gifts and privileges of my life.
But the attention was not all positive. In late 2016, I caught the eye of someone on the 4chan board /pol/. There was no particular incident that prompted the harassment, but in hindsight, I was a typical target for such groups. I am a woman, the messaging in the comics is feminist leaning, and importantly, the simplicity of my work makes it easy to edit and mimic. People on the forum began reproducing my work and editing it to reflect violently racist messages advocating genocide and Holocaust denial, complete with swastikas and the introduction of people getting pushed into ovens. The images proliferated online, with sites like Twitter and Reddit rarely taking them down.
A recent example of my work
The ways my images were altered were crude, but a few were convincing. Through the bombardment of my social media with these images, the alt-right created a shadow version of me, a version that advocated neo-Nazi ideology. At times people fell for it. I received outraged messages and had to contact my publisher to make my stance against this ultraclear. I started receiving late-night calls and had to change my number, and I got the distinct impression that the alt-right wanted a public meltdown.
At one point, someone appeared to have made a typeface, or a font, out of my handwriting. Something about the mimicking of my handwriting, streamlined into an easily accessible typeface, felt particularly violating. Handwriting is personal and intimate to me, a detail that defines me as much other unique traits like the color of my eyes or my name. I can easily recognize the handwriting of my family members and friends -- it is literally their signature. Something about this new typeface made me feel as if the person who had created it was trying to program a piece of my soul.
One of the images created by the alt-right
The harassment shocked the naïveté out of my system. A shadow me hung over my head constantly, years after the harassment campaign ended. I had been writing differently, always trying to stay one step ahead of how my drawings could be twisted. Every deranged image the alt-right created required someone sitting down and physically editing or drawing it, and this took time and effort, allowing me to outpace them and salvage my career.
And then along comes artificial intelligence. In October, I was sent via Twitter an image generated by A.I. from a random fan who had used my name as a prompt. It wasn't perfect, but the contours of my style were there. The notion that someone could type my name into a generator and produce an image in my style immediately disturbed me. This was not a human creating fan art or even a malicious troll copying my style; this was a generator that could spit out several images in seconds. With some technical improvement, I could see how the process of imitating my work would soon become fast and streamlined, and the many dark potentials bubbled to the forefront of my mind.
I felt violated. The way I draw is the complex culmination of my education, the comics I devoured as a child and the many small choices that make up the sum of my life. The details are often more personal than people realize -- the striped shirt my character wears, for instance, is a direct nod to the protagonist of "Calvin and Hobbes," my favorite newspaper comic. Even when a person copies me, the many variations and nuances in things like line weight make exact reproductions difficult. Humans cannot help bringing their own humanity into art. Art is deeply personal, and A.I. had just erased the humanity from it by reducing my life's work to an algorithm.
A.I. text-to-image generators such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and DALL-E exploded onto the scene this year and in mere months have become widely used to create all sorts of images, ranging from digital art pieces to character designs. Stable Diffusion alone has more than 10 million daily users. These A.I. products are built on collections of images known as "data sets," from which a detailed map of the data set's contents, the "model," is formed by finding the connections among images and between images and words. Images and text are linked in the data set, so the model learns how to associate words with images. It can then make a new image based on the words you type in.
An A.I. generated image that I created
when I used my name as a prompt
The data set for Stable Diffusion is called LAION 5b and was built by collecting close to six billion images from the internet in a practice called data scraping. Most, if not all, A.I. generators have my work in their data sets.
Legally, it appears as though LAION was able to scour what seems like the entire internet because it deems itself a nonprofit organization engaging in academic research. While it was funded at least in part by Stability AI, the company that created Stable Diffusion, it is technically a separate entity. Stability AI then used its nonprofit research arm to create A.I. generators first via Stable Diffusion and then commercialized in a new model called DreamStudio.
So what makes up these data sets? Well, pretty much everything. For artists, many of us had what amounted to our entire portfolios fed into the data set without our consent. This means that A.I. generators were built on the backs of our copyrighted work, and through a legal loophole, they were able to produce copies of varying levels of sophistication. When I checked the website haveibeentrained.com, a site created to allow people to search LAION data sets, so much of my work was on there that it filled up my entire desktop screen.
Many artists are not completely against the technology but felt blindsided by the lack of consideration for our craft. Being able to imitate a living artist has obvious implications for our careers, and some artists are already dealing with real challenges to their livelihood. Concept artists create works for films, video games, character designs and more. Greg Rutkowski, a hugely popular concept artist, has been used in a prompt for Stable Diffusion upward of 100,000 times. Now, his name is no longer attached to just his own work, but it also summons a slew of imitations of varying quality that he hasn't approved. This could confuse clients, and it muddies the consistent and precise output he usually produces. When I saw what was happening to him, I thought of my battle with my shadow self. We were each fighting a version of ourself that looked similar but that was uncanny, twisted in a way to which we didn't consent.
It gets darker. The LAION data sets have also been found to include photos of extreme violence, medical records and nonconsensual pornography. There's a chance that somewhere in there lurks a photo of you. There are some guardrails for the more well-known A.I. generators, such as limiting certain search terms, but that doesn't change the fact that the data set is still rife with disturbing material, and that users can find ways around the term limitations. Furthermore, because LAION is open source, people are creating new A.I. generators that don't have these same guardrails and that are often used to make pornography.
In theory, everyone is at risk for their work or image to become a vulgarity with A.I., but I suspect those who will be the most hurt are those who are already facing the consequences of improving technology, namely members of marginalized groups. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for instance, has an entire saga of deep-fake nonconsensual pornography attached to her image. I can only imagine that some of her more malicious detractors would be more than happy to use A.I. to harass her further. In the future, with A.I. technology, many more people will have a shadow self with whom they must reckon. Once the features that we consider personal and unique -- our facial structure, our handwriting, the way we draw -- can be programmed and contorted at the click of a mouse, the possibilities for violations are endless.
I've been playing around with several generators, and so far none have mimicked my style in a way that can directly threaten my career, a fact that will almost certainly change as A.I. continues to improve. It's undeniable; the A.I.s know me. Most have captured the outlines and signatures of my comics -- black hair, bangs, striped T-shirts. To others, it may look like a drawing taking shape.
I see a monster forming.
