Full text: Sales of the company's cars are flagging, but investors are focusing on the potential of autonomous driving and Mr. Musk's ties to President-elect Donald J. Trump.
Tesla's sales of electric cars have stalled. But Wall Street doesn't seem to be worried.
Investors have taken an optimistic view of the company's progress in autonomous driving and bet that its chief executive, Elon Musk, will use his new influence in Washington to Tesla's benefit. Even after a decline on Friday, the company's share price has risen nearly 80 percent since early November.
The increase in the value of Mr. Musk's 13 percent stake in Tesla has cemented his status as the richest person on the planet. After spending more than $ 250 million to support Donald J. Trump, he has become so close to the president-elect that some people have begun referring to him as "co-president."
Still, stagnant sales at Tesla do not bode well for the company or for overall sales of electric vehicles, which are seen as an essential tool against climate change. While carmakers like General Motors and Hyundai are offering a growing selection of electric vehicles, Tesla still accounts for almost half of all electric car sales in the United States and sets the tone for technology.
Mr. Musk has been vocal about many topics on X, the social media platform he owns. He regularly discusses government spending he believes is wasteful, immigrants he blames for crime and his conviction that "woke mind virus is one of the biggest threats to the existence of humanity."
But he is largely silent about plans to revive Tesla's sales, providing few details about a new budget-priced car that may sell for as little as $ 25,000. The company has promised to begin selling a more affordable vehicle by mid-2025 to bring electric driving within reach of the middle class.
Tesla and Mr. Musk did not respond to requests for comment.
Some analysts wonder whether he has lost interest in cars as he juggles numerous other activities. They include X; SpaceX, the federal government's main rocket contractor; and his role as co-head of a newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, which will advise Mr. Trump on slashing federal spending.
Mr. Musk has not shown the same level of dedication to carmaking that he did in 2018 when Tesla was struggling to mass-produce the Model 3 and he slept at the factory, said Kenneth Boyer, a professor of business at Ohio State University.
"He was all in," said Mr. Boyer, whose recent book, "The Electric Vehicle Revolution: Five Visionaries Leading the Charge," includes a chapter on Mr. Musk. "The question now is, what is Elon committed to, or is he spread too thin?"
Tesla is about to release its sales figures for the last three months of 2024. Data and estimates available so far indicate that its sales have fallen in all of its major markets.
In the United States, Tesla sales will be down around 6 percent in 2024, a bigger decline than any carmaker except the troubled Stellantis, according to estimates by Cox Automotive. Tesla will end the year with 633,000 cars sold in the United States, Cox expects, giving it a 4 percent share of the total car market.
Sales of Teslas may have spiked toward the end of the year as buyers rushed to take advantage of federal tax credits, worth up to $ 7,500, that Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress may repeal or slash.
In the European Union, Tesla sales through November fell 15 percent from a year earlier, to 211,000 cars, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Tesla sales also slipped in China, the world's largest car market.
It was inevitable that Tesla, a pioneer in battery-powered cars, would lose market share as other carmakers introduced more such models. Until a few years ago, Tesla had the market largely to itself. Now, it faces stiff competition from the likes of BYD in China, Volkswagen and BMW in Europe, and G.M., Ford Motor and others in the United States.
But Tesla's situation appears to be more concerning. Its sales are falling even as the overall market for electric vehicles grows, rising 25 percent through November globally, according to Rho Motion, a research firm.
Some investors hope that a new, cheaper Tesla could supercharge sales. The least expensive Tesla, the Model 3 sedan, starts at $ 42,500 in the United States before government incentives.
A $ 25,000 Tesla would make electric cars accessible to many more buyers. The average sales price for electric vehicles currently on the market is more than twice that.
"The idea of Tesla being able to open up the market to a wider range of buyers with an even more affordable option than the Model 3 -- that is what has investors most excited," said Ben Rose, president of Battle Road Research, who expects Tesla shares to outperform the broader stock market.
But Mr. Rose acknowledged, "This seems to be the product that Elon Musk is least excited about."
Tesla has not displayed a prototype or revealed much information about a lower-cost vehicle's price or performance. That contrasts with the company's Cybertruck, a futuristic pickup that Tesla unveiled in 2019, four years before it went on sale.
Aside from the Cybertruck, which starts at $ 80,000, Tesla has not introduced a completely new vehicle since the Model Y sport utility vehicle in 2020. (Tesla did begin selling an updated version of the Model 3 this year.)
Early indications are that the angular, stainless steel Cybertruck does not have broad enough appeal or a low enough price to revive the company's overall sales. Tesla sold 28,000 Cybertrucks through September, according to Cox, making it the best-selling electric pickup in the United States. But the company sells only a tenth as many Cybertrucks as it does the Model Y, Tesla's most popular vehicle.
Car shoppers are yearning for less expensive electric vehicles. Used Model 3s priced around $ 25,000 are among the fastest-selling vehicles on CarGurus.com, said Kevin Roberts, director of economic and market intelligence at the online sales site. "When the price comes down, the interest is there," he said.
Mr. Musk has displayed much more enthusiasm when talking about Tesla's plans to sell self-driving cars that could function as driverless taxis. Tesla's share-price gain has been driven largely by faith in Mr. Musk's ability to deliver the technology and optimism that his pull with the new administration will help clear away regulatory hurdles.
Most analysts believe wide use of self-driving taxis is still years away, though they are starting to hit the road in some places. Waymo, a division of Google's parent company, offers driverless taxi rides in San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles and is expanding to Atlanta, Miami and Austin, Texas. Many companies are also testing autonomous taxis extensively in China.
But many investors appear to be convinced that Tesla will come to dominate the self-driving taxi business.
The share price "is very strongly tied to what people think of Elon Musk," said Leonard Kostovetsky, an associate professor at the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College, "whether you think he is a genius or just lucky."

Full text: The value of a possible merger between Honda and Nissan.
Honda and Nissan are exploring a merger that would create one of the world's largest automakers. The tie-up, valued at $ 50 billion, would be the latest consolidation of car companies aimed at sharing the financial burden of developing electric vehicles.
The Japan-based companies formally agreed last Monday to begin talks on combining their operations, with the goal of completing a merger by August 2026. Honda and Nissan sold a combined total of around seven million vehicles last year, a sum behind only Toyota and Volkswagen.
The talks come as more car companies are looking for creative ways to handle research, production and sales of electric vehicles. Automakers have invested billions in E.V. development, financing those efforts primarily through sales of gasoline and hybrid cars. But those efforts have so far failed to generate a profit.
"Current business models are being upended," Toshihiro Mibe, Honda's chief executive, said at a briefing in Tokyo. "It is not going to take 10 to 20 years for that to happen -- it will come much faster."
Gasoline-powered cars generally remain cheaper and more popular in the United States than electric vehicles, and E.V. sales have slowed in the last year, a trend that may continue if President-elect Donald J. Trump removes federal tax credits for buying and leasing electric vehicles.
Some analysts have argued that the merger is necessary for the two automakers to have enough firepower to compete in an increasingly crowded industry. Yet combining two large global operations is incredibly difficult. Past mergers between big auto companies have often failed to achieve their objectives, and this time could be no different, said Thomas Stallkamp, an automotive consultant based in Michigan.
"You try to put two of them together and you run into a lot of egos and infighting, so it's very, very difficult to make it work," Mr. Stallkamp said.
"Union baristas know their value, and they're not going to accept a proposal that doesn't treat them as true partners."
Lynne Fox, the president of Workers United, the union that represents more than 10,000 Starbucks employees, announcing that a strike had expanded to 300 stores nationwide.
"The 7-hour -- and counting -- adventure of rescheduled and delayed flights has resulted in me spending more of Christmas Eve at the D.F.W. Pizza Hut Bar than with my wife, waiting for me in Tucson."
Desmond Zantua of Queens, stuck at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, after American Airlines grounded flights because of a technical glitch and bad weather.
"They have no authorities whatsoever. They don't control the scope of government. They don't control the size of government."
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former chief economist under President George W. Bush, on whether Mr. Trump and his allies can meaningfully cut government spending.

Europe Had a Terrible Year. It's Only Going to Get Worse.: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Early this year, France's center-right Republicans decided to move to a new home. After a decade of demoralizing defeats, the party vacated its headquarters for one closer to France's National Assembly, hoping the move would bring a change in fortune.
It was not to be. June brought disastrous results in European Parliament elections and the prospect of more in a snap election called by President Emmanuel Macron. In response, the president of the Republicans, Éric Ciotti, threw in his lot with the ascendant National Rally, the far-right party of Marine Le Pen. But he did so without consulting the party's other leaders, to whom the alliance remained anathema. When they tried to remove him from his post, he simply dismissed the staff and locked the doors.
Mr. Ciotti's lockout is emblematic of the season of political chaos Europeans have lived through this past year. Such collapses and reversals have now become the norm. Within three months of taking office, the French government that was painstakingly put together after the election fell apart; the German government soon followed suit. As 2024 draws to a close, two of the European Union's founding nations find themselves politically adrift.
Europe's growing far right, meanwhile, has only entrenched its position. This summer's European elections were marked by breakout performances for the hard right across the union, and there were major advances on the national level. In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders's Party for Freedom forged a government coalition; Giorgia Meloni, Italy's postfascist prime minister, saw her popularity deepen; and the far-right Alternative for Germany surged to become the country's second-most-popular party.
Europe's extreme right has moved past the point of normalization; now a regular force of government, it is becoming almost banal. For Europe, its consolidation caps a year of tumult. Judging from the continent's parlous economic situation and general social disarray, matters are only going to get worse.
A decade ago, Europe presented a very different face to the world. In Greece the radical-left party Syriza was about to rise to power on the back of resistance to austerity imposed by the so-called troika of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the Eurogroup. In France a center-left president, François Hollande, was being hounded by rebels on the left of his party. And in Britain a socialist backbencher named Jeremy Corbyn was soon to claim the leadership of the Labour Party.
All of this reads like ancient history today. Syriza, which ultimately carried out the austerity it had campaigned against, lost power in 2019 and splintered after a former Goldman Sachs trader was elected as its leader. Mr. Corbyn has been kicked out of the party he once led, and the French left has been sidelined by Mr. Macron's penchant for cutting deals with the right. Die Linke, once a credible challenger to the Greens and Social Democrats for leadership on the German left, risks disappearing from Parliament in the country's upcoming elections.
This decline is not the result of a political law of nature. Instead, Europe's current political constellation owes much to a cohort of politicians and officials who held sway in the 2010s across the continent. Following Angela Merkel's lead during her 16-year stint as Germany's chancellor, it was they who set the terms of European politics that have now come back to haunt policymakers. Their response, for instance, to the euro crisis -- the seemingly never-ending financial troubles that followed the crash of 2008 -- was to offer a damaging blend of moralism and technocracy.
Doubling down on punitive austerity measures, Jeroen Dijsselbloem -- Ms. Merkel's lieutenant as head of an informal grouping of eurozone finance ministers -- claimed that the debt-ridden governments of Southern Europe had wasted their money on "schnapps and women." For his part, Jean-Claude Juncker, then chief of the European Commission, admonished Greeks that there was "no need to commit suicide because you are afraid of dying." Led by Ms. Merkel, Europe's politicians insisted on obeisance to financial markets and European etiquette, no matter the consequences.
Today the costs of this aggressive aversion to change have become starkly apparent. In the past decade and a half, continental growth indicators have gone from stagnant to concerning. In a recent X-ray of the European economy, Mario Draghi, a former head of the European Central Bank and former prime minister of Italy, sounded a belated alarm as to the grim extent of the decline: lack of innovation, lagging productivity and general economic underperformance. The continent's economic future looks impossibly bleak.
The wallop has been a long time coming. Occupied with disciplining Europe's periphery, policymakers in Berlin missed a reckoning with Germany's economic model. A book published this year by the German commentator Wolfgang Münchau required no more than two syllables to sum up the results of this procrastination: "Kaput." His list of causes for the downturn is familiar: the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which together spurred a global price fever and cut off the usual source of energy on which German factories ran -- an inflationary spiral compounded by America's trade wars. For an economy coasting by, these shocks proved worse than destabilizing.
Germany's prized export sector especially suffered from such complacency. For years, reports of an impending green revolution in electric vehicle production were dismissed. Now an industrial doomsday is dawning: Germany's car producers have seen themselves priced out of their trusty Chinese markets, steadily served by Chinese producers. As catastrophic growth forecasts told a story of their own in October, Volkswagen announced it was closing factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history, with severe knock-on effects for neighboring economies in Belgium, Poland and the Netherlands.
Economically, the Merkel consensus sowed the seeds of stagnation. Politically, it wound up destroying dissidence to its left while allowing discontent on the right to thrive. As inflation pushes the cost of living skyward and real wages stagnate, European electorates have been left with the sense that the levers of policy are slipping from their grasp. Railing against immigration -- long a source of ire for many across the Western world -- and engaging in Americanized culture wars at least allow a cathartic release and the illusion of control.
In this environment, far-right forces have predictably prospered, alternately tolerated and co-opted by the political center. In seven out of 27 countries in the European Union, from Finland to Italy, the far right now directly participates in government. In the newly assembled European Commission led by Ursula von der Leyen, a key ally of Ms. Meloni holds an important vice-presidential position. Rather than the bloc fending off the far right, the prospect seems to be a far-right European Union, in which the mainstream chases the extremes.
To some outsiders, this might give off an image of strength. Where foreign policy, military affairs or energy independence are concerned, however, Europe appears more and more rudderless in a stormy world. For a continent that once saw itself as a middle way between the unbridled market capitalism of the United States and the various authoritarians stationed farther east, it's a bitter irony that it now seems headed for pale imitations of both. And with Donald Trump around the corner, the hard times might have only just begun.

Full text: General Motors has gone from market leader to also-ran in the world's largest car market, stymied by its own missteps and Chinese policies that favored its local rivals.
General Motors was a pioneer in China, where for a quarter-century the company drew enormous profits and vied with Germany's Volkswagen as the top seller of cars.
Those days are over.
G.M.'s sales in China have entered a death spiral, falling 42.5 percent in the first 11 months of this year. The company now ranks 16th by sales. The dizzying collapse of its China business forced G.M. to take a roughly $ 5 billion charge against profits this month.
It was a drastic comedown for the company, which started in China in 1996 with an initial investment of $ 350 million and went on to build a network of factories, churning out vehicles and sending billions in profits to its headquarters in Detroit.
G.M.'s early China executives were highly responsive to the unique characteristics of the market. They built bulky minivans with lots of sparkling chrome to appeal to leaders of the state-owned companies that were big customers. They sold Buicks, a faded brand in the United States that still had cachet in China. For rural farmers, G.M. offered vans and pickup trucks with flimsy seats and no air-conditioning that cost only $ 5,000.
In many ways, the story of G.M. in China tracks the experience of all foreign automakers in what is now the world's largest car market.
China allowed foreign carmakers like G.M. into the country only as part of a publicly stated, long-term policy to gain technology and build its own globally competitive industry. Government leaders were also intent early on to shift away from cars that needed gasoline, which China mostly imports, and toward electric cars powered by energy sources at home like coal, solar and wind.
G.M. executives foresaw China's strength, particularly in electric cars. "China is well positioned to lead in this," David Tulauskas, an early G.M. director of China government policy, said in a 2009 interview.
But after years of success, G.M. has found it increasingly difficult to compete with Chinese rivals or adapt to the rise of electric cars.
Government policies that forced G.M. into joint ventures with Chinese companies meant that G.M. ended up teaching much of what it knew about car manufacturing to local rivals that now outsell it.
Since 2008, Beijing has collected taxes totaling more than 100 percent on large, imported cars and sport utility vehicles. The taxes are so high that G.M. does not even try to import some models, like the Cadillac Escalade. That full-size S.U.V. starts at $ 87,595 in the United States but costs $ 186,000 including tax in China, when purchased through an import agent.
Electric cars made in China face only a 13 percent tax.
In addition to wielding tax policy at foreign carmakers, Beijing limited or blocked government subsidies for cars built by foreign companies. Partly as a result, G.M. has not competed effectively in battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid cars. These models together accounted for 52.3 percent of the Chinese market in November, the China Passenger Car Association announced last week. That was up from 32.8 percent in January.
These fast-growing categories account for less than 20 percent of G.M. sales this year -- while its sales of gasoline-powered cars have halved.
The Chinese market transformed much faster than anyone expected. The government's target in 2017 was for one in five cars sold in 2025 not to run on gasoline or diesel.
G.M. declined to make any executives available for interviews for this article. The company provided a statement expressing optimism that its main operations in China, a joint venture with the state-owned SAIC Motor of Shanghai that makes Chevrolets, Buicks and Cadillacs, would return to health.
"G.M. is working closer than ever with our joint-venture partner SAIC to restore the business in China to make it profitable and sustainable," the company said. SAIC did not respond to requests for comment.
The architect of G.M.'s early successes was Philip F. Murtaugh, an obscure middle manager who had grown up on an Ohio farm. He went straight from high school in 1973 to the General Motors Institute, a company-sponsored college in Flint, Mich., where students worked while also taking classes. Mr. Murtaugh toiled in a factory that stamped car body parts.
Working up the ranks, Mr. Murtaugh, who spoke no Chinese, was given a crucial role on the team that negotiated G.M.'s joint venture with SAIC. While the rest of the team went back to the United States, Mr. Murtaugh stayed in Shanghai to run the new business.
China's car market was tiny -- 400,000 cars were sold in 1998. Today that number is 27 million.
One early win for the joint venture was the Buick GL8 luxury minivan for corporate fleets. Introduced in 1999, it was designed to maximize interior space but was just small enough to avoid being categorized as a commercial vehicle and tagged with a yellow sticker on a fender. A quarter-century later, luxury-apartment parking lots in Beijing and Shanghai still have many of the latest GL8s.
Next came the Buick LaCrosse sedan. In the early 2000s, Chinese consumers developed a growing taste for car ownership. G.M. executives noticed that many of these buyers were hiring drivers and riding in the back seat. Collaborating with SAIC, G.M. designed a version of the LaCrosse with extra legroom for rear-seat passengers.
Rival executives watched the joint venture's success and fumed. "I struggled with that, because I couldn't persuade people in Detroit, in Auburn Hills, to pay attention to the back seat," said Bill Russo, the top executive in China then for Chrysler, which had its headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich.
Introduced in February 2006, the special LaCrosse minted fortunes for G.M. in China. A year later, as Chinese motorists demanded fuel economy and new technology, the joint venture introduced a gasoline-electric hybrid version of the LaCrosse.
Mr. Murtaugh arranged in 2002 for G.M. to pay just $ 31 million to buy a 34 percent stake in Wuling, an obscure Chinese manufacturer in the mountains of southwestern China. Wuling made spartan, low-price vans. G.M.'s top executives in Detroit were initially skeptical of investments in economy cars. They later raised the company's stake in Wuling to 44 percent after the utilitarian vehicles proved popular in rural China.
But shortly before the first LaCrosse went on sale in China, and as Wuling's potential was only starting to become clear, Mr. Murtaugh was out of a job. His fast-growing and highly autonomous empire 7,000 miles from G.M. headquarters was earning close to $ 2 million a day by 2005. But the company's North American operations were struggling, losing about $ 10 million a day.
G.M. leaders in Michigan decided to seek greater economies from large-scale production, the company's century-old formula for success. They integrated the China joint venture's car designs, procurement and other units into respective divisions in Detroit.
Mr. Murtaugh lost his independence and most of his authority, and resigned in protest. Unemployed at 49 for the first time in his life, he left Shanghai for a home in Kentucky. Mr. Murtaugh later worked briefly for SAIC and then a succession of Chinese start-ups, but did not repeat his success at G.M. He declined to comment for this article.
At the G.M.-SAIC joint venture, the pace of hits began to slow.
In 2007, the same year the LaCrosse hybrid went on sale, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, chose a former Audi engineer, Wan Gang, to become the country's minister of science and technology. Mr. Wan would stay in the job for 11 years and, with instructions from the country's top leaders to spend whatever it took, oversaw the initial conversion of the Chinese auto industry to electric cars.
"If you compare it to Western governments' back and forth, the Chinese government's unswerving commitment to the development of the E.V. market gave companies and investors the confidence to go forward," said Stephen Dyer, a former Ford Motor executive in China who now leads Asia automotive consulting at AlixPartners.
In response to changes in the Chinese market, G.M. decided in 2011 to import the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, which had been developed with assistance from the Obama administration. But the Chinese government told G.M. that the Volt would not qualify for government subsidies -- up to $ 19,300 per car -- unless G.M. agreed to transfer electric car technology to SAIC Motor, like how to make powerful batteries that could be recharged many times.
G.M. faced pressure from Congress not to share technologies developed partly with federal money. The company agreed to transfer electric car technology to the joint venture, but not the Volt's technology. As a result, the model did not qualify for the Chinese subsidies, which doomed it to be uncompetitive.
G.M. then became more cautious in its approach to China. Executives at Volkswagen, Ford and other automakers had long warned that G.M. was sharing too much advanced technology with SAIC. G.M. executives in the United States began to have the same worry.
The joint venture began building many cars in China using a lower-tech vehicle technology that lost appeal as the country became more affluent and Chinese automakers learned to build better cars. G.M. transferred designers and engineers from its Brazil and Mexico operations to Shanghai to replace higher-paid American engineers.
At the same time, SAIC was withdrawing Chinese engineers from the joint venture after they had worked with G.M.'s technology. SAIC assigned them to develop its own cars and minivans. Many of those SAIC vehicles would later compete directly with cars from its joint venture with G.M.
In 2016, G.M. tried again to offer a plug-in hybrid, the Buick Velite. Even though the batteries were made in China, Beijing decided to block subsidies to buyers, without telling G.M. in advance, because the company making the batteries in China, LG, was South Korean.
When the pandemic began in early 2020, G.M. evacuated almost all foreign employees and their families from China, as did Volkswagen and other automakers. China's borders were sealed to travelers. But Chinese automotive start-ups like Nio, Xpeng Motors and Zeekr were investing heavily in robots and design innovations.
Today, Chinese automakers dominate their home market. SAIC, G.M.'s longtime partner, is among the most successful. Private Chinese companies emerging from the cellphone industry -- like BYD, Xiaomi and Huawei -- pose even more formidable competition.
Last week, G.M. shut its Cruise driverless taxi program in the United States. The initiative had been essential to the company's long-term competitiveness in China, where the government is pushing faster for autonomous driving than anywhere else in the world.
G.M. said it was not giving up on China.
In April, its joint venture with SAIC introduced a plug-in hybrid version of the GL8 minivan, which has had few changes since the 1990s. It is still the best-selling minivan in China. But SAIC has introduced an almost identical competitor, the Maxus G90.
G.M. began importing Chevrolet Tahoe full-size sport utility vehicles to China from the United States this year. And to bypass Chinese taxes, it is replacing their engines with much smaller ones.
Wuling, the maker of utilitarian minivans and pickups, is selling three times as many vehicles in China as mainstay G.M. brands. G.M. still profits from its 44 percent investment, but SAIC is the controlling shareholder in Wuling with a 49 percent stake.
G.M. said its China sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars surpassed its sales of gasoline cars in late summer for the first time. Overall sales have increased each month since July. "Our results have begun to improve," the company said.
But many in China see not just G.M. but all foreign automakers as dangerously behind. More than four-fifths of the electric and plug-in hybrid cars sold here are Chinese brands.
"It is not just G.M.," said Mr. Russo, the former Chrysler executive, who is now a Shanghai electric car consultant. "Everyone among the foreign automakers had a condescending, arrogant attitude toward the capability of the Chinese companies to embrace innovation."

Carmakers Talking Merger. History Isn't on Their Side.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Japanese companies are considering joining forces to survive in a rapidly changing auto industry, but auto history is filled with troubled and failed marriages.
The Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan are discussing a possible merger, in a bid to share costs and help themselves compete in a fast-changing and increasingly competitive industry.
But a merger, even of two companies from the same country, is no guarantee of success, and the history of automotive deals is littered with failures and disappointments.
Combining two large, global manufacturing operations is an incredibly difficult feat that involves reconciling different technologies, models and approaches to doing business. A merger's success rests on getting ambitious managers and engineers who have spent decades competing with one another to cooperate. Teams and projects have to be scrapped or changed, and executives must cede power to others. In some cases, the merging companies are hamstrung by elected leaders who force them to keep operating money-losing factories.
Thomas Stallkamp, an automotive consultant based in Michigan, was involved in the struggles of one of the biggest auto mergers, the 1998 merger of Chrysler and the German company Daimler. Mr. Stallkamp spent years in senior roles at Chrysler and DaimlerChrysler.
"Car companies are big, complicated organizations, with large engineering staffs, manufacturing plants all over the world, hundreds of thousands of employees, in a capital-intensive business," Mr. Stallkamp said. "You try to put two of them together and you run into a lot of egos and infighting, so it's very, very difficult to make it work."
Honda and Nissan announced plans this year to work together on electric vehicles, and on Monday they formally began talks about extending that cooperation to a merger that could also include Mitsubishi Motors, a smaller manufacturer that works closely with Nissan. A pairing would unite Japan's second- and third-biggest automakers, after Toyota, and create a company that would be the third largest in the world by number of cars produced, after Toyota and Volkswagen.
The merger discussions were prompted by difficulties the companies are facing around the world.
Chief among those problems is that sales have plummeted in China, the world's largest auto market. Chinese car buyers are moving much more quickly to electric and plug-in hybrid cars and trucks than most industry experts had expected. Honda and Nissan offer few such models, which now account for more than half of all cars sold in China. Companies that are doing the best in the shift away from gasoline cars are domestic manufacturers like BYD and SAIC, as well as Tesla.
Last month, Honda said it expected net profit for the fiscal year ending in March to fall 14 percent, and lowered its forecast for global vehicle sales to 3.8 million from 3.9 million, largely as a result of its difficulties in China, which had once accounted for about a third of its sales.
Nissan has more significant troubles than Honda and in recent years has slogged through management upheaval. In the United States, a critical market where Nissan used to earn significant profits, the company's market share has fallen sharply as it struggles to sell cars and trucks that haven't received significant upgrades in recent years. In the period from April to September, Nissan's operating profit plunged 90 percent, and the automaker recently said it aimed to lose 9,000 employees worldwide and cut global production by about 20 percent.
A merger could help Honda and Nissan develop electric cars faster and at lower cost -- in theory. But other companies have struggled to achieve such gains in practice, often because the priorities of companies working together often shift and diverge. Ford Motor and Volkswagen teamed up a few years ago to work on electric vehicles and autonomous driving technology. But the companies shut down their self-driving car business and reaped few benefits from collaborating on electric vehicles.
Honda had a partnership with General Motors, and currently sells two electric sport utility vehicles, the Honda Prologue and Acura ZDX, that are manufactured by G.M. But the companies have decided not to extend the partnership beyond those two models, and G.M. is now exploring ways to work with Hyundai, the South Korean automaker.
Still, analysts said a merger of Honda and Nissan had the potential to help both companies. In the United States, the two companies have similar product lines focused on small and medium-size cars and sport utility vehicles like Nissan's Sentra, Altima and Rogue and Honda's Civic, Accord and CRV.
Sam Fiorani, a vice president at Auto Forecast Solutions, a research firm, said Nissan had the technology to build full-size pickup trucks bought by many Americans, something Honda lacks. "That's something that could be valuable for Honda in the future," he said.
On the production side, Nissan has two vehicle assembly plants in the United States and Honda has four. Each also has engine and transmission factories and engineering centers.
They could in theory reap savings by combining their operations, closing some plants and locations and eliminating jobs. But that's where the difficulties are likely to arise.
"That means one of the two merger partners is going to gut their development organization or scrap their engine program, and that where you always run into heavy resistance," Mr. Stallkamp said. "When it comes down to it, neither side wants to take the hit."
In many cases, downsizing measures run into political opposition because governments push companies to preserve jobs. Stellantis was formed in a 2021 merger of France's Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler, and the French and Italian governments have fought to keep the combined company from closing factories.
After some initial success, Stellantis this year has suffered a slump in vehicle sales and a drop in profit. The chief executive who helped shepherd the merger, Carlos Tavares, resigned this month. The company, now run by a board committee, is looking for a new top executive and scrapping parts of the strategy it put in place after the merger.
For more than two decades Nissan was the junior partner in an alliance with Renault. The partnership saved Nissan from collapse and helped it become profitable, but neither company saw the kind of long-term success that had been envisioned by Carlos Ghosn, who had led the alliance and served as chief executive of both companies.
Eventually, executives at Nissan chafed at being effectively controlled by Renault. In 2018, Mr. Ghosn was arrested and jailed in Japan on charges of financial wrongdoing. He fled to Lebanon before a trial. Renault still owns a significant stake in Nissan, but the two don't work as closely together as they used to.
DaimlerChrysler faced few battles over closing plants, but struggled to merge a luxury carmaker with an automaker that made more affordable models. The combined company had a balky management structure that included two executives sharing power at the top, and with vast cultural differences between its German and American operations. The two sides separated in 2007 after nine years.
"It was a constant battle of egos on both sides," Mr. Stallkamp said.
Other partnerships that proved disappointing include BMW's takeover of Britain's Rover in the 1990s. Ford owned all or part of Jaguar Land Rover, Mazda and Volvo but sold those assets during and after the 2008 financial crisis.
A few automotive mergers have seemed to live up to expectations. Fiat Chrysler -- formed when Fiat, an Italian automaker, took over Chrysler as the American company was emerging from bankruptcy -- is one example of a merger that seemed to flourish. Under its chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, the Chrysler part of the business, which also included the Dodge, Jeep and Ram brands, recovered and became the more profitable half of the combined company.
The South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia, which have been in an alliance since 1998, are together one of the world's largest automakers and have enjoyed strong growth in recent years. They share development, engineering and manufacturing resources, but have separate sales and marketing operations.
Marc Cannon, a consultant who was a senior executive at AutoNation, a large automotive retailer, said Honda and Nissan could try to emulate Hyundai and Kia, but he expressed doubts about how well the Japanese companies would fare.
"Honda is still a great brand with great products. Nissan's brand has been damaged with all the turmoil they've had in the last few years, and their quality is not great," Mr. Cannon said. "So it doesn't make that much sense to me. Why would Honda be interested in taking on Nissan's problems?"

Full text: Japan's second- and third-largest automakers hope the $ 50 billion deal would help them catch up with Tesla and China's BYD in electric vehicles and advanced software.
Honda Motor and Nissan Motor are exploring a merger to create one of the world's largest auto groups as they seek to better position themselves for the expensive technological transition reshaping the automotive industry.
On Monday, Honda and Nissan signed a memorandum of understanding to formally begin talks aimed at deepening a partnership that began this year. Over the next six months, the companies will discuss combining their operations under a holding company, with the goal of completing the merger in August 2026.
Honda and Nissan, Japan's second- and third-largest automakers, would join a growing number of legacy auto giants, including General Motors and Volkswagen, that are deepening ties to share the financial burden of developing next-generation vehicles. The deal is seen as a lifeline in particular for Nissan, which has been slashing jobs and production amid faltering sales.
Unlike the gasoline-powered cars that have defined the industry for most of the past century, more vehicles today are being equipped with batteries, electric motors and advanced software that enables features such as autonomous driving.
To navigate the change, Honda and Nissan have decided they can better handle research and development and new investments as a combined force, Honda's chief executive, Toshihiro Mibe, said at a briefing in Tokyo on Monday.
"Current business models are being upended. It is not going to take 10 to 20 years for that to happen -- it will come much faster," Mr. Mibe said. "We need to have the right artillery in order to be competitive on that battlefield so we're starting today."
In recent years, automakers across Japan, the United States and Europe have invested billions of dollars into electric vehicle development -- efforts that, for the most part, have yet to generate profits. These investments are being financed by sales of higher-margin gasoline and hybrid models, which also require continuous investment.
With electric vehicle sales growth slowing and President-elect Donald J. Trump gearing up to eliminate E.V. tax incentives in the United States, automakers must figure out how to sustain investments in gasoline- and battery-powered cars for an extended period, said Takaki Nakanishi, head of the automotive consulting firm Nakanishi Research Institute in Tokyo.
"To sustain these dual investments, automakers need scale and the operational efficiencies that come with it," Mr. Nakanishi said. "If Nissan and Honda are not able to achieve this, they will not survive," he said. "Times are truly that tough."
Nissan sells more than three million vehicles a year, while Honda sells nearly four million. A merger would position them as the world's third-largest automaker group, behind Toyota, whose brands sold 11 million vehicles last year, and Volkswagen, which sold nine million. Honda and Nissan together employ about 325,000 people.
Nissan and Honda said integrating their businesses would enable them to standardize the basic makeup of vehicles and increase production. Those steps would reduce how much each company spent on developing vehicles, freeing up cash to spend on things like creating new software.
The key question is whether even large, combined entities like Honda and Nissan can keep up with newer competitors. The American company Tesla and China's BYD have already established a commanding lead in electric vehicles and car technologies that can be updated over the air like smartphones.
Automotive mergers have a long history of failing to meet expectations and ultimately falling apart. DaimlerChrysler split after nine years of a mostly unhappy marriage. Stellantis was formed in the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and the French PSA Group, and the chief executive who helped engineer the pairing, Carlos Tavares, resigned under pressure this month.
Last year, Nissan and its longtime French partner, Renault, agreed to take steps to unwind their alliance. Around the same time, Honda and G.M. decided to scrap a plan to develop a line of lower-priced electric vehicles, less than two years after the companies announced the joint effort.
The new parent company of a merged Honda and Nissan would be listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Honda would nominate a majority of the new company's directors, from among which a president would be selected. Mitsubishi Motors, a smaller Japanese automaker and longtime partner of Nissan's, said it would also consider joining the new group.
Under the automakers' current market valuations, the combination would be worth more than $ 50 billion.
The deal is part of a wave of consolidation, which some argue is long overdue, in the Japanese car industry. This year, there has been $ 10 billion in mergers and acquisitions in the sector, up 163 percent from a year earlier, according to Mergermarket, a data provider.
Even with expanded scale, the Japanese automakers would need to prove that their partnership could speed their development of new vehicles, said Tang Jin, a senior researcher at Mizuho Bank. If they cannot create some kind of "chemical reaction" of new value by coming together, he said, "their merging will simply become a gathering of the weak."
Already in China, the world's largest car market, it may be too late for Honda, Nissan and many Western automakers to make up ground lost to cost-competitive and technologically advanced local rivals. For the fiscal year ending March 31, Nissan has projected a 13 percent drop in its sales in China, while Honda expects an even steeper decline.
Nissan's struggles in China contributed to a 90 percent plunge in its operating profit to $ 214 million during the first half of the current fiscal year. Last month, Nissan said it would make deep cuts to its global operations, and in the weeks since, it has been circled by a number of groups including activist investors.
Compared with Nissan, Honda's financial position remains healthy. Honda turned a $ 1.8 billion profit in the July-to-September quarter, but that was down 15 percent from a year earlier because of higher research-and-development costs and weak sales in China.
"Nissan's current decline could very well be Honda's tomorrow," said Mr. Nakanishi, the industry consultant. That is something Honda recognizes. "It realizes its best shot is to combine with Nissan, share a common destiny and try to overcome the impending crisis together," he said.

Full text: The automaker agreed to keep all 10 of its factories in Germany open and to guarantee workers' jobs until the end of 2030.
Volkswagen, Germany's largest automaker, reached an agreement with its union on Friday, ending a three-month standoff that had rattled the country and brought to light the extent of German industrial decline.
Under the deal, hammered out during more than 70 hours of talks at a hotel in the western city of Hanover, the company agreed to keep all 10 of its factories in Germany open and to guarantee workers' jobs until the end of 2030. But during that time, the company will carry out a restructuring plan that will include the loss of more than 35,000 jobs through retirement and attrition.
In exchange, the union, IG Metall, which represents most of Volkswagen's workers, withdrew its demand for a wage increase until 2031 and agreed to cuts in bonuses and reductions in production of hundreds of thousands of cars across several plants.
"No site will be closed, no one will be made redundant, and our company wage agreement will be secured for the long term," Daniela Cavallo, the head of the works council at Volkswagen, said in a statement announcing the agreement.
At stake was not just wages but Volkswagen's plans to solve the problem of too many workers and too few orders, amid slumping demand in Europe and abroad and increasing competition from Chinese automakers.
Volkswagen's woes have mirrored Germany's economic malaise. Officials in the country have forecast that the economy will contract in 2024, for the second consecutive year. Economists do not expect to see a significant return to growth in 2025.
The extended wage dispute had strained the 87-year-old automaker's strong ties with its roughly 120,000 workers in Germany, who said management had betrayed the social pact of the country's traditional collective bargaining system, where the welfare of the company and its employees are given equal weight.
Some 100,000 IG Metall members staged brief walkouts in December. The union had threatened to start longer strikes starting in January if an agreement had not been reached.
That pressure, combined with Volkswagen's plunging share price, which has fallen by more than a third over the past 12 months, was enough to force the company to back down from its threats to close as many as three plants. Volkswagen had also initially sought a 10 percent wage cut.
"With the package of measures achieved, the company has set a decisive course for its future in terms of costs, capacities and structures," Oliver Blume, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said in a statement.
For its part, the union retreated from its demand of a 7 percent wage increase and offered a compromise instead: the creation of a communal fund equivalent to a 5 percent wage increase for each worker over the next five years. The fund can be drawn from to compensate those employees whose hours are reduced or who are forced into early retirement through the restructuring.
Volkswagen said the deal would save more than 4 billion euros, or roughly $ 4.2 billion, annually in the coming years. It would also reduce its production capacity by 734,000 cars over the coming five years, allowing the company to invest in new products that it hopes will restore its ability to compete.
"I think it sends a good signal to the work force and creates confidence that the employees are valued," said Beatrix C. Keim, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Duisburg, adding that it was good for Germany's auto industry because many suppliers and their employees depend on Volkswagen's success.
The agreement was a sorely needed positive end to a difficult year, coming days after Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany lost a vote of confidence in Parliament, setting off new elections in February that are shaping up to focus largely on how to jump-start the country's stagnant economy.
High energy prices, a complex bureaucracy, aging public infrastructure and geopolitical developments have hurt exports, while political paralysis under Mr. Scholz's government exacerbated the situation.
The threat of further protectionism from the administration of President-elect Donald J. Trump in the United States has economists worried that the coming year could be more challenging, even if a new German government is able to quickly enact some badly needed reforms.
Volkswagen is struggling against falling demand in Europe and China, the world's largest car market, and is burdened by high costs for labor and electricity, especially in Germany. In October, the company reported that profit fell to €2.86 billion, or $ 3.1 billion, for the months from August to September, its lowest level in three years.
On Friday, Volkswagen's top shareholder, Porsche, said it might have to write down the value of its 31.9 percent stake in the company by as much as €20 billion, or $ 21 billion, creating extra pressure on Volkswagen's management to reach an agreement that included cost cuts.

Honda and Nissan Weigh Possible Merger: [Correction]

Full text: The merger talks between Japan's second- and third-largest automakers highlight the intense upheaval within the world's auto industry.
Honda Motor and Nissan Motor, Japan's second- and third-largest automakers, are discussing ways to deepen their ties, including the possibility of a merger that could fundamentally restructure Japan's car industry.
The merger talks between the two storied Japanese giants highlight the intense upheaval within the world's auto industry, as carmakers grapple with expensive technological shifts, political instability and the rise of fast-growing Chinese rivals.
Though discussions are still at an early stage, the thinking at Nissan and Honda is that combining forces could provide the companies with the resources and scale necessary to navigate those immense pressures.
Last year, Honda sold 3.98 million vehicles and Nissan 3.37 million. Their combination could make them the world's third-largest automaker group, behind their Japanese rival Toyota Group, which sold 11.23 million vehicles last year, and Volkswagen Group of Germany, which sold 9.23 million.
Honda and Nissan began collaborating this year on the development of electric vehicles. Over several months, their discussions have expanded to include the potential creation of a new company under which both automakers would operate, according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Nissan and Honda are expected to sign a memorandum of understanding within the next week to formally begin discussions of partnership-broadening steps, including the details of a potential merger, the people familiar with the matter said. No final decisions have been made, they said.
The companies said in statements that they were in talks. "As announced in March of this year, Honda and Nissan are exploring various possibilities for future collaboration, leveraging each other's strengths," they said. "We will inform our stakeholders of any updates at an appropriate time."
The possibility of merging forces would have been largely unthinkable for two Japanese titans of auto making just a decade ago. The talks underscore the level of churn in the industry as manufacturers move away from the internal combustion engine, which has powered the vehicles they have produced for most of the past century.
Honda and Nissan each need to invest billions of dollars in electric vehicles, said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, a market research firm.
"Moving forward in E.V.s is expensive, and some of the smaller players have to figure out how to pay for it," she said. "And it's harder than ever now, because sales of E.V.s are growing more slowly than people had expected just a few years ago."
Nissan shares soared more than 20 percent during trading in Tokyo on Wednesday as investors reacted to the news about a potential merger. Honda's shares fell slightly.
Honda, founded in 1948, has long pursued a go-it-alone approach, developing components like engines on its own and spurning globe-spanning alliances. But more recently, the amount of investment required for a shift toward battery-powered vehicles has led it to seek partnerships with companies including Sony in Japan and General Motors in the United States.
Established in 1933, Nissan in particular has struggled in recent years to keep up with the swiftly growing appetite for hybrid gas-electric vehicles in the United States and fully electric cars in China. Last month, Nissan unveiled deep cuts to its global operations and said it needed to take steps to speed up its development of new offerings in its core markets.
Nissan's global sales declined across its core markets -- North America, China and Japan -- in the first half of its fiscal year. During the April-to-September period, its operating profit fell 90 percent, to $ 214 million.
Japanese automakers, like their peers in the United States and Europe, are also facing intense competition from new, highly cost-competitive and technologically advanced rivals in China. After enjoying years of state support, Chinese makers of electric vehicles like BYD are pushing deeper into Europe and Southeast Asia, where Japanese manufacturers have long dominated.
Last year, China overtook Japan for the first time to become the world's largest car exporter. China's exports were boosted by strong demand for electric vehicles and its shipments to Russia, a market that Japanese and Western automakers withdrew from in response to the war in Ukraine.
Like the Western automakers G.M., Ford Motor and Volkswagen, Nissan and Honda have struggled to compete in China as local rivals offer low-cost models tailored to the domestic market, which is the world's largest. Nissan has forecast that its sales in China will fall 13 percent this fiscal year. Honda projected an even larger slump.
As the industry adapts to the new market dynamics, automakers worldwide are forging more alliances. In September, G.M. said it would work with Hyundai of South Korea on internal combustion, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Last month, Volkswagen said it would form a joint venture with the electric vehicle maker Rivian, a California start-up.
People at Honda and Nissan say a partnership could benefit both companies in a number of ways. Honda has a strong portfolio of fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles, and Nissan could help it build out its global supply chain for batteries. Nissan was an early pioneer in electric vehicles and has several popular models, including the Sakura minivehicle it offers in Japan.
Nissan also holds a large stake in Mitsubishi Motors, a smaller Japanese automaker. If a Nissan-Honda group is established, Mitsubishi will consider joining it, according to the Japanese newspaper Nikkei, which earlier reported the merger discussions.
Automotive mergers often fail to deliver the efficiencies and profits that executives hope for. DaimlerChrysler split after nine years of a mostly unhappy marriage. Stellantis was formed in the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and the French PSA Group, and the chief executive who helped engineer the pairing, Carlos Tavares, resigned under pressure this month.
Nissan and the French automaker Renault have been strategic partners for more than two decades, and both saw some benefits early on, but neither achieved the kind of growth and profitability levels that executives and analysts had expected.
Last year, Nissan and Renault agreed to take steps to unwind their alliance. Around the same time, Honda and G.M. decided to scrap a plan to develop a line of lower-priced electric vehicles, less than two years after the companies announced the joint effort.

The Germany We Knew Is Gone: [Op-Ed]

Full text: When I recently picked up a rental car in Las Vegas -- I was in America to cover the elections -- the agent at the counter insisted on "upgrading" me to a BMW. "So you feel at home," he said, looking at my German driver's license, smiling. I took the keys and made a mental note: Outside Germany, Germany is still intact.
I often find this when I travel. Outside Germany, Germany is still a car country, home to a flourishing economy. Outside Germany, Germany is still a prosperous country, where everybody drives a BMW or the like. Outside Germany, Germany is still a well-ordered country, a pleasant place both politically and socially. I smiled back at the agent. But inwardly, I winced. Because in Germany, Germany doesn't feel like Germany anymore.
On Monday, Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of confidence at the Bundestag, Germany's parliament, officially ending his government. It was a formality: The three-party coalition had fallen in early November, when Mr. Scholz dismissed the finance minister, Christian Lindner, prompting his Free Democrats to quit the administration. The move left Mr. Scholz, a Social Democrat, with a minority government alongside the Greens. Rather than stagger on, he decided to call snap elections that will be held on Feb. 23. The no-confidence vote was a final piece of housekeeping.
At first glance, the story of the government's breakdown looks like a rather dull "House of Cards" political thriller, centered on a budget fight. Underneath the noise, however, there's an existential crisis. The economically prosperous, socially cohesive and politically stable Germany has gone. And this government, ideologically torn and rocked by outside shocks, proved unable to cope. How did we get here?
In the fall of 2021, things felt very different. After Angela Merkel decided not to run again after 16 years in office, Mr. Scholz defeated her Christian Democratic successor and formed the first three-party government in recent German history. Younger politicians like Annalena Baerbock, the foreign minister, and Mr. Lindner came in. It was the first time the Greens, an economically left-leaning party rooted in the ecological movement of the '80s, had shared power nationally with the Free Democrats, a pro-civil liberties and pro-business party.
In interviews for a book I was writing, many of those younger politicians talked about overcoming their ideological barriers to modernize Germany after Ms. Merkel's long reign, which they saw as overly attached to the status quo. They talked enthusiastically about digitizing the country and promoting green industries. The energy felt genuine. Led by the steady, moderate Mr. Scholz, the government looked well set to tackle the country's challenges.
But problems soon stacked up. The first was Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, which threw the new government into crisis management mode: frantically buying gas on the international markets to replace Russian energy, trying to protect consumers and companies from soaring prices and organizing weapons deliveries to Ukraine. After Mr. Scholz announced a "Zeitenwende," a turning point in foreign policy, the government allocated 100 billion euros to rebuilding Germany's military.
All that came as the economy was faltering. While other Group of 7 countries are growing, Germany is about to register its second consecutive year of recession. Its signature businesses are struggling. Volkswagen, which employs about 300,000 people in Germany, plans to shut down manufacturing sites and lay off thousands of workers. Ford, Audi and Tesla have also announced layoffs, as has ThyssenKrupp, a major steel manufacturer. Once Europe's standout economy, Germany has gone from leader to laggard.
The reasons for the downturn are complex. The abrupt end of cheap Russian gas is a big factor, of course, but so is the government's agenda of green reforms, which -- by phasing out coal and relying more on renewables -- have exacerbated the cost of energy. That hasn't helped German car manufacturers, who are struggling to compete with their Chinese counterparts. Some companies have clearly made poor decisions, but the government has failed to support them, too. Generally, the government is guilty of underinvesting not only in key industries but also in schools, railways and roads. Overall, the picture is grim.
All the while, a toxic debate on migration has been brewing. Since 2015, millions of people have come to Germany, including, most recently, roughly a million Ukrainians. The country's attitude has been bipolar. On the one hand, the fact that Germany is a multiethnic, multireligious society is widely accepted. But on the other, there's simmering discontent -- periodically cresting into waves of anger -- about immigration. The government has offered a similarly mixed response, at once making it easier for skilled workers to migrate and imposing strict border controls, with tougher asylum measures and more deportations. The approach hasn't really pleased anyone.
These travails have combined to devastating political effect. In the face of so many difficulties, it has become increasingly hard to govern. The public hasn't been sympathetic: Frustration with the government is widespread, its parties roundly disliked. In this febrile atmosphere, a newly formed pro-Russia party, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, has prospered and the far-right Alternative for Germany has cemented itself as the second-most-popular party in the country. If the three-way coalition was an experiment in coping with the country's fragmented politics, it failed. The timing, with Donald Trump ascendant and Europe in disarray, could not be worse.
Not all is lost, though. Germany's crisis is real, but it is as much a crisis of confidence as anything else. Unemployment may grow but is still minimal. Our budgetary restrictions, far from a force of nature, can be overcome with political will. The party system is fracturing, but even the most divided states have been able to form governments: Next year we may well see the return of a stable coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats. Having integrated generations and generations of immigrants, there's no reason we can't do it again.
And yet it is worth paying close attention. Germany could be the canary in the coal mine for Western societies. Most of our neighbors and friends face the same troubles: the costs of transforming carbon-based economies, the perils of responding to new geopolitical challenges, the difficulties of achieving social cohesion. If Germany, that most temperate zone of world politics, is not able to do it, who is?

Automakers Struggle With Market Shift and Competition From China: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Changing technology, political turmoil and competition from China are cutting into profits and forcing carmakers to cut jobs and close factories.
A few years ago, automakers were celebrating record profits as the pandemic created shortages of new cars, allowing them to raise prices. Now the hangover is setting in.
Nissan, the Japanese automaker, is laying off 9,000 employees. Volkswagen is considering closing factories in Germany for the first time. The chief executive of the U.S. and European automaker Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat and other brands, quit after sales tumbled. Even luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz are struggling.
Each carmaker has its own problems, but there are some common threads. They include a tricky and expensive technological transition, political turmoil, rising protectionism and the emergence of a new class of fast-growing Chinese carmakers. The many woes raise questions about the future of companies that are a critical source of jobs in many Western and Asian countries.
Many of these problems have been apparent for years but became less pressing during the pandemic, lulling some automakers into complacency. When shortages of semiconductors and other components slowed production and limited inventory, carmakers found it easy to raise prices.
But that era is over and the industry has reverted to its prepandemic state, with too many carmakers chasing too few buyers.
Many car factories around the world are making many fewer cars than they were built to produce. When automakers don't earn a decent return on their factories and machines, there is "a massive effect on profitability," said Simon Croom, a professor of supply chain management at the University of San Diego. "The difference between profit and loss is a very fine line in the auto industry."
Workers are among the first to suffer in an industry that employs nine million people worldwide in manufacturing, including around a million in the United States. More than two million more Americans work for dealers and related businesses.
Nissan, which has factories in Mississippi and Tennessee, has not detailed where its layoffs will take place. It is not alone in cutting jobs. Ford last month announced 4,000 job cuts, mostly at factories in Britain and Germany. The company cited "unprecedented competitive, regulatory, and economic headwinds."
Ford was partly referring to Chinese carmakers. Barely a factor before the pandemic, they have charged into the international market with cars that can match Japanese, European or American vehicles on quality, at much lower prices.
BYD, Chery, SAIC and other Chinese carmakers are still effectively barred from the United States by trade rules and hobbled by tariffs in Europe. But they are pushing into places like Australia, Brazil, Chile and Thailand, luring buyers away from the likes of Fiat, General Motors and Toyota.
Competition from China is "starting to hit the safe places that Western carmakers had," said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics, a research firm.
Inside China, the world's largest car market, domestic manufacturers have stolen the limelight from foreign carmakers with over-the-top options like those offered by BYD in its Yangwang U8, a plug-in hybrid off-road vehicle.
The U8 can stay afloat for up to 30 minutes in a flood, according to the company, and its wheels can be set to roll so that the vehicle can rotate 360 degrees while remaining in the same spot.
The rise of Chinese automakers has been particularly tough on German carmakers. Volkswagen gets one-third of its sales from China and once dominated that market. But the company's deliveries there plunged 10 percent in the first nine months of this year, compared with 2023.
BMW and Mercedes-Benz have also reported big sales declines in China recently, which they blamed for lower profits.
American carmakers have also suffered from this shift. G.M. said this month that it would take a more than $ 5 billion hit to its profit as it restructured its Chinese operations, which have been losing money.
Companies that were slow to replace aging models are doing worst. That has been the case for Nissan, Stellantis and even Tesla, which analysts expect to end the year with sales that are roughly unchanged from 2023. Others have struggled to build appealing electric vehicles and develop software, an increasingly important element of car design.
Volkswagen was among the first established carmakers to develop electric vehicles, but the models underwhelmed buyers and critics. Sales in the United States of the company's ID.4 sport-utility vehicle plunged by more than half in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book. Buggy software handicapped sales of the ID.4 and other electric models that Volkswagen sells in Europe and Asia.
"The Chinese are winning market share and the Germans are losing," said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Bochum, Germany. "It's not only the electric cars, it's the software in the cars."
Changing government policy is adding to the carmakers' woes. Sales of electric vehicles plunged in Germany after the government, facing a budget crisis, abruptly eliminated financial incentives.
In the United States, President-elect Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress want to repeal Biden-era tax credits designed to promote electric vehicles. The shifts in policy endanger the hundreds of billions of dollars that G.M., Hyundai-Kia, Volkswagen and others have invested in new factories and cars.
"The auto industry has had to dish out a lot of capital for an underwhelming E.V. market and one that may well change in the next six months," said Erin Keating, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive, a research firm.
Mr. Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and Canada. China is an important source of components for virtually all carmakers. Mexico is an important manufacturing center for BMW, G.M., Ford, Stellantis, Volkswagen and others, shipping two million vehicles to the United States in the first nine months of the year.
Not all car companies are doing poorly. G.M. shares have risen more than 40 percent this year, while shares of most automakers have fallen. In part, Wall Street is rewarding G.M. for popular electric vehicles like the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet Equinox. Mary T. Barra, the G.M. chief executive, has said the company is close to making a profit on electric vehicles, unlike other American carmakers excluding Tesla.
But G.M. is also retrenching, announcing last week that it would stop developing robotaxis, autonomous vehicles that can carry passengers without drivers. The decision raised questions about whether established carmakers can compete with Tesla and Waymo, a division of Google's parent company, in the next generation of automotive technology.
Toyota's strategy of doubling down on hybrids, while offering few all-electric cars, also appears to be paying off -- at least for now. Many buyers are choosing hybrids, which cost a lot less than electric vehicles and don't need to be charged, as a way to reduce emissions and fuel expenses.
But Toyota could be left behind if sales of electric vehicles grow faster than market analysts expect. Prices for battery-powered vehicles are dropping while the distance they can travel on a charge is growing. In China, electric vehicles are already cheaper than comparable gasoline models. More than half of new cars sold there are electric or plug-in hybrids.
Carmakers are trying to adapt. Stellantis, whose chief executive, Carlos Tavares, quit this month, has new models lined up for 2025. They include several electric vehicles, among them Jeeps, Ram pickups and a Dodge Charger muscle car. The company is also working to repair its relationship with dealers who feel that Stellantis waited too long to lower prices and offer incentives to help them sell cars that were piling up on their lots.
John Elkann, the chairman of Stellantis, held a virtual meeting with U.S. dealers after Mr. Tavares's resignation. Later, the Stellantis National Dealer Council issued a statement expressing optimism that "2025 will mark a turning point."
Attempts to reach Mr. Tavares for comment were unsuccessful.
Market pressures will prompt carmakers to cooperate with one another more, for example, by sharing the costs of engine development, said K. Venkatesh Prasad, the senior vice president of research at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.
"You're seeing some of this already," he said.
Makoto Uchida, Nissan's chief executive, said last month that the company would reduce the time it takes to develop a new vehicle by working more closely with its partners Renault, Mitsubishi and Honda.
Volkswagen is trying to solve its software problems by investing in Rivian, which makes electric pickups and sport utility vehicles in Illinois.
Western carmakers are also making deals with Chinese automakers. Volkswagen will develop new models with Xpeng to sell in China. Last year, Stellantis bought a 20 percent stake in Leapmotor and has begun selling the Chinese company's electric vehicles in Europe.
"If you can't beat 'em," Mr. Dudenhöffer said, "join 'em."

Automakers Thrived in the Pandemic. Many Are Now Struggling.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A few years ago, automakers were celebrating record profits as the pandemic created shortages of new cars, allowing them to raise prices. Now the hangover is setting in.
Nissan, the Japanese automaker, is laying off 9,000 employees. Volkswagen is considering closing factories in Germany for the first time. The CEO of U.S. and European automaker Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat and other brands, quit after sales tumbled. Even luxury brands including BMW and Mercedes-Benz are struggling.
Each carmaker has its own problems, but there are some common threads. They include a tricky and expensive technological transition, political turmoil, rising protectionism and the emergence of a new class of fast-growing Chinese carmakers. The many woes raise questions about the future of companies that are a crucial source of jobs in many Western and Asian countries.
Many of these problems have been apparent for years but became less pressing during the pandemic, lulling some automakers into complacency. When shortages of semiconductors and other components slowed production and limited inventory, carmakers found it easy to raise prices.
But that era is over and the industry has reverted to its prepandemic state, with too many carmakers chasing too few buyers.
Many car factories worldwide are making many fewer cars than they were built to produce. When automakers don’t earn a decent return on their factories and machines, there is “a massive effect on profitability,” said Simon Croom, a professor of supply chain management at the University of San Diego. “The difference between profit and loss is a very fine line in the auto industry.”
Workers are among the first to suffer in an industry that employs 9 million people worldwide in manufacturing, including about 1 million in the United States. More than 2 million more Americans work for dealers and related businesses.
Nissan, which has factories in Mississippi and Tennessee, has not detailed where its layoffs will take place. It is not alone in cutting jobs. Ford last month announced 4,000 job cuts, mostly at factories in Britain and Germany. The company cited “unprecedented competitive, regulatory and economic headwinds.”
Ford was partly referring to Chinese carmakers. Barely a factor before the pandemic, they have charged into the international market with cars that can match Japanese, European or American vehicles on quality, at much lower prices.
BYD, Chery, SAIC and other Chinese carmakers are still effectively barred from the United States by trade rules and hobbled by tariffs in Europe. But they are pushing into places like Australia, Brazil, Chile and Thailand, luring buyers away from the likes of Fiat, General Motors and Toyota.
Competition from China is “starting to the hit the safe places that Western carmakers had,” said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics, a research firm.
Inside China, the world’s largest car market, domestic manufacturers have stolen the limelight from foreign carmakers with over-the-top options like those offered by BYD in its Yangwang U8, a plug-in hybrid off-road vehicle.
The U8 can stay afloat for up to 30 minutes in a flood, according to the company, and its wheels can be set to roll so that the vehicle can rotate 360 degrees while remaining in the same spot.
The rise of Chinese automakers has been particularly tough on German carmakers. Volkswagen gets one-third of its sales from China and once dominated that market. But the company’s deliveries there plunged 10% in the first nine months of this year, compared with 2023.
BMW and Mercedes-Benz have also reported big sales declines in China recently, which they blamed for lower profits.
U.S. carmakers have also suffered from this shift. GM said this month that it would take a more than $5 billion hit to its profit as it restructured its Chinese operations, which have been losing money.
Companies that were slow to replace aging models are doing worst. That has been the case for Nissan, Stellantis and even Tesla, which analysts expect to end the year with sales that are roughly unchanged from 2023. Others have struggled to build appealing electric vehicles and develop software, an increasingly important element of car design.
Volkswagen was among the first established carmakers to develop electric vehicles, but the models underwhelmed buyers and critics. Sales in the United States of the company’s ID.4 SUV plunged by more than half in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book. Buggy software handicapped sales of the ID.4 and other electric models that Volkswagen sells in Europe and Asia.
“The Chinese are winning market share and the Germans are losing,” said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Bochum, Germany. “It’s not only the electric cars, it’s the software in the cars.”
Changing government policy is adding to carmakers’ woes. Sales of electric vehicles plunged in Germany after the government, facing a budget crisis, abruptly eliminated financial incentives.
In the United States, President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress want to repeal Biden-era tax credits designed to promote electric vehicles. The shifts in policy endanger the hundreds of billions of dollars that GM, Hyundai-Kia, Volkswagen and others have invested in new factories and cars.
“The auto industry has had to dish out a lot of capital for an underwhelming EV market and one that may well change in the next six months,” said Erin Keating, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive, a research firm.
Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and Canada. China is an important source of components for virtually all carmakers. Mexico is an important manufacturing center for BMW, GM, Ford, Stellantis, Volkswagen and others, shipping 2 million vehicles to the United States in the first nine months of the year.
Not all car companies are doing poorly. GM shares have risen more than 40% this year, while shares of most automakers have fallen. In part, Wall Street is rewarding GM for popular electric vehicles like the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevrolet Equinox. GM CEO Mary T. Barra has said the company is close to making a profit on electric vehicles, unlike other U.S. carmakers excluding Tesla.
But GM is also retrenching, announcing last week that it would stop developing robotaxis, autonomous vehicles that can carry passengers without drivers. The decision raised questions about whether established carmakers can compete with Tesla and Waymo, a division of Google’s parent company, in the next generation of automotive technology.
Toyota’s strategy of doubling down on hybrids, while offering few all-electric cars, also appears to be paying off — at least for now. Many buyers are choosing hybrids, which cost a lot less than electric vehicles and don’t need to be charged, as a way to reduce emissions and fuel expenses.
But Toyota could be left behind if sales of electric vehicles grow faster than market analysts expect. Prices for battery-powered vehicles are dropping while the distance they can travel on a charge is growing. In China, electric vehicles are already cheaper than comparable gasoline models. More than half of new cars sold there are electric or plug-in hybrids.
Carmakers are trying to adapt. Stellantis, whose CEO, Carlos Tavares, quit this month, has new models lined up for 2025. They include several electric vehicles, among them Jeeps, Ram pickups and a Dodge Charger muscle car. The company is also working to repair its relationship with dealers that feel that Stellantis waited too long to lower prices and offer incentives to help them sell cars that were piling up on their lots.

In Mexico, China E.V.s Are Booming: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: BYD and other manufacturers are importing cars from China and scouting factory sites in Mexico as part of a global expansion that, for now, excludes the United States.
Behind a crumbling brick wall in a working-class neighborhood of Mexico City lurks a seemingly innocuous car lot. But it could be a sign of a potentially grave threat to the North American auto industry.
A makeshift dealership for the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD has sprung up in this dusty lot. Esteban Alegría, an employee, said the dealership was selling cars as fast as they arrived from China. Mr. Alegría's top seller is the Dolphin Mini, a small but capable four-door electric compact that costs about $ 18,000, about $ 10,000 less than the cheapest battery-powered vehicle available in the United States.
Mr. Alegría's dealership is one of dozens that Chinese carmakers like BYD, Chery, Geely and SAIC are opening up around Mexico as they establish a foothold in North America.
Chinese carmakers are effectively barred from the United States by tariffs that double the sticker price of vehicles imported from China, and they are not yet manufacturing significant numbers of vehicles in Mexico that could be exported across the border.
But their ambition to expand overseas is on vivid display in Mexico and across Latin America, Asia, Europe and Africa. Ads for Chinese brands are in airports and soccer stadiums and loom above Mexico City streets on large billboards. Chinese cars, both gasoline and electric models, are an increasingly common sight.
BYD and others are also looking for places to build factories in Mexico, although none have announced firm plans. Initially, the plants would serve Latin America, part of a campaign by Chinese automakers to erode the dominance of Japanese, American and European carmakers in places like Brazil and Thailand.
But there is little doubt that, eventually, Chinese carmakers hope to use Mexico as an on-ramp to the United States.
"Maybe next year BYD can enter the United States," Mr. Alegría said optimistically, as salsa music blared from a speaker hung on a pole and two men washed the dust from a newly arrived Dolphin. Nearby, workers mortared a cinder block wall, part of a new building that will replace the one-room sales office made of rough bricks topped by a corrugated metal roof.
"If not," Mr. Alegría added, with a smile, "I can deliver."
It is very unlikely that the Dolphin or any other Chinese car brand will be available in the United States soon. Because of the high tariffs, Chinese carmakers have not tried to establish dealerships or get approval from federal regulators to sell in the United States. (BYD does make electric buses in California.)
And someone buying a BYD from a Mexican dealer like Mr. Alegría would have a hard time registering and insuring it in the United States because the cars have not demonstrated that they meet safety standards.
President Biden and President-elect Donald J. Trump have been emphatic about wanting to keep Chinese automakers out of the United States, well aware of the threat they pose to U.S. car and auto parts factories that employ a million workers.
Mr. Trump has threatened 25 percent tariffs on all Mexican products, including cars. Mr. Biden has pursued policies aimed at fending off the challenge from China, including subsidies for U.S. battery factories. The Chinese government has long subsidized carmakers with the goal of becoming a major auto exporter.
But in the years to come it may be difficult to explain to consumers in the United States why they're not allowed to buy inexpensive electric vehicles that are readily available across the border, especially if they're made in Mexico, which already manufactures millions of cars for the United States.
Less than 20 years ago, Chinese cars were widely seen as inferior, even by many Chinese drivers. But in recent years, the country's manufacturers have pulled even with foreign rivals in mechanical quality, analysts say, and often surpass U.S., Japanese and European carmakers in battery technology, autonomous driving and entertainment software. (Think in-car karaoke and rotating touch screens.)
Chinese carmakers have clawed significant market share domestically from once-dominant companies like Volkswagen. Even Tesla, which has a large factory in Shanghai, has lost ground to BYD and other Chinese carmakers. Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, will be in a position to influence U.S. auto and China policy after spending more than $ 250 million to support the Trump campaign and becoming a close adviser to the president-elect.
"Before the pandemic, the rules were set down by the Western carmakers," said Felipe Munoz, global analyst at JATO Dynamics, a research firm. "Now it's the opposite."
Representatives of several Chinese carmakers declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. Jorge Vallejo, BYD's director general for Mexico, agreed to an interview but canceled abruptly as New York Times reporters waited outside his office in Mexico City. The company's representative declined to reschedule or make other executives available.
China's car market is the world's largest by far, and the growing prowess of domestic producers is having far-reaching effects. General Motors said on Wednesday that it would take a more than $ 5 billion hit to its profit as it restructured its operations in China, which have been losing money in recent years.
Mary T. Barra, G.M.'s chief executive, acknowledged the price pressure from Chinese carmakers during an interview in October. "We'll continue to look at smart ways to take cost out," she said, while insisting that the company could still compete with China.
Arno Antlitz, the chief financial officer of Volkswagen, noted that the industry had dealt with new competitors before, including Japanese carmakers in the 1970s and South Korean carmakers in recent decades. "We think we have a competitive setup," he said in an interview in October.
Still, the auto industry does not appear to have seen anything like the current wave of Chinese brands, which have quickly overtaken Japanese companies as the world's largest auto exporters.
Chinese carmakers have made deep inroads in countries where they have local production or face few significant trade barriers. In Brazil, Chinese brands have a 9 percent share of car sales, up from 1 percent in 2019. In Thailand, they have 18 percent of the market, up from 5 percent in 2019, according to JATO.
In Mexico, Chinese brands now account for 9 percent of new car sales, up from effectively nothing five years ago.
"They gained market share when other brands didn't have inventory and there were long waits to get cars in Mexico," said Guillermo Rosales Zárate, president of the Mexican Association of Automobile Distributors.
In San Luis Potosí, an industrial hub 250 miles north of Mexico City, BYD models are taking customers from Toyota, said Fernando López, manager of a dealership that sells both brands from a showroom in an upscale neighborhood.
BYD's Shark pickup, a $ 45,000 plug-in hybrid, is poaching buyers from the Toyota Tacoma, he said, while the BYD Song, a $ 30,000 plug-in S.U.V., is luring customers from the Toyota RAV4. The Chinese models cost $ 10,000 less than the comparable Toyotas.
"I don't know if people are going to let them sell in the United States," Mr. López said, referring to BYD, "but they can compete with any brand."
Mexico is the world's seventh-largest auto producer, just behind South Korea and Germany. Most major carmakers have factories in Mexico, including G.M., Ford Motor, Stellantis and Volkswagen. Many use parts from Chinese companies like Minghua, which produces bumpers and other components from a plant next to a large BMW factory outside San Luis Potosí.
Almost 80 percent of vehicles produced in Mexico, more than two million through September, went to the United States, according to the Mexican Automotive Industry Association.
Although U.S. tariffs on cars made in China are high, in theory Chinese cars made in Mexico and exported north of the border would currently have to pay a maximum tariff of just 2.5 percent.
But the United States would probably put pressure on the Mexican government to erect barriers to Chinese automakers. Mexico's new president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has played down talk of a BYD factory in Mexico and emphasized that relations with the United States are the government's top priority.
Mexico is "so economically tied to the U.S., at the end of the day this is a straightforward calculation," said Joshua Meltzer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who focuses on international economic relations. In October, the Mexican government raised the tariff on imported cars to 20 percent from 15 percent, in what was widely seen as a reaction to growing sales of Chinese vehicles.
The threat from China will grow as electric vehicles become more popular. Those cars already account for half of all new cars in China, giving the country's carmakers a head start.
Auto executives expect electric vehicles to eventually supplant gasoline and diesel models even if Mr. Trump removes financial incentives for such cars and trucks. G.M., Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and others have staked billions of dollars on electric-car and battery factories.
In Mexico, electric vehicles account for less than 2 percent of new car sales, but have grown more than 40 percent this year despite a dearth of public chargers. Electric vehicles in Mexico City are exempt from restrictions that apply to gasoline and diesel vehicles on days when air pollution is very bad.
That helps the Dolphin Mini, said Daniela Alvarez, a saleswoman at another BYD dealership squeezed into a storefront beneath a Mexico City parking garage.
Ms. Alvarez rattled off the Dolphin's technical specifications, including its advanced battery technology, rotating video display and four airbags. While Chinese electric vehicles still cost more than gasoline models, she said, they cost only 30 percent as much to fuel.
"Electricity is cheaper than gas," she said. "You can make up the difference."

Chi-Chi's Chain of Restaurants Is Coming Back After 20 Years: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The chain, which closed in 2004, is poised for a revival next year after the son of one of the founders reached a deal with Hormel Foods.
Chi-Chi's, the Mexican restaurant chain that closed 20 years ago, is poised for a revival next year after Michael McDermott, the son of one of the founders, announced a deal with Hormel Foods.
Under the agreement with Hormel, which owns the brand's trademarks, Mr. McDermott will be able to use the Chi-Chi's name on newly opened restaurants in 2025.
In a news release announcing the deal, Mr. McDermott said he had "fond memories" of growing up in Chi-Chi's restaurants.
He credited his father with instilling in him "the passion and determination to pursue my own career in the restaurant industry."
Mr. McDermott said in a statement on Friday that the new business venture was "in the early stages of planning by securing funding" but shared that the first two restaurants to open will be in Minnesota.
He did not clarify where in Minnesota the sites would be or how many restaurants might ultimately be opened under the revival.
"Our goal is to explore the original development path Chi-Chi's took, through both company and franchised opportunities within the Midwest and East Coast," Mr. McDermott said.
A spokesman for Hormel said in a statement that "the legacy and spirit of the brand remain strong."
Founded in 1975 by the restaurateur Marno McDermott and Max McGee, a former Green Bay Packers player, Chi-Chi's had more than 200 locations nationwide at its peak.
The casual sit-down restaurant sold crowd favorites like chimichangas, deep-fried burritos and "fried" ice cream that its menu called its specialty.
By the time Chi-Chi's closed its doors in 2004 after a series of ownership changes, the company had long been struggling.
Around the time of its bankruptcy filing in 2003, Chi-Chi's was grappling with a hepatitis A outbreak at one of its Pennsylvania restaurants.
The outbreak killed four people and sickened 660, according to The Associated Press. The Food and Drug Administration determined the outbreak was linked to green onions grown in Mexico, according to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
Consumers in 2024 are unlikely to remember the outbreak, said Jeffrey Sharlach, a management communication professor at the New York University Stern School of Business.
"What we see, historically, is that most food brands recover very, very quickly from these food-poisoning incidents," he said.
Instead, consumers are more likely to remember the brand name and any fond memories they might have of going to a Chi-Chi's while they were growing up, he said.
It's the type of nostalgia that has helped revive brands, he said, pointing to the Volkswagen Beetle and Polaroid as examples.
"You can't underestimate how challenging it is to build a brand name from scratch," he said. "So there is value in the nostalgia, not only in the name recognition and awareness, but also in that emotional appeal."
But whether there is enough nostalgia to make Chi-Chi's successful is another matter.
Eric Greenleaf, a marketing professor also at the New York University Stern School of Business, said the restaurant's biggest challenges will be overcoming how long it had been away and the stiff competition it would face in the Mexican food market, which has "become much more sophisticated."
"It's very difficult to make a lot of money in the restaurant business," he said.

Full text: The European Union and four South American countries have reached an agreement to establish one of the largest trade zones in the world.
The European Union reached a major trade agreement on Friday with four South American countries, concluding a long-delayed negotiation that took on new urgency as President-elect Donald J. Trump threatened to impose tariffs on some of the world's largest economies.
The deal, between the European Union and members of Mercosur -- a bloc that includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- would establish one of the largest trade zones in the world and would be the European Union's biggest trade agreement ever.
With European leaders preparing for the possibility that Mr. Trump's return to office will lead to a more fragmented global economy, the deal is a significant victory for proponents of free trade, linking markets with more than 700 million people. But it could fuel frustration within the European bloc, with France, the biggest critic of the deal, opposed to the agreement over concerns about the possible dumping of cheap agricultural imports in Europe, which could hurt its farmers.
If ratified by European Union member states and the European Parliament, the agreement would lift tariffs on products including meat, cars, wine and chocolate. Despite France's strong opposition to the agreement, Paris does not appear to have persuaded enough other European countries to vote against it, although it signaled it would still lobby to block it. A date for the ratification vote has not yet been set.
What's in the trade deal?
With Mr. Trump's election, Europe is facing the threat of high tariffs on exports to the United States, its biggest trading partner, and increased competition from China. Mr. Trump has suggested that he would impose tariffs of 10 to 20 percent on products around the world and tariffs of 60 percent or more on Chinese goods.
So European leaders have emphasized the need to diversify trade.
Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, said on Friday that the political agreement was a milestone for Europe and South America.
"We both believe that openness and cooperation are the true engines of progress and prosperity," she said, speaking in Uruguay. "I know that strong winds are blowing in the opposite direction, towards isolation and fragmentation, but this agreement is our clear response."
Negotiations over the trade deal began 25 years ago and came close to a breakthrough in 2019. Ms. von der Leyen said the agreement would save European companies 4 billion euros ( $ 4.2 billion) in export duties per year.
The prospect of Mr. Trump's tariffs has also made the deal more compelling for the members of Mercosur, who are interested in selling more beef and industrial products to Europe. And China's intention to increase agricultural production means that a major buyer of Argentine and Brazilian meat and soybeans could reduce purchases.
Bolivia, a member of Mercosur, could join the agreement if it aligns its rules in line with other members of the bloc.
Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow in Brussels at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the deal came at a critical moment. "The signal is that, well, the United States may be pulling out of the global trading system, but the rest of the world is intent on pursuing a different route," he said.
It is a boon for European carmakers and others.
Economists say the agreement is critical for Europe, which is facing a disappointing economic outlook, and particularly for Germany, the biggest exporter to the Mercosur region. Tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump would exacerbate challenges for major European industries, including the automobile, pharmaceutical and machinery sectors.
European carmakers, including BMW, Fiat, Peugeot and Volkswagen, would benefit from lower tariffs on imports and exports between the two blocs. Novartis, Sanofi and other European pharmaceutical giants would gain easier access to a large market for health care products.
A range of other European industries, such as the luxury sector, tech, construction and banking, would also be able to reach hundreds of millions of consumers.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany said on Friday that an "important hurdle" for the agreement had been overcome. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of Spain, which manufactures large quantities of chemicals and pharmaceuticals, said on Friday that the agreement would make Europe "more prosperous and resilient." The Spanish government said the agreement would increase exports by up to 40 percent and create an estimated 22,000 jobs.
Even if Europe is spared from U.S. tariffs, escalating tension between the United States and China could pose problems for European companies. Business leaders are concerned that if Chinese products are shut out of U.S. markets, a surge of cheap Chinese imports would instead enter Europe or other markets where Europe competes.
Europe needs to prioritize not only the ratification of the South America trade agreement, but also trade agreements with other countries and regions, like Britain and Switzerland and nations in the Indo-Pacific region, said Ignacio García Bercero, a former European Commission trade official. The European bloc already has trade deals with most other countries in South America.
South America is also a reservoir of raw materials like lithium, nickel and manganese that are needed for Europe's transition to green energy.
France opposes the deal out of concern for farmers.
France has bitterly opposed the pact, saying it would open Europe's agricultural markets to cheap food imports, including beef and wheat, that use hormones and pesticides that are forbidden in Europe. French farmers, a politically powerful lobby, have joined others across the bloc to denounce what they fear will amount to food dumping that risks their economic survival.
Poland and Italy have also expressed concerns about the deal.
The timing is precarious for Emmanuel Macron, the embattled president of France, whose government is mired in crisis. He has called the agreement "unacceptable," and on Friday, France sought to bat down suggestions that the country was isolated in its opposition. "Today is clearly not the end of the story," the French trade minister, Sophie Primas, said, referring to the government's hope to prevent the deal from being approved by the 27 national parliaments in the European Union.
Environmental groups also oppose the deal, saying it would accelerate the destruction of forests in the Amazon to make way for increased agricultural production.
Ms. von der Leyen's decision to push through the deal without Mr. Macron's approval could fuel suspicion in France about giving Brussels too much power and could spur support for Marine Le Pen, a nationalist, anti-immigrant leader who also opposes the deal.
"It's a bit of a tinder box," Mr. Kirkegaard said. "The deal will remind many French voters that they don't have much influence in the E.U. anymore."

New China Slaps Back At U.S. Move In Trade War: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Faltering U.S. industrial leadership has allowed China to take a harder trade stance as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office.
When Donald J. Trump fired the opening shots in a trade war during his first term, Chinese officials often took days to respond and Chinese businesses followed every threat with alarm.
But this week, after the Biden administration broadened its restrictions on advanced technology that could be sent to China, Beijing announced sweeping retaliation in a single day. The country's stock market investors mostly shrugged at the Biden administration's action.
And on Wednesday, General Motors, a onetime cornerstone of American industrial might, said it was taking a $ 5 billion hit to profit to recognize that it was no longer able to adequately compete with Chinese carmakers.
The fast-moving developments have underlined how far China has come as an industrial superpower, and its readiness for a potentially bruising battle with the second Trump administration. China now has a manufacturing sector that is larger than those of the United States, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Britain put together. It produces some of the world's most advanced technology.
There are a few areas in which China has not caught up with the United States, with the most advanced semiconductors perhaps being the most prominent. But in many other sectors, including all but the fastest semiconductors, its manufacturers are coming close to ending their dependence on American supplies.
That was evident in the announcement on Tuesday by four government-linked trade associations that urged Chinese companies making everything from cars to communications equipment to be wary of buying any more American computer chips.
"The Chinese chip industry is stronger now than eight years ago, so we can make such a strong declaration," said Hu Xijin, an influential nationalistic commentator in China. "Eight years ago, such a declaration was unthinkable," said Mr. Hu, who has nearly 25 million followers on social media.
Beijing's other response to Washington on Tuesday, involving minerals, also highlighted China's new willingness to publicly and directly confront foreign trading partners. The Ministry of Commerce, in a statement on its website, said it had banned with immediate effect the export of four critical minerals to the United States that were mined or processed mainly in China.
When China imposed a two-month export embargo on rare earth metals to Japan in 2010, by contrast, it did so in complete secrecy. The Commerce Ministry called in representatives of two dozen companies, told them not to export and warned them that they would lose their export licenses if they told the news media.
The most recent sign of China's industrial muscle came in the profit charges by General Motors, which the company has incurred while restructuring its China joint venture with SAIC Motor. When Mr. Trump took office in early 2017, the Chinese ventures of G.M. and Volkswagen were locked in a long-running battle for leadership in China while domestic brands lagged far behind.
But G.M. brands that used to rank among the leaders in China sales, like Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac, no longer even rank among the top 20. BYD, a Chinese electric car manufacturer based in Shenzhen, is now the best-selling brand in China and is rapidly stepping up exports to the rest of the world.
When G.M. opened an assembly line in Shanghai in 1998, the company showed off the several dozen robots it had imported from outside China. But when Volkswagen -- Germany's signature automaker -- opened an electric car assembly plant last year in Hefei, China, it ordered just one robot imported from its home country. VW bought the other 1,074 robots from a factory in Shanghai.
And while G.M.'s decision to open an assembly line in Shanghai in the late 1990s to build 100,000 Buicks a year was a big bet on the Chinese market, BYD is now building an industrial complex in Hefei with the capacity to make 1.5 million cars a year.
China has used tariffs and other fiscal policies to help its homegrown companies gain an advantage: It charges taxes totaling as much as 100 percent on imported cars and sport utility vehicles with large gasoline engines, a category in which G.M. is strong. By contrast, electric cars from Chinese manufacturers face a tax rate of only 13 percent.
So G.M. and its Detroit rivals have long been unable to sell more than a trickle of cars from the United States in China. Now even their sales of gasoline-powered cars from factories inside China have plunged as more than half of Chinese buyers choose battery-electric or plug-in hybrid cars.
The big question now is how the Trump administration will respond to China's assertive stance. For decades, China has fairly consistently sold about $ 4 worth of goods to the United States for every $ 1 worth of goods that it buys. That imbalance partly reflects Beijing's many tariffs and informal limits on imports, as well as an enormous government effort during nearly two decades to replace imported manufactured goods with domestic production.
Overall Sino-American trade has grown rapidly. So the lopsided ratio has translated into a large American trade deficit.
China's overall trade surplus in manufactured goods, mainly but not entirely with the United States, now equals a tenth of the country's entire economic output. That surplus has created millions of factory jobs in China. But it also means China has more to lose than the United States does in a broad trade war.
Chinese officials appear to be preparing for a world in which they do not seek confrontation with the United States, but are prepared for the two countries to pursue their own economic paths. Their preferred term for that course: "peaceful coexistence."

G.M. to Take $5 Billion Hit And Revamp China Project: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: General Motors and other foreign automakers are selling fewer cars and losing lots of money in China, where domestic electric and hybrid cars have taken off.
General Motors said on Wednesday that it would take a more than $ 5 billion hit to its profit as it restructured its ailing operations in China, which have been losing money as its car sales there have dropped sharply.
G.M. and SAIC Motor, a state-owned company, operate a 50-50 joint venture, SAIC-GM, that is based in Shanghai and produces and sells vehicles under several brand names, including Cadillac and Buick. Founded in 1997, the venture once grew steadily and generated considerable profits.
But over the last several years, the business has lost market share to Chinese manufacturers that invested heavily in electric and hybrid cars, which have come to account for more than half of all vehicles sold in China.
G.M. said in a regulatory filing that it would report an expense of $ 2.6 billion to $ 2.9 billion in the fourth quarter to reflect the reduction in the value of G.M.'s investment in its Chinese joint venture on its balance sheet. Another $ 2.7 billion expense, most of which will be recognized in the fourth quarter, will reflect G.M.'s share of the cost of restructuring measures the joint venture will take.
In the first nine months of the year, G.M. lost $ 347 million on its Chinese operations. Its sales in the country fell nearly 20 percent in that period, while its market share dropped to 6.8 percent, from 8.6 percent a year earlier and more than 15 percent in 2015.
The announcement indicates that G.M. does not expect its Chinese operations to rebound soon.
"We are focused on capital efficiency and cost discipline and have been working with SGM to turn around the business in China in order to be sustainable and profitable in the market," the company said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. "We are close to finalizing our restructuring plan with our partner, and we expect our results in China in 2025 to show year-over-year improvement."
G.M.'s troubles in China, the world's largest vehicle market, reflect a broader trend. Almost all foreign automakers there, including European, Japanese and South Korean companies, are struggling as increasingly ambitious Chinese car companies like BYD and Geely introduce new models and slash prices. Many of those automakers are also exporting a growing number of cars to other countries in Asia, Europe and Latin America.
Ford Motor has been working to streamline and reorganize its Chinese joint venture for several years. The automaker spent $ 881 million restructuring the business in the first nine months of the year.
Volkswagen, an early entrant into the Chinese market, was the top-selling automaker in the country for four decades. But its business there has slumped as car buyers have quickly turned to electric and hybrid vehicles made by BYD, which is vying this year to pass Tesla as the world's largest producer of electric cars, and by others.
BYD also appears poised to pass Ford this year to become the world's sixth-largest automaker overall.
Volkswagen's vehicle sales in China have dropped more than 10 percent this year, compounding other troubles for the German company. It recently said it might have to close factories in its home country for the first time.
Last week, Volkswagen said it was looking to sell stakes in operations in China's northwestern Xinjiang region, where the authorities have cracked down harshly on a predominantly Muslim ethnic group that lives there.
Chinese banks and local governments have provided low-cost loans, land and other incentives to locally owned automakers, enabling some to sell cars for less than they cost to produce.
In an October letter to shareholders, G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the company was seeing improvements in its Chinese operations. Sales in China in the third quarter were better than in the second, while dealer inventory fell sharply and electric vehicle sales were on track to hit the company's 2024 production and profit targets.
G.M. is solidly profitable in North America, which is where the company makes the vast majority of its profits. In October, the automaker said it expected to report 2024 net income of $ 10.4 billion to $ 11.1 billion.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The company, facing slumping sales, announced that Carlos Tavares would step down immediately and that a search for a new chief was underway.
The chief executive of the automaker Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, has resigned, the company said on Sunday, amid a decline in profits and slumping sales in its key North America region.
Mr. Tavares, 66, spearheaded the creation of the company in a 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and France's Peugeot. The company is one of the largest automakers in the world and produces vehicles under an array of brand names, including Chrysler, Jeep, Ram, Dodge, Fiat, Peugeot, Opel and Maserati.
"Stellantis's success since its creation has been rooted in a perfect alignment between the reference shareholders, the board and the C.E.O.," the company's senior independent director, Henri de Castries, said in a statement. "However, in recent weeks different views have emerged which have resulted in the board and the C.E.O. coming to today's decision."
Mr. Tavares could not immediately be reached for comment.
The resignation took effect on Sunday, the company said in the statement. Mr. Tavares had announced this year that he planned to retire at the end of his current contract, in 2026. The company also said a search for a successor by a special board committee was "well underway." It added that a new executive committee, headed by John Elkann, the chairman of the Stellantis board, would run the company until a permanent replacement for Mr. Tavares was named.
Mr. Elkann is a grandson of Gianni Agnelli, the Italian industrialist who founded Fiat. Mr. Elkann worked closely with Sergio Marchionne, who engineered Fiat's 2009 takeover of Chrysler, which was going through a bankruptcy.
Fiat Chrysler became profitable and grew under Mr. Marchionne, who died unexpectedly in 2018.
By 2020, though, both Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot were struggling to keep pace with other automakers that were investing tens of billions of dollars to develop and produce electric vehicles, and a merger between the two companies was forged. The combined company renamed itself Stellantis in 2021.
Under Mr. Tavares, Stellantis flourished for a time after the trans-Atlantic merger, and reported a record profit of 18.6 billion euros, about $ 19.7 billion, in 2023. He also outlined plans to develop E.V.s, although Stellantis was moving at a slower pace than its Detroit rivals, General Motors and Ford Motor. Bonuses stemming from the 2023 results helped make Mr. Tavares one of the highest-paid executives in the auto industry.
But the company's profits have fallen this year, as sales in the United States have dropped significantly. It was slow to match rivals' price reductions and sales incentives, and dealer inventories rose. In response, Stellantis has laid off workers, cut production and left idle a plant in Illinois that it had planned to restart.
In the first nine months of the year, Stellantis's U.S. sales fell 17 percent. In September, a group of dealers sent Mr. Tavares an open letter, blaming him for decisions aimed at driving up profits in 2023 that they said left the company in a troubled state.
"The intent of this letter is to sound an alarm -- an alarm, not only to you, but to the Stellantis board of directors, your employees, your investors and your suppliers," the letter said. "The reckless short-term decision making to secure record profits in 2023 has had devastating, yet entirely predictable, consequences in the U.S. market."
Soon after, Stellantis issued a profit warning, saying the cost of fixing its U.S. operations would dent its bottom line. Specifically, the company said operating profit would, at best, amount to 7 percent of sales compared with an earlier forecast of more than 10 percent.
The company's stock price has dropped more than 50 percent this year, from a high of more than $ 29 in March to $ 13.20, its close on Friday. On Monday, the stock fell another 8 percent.
The transition to electric vehicles has presented challenges for many automakers. While G.M., Toyota and Tesla continue to post substantial profits, Ford and Volkswagen have struggled to make money on E.V.s. The E.V. start-up Rivian has had trouble ramping up sales beyond about 50,000 vehicles a year.
Volkswagen recently said it could close as many as three plants, including factories in Germany, a once-unthinkable step for the company.
Mr. Tavares was born and educated in Portugal, and joined Renault in his early 20s. He rose through the ranks and became a close lieutenant of Carlos Ghosn, who was the chief executive of both Renault and Nissan. Mr. Tavares worked at the Japanese automaker Nissan for several years while it was controlled by Renault. He left Renault amid a falling out with Mr. Ghosn in 2013, and was hired as Peugeot's chief executive a year later.
Last month, Mr. Tavares announced a new design for large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, including electric models, and said Stellantis was on track to slash carbon emissions from its vehicles and factories by 2038. "This is our commitment to no-compromise innovation as we deliver clean, safe and affordable mobility to all," he said.

VW Workers in Germany, Under Threat of Closings, Stage Strikes: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Workers at nine of the automaker's German factories walked off their jobs for several hours, and warned they would escalate the action if their demands went unmet.
Volkswagen workers across Germany escalated their labor dispute with management by walking off their jobs for several hours on Monday, and their union threatened longer strikes if their demands were not met.
The automaker is in the middle of labor negotiations with IG Metall, the union representing most of its workers, as the company tries to reduce costs in an effort to return it to profitability. Volkswagen is seeking 10 percent wage cuts and threatening to close factories in Germany, the first such move in its 87-year history.
Thousands of workers at nine of the company's plants in Germany, as well as several other subsidiaries that are covered under a wage agreement with the automaker, staged two-hour strikes on Monday, demanding that Volkswagen guarantee their jobs and keep its factories open.
IG Metall has threatened to start longer walkouts, or open-ended strikes, unless it is able to reach an agreement with Volkswagen managers.
"If necessary, this will be the toughest collective-bargaining battle Volkswagen has ever seen," said Thorsten Gröger, the chief negotiator and district manager for the union. "Volkswagen will have to decide at the negotiating table how long and how intense this dispute has to be."
The labor battle, the company's first involving strikes since 2018, comes as Volkswagen, Germany's leading automaker, faces slowing demand for its cars in Europe and Asia, as well as increased competition from Chinese automakers.
"Volkswagen respects the right of employees to take part in a warning strike," a company representative said in an emailed statement on Monday, adding that measures had been taken to try to minimize the effect of the strikes on customers.
Volkswagen remains interested in reaching "a sustainable and jointly supported solution," the company said.
The two sides are scheduled to meet next Monday for a fourth round of talks that have so far remained deadlocked. Germany's labor system guarantees employees certain rights in the workplace, and in the case of Volkswagen, that has meant that protracted strikes are relatively rare.
But this fight, coming at a time of political uncertainty after the collapse of the coalition government in Berlin, coupled with a near-stagnant German economy and an automotive industry in transformation, could challenge Germany's traditional, cooperation-based model of labor negotiations.
"It is important that we fight and show our teeth," Daniela Cavallo, who leads Volkswagen's works council and is a member of IG Metall, told hundreds of workers who were striking at the company's Wolfsburg headquarters on Monday.
Last week, Volkswagen rejected a union proposal that involved forgoing wage increases in exchange for job guarantees by setting up a fund to be tapped when things get tight in the future. IG Metall had calculated that the offer would save the company 1.5 billion euros, about $ 1.6 billion, but Volkswagen said the proposal fell short of the long-term structural change that it had deemed necessary.
Over the weekend, the union hosted a late-night party outside the Volkswagen factory in Emden to mark the end of a weekslong "peace period," which started at the beginning of wage negotiations but ran out at midnight on Sunday.
Bratwursts sizzled on grills, and workers dressed in bright red union vests sipped hot mulled wine, making it look as if they were celebrating the holiday season. But the tone was serious.
"There is no other issue around the dinner table anymore," Torsten Hasenpusch, a representative for IG Metall in Emden, told the German public television broadcaster NDR. "Will I lose my job? Can we keep up our standard of living? It's all people can think about."

E.V. Chargers Finally Pay Off for Retailers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Companies see charging as a potentially profitable business in and of itself, not just as a spur for foot traffic and sales.
Sarajane Leary knows what to do when her electric car is low on power: She goes grocery shopping.
On a recent afternoon, Ms. Leary plugged her Toyota bZ4X into a fast electric vehicle charger in the parking lot of a Hannaford supermarket in Altamont, N.Y., and then headed into the store for paper goods and potato chips.
"I'll get a 50 percent charge while I'm here," she said.
The time -- and money -- Ms. Leary spends in a store while charging her car is exactly the kind of thing retailers, shopping centers and malls bet on when they started installing E.V. chargers decades ago. For years, their experience was mixed, and the actual benefits were unclear.
Now, new studies say retailers' charging efforts may well be paying off: One peer-reviewed study by researchers at Boston University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison published this year looked at the impact of nearly 1,600 Tesla Supercharger stations in more than 800 U.S. counties and found a 4 percent increase in monthly visits for retailers within 200 meters of chargers after they were installed. The effects were most pronounced for retailers within 150 meters. The researchers also found a 5 percent increase in spending.
Another recent study, published in Nature Communications, analyzed data from California, where E.V. ownership and charging infrastructure are more widespread than in other states. It found that installing chargers brought more modest increases in foot traffic and spending but that public E.V. stations "tend to attract higher-income, exploratory visitors and local residents," and in low-income areas they "enhance businesses."
Some companies -- notably Walmart, the largest retailer in the United States -- are seeing charging as a potentially profitable business in and of itself, not just as a spur for foot traffic and sales. They have begun building charging stations under their own brand names rather than relying on providers that lease a part of their parking lots to install and maintain the stations.
"Companies are beginning to see charging as something that can potentially help the bottom line," said Graham Evans, a director at S&P Global Mobility, an automotive market research firm. "It's going to become more ubiquitous rather than a token gesture."
The embrace of charging comes as more Americans -- many of whom are worried about a warming planet -- trade in their gas-powered cars. In 2023, 1.4 million plug-in electric vehicles were sold in the United States, more than 9 percent of all car sales that year and an increase of over 50 percent from 2022, according to Argonne National Laboratory, a federally funded research center. And although the growth of E.V. sales has slowed this year, an estimated 346,309 of the vehicles were sold in the third quarter, nearly 9 percent of sales, according to Cox Automotive, a market research firm. (It is too soon to say what impact Donald J. Trump's election will have on sales, but during his campaign he vowed that if he became president he would end the Biden administration's policies that encourage E.V. manufacturing and sales.)
Some of the slowdown in E.V. sales this year can be chalked up to drivers who hesitate to trade in their gas-powered cars because of concerns about E.V. charging infrastructure, which has grown more slowly than E.V. sales. Broken chargers have been a problem: One in five ports does not work when motorists pull up, according to recent research led by a Harvard Business School fellow.
In total, over 200,000 public chargers are spread across about 74,000 stations, but more than a million public chargers will be needed by 2030 to keep up with E.V. sales, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have estimated.
Even with the Biden administration's $ 5 billion plan to fill in the infrastructure gap, a robust national network is still years away. Under that plan, states are required to submit proposals for charging operators and site hosts. Nearly 60 percent of the grants have gone to fuel and convenience stores, rest stops and service plazas, according to EVAdoption, a data and analytics firm. Still, only one in every 14 big-box locations offers charging, while one in every 15 grocery stores and one in every 40 department stores do, a Consumer Reports analysis found.
For many retailers, charging deficiencies present an opportunity: Truckers, ride-hailing drivers and people on long-distance trips rely on public chargers, as do the 5 percent of E.V. owners who are not able to charge at home, many of whom live in apartment buildings and park on the street. The most frequently used public chargers are at retailers, according to a 2024 study of usage data by J.D. Power, a data analytics company.
Some landlords of shopping centers and malls have found that installing chargers on their properties has helped to attract new tenants, said Jim Hurless, a managing director who oversees the E.V. business at the real estate firm CBRE.
But installing the chargers is complicated and expensive. The process involves surveying, engineering, permitting, connecting with local utilities, testing and inspection -- and can take up to 18 months from start to finish. Slower chargers -- considered a good fit for cinemas and hotels, where a customer parks for a few hours or overnight -- can cost up to $ 7,000 to install. Fast chargers, which can provide a significant charge in 20 minutes, can cost as much as $ 175,000.
Many retailers turn the project over to a charging company that pays them a monthly fee for the parking spaces used while retaining any revenue from customers. And those providers have been installing more, and faster, chargers and promising a more reliable, and in some cases plusher, customer experience than in the past.
Mercedes-Benz is investing $ 1 billion on the first phase of a new network of high-speed chargers that can accommodate all brands of vehicles. Its charging stations will have lounges -- and landscaping -- at some locations. The automaker has installed charging hubs at a dozen Buc-ee's gas and convenience stores in the Southeast, with plans to expand to more than 40 additional sites. Starbucks, which had Volvo install 15 stations on properties between Seattle and Denver, will work with Mercedes to add 100 more, including on Interstate 5 on the West Coast.
Some charging companies are developing methods to speed up installations. EVgo has begun to experiment with a prefabricated model, with its first installation at a site in League City, Texas, in March.
But some retailers, like the convenience-store chains 7-Eleven and RaceTrac, are seeking to take control over -- and monetize -- charging by building their own networks.
For several years, Walmart has worked with Electrify America, a division of Volkswagen, and now has Electrify America stations at 280 of the retailer's stores. When Walmart tested its own chargers at stores near its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters and in a town near Dallas, it found demand surprisingly strong, said Vishal Kapadia, the company's senior vice president for energy transformation.
"There is a need for this infrastructure in many pockets," he said.
The company is rolling out 15 stations in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and 10 in Phoenix, and it plans to have thousands across the country by 2030. Walmart expects to spend $ 1 million to $ 1.5 million at each site.
"Charging can be a profitable stand-alone business," Mr. Kapadia said. "The ancillary benefits are driving traffic to our locations."
Even Costco, one of the first retailers to install charging stations in the 1990s, before ripping them out in 2011 because the company said they were rarely used, has recently returned to E.V. charging. Costco installed a station at its store in Ridgefield, Wash., in just seven weeks.
Hannaford, a Northeast grocer with charging stations at 24 of 189 stores -- including the one Ms. Leary frequents -- got into the charging business because it was "how we want to present ourselves," said George Parmenter, health and sustainability lead at Hannaford. "It's a billboard that says, 'This is something important to us."'
Mr. Parmenter said he did not know to what extent charging led to in-store sales, but he noted that a Tesla charging station at a Hannaford store in Portland, Maine, averaged about 2,000 charging sessions a month.
"I don't know what else you could do to get that many people to show up," he added.
Brent Gruber, executive director of E.V. practice at J.D. Power, said: "Fifteen years ago it may have not made the most sense to add charging. Now it makes sense."

Even Costco, one of the first retailers to install charging stations in the 1990s, before ripping them out in 2011 because the company said they were rarely used, has recently returned to EV charging. Costco installed a station at its store in Ridgefield, Washington, in just seven weeks.
Hannaford, a Northeast grocer with charging stations at 24 of 189 stores — including the one Leary frequents — got into the charging business because it was “how we want to present ourselves,” said George Parmenter, health and sustainability lead at Hannaford. “It’s a billboard that says, ‘This is something important to us.’”
Parmenter said he did not know to what extent charging led to in-store sales, but he noted that a Tesla charging station at a Hannaford store in Portland, Maine, averaged about 2,000 charging sessions a month.
“I don’t know what else you could do to get that many people to show up,” he added.
Brent Gruber, executive director of EV practice at J.D. Power, said: “Fifteen years ago it may have not made the most sense to add charging. Now it makes sense.”

Family Returns Prized Artifacts To Descendant of Famed Chief: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The beaten-up suitcase had been in the Newell family for more than a century, passed from dusty closet to dusty closet and pulled out every now and then for guests.
They would unlatch the metal clasps and take out a fringed shirt adorned with careful beadwork, a weathered pair of moccasins and an elaborate headdress that trailed eagle feathers down to the floor.
Passed along with the suitcase was the story told by their 19th-century ancestor, Major Cicero Newell, who said he had received the clothing from the well-known Lakota leader, Chief Spotted Tail, during his stint as an agent for the federal government's Indian affairs office beginning in the late 1870s in what is now South Dakota.
The suitcase had been passed down five generations, ending up in the guest room closet of Newell's great-great-grandson, James, a retired salesman living in a small town in Washington State.
But when it came time for James Newell to think about passing it along again, the sixth generation had a different idea.
"'Well, Dad, why don't we try giving it back?"' James Newell, 77, recalled his son, Eric, asking when the topic came up several years ago at the dinner table.
The older Newell thought about it. There was the issue of whom they would give it back to, but that could be worked out.
"It felt right," James Newell said.
The Newells's suitcase is part of an untold number of Native artifacts kept in attics and closets across America, their origin stories often clouded by decades-long games of intergenerational telephone.
A 1990 federal law set up a protocol for museums and other institutions to repatriate Native human remains, funerary objects and other cultural items in consultation with tribes and descendants. But that law doesn't cover the artifacts found in your grandfather's basement or your aunt's cupboard.
As younger generations inherit these possessions, they're more likely to have an impulse toward giving them back, repatriation experts say. Some are motivated by a sense of ethical responsibility, some by practical considerations, and some because they have less interest in the "cabinet of curiosities" traditions of earlier times.
"Priority No. 1 was to get it into the hands of somebody who is going to take care of it and maintain it," said Eric Newell, 46, who noted that it had been his "great-great-great-grandfather" who had the original connection to it.
So his father started doing research on the old suitcase in the closet, starting with the man who had asked that it be passed down to the firstborn son of each generation. (It had gone to James Newell, a second son, because his older brother had been wary of keeping the heirlooms in his trailer in the mountains, where he had worked as a logger.)
As with many family stories, the exact circumstances of how Cicero Newell came into possession of the heirlooms are somewhat ambiguous, so the Newells relied on what they had been told by previous generations and what they could find online.
A Civil War veteran from Michigan, Cicero Newell was appointed what was then termed a U.S. Indian agent -- an employee tasked with communicating between the federal government and tribes. He was stationed in what is now reservation land of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe.
It was a tumultuous time in the region: The U.S. government had recently seized the Black Hills, flouting the treaty that had promised tribes control over the vast Great Sioux Reservation.
Newell, who later wrote extensively about his time on the reservation, described how he came to admire the Lakota leaders he met. His tenure at times drew criticism; some newspaper accounts accused him of acting as a pawn for Lakota officials such as Chief Spotted Tail. One article criticized him in harsh personal terms for helping spread the word about a Sun Dance ceremony put on by the chief.
In his writings, Newell expressed a particular affection for Chief Spotted Tail, a storied tribal spokesman and negotiator who was shot and killed in 1881 by a member of his tribe. Newell wrote that when he passed on to the afterlife, "I hope that one of the first persons I may meet there will be my dear old friend Spotted Tail."
What, exactly, Chief Spotted Tail thought of Newell is less clear from the historical record. Newell wrote that during his time as a U.S. Indian agent, he had successfully convinced Spotted Tail and other Lakota parents to send their children to a new federal boarding school out east.
In recent years, research into Native American boarding schools has more fully revealed the neglect and abuse that many children endured in them, as well as their targeted efforts to erase Indigenous students' cultures to achieve assimilation.
In 1880, the year before he died, Chief Spotted Tail traveled to the school in Carlisle, Pa. Newspaper articles from around that time and letters kept in government archives indicate that he had been unhappy with the school's approach to punishment and grew distraught over the sickness and deaths of schoolchildren.
For James Newell, an idea of what to do with the suitcase began to take shape in 2020.
Newell, who had been researching for more than a year, was looking on the website of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe when he came upon a familiar name: John Spotted Tail, chief of staff to the tribal president. He reached him over the phone and told him what was inside his family's closet.
"At first I kind of thought it was a crank call," John Spotted Tail, 69, recalled.
But as he listened to Newell's story -- after explaining to him that he was five generations removed from Chief Spotted Tail -- he began to grow interested.
Newell was eager to give the contents of the suitcase to a descendant of the Lakota chief but wary of driving it across the country. Federal law prohibits the possession of eagle feathers without special dispensation, but the government allows exceptions for Native Americans because of their religious and cultural significance. Newell was worried that if he were to be stopped on the road, his possession of the headdress could land him in jail.
John Spotted Tail's curiosity was piqued by Newell's story. When he came home from work, he asked his wife if they had enough money to travel to Washington.
They got in the car the next morning, supplied with lunch meat and bread, and began a 1,400-mile drive to the home of a complete stranger.
"We're halfway there and I look at John and I said, 'What if these people aren't real?" said Spotted Tail's wife, Tamara Stands and Looks Back-Spotted Tail.
But as soon as the couple arrived in La Center, Wash., the Newells opened the suitcase for them. In addition to the clothing, it contained a bison horn and braided hair that could have belonged to a horse or a person.
"We looked at each other and we said, 'Is this real? 144 years?"' she said. "We were just kind of in awe."
After spending three days with the Newells, the Spotted Tails drove back to the Rosebud Reservation with the suitcase in the trunk of their Volkswagen Passat.
There was a tribal protocol they needed to follow to determine where the belongings would end up. They consulted Lakota spiritual leaders and cultural experts, participated in a ceremony surrounding the clothing and consulted other Spotted Tail relatives.
Some were skeptical about the story from the Newells; others wanted to see the items kept with the family. John Spotted Tail favored putting it in a museum, where visitors could learn about the Lakota leader.
For several years, he kept the suitcase in his home, but the responsibility began to weigh on him. "It was hard to even leave home or go anywhere because they were here," John Spotted Tail said.
He and his wife called the South Dakota State Historical Society in Pierre, where curators wanted to feature the century-and-a-half old heirlooms prominently and assured them that they would be well preserved. And the museum was less than a two-hour drive from the reservation, making it accessible to local relatives who wanted to visit.
The suitcase, and the story of how it got here, was a historical society director's dream.
The director, Ben Jones, looked through old photographs and read Newell's writings to try to find evidence indicating that the Lakota chief had given the one-time Indian agent such a significant gift.
None surfaced, but it was clear that the two men had crossed paths, living in the same area for a couple of years and navigating the conflict around the U.S. government's westward expansion.
In May, the Spotted Tails formally transferred the suitcase and its contents to the historical society at a ceremony involving Lakota prayers at a middle school in Pierre. The museum is hoping to put the heirlooms on display late next year.
"They became colleagues, and then friends," Jones said of Newell and Chief Spotted Tail, "and five generations later, their families were wondering what to do with these artifacts."

VW to Leave Contentious Region of China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The automaker has long been criticized by human rights activists for doing business in the territory, where China has repressed Muslim ethnic groups.
Volkswagen said on Wednesday that it was disposing of its ownership stakes in facilities in northwestern China's Xinjiang region, exiting an area now known for the country's crackdown on predominantly Muslim ethnic groups there.
Volkswagen had a joint venture assembly plant in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, as well as two test tracks in the region, maintaining the largest and most visible presence in Xinjiang of any multinational company. That drew condemnation from human rights groups. The United States and a growing number of European countries bar imports from Xinjiang because of evidence of forced labor there.
The Chinese government, which denies the accusations of forced labor, has put heavy pressure on global companies to keep doing business in Xinjiang. In September, the Ministry of Commerce began investigating whether PVH, the corporate parent of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger clothing brands, had taken "discriminatory measures" by not buying products from Xinjiang.
BASF, the German chemicals giant, has tried for a year to obtain Chinese government permission to dispose of its stakes in two manufacturing joint ventures in Xinjiang. BASF said on Wednesday that it was in negotiations to sell both stakes, but did not identify possible buyers.
For Volkswagen, the assembly plant in Urumqi did not just become a political liability -- it was also a money loser, because it was designed to make gasoline-powered cars. China has swiftly adopted electric vehicles in the last four years, and half the cars sold in China are now either battery-electric or plug-in hybrid cars.
That has left manufacturers like Volkswagen Group, which also includes Audi and Porsche, with considerable unneeded production capacity. Volkswagen was China's market leader from 1983 through last year, but BYD, a Chinese maker of electric cars, has passed it in sales this year.
The Urumqi assembly plant has not built cars since 2019 and is heavily guarded and closed to visitors. During a weekday visit last month to the factory's perimeter, there was no sign of activity inside the complex, where industrial buildings extend for hundreds of yards.
Volkswagen and its state-owned joint venture partner, SAIC Motor, now employ 175 workers who do the final preparation of cars at the Urumqi complex for delivery to dealerships in western China. The Shanghai municipal government owns SAIC Motor, which also makes the MG brand of cars and has been rapidly expanding exports.
Volkswagen said that ownership of the assembly plant and test tracks was being transferred by the joint venture to the Shanghai Motor Vehicle Inspection Center, which is owned by a different arm of the Shanghai government. No price was disclosed for the transaction.
Exporting from Urumqi is impractical: Nearby Central Asian countries buy few cars, and the plant is 1,800 miles from the coast, too far for seaborne shipments.
Volkswagen has been looking for factories to close this year, not just in China but also in Germany, where higher-cost plants have stayed open for years partly because of the company's large profits in China.
The company faces intensifying competition around the globe from Chinese automakers, which are expanding exports of both electric and gasoline-powered cars. Volkswagen responded by setting up a 3,000-engineer complex in central China to develop electric cars.
Volkswagen said that through 2040, it would continue its broader cooperation with SAIC in China, including the introduction of at least eight new electric models by 2030.
Volkswagen and SAIC built the assembly plant in Urumqi in 2012 and 2013 to make inexpensive cars to sell in western China. Volkswagen made a point of hiring numerous Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group in Xinjiang. Uyghurs have long faced discrimination from Chinese employers, and difficulties facing Uyghurs deepened after deadly attacks by Uyghur militants from 2008 to 2014.
Beginning in 2014, China cracked down on Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang. As many as a million ethnic Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other minorities were sent to indoctrination camps, detention centers and prisons. Associated forced-labor programs that sent rural Uyghurs to factories and to do other urban jobs also drew heavy criticism from human rights groups, and they have prompted the United States and some European countries to restrict imports from Xinjiang since 2021.
Volkswagen has denied accusations by overseas activists that it used forced labor by Uyghurs to build its test track near Urumqi. But when it hired an auditing firm last year to review its compliance in Xinjiang with international labor standards, the audit was criticized overseas for not sufficiently protecting the anonymity of the workers who participated.
Since February, Volkswagen had been saying it was in "advanced talks" to decide the future of its activities in Xinjiang. China's foreign ministry publicly urged Volkswagen and BASF in February not to leave the region, saying that they should "cherish the opportunity to invest and develop in Xinjiang."
But with sales of gasoline-powered cars in China dwindling further, and with MG cars and SAIC Motor encountering criticism from human rights activists over ties to Xinjiang, Beijing's hostility to withdrawal began to ebb.
China's foreign ministry did not comment about Volkswagen at its daily briefing.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Automakers and parts suppliers would struggle if President-elect Donald J. Trump followed through on his threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.
President-elect Donald J. Trump's threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada sent shivers on Tuesday through the auto industry, which depends heavily on both countries for parts and manufacturing.
The prospect of tariffs "is a two-alarm fire for the auto industry," said Patrick Anderson, chief executive of Anderson Economic Group, a consulting firm in Michigan. "There is probably not a single assembly plant in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Texas that would not immediately be affected by a 25 percent tariff."
The list of popular vehicles made in Mexico or Canada is long. It includes Ram pickups made by Stellantis in Saltillo, Mexico, and Chrysler minivans built in Windsor, Ontario. General Motors makes Chevrolet Silverado pickups and electric versions of Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s in Mexico, where Ford Motor also makes its Maverick pickup.
All of those vehicles and many others would become significantly more expensive if Mr. Trump, who won Michigan with promises to preserve auto jobs, followed through on his threat, economists said. Those higher auto prices would have a significant effect on overall inflation. And higher car prices would probably lead to lower sales and layoffs at auto factories.
"In his first term, President Trump instituted tariffs against China that created jobs, spurred investment and resulted in no inflation," Karoline Leavitt, spokeswoman for the Trump-Vance Transition, said in an email. Once in office, she said, he will work to bring jobs back to the United States by "raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations and unshackling American energy."
The prospect of disruptive tariffs hits the industry at a perilous moment. Virtually all automakers are struggling with sagging consumer demand, a growing preference for hybrids and electric cars, and the emergence of Chinese automakers like BYD that are pushing into markets once dominated by Japanese, American and European companies.
Signs of industry woes are proliferating. Nissan, which manufactures several vehicles in Aguascalientes, Mexico, as well as Mississippi and Tennessee, said this month that it would lay off 9,000 employees worldwide because of declining sales. Volkswagen, which has factories in Mexico and Tennessee, is considering closing plants in Europe for the first time in its history.
Sales at Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Peugeot, Fiat and other brands, fell 27 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier. Even luxury brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz, which make cars in Mexico and the United States, are earning smaller profits.
Mr. Trump's policy pronouncements have already jolted the industry. The president-elect has vowed to eliminate Biden-era subsidies for electric vehicles, endangering tens of billion of dollars that General Motors and other automakers have invested in U.S. battery factories and new car models.
"The auto industry is in a process of a transformation that is the biggest tech upgrade in history," said Dimitry Anastakis, a professor at the University of Toronto who studies business history. "They are looking for as much stability as possible as they navigate this disruptive landscape. To throw a spanner in the works is not helpful."
Mexican and Canadian factories buy auto parts from the United States and the two countries are major suppliers of components to virtually all U.S. manufacturers including Tesla. That company's chief executive, Elon Musk, was a big supporter of Mr. Trump's campaign and is expected to play a significant role in his administration.
Automakers got a taste of how closely linked they are to Canada in 2022, when groups of truck drivers in that country blocked a bridge linking Windsor to Detroit in protest of pandemic restrictions. Toyota, Ford, Stellantis and others were forced to shut down U.S. assembly lines because of parts shortages even though the protest lasted less than a week.
"Southern Ontario is closer to Detroit auto plants than the supply plants in Indiana, Ohio and Kansas are," said Erik Gordon, a professor of business at the University of Michigan, who follows the auto industry. Tariffs, he said, "would have an effect similar to New York City imposing a tax on food and fuel that comes into the city from New Jersey."
Mr. Trump said tariffs would remain in place until Mexico stopped the flow of illicit drugs and unauthorized immigrants to the United States. But tariffs could lead to an increase in migration if some of the one million Mexicans who work in the auto industry lost their jobs, analysts say.
"As the economy goes, there goes prosperity," said Anna Nagurney, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who studies supply chains. "It can have spillover effects."
Tariffs could push Mexico closer to China. BYD, SAIC, Geely and other Chinese carmakers have been moving into Mexico, plastering billboards with images of their cars and opening dealerships at a fast clip. BYD and others have been scouting locations in Monterrey and other cities as sites for manufacturing plants.
But plans for factories are on hold while the Chinese wait to see what Mr. Trump will do, Mexican officials have said.
Wall Street was clearly alarmed by the prospect of tariffs. G.M.'s stock closed 9 percent lower on Tuesday after Mr. Trump's statement on tariffs. Stellantis fell about 6 percent, and Ford was down nearly 3 percent.
Ford said its shares suffered less because its operations were more concentrated in the United States than other automakers. "Ford is the most committed to building in America among the major automakers," the company said in a statement.
Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Nissan and Volkswagen declined to answer questions about tariffs, as did the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the industry's main trade group.
BMW, which has large factories in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, and Spartanburg, S.C., declined to comment on Mr. Trump's tariff threat, but said in a statement that free markets are "a key factor not only for our business model, but also for growth, welfare and employment throughout the global economy."
Some auto experts expressed hope that the threat of tariffs was merely a bargaining tool and would never be imposed. The strategy could be effective, some experts conceded.
"People in China and Canada are thinking about concessions they could make before there is even anything on the table," said Richard Baldwin, a professor of economics at the International Institute for Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland. "He's forcing the Canadians and Mexicans to prenegotiate with themselves."

White House to Lend $6 Billion for Rivian E.V. Factory: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The financing for a factory in Georgia is part of a last-minute effort to establish climate policies before President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office.
The Biden administration said on Monday that it would lend $ 6 billion to help Rivian build an electric car factory in Georgia, part of an effort to lock in Democratic climate policies before President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office.
Rivian, a relatively new company that makes only electric vehicles, plans to produce sport utility vehicles and hatchbacks at the factory, in Social Circle, Ga., near Atlanta.
The loan agreement will be binding once the Department of Energy and Rivian sign a contract, which is expected to take place before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January.
"Rivian will work closely with D.O.E. to close the loan quickly," the company said in a statement.
The project is in a congressional district represented by a Republican, highlighting how much Biden administration clean energy policies have benefited regions where most voters back conservative politicians, including Mr. Trump.
Republicans have opposed use of federal money to promote electric cars, but some of them may be unwilling to interfere with projects that bring thousands of jobs and billions of dollars to their districts. In August, 18 Republican representatives sent a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson describing full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's signature climate law, as a "worst-case scenario."
Attempts to disrupt the financing would probably also face opposition from carmakers. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group, asked Mr. Trump not to roll back electric vehicle tax incentives in a letter this month.
Sales of such vehicles have fallen short of some projections, but still rose 11 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier, while sales of gasoline cars were flat, according to the research firm Cox Automotive. The Biden administration has offered tax credits of up to $ 7,500 and other incentives designed to ensure that half of all cars sold by 2030 are electric, up from 9 percent this year. Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gases in the United States.
Mr. Trump and Republican allies in Congress have vowed to eliminate the incentives and other environmental policies that they say effectively force carmakers to sell electric vehicles that buyers do not want.
Rivian, which is backed by Amazon and other investors, will make a midsize S.U.V. and a hatchback at the factory. It will begin producing cars in 2028 and eventually employ 7,500 people, and 2,000 during construction, Rivian said.
The loan will be an important lifeline for Rivian, which is struggling to eke out profits selling vans to businesses and pickups and S.U.V.s to individuals. The Georgia factory will augment Rivian's plant in Normal, Ill., and produce S.U.V.s that sell for about $ 45,000. The company's existing consumer vehicles start at around $ 70,000.
"This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in E.V. manufacturing and technology," R.J. Scaringe, the chief executive of Rivian, said in a statement.
Work on the Georgia plant had been on hold since March because of Rivian's financial circumstances. The project has the support of Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, but has also been criticized by some Republicans who see it as a waste of government money that would change the rural character of the area near the factory site.
Rivian also received important support this month from Volkswagen. The companies formed a joint venture to develop software and electronics, extending a partnership announced in June. Volkswagen plans to invest $ 5.8 billion in the joint venture and Rivian.
Federal loans have long supported new technologies. Tesla received a $ 465 million loan in 2010 from the Obama administration to finance production of the Model S. Tesla repaid the loan ahead of schedule three years later.
Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive and one of Mr. Trump's biggest supporters, has backed the repeal of electric vehicle subsidies, saying that other automakers would suffer more than Tesla.
Federal loans and tax credits have also helped General Motors and Ford Motor build electric vehicle and battery factories and compete more effectively. Tesla's share of the electric car market has fallen to less than 50 percent this year, from 60 percent in 2023.
"In my view, we should end all government subsidies, including those for E.V.s, oil and gas," Mr. Musk said this month on X.
The Biden administration has lent almost $ 27 billion to support manufacturing of low-emission or zero-emission vehicles, including the Rivian project. The largest loan so far, $ 9.2 billion, went to Ford and SK On, which are building three battery factories in Tennessee and Kentucky.
The loans have "supported" 50,000 jobs since Mr. Biden became president, Jigar Shah, director of the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office, said. The money, he said in a statement, ensures that "the workers who have been a pillar of our nation's economy for the past 100 years have the tools they need to thrive in the 21st century clean-energy economy."
The loans carry interest rates comparable to what the federal government pays on Treasury notes.

Trump Seen As a Threat To E.V. Sales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Fewer people will be able to afford electric cars and trucks if President-elect Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress eliminate a $ 7,500 federal tax credit.
Many car buyers have come to rely on a $ 7,500 federal tax credit on electric vehicles to soften the blow of their high prices. But those credits could disappear after President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office, leading to an almost immediate drop in sales of the cars and trucks.
Electric car sales could fall 27 percent if consumers lose the tax break, according to estimates published last week by three economics professors, Joseph Shapiro of the University of California, Berkeley, Felix Tintelnot of Duke University and Hunt Allcott of Stanford. Registrations of electric models are on track to hit 1.2 million this year, and estimates are that there would be about 317,000 fewer registered annually without the credit.
Other countries that eliminated such subsidies have seen similar drops -- in Germany, electric vehicle sales tumbled 27 percent in the first 10 months of the year, after the government last December abruptly canceled an incentive worth $ 4,900.
"You can't make a vehicle $ 7,500 more expensive and sell more of them easily," said Chris Harto, a senior policy analyst for Consumer Reports. "People are only willing to pay so much."
The tax credits, which can be as high as $ 7,500 for new electric cars and plug-in hybrids, and up to $ 4,000 for used models, are a cornerstone of President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, a law meant to address climate change and spur domestic manufacturing. Since January, consumers who buy or lease eligible cars have driven home with $ 2 billion in credits on 300,000 cars, according to the Treasury Department.
New-car prices are flat in 2024, but have risen nearly 30 percent since the start of the pandemic. And the gap between battery-powered cars and internal combustion models remains stubbornly wide. Consumers paid $ 56,900 on average for an electric car in October, $ 9,000 more than for the average gasoline car or hybrid, according to Kelley Blue Book, though the tax credit often significantly reduced that gap.
Mr. Trump regularly attacked Mr. Biden's policies on climate and electric cars on the campaign trail, and his transition team is exploring steps he could take to repeal or limit the credits. A complete repeal would require Congress to act. But Mr. Trump could also direct the Treasury to change tax rules in ways that limit how many cars qualify for credits.
Those efforts have the support of one of Mr. Trump's biggest supporters, Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, which makes roughly half of the electric vehicles sold in the United States. Mr. Musk has called for the elimination of all subsides for electric vehicles. He has also said the loss of the tax break would hurt Tesla less than it would other automakers.
But even Tesla would take a hit because the company's two top-selling cars are eligible for the $ 7,500 credit. Losing the credit could further depress the company's sales, which have been tepid this year because it has few new models to compete with electric cars from other automakers.
Tesla and the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.
Some state governments also offer incentives, and Democratic governors could try to offer more support if federal policy changes. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Monday said that he would propose restoring an electric vehicle rebate program that ended last year if the federal credits were repealed.
If the credits end, Mr. Harto said, some automakers might make up some of the difference by offering bigger discounts to sustain sales and keep their factories humming. Several automakers are already offering year-end deals, including monthly leases below $ 250 on models like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Nissan Ariya and Kia Niro. Mr. Harto advises shoppers interested in such vehicles to buy one soon.
"If you're really considering an E.V. over the next few years, there's probably no better time than today," he said.
Albert Gore III, the executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, a trade group, said ending credits would instantly raise prices for the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry. Three of four electric cars sold in the United States are built domestically, by companies including Tesla, Ford Motor, General Motors, Hyundai, Rivian and Volkswagen.
"This is going to be inflationary on the entire car market, no doubt about it," said Mr. Gore, whose father was the U.S. vice president from 1993 to 2001.
Mr. Harto said price increases could be a deal-killer for budget shoppers. Several affordable electric models -- the kind many Americans have clamored for -- have recently arrived in showrooms, with encouraging early sales. They include the Chevrolet Blazer sport utility vehicle and the mechanically related Honda Prologue, both built at a G.M. plant in Mexico. With both models eligible for a full $ 7,500 credit, the Blazer costs as little as $ 38,500 and the Prologue about $ 41,000. An electric Chevrolet Equinox costs $ 27,500 after the credit, on a par with similar gasoline vehicles.
Still, some analysts note that many electric cars are already ineligible for the tax credit.
Just 20 percent of electric car buyers claimed a tax credit in the first half of 2024, according to BloombergNEF, a research firm. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, cars are eligible for the credit only if they are assembled in North America and are powered by batteries that include materials from the United States or its trade allies. Only 13 models offer the full $ 7,500 credit through Dec. 31. Another eight are eligible for $ 3,750.
Buyers also have to earn incomes below $ 300,000 for couples and $ 150,000 for individuals.
Those restrictions do not apply if electric cars are leased. As a result, leases made up 79 percent of all electric-car transactions in dealerships in October, up from 16 percent in January, according to Edmunds. Those figures do not include brands, such as Tesla, Rivian and Lucid, that sell cars directly to consumers.
For people who are not ready to buy a new car, many formerly leased cars should enter the used market in coming years. They may make for tempting deals because battery-powered models have suffered sharp depreciation since Tesla started slashing prices last year.
Sales of electric cars have slowed in 2024, yet these cars have never been more popular: Americans bought a record 346,000 such models in the third quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. Sales are up 9 percent in the first nine months of the year.
Supporters warn that killing the credits would blunt that momentum, with damaging effects for the environment, jobs and global competitiveness. The Environmental Defense Fund said companies had announced $ 126 billion in electric car and battery manufacturing investment since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, creating 108,000 jobs. By 2027, automakers will have built annual capacity for 5.8 million electric cars, enough to supply more than one in three new vehicles at current sales levels.
Opponents of credits say electric vehicles should compete with gasoline models without the help of the federal government. They note that many battery-powered cars are luxury models bought or leased by people who can afford the vehicles without tax breaks.
"I've driven them, and they are incredible," Mr. Trump said about electric vehicles at a July campaign rally in Michigan, "but they're not for everybody."
Mr. Harto said electric cars would eventually have to stand on their own. But the Inflation Reduction Act was aimed at fostering a domestic ecosystem of cars, batteries, components and minerals before it is too late to catch up to China, which dominates the industry.
"Do we want to build those cars and batteries in the U.S., or just import them from China?" Mr. Harto said. "The incentives give automakers a cushion to scale up and figure it out."
Even if Congress repeals the credits or Mr. Trump rewrites the rules, some industry executives expect a temporary jolt in sales, not a permanent decline. Jim Cain, a G.M. spokesman, said the automaker began investing in electric vehicle and battery factories years before the Inflation Reduction Act took effect, a strategy that is now paying dividends.
"The purest way to drive E.V. demand is with good-looking vehicles that hit all the buttons for consumers," Mr. Cain said, "and we think we've got those pieces."

Steel Maker Eliminating 11,000 Jobs In Germany: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The venerable steel producer, which has been struggling against high energy prices at home and growing competition from abroad, is the latest company in Europe to cut its work force.
ThyssenKrupp, the largest steel maker in Germany, said Monday that it would eliminate up to 11,000 jobs by 2030, a decision that comes as the country struggled to overcome economic weakness that has hindered growth for nearly two years.
The overhaul is aimed at returning ThyssenKrupp to profitability in the face of pressure from Asian competitors and high energy prices. Compounding the challenges, President-elect Donald J. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on all goods imported to the United States. ThyssenKrupp was among those hurt by the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on steel and aluminum during his first term in office.
ThyssenKrupp said that it would reduce the amount of steel it produced each year down to no more than 10 million U.S. tons, from the current level, 12.6 million U.S. tons, which would allow it to eliminate 5,000 jobs. Another 6,000 jobs will be cut through the sale of business activities or turning to external providers, the company said without elaborating.
"Urgent measures are required to improve ThyssenKrupp Steel's own productivity and operating efficiency and to achieve a competitive cost level," the company said in a statement.
On Tuesday, ThyssenKrupp reduced the value of its steel division by 1 billion euros, or $ 1.04 billion, after posting a yearly net loss of €1.4 billion, or $ 1.2 billion. The company has been struggling for years to decarbonize its steel production, as the price of powering its existing coking plants has soared.
Germany, Europe's largest economy, has not had significant growth in the past two years. On Friday, the economy recorded 0.1 percent growth from July to September, but it was forecast to contract over the entire year. Economists do not expect to see a return to growth in 2025, unless the government can make significant changes quickly.
Dozens of companies have announced plans over the past few months to reduce their work forces in Germany. On Friday, the auto supplier Bosch said it would cut 5,500 jobs beginning in 2027. Ford Motor said Wednesday it would eliminate 4,000 jobs in Europe, primarily in Germany.
Workers at Volkswagen, Germany's biggest automaker, are planning to begin staging warning strikes in the coming days, as they fight management plans to reduce their numbers and close up to three of the company's 10 factories in Germany. In October, Volkswagen reported a 42 percent drop in quarterly profit and warned of an "urgent need" to cut costs amid growing competition from Chinese automakers.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Democrat-led states successfully challenged policies during the first Trump administration. Now, they worry the new White House will be more prepared and less restrained.
During the early days of Donald J. Trump's first presidency, lawyers at the attorney general's office in Washington State would gather to strategize about what they saw as troubling directives being handed down by the White House.
There were orders barring travelers from Muslim-majority countries, rolling back environmental rules and ending protections for young immigrants. Lawyers in Washington and other states controlled by Democrats believed the actions were endangering rights and lives.
But there was one thing working to their advantage: Many of the administration's orders were written in such a sloppy fashion, said Bob Ferguson, Washington State's attorney general, that he repeatedly asked his staff members the same question: "Do you guys think a lawyer looked at this?" Often, it seemed as if nobody had, which gave the state ample opportunities to pursue what became a stream of successful legal challenges.
Now, as Mr. Trump prepares for a second term, Mr. Ferguson said he anticipated that the initiatives from the incoming White House might not carry the same flaws. Mr. Ferguson, a Democrat who was recently elected to be Washington's next governor, said Mr. Trump has built a cadre of advisers who have spent years planning ways to implement their plans for the country. The new administration also stands to benefit from a court system now tilted more in Mr. Trump's favor.
"A concern I have is that Donald Trump and his administration may well be better prepared on their end," Mr. Ferguson said.
Around the country, states led by Democrats have expressed alarm about many of the new measures that Mr. Trump and his allies have described and have made broad preparations of their own. Lawyers have been scouring through the conservative policy plan known as Project 2025, and they have been strategizing how to challenge any such plans in an altered judicial landscape. Private advocacy groups have hundreds of lawyers ready to go to court. Governors in Democratic-led states have been preparing to coordinate. This week, Democratic attorneys general were gathering for a meeting in Pennsylvania.
The incoming administration -- emboldened after prevailing with voters this year -- carries newfound might that Mr. Trump did not have eight years ago. Republicans are now poised to have full control of Congress, and there is a conservative-leaning Supreme Court. That has left Democratic state officials as perhaps the best suited to mount political and legal challenges.
Mr. Trump has laid out a broad vision to alter the nation, one that in some ways mirrors policies he attempted to put into place during his first term, often to see them blocked in the courts.
He and his advisers have already outlined plans to build "vast holding facilities" to detain undocumented immigrants and then deport them. He campaigned on promises to "kill" Environmental Protection Agency emissions rules adopted to combat climate change. He has said he would consider deploying U.S. troops to enforce security at the border and potentially in Democrat-run cities to arrest undocumented immigrants and help quell protests and crime.
Mr. Trump is preparing to install some of his most loyal followers in key positions, including the office of attorney general, which is responsible for defending government policies and prosecuting those who fail to follow them. At least one potential nominee has already encountered bipartisan resistance.
Matt Gaetz, a former congressman from Florida who was the subject of a House Ethics Committee investigation, withdrew his name from consideration on Thursday after it became clear that his confirmation would most likely be blocked amid allegations that he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Mr. Gaetz has repeatedly denied the allegations.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump put forward Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general, as his new pick. In Florida, Ms. Bondi tried unsuccessfully to overturn and weaken the Affordable Care Act and opposed expanding legal protections for the L.G.B.T.Q. community.
William Tong, the state attorney general in Connecticut, was one of those who expressed concern that the Trump Justice Department would be better prepared to defend its policies in court. He said he feared that Mr. Trump would be able to operate with fewer political and ethical guardrails than during his first administration, and that, with Congress and the courts on his side, there might also be fewer legal guardrails.
"I think we are prepared for it to be much more aggressive, much quicker and much harder," he said.
During Mr. Trump's first administration, the White House often stumbled as a result of procedural flaws in its executive orders and other initiatives. When Mr. Trump moved in 2017 to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which provides protections for young immigrants known as Dreamers, Mr. Ferguson and others filed suit. Part of their case was based on what lawyers described as the harmful effects of eliminating protections for young immigrants who might have spent much of their lives in the United States.
But they also argued that the administration had violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which specifies the processes government agencies must follow to develop and implement new regulations.
As the litigation proceeded, the lower courts blocked implementation of the order. The Supreme Court ultimately sided with the states, agreeing that Mr. Trump's implementation had not followed the proper administrative protocol.
States had other successes: When the Trump administration wanted to add a question on citizenship to the census, states challenged the plan, and the Supreme Court agreed that the administration's explanation for adding the question appeared to have been "contrived." When the administration moved to ban travel from seven largely Muslim nations, a challenge from Mr. Ferguson's office led a judge to block the administration's initial measure and forced the White House to narrow its scope.
Mr. Ferguson's office also pointed to Mr. Trump's failures on rolling back environmental regulations. In those cases, state challenges succeeded because of missteps such as missed deadlines.
In total, Mr. Ferguson's office said, Washington State was a party to 99 lawsuits against the federal government during the Trump administration, with 55 wins. The state lost three cases, having to do with law enforcement funding, the counting of undocumented immigrants in apportioning congressional seats and aircraft greenhouse gas emissions. Other cases are pending or have been made moot by the actions of the Biden administration.
Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley, said he expected major new legal fights between Democratic-led states and the Trump administration that could reshape federal and state relations.
The White House, Mr. Chemerinsky said, will most likely try various strategies to force state and local governments to help round up immigrants for deportation. But while the courts have so far ruled that the federal government cannot withhold money to force state agencies to help with immigration enforcement, he said, it is likely that the issue will be litigated once again.
Similarly, the Trump administration might try to raise the issue of federal pre-emption, which generally prohibits state laws that conflict with federal law, on issues such as environmental standards, abortion and transgender rights in schools. States have frequently argued that while federal law sets a base line for various policies, states are permitted to exceed those standards.
"The question will be, does federal law pre-empt in these areas, or can states do more to protect rights?" said Mr. Chemerinsky, who said he expects the issue to be litigated.
Democratic leaders have signaled that they will try to work around the administration if necessary.
California did just that during Mr. Trump's first term, when he sought to block the state's longstanding limits on auto emissions standards, which were stricter than those in the rest of the nation. Working in secret, state officials did an end run, striking legal agreements with four of the world's largest automakers -- Ford, Volkswagen, Honda and BMW -- to reduce their tailpipe emissions according to limits set by the state.
Now California is seeking permission from the Biden administration to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles in the state after 2035. The state also is requiring about three-quarters of new trucks sold there after 2035 to produce zero emissions. Mr. Trump has signaled that he would again seek to block California's influence on environmental policymaking, but regulators from the state have been talking to automakers about emissions limits and have begun to enlist other states.
Some Democrats say they are still optimistic that litigation can once again be successful in blocking some Trump administration initiatives, even if the administration is better prepared. Phil Weiser, the attorney general of Colorado, said he believed that while the Supreme Court would most likely issue rulings that he found objectionable, he also believed that the justices would hold strong on foundational principles such as freedom of speech and separation of powers.
"I'm going to choose to take the positive view that we are going to get through this," Mr. Weiser said. "Although it's not going to be easy, the work of us continuing as a democratic republic is what's on the line."
Mr. Trump's rise to power has had the effect of helping Democratic attorneys general find a common voice. Early in his first presidency, they began meeting every Tuesday morning and never stopped. This week, as they met in Pennsylvania, the stakes rose to new heights.
"We don't know exactly what's coming and how it's going to come, so we just need to be ready," said Ellen Rosenblum, the attorney general of Oregon. "I don't think there are any A.G.s on vacation right now."

Dim Outlook For Economy In Germany: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The country is facing a second year of zero growth, with industry leaders gloomy and worried about potential tariffs from President-elect Donald Trump.
As Germans prepare for a snap election after the collapse of a fragile government coalition, one issue at the top of voters' minds will be how the new government would revive the country's once powerful economy at a time when energy prices are high and companies are cutting jobs.
Germany, Europe's largest economy, has not seen significant growth in the past two years. On Friday, the economy recorded 0.1 percent growth from July to September, but it is forecast to contract over the entire year. And economists do not expect to see a return to growth in 2025, unless a new government can make significant changes quickly.
Driving that point home, Germany's largest auto supplier, Bosch, said on Friday that it planned to cut 5,500 jobs, beginning in 2027. More than two-thirds will be at German factories.
High energy prices, a complex bureaucracy, aging public infrastructure and geopolitical developments have hurt Germany's export industry. Political paralysis under the previous government exacerbated the situation.
The three-party coalition led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz spent the last year bickering over issues from energy to immigration before finally collapsing this month. Early elections on Feb. 23 are likely to result in a new government, which will have the opportunity to turn things around.
But economists warn that this will require changes to tax and welfare policies, as well as deregulation and investment in infrastructure. "Without major policy changes, the German economy's long-run growth potential is extremely limited," said Salomon Fiedler, an economist at Berenberg, a private bank.
The Cost of Political Uncertainty
German industrial companies have seen production shrink more than 12 percent since 2018. Many point to a lack of clear signals from Berlin on where they should direct investment.
An example was an abrupt decision by the government to end subsidies for electric vehicles at the end of last year, in an effort to slim down the budget. Automakers, which had been ramping up production of battery-powered cars, saw demand plunge after spooked customers pulled back.
The fallout from that decision has led to enormous job cuts in the automotive industry this year. On Wednesday, Ford Motor announced that it was eliminating 4,000 jobs in Europe, most of them in Germany. Volkswagen is threatening to close up to three of its 10 German factories as part of the restructuring needed to return the brand to profitability.
After losing natural gas from Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Mr. Scholz's government quickly pivoted to importing liquefied natural gas, which has kept homes warm and reserves full, but also has resulted in a 40 percent jump in prices from the year before. Nevertheless, the government went ahead with plans to shut down the country's last nuclear reactor.
Analysts point out that such zigzag strategies make it difficult for business leaders to plan investments or predict costs. That frustration has translated into record levels of pessimism among Germany's industrial leaders, according to a survey by the Ifo Institute in Munich.
"There was no clear line from politicians and therefore great uncertainty," said Stefan Sauer, an economic researcher who worked on the report. "That's probably one of the main reasons the mood is so bad and why competitiveness is suffering as a result."
Industry Under Pressure
At the heart of Germany's economic problems lies its once formidable industrial sector, which is expected to see production fall 3 percent in 2024 for the third year in a row, according to data compiled by the German industrial association BDI.
Faced with higher energy prices, environmental and digital services regulation and growing competition from China, companies that once dominated sectors from automotive to machinery and steel now find themselves needing to cut costs and restructure.
"German industry is under massive pressure," said Tanja Gönner, managing director of the BDI. "A recovery in 2025 is not in sight."
This month, Germany's largest steel maker, ThyssenKrupp, was forced to write down the value of its steel division by 1 billion euros, or $ 1.04 billion, after posting a yearly net loss of €1.4 billion, or $ 1.2 billion. The company has been struggling for years to decarbonize its steel production, as the price of powering its existing coking plants has soared.
Beyond the industrial giants, the German economy also depends on innovation and expertise. But in an increasingly digital world, Germany is lacking new start-ups that will help drive the next generation of growth.
Government financing is available to help entrepreneurs start business, but when it comes time to scale them, many move to the United States, where venture funding is more widely available and taxes are lower.
"Our main problem is not what is happening to ThyssenKrupp," Danyal Bayaz, the finance minister for the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg, told the German American Conference at Harvard last week. "It is why is the last successful German start-up 50 years old?"
The Looming Threat of Trump Tariffs
Germany, the world's third-largest exporting nation, sells cars, chemicals and machines around the world. But all three sectors are suffering, as geopolitics and supply chain shifts in recent years have disrupted global trade.
Last year, the United States replaced China as Germany's most important trading partner, sending goods worth €157.9 billion, or $ 164.3, across the Atlantic. But with President-elect Donald J. Trump promising across-the-board tariffs as a cornerstone of his economic policies -- including levies of 60 percent or more on goods from China -- that number could drop, further hurting Germany.
Many German companies are already heavily invested in the United States, including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen and dozens of automotive suppliers, as well as leading chemical and pharmaceutical firms. But those companies also export from their U.S. factories and could be hurt if Mr. Trump's plans set off a wider trade war.
In the last year, German companies invested €15.7 billion, or $ 16.3 billion, in the United States. Cheaper energy prices and lower taxes were the main attraction, but many companies also benefited from the incentives offered by the Inflation Reduction Act, which Mr. Trump has promised to repeal.
During his first term in office, Mr. Trump repeatedly targeted Germany for what he called its "massive trade deficit." Germany's trade surplus with the United States has not shrunk significantly over the last four years, reaching €63.3 billion in 2023, raising concerns that Mr. Trump could again make it an issue.
Regardless of how Mr. Trump's economic policies play out, economists do not expect them to benefit Germany.
"Whether it's the prospects of tariffs or U.S. tax cuts and deregulation indirectly undermining German competitiveness, it's hard to see how U.S. economic policies will not be negative for the German economy," said Carsten Brzeski, an economist with ING Bank.

Big Auto's Plea to Trump: Force Us to Sell E.V.s: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Donald J. Trump promised to erase Biden tailpipe rules that are designed to get carmakers to produce E.V.s. But Detroit wants to keep them.
Three of the nation's largest automakers, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, are strategizing with other car manufacturers on how to make a delicate request of President-elect Donald J. Trump: Don't scrap the federal regulations that compel the industry to sell electric vehicles.
The conversation would require diplomatic finesse. Mr. Trump has railed against the E.V. rules, which strictly limit the amount of tailpipe pollution while also ramping up fuel economy standards. They are designed to get carmakers to produce more E.V.s and have been a cornerstone of President Biden's fight against climate change.
Mr. Trump sees them differently. He has falsely said the rules amount to a Democratic mandate that would prevent Americans from buying the gasoline-powered cars of their choice -- a concern of his campaign donors from the oil industry.
And Mr. Trump still holds grievances against some of the automakers, whom he views as having betrayed him because during his first term they supported Obama-era auto emissions rules.
In fact, most automakers don't love the more stringent rules Mr. Biden put in place. But they have already invested billions in a transition to electric vehicles, and fear that if Mr. Trump made an abrupt change as he has promised, they could be undercut by automakers who sell cheaper, gas-powered cars. They argue it would harm an industry that is a backbone of American manufacturing and employs 1.1 million people.
Lobbyists and officials from several car companies say the automakers want the Biden regulations to remain largely intact, with some changes such as more time for compliance and lower penalties for companies that don't meet the requirements.
One wild card in negotiations is Elon Musk, the top Trump adviser and chief executive of Tesla, which accounts for half of electric vehicle sales in the United States.
In a previously unreported Nov. 12 letter to Mr. Trump, John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents 42 car companies that produce nearly all the new vehicles sold in the United States, wrote that in order for the auto industry to remain "successful and competitive," it needed "stability and predictability in auto-related emissions standards."
Transportation is the sector of the U.S. economy that produces the most greenhouse gases -- pollution that is dangerously heating the planet. The Obama administration was the first to limit tailpipe emissions of such pollution. During his first term, Mr. Trump effectively erased those rules, replacing them with standards that were little more than business as usual.
Mr. Biden restored and, with input from the automakers, significantly strengthened the tailpipe rules, making them the biggest regulations enacted by the federal government to fight climate change. The regulations affect vehicles starting in model year 2027 and grow more stringent through 2032. Automakers could comply by selling a mix of gasoline-burning cars, hybrids, E.V.s or other types of vehicles, such as cars powered by hydrogen.
The E.P.A. estimates that compliance with the rule would mean that by 2032, about 56 percent of new passenger vehicles sold would be electric and another 16 percent would be hybrids, up from about 9 percent and 11 percent today, respectively. Car companies that don't meet the new restrictions could face substantial penalties or could purchase "emissions credits" from companies that have exceeded the standards by selling more E.V.s.
Tesla, which makes only electric vehicles, has earned billions of dollars by selling emissions credits to other automakers, collecting $ 2.1 billion in the first nine months of this year alone, which was 43 percent of its net profit, according to regulatory filings. During Tesla's early years, the credits were a critical source of revenue that probably prevented the company from going bankrupt, analysts say.
Electric vehicle supporters had hoped that Mr. Musk would persuade Mr. Trump to retain the E.V. rules. But that seems unlikely; he is now poised to lead the Trump administration's initiative to reduce regulations.
And Mr. Musk is more focused on removing government obstacles to self-driving cars, which he has described as central to Tesla's future, said people familiar with his thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss it.
As for the emissions standards, Tesla prepared in advance for their elimination, said Rohan Patel, who served as vice president of global policy for Tesla before stepping down earlier this year. "They predicted that if a Republican won, no matter how influential Elon was, the rule would be weakened for sure or potentially go away," he said.
Mr. Musk has also made clear that he will not fight to preserve the $ 7,500 tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles that is provided by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The credit has helped to make E.V.s competitive with gas-powered vehicles and has been a particular target of Mr. Trump's.
"In my view, we should end all government subsidies, including those for E.V.'s, oil and gas," Mr. Musk said on X last week.
Getting rid of the $ 7,500 tax credit may damage Tesla, but it would hurt Ford, GM and others more, Mr. Musk said during an earnings call in July. "I think it would be devastating for our competitors and for Tesla slightly," he said.
That is almost certainly true for several reasons, auto industry analysts said.
One is the scale of investment that American carmakers have made in electric vehicles. Ford, G.M., Stellantis and others have invested about $ 146 billion over the past three years in the design, engineering and manufacturing of electric vehicles, according to the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit organization in Ann Arbor, Mich.
For example, there were fewer than half a dozen E.V. battery plants in the United States when Mr. Trump first came into office in 2017. Today there are more than three dozen, many of them joint ventures between automakers and battery companies, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.
Except for Tesla, most automakers still sell electric vehicles at a loss because they have not yet recouped their investments. They also need to sell at scale to bring down production costs, and while E.V. sales in the United States are still growing, the pace has slowed.
Still, virtually all auto executives expect electric vehicles to displace gasoline cars over time and if the American carmakers falter now, they risk being overtaken by carmakers from Europe and China.
Ripping up the pollution rules could imperil those investments and harm the American industry's ability to compete globally, said analysts.
"The regulations determine that all automakers have to follow the same rules," said Stephanie Brinley, an analyst for the Auto Intelligence service at S&P Global Mobility. "You don't want one automaker sticking to making the cheapest fossil fuel cars to sell domestically, while the other automakers are trying to make these investments to compete globally. If you have a regulation on the books, then everybody has to play by the same rules."
Rolling back the rules would also pose a problem because automakers plan car models years in advance. Developers in Detroit have already designed the cars they expect to put in showrooms in 2028, under the assumption that the E.V. rules would still be in place.
"The worst thing of all for the automakers, even worse than a difficult regulation, is a back-and-forth swing every four years," Ms. Brinley said.
The automakers are also hoping to press the point with Mr. Trump that many of their new E.V. manufacturing facilities and battery plants, which are generating jobs and tax revenue, are in states like Ohio, Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina that he won in this year's election.
But the automakers are treading with care, concerned that Mr. Trump might bear a grudge against companies that publicly opposed his first-term efforts to erase the Obama E.V. rules.
"Given their track record with Trump, I don't know how much sway the autos will have in terms of the decision the president makes," said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, a conservative research group focused on energy, who served on the first Trump administration's transition team.
Among Mr. Trump's biggest grievances with automakers includes a 2019 legal agreement that four of the world's largest automakers -- Ford, Volkswagen, Honda and BMW -- secretly struck with the state of California to reduce their tailpipe emissions according to stringent limits set by that state.
The move blindsided and enraged Mr. Trump, since it came as his administration was moving to weaken federal emissions standards and to revoke California's legal authority to set its own rules. He appeared to seek revenge by opening an antitrust investigation into the automakers that signed on to the California deal. Later on, two more companies -- Stellantis and Volvo -- joined the companies that sided with California. All those companies remain bound to that deal.
Mary Barra, the chief executive of G.M., who has shown herself to be nimble in repositioning her company to align with the priorities of a changing Oval Office, took a different tack. She met with Mr. Trump in his first weeks in office and urged him to weaken the pollution standards and joined the Trump administration's legal proceedings against the California deal.
But within weeks of Mr. Biden's election in 2020, Ms. Barra reversed course, dropping G.M.'s legal support of the Trump administration's California case, and cheering Mr. Biden's electric vehicle agenda.
In a letter at the time to environmental groups, Ms. Barra wrote: "President-elect Biden recently said, 'I believe that we can own the 21st-century car market again by moving to electric vehicles.' We at General Motors couldn't agree more."
Mr. Trump was furious.
Ms. Barra further cemented her relationship with Mr. Biden in 2022, when G.M. hired his niece, Missy Owens, as its head of environmental, social and corporate governance.
Ms. Barra has insisted that G.M.'s strategy is not dependent on politics. The company's investments in batteries were "something we started well before I even knew what I.R.A. was going to be or that it would be passed," she said in an interview last month.
Auto lobbyists familiar with the Trump transition, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk publicly, described a scenario in which the Big Three auto companies would need to bow to Mr. Trump.
"General Motors is going to have to come back in and make nice with Trump," said Christopher Grundler, a former top auto pollution regulator who worked at the E.P.A. from the Carter through the Biden administrations.
It appears that G.M. is trying to follow that advice.
After the July assassination attempt on Mr. Trump, Ms. Barra wrote on X, "I wish President Trump all the best for a full recovery."
Mr. Trump's inauguration committee has asked G.M. to provide about 250 vehicles for V.I.P.s during the inauguration, and the company intends to support the event "in a big way," according to a person familiar with the matter. It is not yet known if any of the vehicles will be electric, the person said.
Asked about Ms. Barra's relationship with Mr. Trump, G.M.'s head of corporate affairs, Faryl Ury, along with other G.M. officials, directed inquiries to Arthur Schwartz, a longtime Republican strategist and adviser to Donald Trump Jr. Mr. Schwartz is reportedly consulting to companies seeking to build relationships with the president-elect. Mr. Schwartz, who has worked with the Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon, declined to comment on the record.
It is possible that the efforts by the carmakers could yield results, said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist and chief executive of the EV Policy Project, an effort to end the partisan divide over electric vehicles.
"If the message is 'mend it, don't end it,' that might get through," Mr. Murphy said of the E.V. rules. "Trumpworld is a weird mix of grievance, instinct and transactional outlook. Despite what he says on the campaign trail, everything he says is written in pencil."

Three of the nation’s largest automakers, Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, are strategizing with other car manufacturers on how to make a delicate request of President-elect Donald Trump: Don’t scrap the federal regulations that compel the industry to sell electric vehicles.
The conversation would require diplomatic finesse. Trump has railed against the EV rules, which strictly limit the amount of tailpipe pollution while also ramping up fuel economy standards. They are designed to get carmakers to produce more EVs and have been a cornerstone of President Joe Biden’s fight against climate change.
Trump sees them differently. He has falsely said the rules amount to a Democratic mandate that would prevent Americans from buying the gasoline-powered cars of their choice — a concern of his campaign donors from the oil industry.
And Trump still holds grievances against some of the automakers, whom he views as having betrayed him because during his first term they supported Obama-era auto emissions rules.
In fact, most automakers don’t love the more stringent rules Biden put in place. But they have already invested billions in a transition to electric vehicles and fear that if Trump made an abrupt change as he has promised, they could be undercut by automakers who sell cheaper, gas-powered cars. They argue it would harm an industry that is a backbone of American manufacturing and employs 1.1 million people.
Lobbyists and officials from several car companies say the automakers want the Biden regulations to remain largely intact, with some changes such as more time for compliance and lower penalties for companies that don’t meet the requirements.
One wild card in negotiations is Elon Musk, the top Trump adviser and CEO of Tesla, which accounts for half of electric vehicle sales in the United States.
In a previously unreported Nov. 12 letter to Trump, John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents 42 car companies that produce nearly all the new vehicles sold in the United States, wrote that in order for the auto industry to remain “successful and competitive,” it needed “stability and predictability in auto-related emissions standards.”
Transportation is the sector of the U.S. economy that produces the most greenhouse gases — pollution that is dangerously heating the planet. The Obama administration was the first to limit tailpipe emissions of such pollution. During his first term, Trump effectively erased those rules, replacing them with standards that were little more than business as usual.
Biden restored and, with input from the automakers, significantly strengthened the tailpipe rules, making them the biggest regulations enacted by the federal government to fight climate change. The regulations affect vehicles starting in model year 2027 and grow more stringent through 2032. Automakers could comply by selling a mix of gasoline-burning cars, hybrids, EVs or other types of vehicles, such as cars powered by hydrogen.
The EPA estimates that compliance with the rule would mean that by 2032, about 56% of new passenger vehicles sold would be electric and another 16% would be hybrids, up from about 9% and 11% today, respectively. Car companies that don’t meet the new restrictions could face substantial penalties or could purchase “emissions credits” from companies that have exceeded the standards by selling more EVs.
Tesla, which makes only electric vehicles, has earned billions of dollars by selling emissions credits to other automakers, collecting $2.1 billion in the first nine months of this year alone, which was 43% of its net profit, according to regulatory filings. During Tesla’s early years, the credits were a critical source of revenue that probably prevented the company from going bankrupt, analysts say.
Electric vehicle supporters had hoped that Musk would persuade Trump to retain the EV rules. But that seems unlikely; he is now poised to lead the Trump administration’s initiative to reduce regulations.

Ford to Cut 4,000 Jobs
In Europe by 2027
Ford Motor said Wednesday that it would eliminate 4,000 jobs in Europe as the automaker struggled with slowing demand for electric vehicles and increased competition from Chinese companies.
The company said the jobs cuts, which will take place by the end of 2027, were part of a broader plan to strengthen its business in Europe. The reductions will primarily affect plants in Germany and Britain.
Ford added that it would reduce production of an electric version of its Explorer sport utility vehicle, which would result in shorter working hours at a plant in Cologne, Germany, in 2025.
The company said it was committed to building a thriving business in Europe. "It is critical to take difficult but decisive action to ensure Ford's future competitiveness in Europe," Dave Johnston, Ford's European vice president for transformation and partnerships, said in a statement.
Ford is pulling back as the auto industry tries to navigate the bumpy transition to electric vehicles. The growth rate of E.V. sales has slowed this year in some European countries. Ford has also struggled to sell as many battery-powered models as it had hoped in the United States and said in August that it would reduce the pace of investments in such vehicles.
Other automakers, including Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have also shifted their strategies after reporting fewer sales of battery-powered vehicles than they had expected. GREGORY SCHMIDT
FOOD
Campbell's Deletes Soup
From Corporate Name
Campbell's is ditching the soup -- at least in name. And the change has now received shareholders' greenlight.
Campbell Soup Co. announced its intention to change its name just over two months ago, saying it wanted to instead be known as the (slightly shorter) Campbell's Co. Shareholders overwhelmingly approved the change on Tuesday.
In a statement, CEO Mark Clouse maintained that this "subtle yet important change" will retain the company's iconic name "while reflecting the full breadth of our portfolio."
New Jersey-based Campbell's hasn't been exclusive to the soup business for some time. The company also owns brands like Prego sauce and Goldfish crackers -- and completed a $ 2.7 billion acquisition of Sovos Brands, the maker of Rao's pasta sauces, earlier this year.
Still, the 155-year-old food seller is most famous for its namesake canned soups, adorned with red and white labels. Its new name won't change that, the company says -- noting the Campbell's soup brand or packaging will not be affected.
"We love soup and always will," Clouse stated Tuesday. "The iconic red and white Campbell's soup labels that consumers love will be on shelves forever."
Campbell's is far from the first to attempt such as makeover. From Dunkin' to KFC, other food companies have rebranded themselves -- often shedding the mention of a specific item they were known for with a shorter corporate title, or even an updated logo -- in hopes of emphasizing other business.

Blackstone Gobbles Up Majority in Jersey Mike's
Jersey Mike's, the quickly expanding sandwich chain, is being acquired by asset management giant Blackstone.
In the transaction announced Tuesday, private equity funds managed by Blackstone will be used to acquire majority ownership of Jersey Mike's. The deal is "intended to help enable Jersey Mike's to accelerate its expansion across and beyond the U.S. market," the companies said, as well as aid ongoing tech investments.
Blackstone and Jersey Mike's did not immediately disclose financial terms Tuesday. But a source familiar with the matter confirmed to The Associated Press that the transaction would value Jersey Mike's at around $ 8 billion, a figure previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.
The acquisition of the private company is expected to close in early 2025. Jersey Mike's founder Peter Cancro will continue to lead the business, the companies said. Associated Press

Ex-Washington Post Chief Takes New Job at Reuters
Sally Buzbee, right, the former executive editor of The Washington Post and The Associated Press, is joining Reuters as the news agency's top editor for the United States and Canada, the company said Tuesday.
As news editor for the U.S. and Canada, Ms. Buzbee will replace Kieran Murray, who is taking over the company's live events.
Ms. Buzbee left the Post in June after she objected to a reorganization plan by the company's new publisher, Will Lewis.
Ms.Buzbee, 59, worked for The A.P. for many years and led its global newsroom from 2017 to 2021 before leaving for the Post.
"Her journalistic chops, her management experience, her global understanding and her positive and pragmatic approach are just what we need in this time of upheaval for the world and for the news industry," said the Reuters editor-in-chief, Alessandra Galloni. Associated Press
AUTOMOTIVE
Volkswagen Picks Officer To Run Its U.S. Business
Volkswagen appointed the former Rivian executive Kjell Gruner as head of its American business on Tuesday as the automaker faces a choppy electric transition and ongoing negotiations with the United Auto Workers union in the region.
Mr. Gruner, previously the electric vehicle startup Rivian's chief commercial officer and head of business growth, succeeds Pablo Di Si, who has been in the role since 2022.
Automakers in the U.S. and around the world are preparing for regulatory uncertainty under President-elect Donald J. Trump, who has promised to pull back incentives on E.V. manufacturing and purchasing.
The president-elect's transition team is planning to kill the $ 7,500 consumer tax credit for electric-vehicle purchases as part of broader tax-reform legislation, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters last week. Reuters

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The new agreement, which builds on an earlier announcement, calls for the German automaker to invest $ 5.8 billion in Rivian, a maker of electric vehicles.
Volkswagen, the German automaker, and Rivian, a California-based maker of electric pickups and S.U.V.s, said on Tuesday that they would form a joint venture to develop software and electronics, extending a partnership they announced in June.
Volkswagen said it would increase its investment with Rivian to $ 5.8 billion from $ 5 billion, which will include a 50 percent stake in the joint venture. While short of an acquisition, the new company broadens the alliance with Rivian and could foreshadow similar partnerships between other established carmakers and new companies struggling to become profitable.
"The partnership with Rivian is the next logical step in our software strategy," Oliver Blume, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said in a statement.
In June, Volkswagen and Rivian had said they would work together on vehicle software -- an area where the German carmaker has struggled. The agreement announced Tuesday goes further by creating an independent company to jointly develop technology for electric vehicles.
The ever-closer association with Volkswagen has helped allay fears that Rivian will run out of money before it becomes profitable. Rivian shares rose 6 percent in extended trading on Tuesday.
Initially the partnership will be focused on developing software for electric vehicles, but could be expanded to include battery modules or other technology, Mr. Blume said during a conference call with reporters. Volkswagen will use the technology in many types of vehicles including subcompacts and cars made by its Audi and Porsche divisions, he said.
Though the world's second-largest carmaker after Toyota, Volkswagen has struggled to make inroads in the United States. Sales of its electric cars here have lagged behind General Motors and Hyundai-Kia. Volkswagen's share of the electric car market in the United States was just 3.4 percent in the third quarter, including the company's Audi and Porsche brands, according to Kelley Blue Book.
The collaboration with Rivian is Volkswagen's second tie-up with another automaker this year aimed at strengthening its software, which has been a notoriously weak point for the German company. In February, Volkswagen announced a partnership with Chinese electric vehicle company Xpeng, aimed at helping it to develop electric cars for China, where it has been steadily losing market share.
Rivian's pickups and sport utility vehicles have received positive reviews in the automotive press, but the company is not selling enough of them to make money. Rivian said last week that it lost $ 1.1 billion in the third quarter, an improvement from the same period in 2023, when it lost $ 1.4 billion. However, deliveries during the quarter fell to 10,000 vehicles, from 15,600 a year earlier, because of a parts shortage.
Volkswagen does not sell a pickup truck in the United States, a handicap in a market where such vehicles are best sellers. But the company is building a factory in South Carolina where it plans to revive the Scout off-road brand with a line of electric S.U.V.s and pickups. Scout will also use technology developed by the VW-Rivian joint venture.
Scout began taking reservations for the vehicles last month, but they will not be available until 2027.
In Europe and China, Volkswagen is trying to cut costs as it faces weak demand for its vehicles. The company also faces high energy and labor costs in Germany, home to many of its factories. The company said last month that its profit in the third quarter fell 42 percent to 2.86 billion euros, or $ 3.1 billion, its lowest level in three years.
Volkswagen has asked its 120,000 workers in Germany to accept wage cuts of 10 percent. The company has threatened to close factories there, too. The company's main union is seeking a 7 percent wage increase and says it may resort to strikes if its demands are not met.
The new joint venture will be known as Rivian and VW Group Technology and will be led by Wassym Bensaid of Rivian and Carsten Helbing of Volkswagen. Its headquarters will be in Palo Alto, Calif.
Volkswagen's $ 5.8 billion investment consists of shares in the joint venture and debt. Of that sum, $ 3.5 billion is conditional on the joint venture achieving "clearly defined milestones," Volkswagen said.

Mixed Close on Wall St. After Expected News on Inflation: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: U.S. stocks drifted to a mixed finish Wednesday after the latest inflation update boosted hopes that more help for the economy will arrive next month through a cut to interest rates.
The S&P 500 was nearly unchanged and edged up by less than 0.1 percent, coming off its first loss since a big rally erupted after Election Day last week. The Dow Jones industrial average added 47 points, or 0.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.3 percent.
The bond market was also mixed after a report said the inflation that U.S. consumers felt last month was exactly as economists expected. It accelerated to 2.6 percent from 2.4 percent, but an underlying measure called "core inflation" did not accelerate. Such core inflation can be a better predictor of future trends, economists say, and the as-expected number boosted expectations for help coming from the Federal Reserve.
"Bang in-line core inflation leaves the Fed on track to cut rates in December," according to Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed-income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.
The Fed began cutting interest rates from their two-decade high in September to offer support for the job market, hoping to keep it humming after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its target of 2 percent. It cut again this month, and traders now see an improved probability of roughly 80 percent for a third cut at its meeting next month, according to data from CME Group.
Those expectations sent the yield for the two-year Treasury down to 4.27 percent from 4.34 percent late Tuesday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which takes future economic growth more into account, fell initially after the inflation report. But it pared its loss and eventually rose to 4.45 percent, up from 4.43 percent late Tuesday.
The question is what will happen with rates in 2025. Prior forecasts published by the Fed implied it could keep cutting rates through next year. But Donald J. Trump's victory in the presidential election may have scrambled such plans. Economists say his preferences for lower tax rates, higher tariffs and less regulation could lead to higher U.S. government debt and inflation, along with faster economic growth.
While lower interest rates can give a boost to the economy and to the price of investments, they can also give inflation more fuel.
Still, Wednesday's data was reassuring for the market after a run of stronger-than-expected data on the economy, which could have signaled upward pressures on inflation.
"The market may be concerned that we are at an inflection point, with inflation potentially returning to an upward trajectory," said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "We see inflation modestly higher next year. We don't think today's CPI data will do much to the market."
On Wall Street, Rivian Automotive jumped 13.7 percent after the electric-vehicle company gave more details about a joint venture it's entering with Volkswagen Group that they had previously announced. The deal's total size could be worth up to $ 5.8 billion, which is more than the $ 5 billion the companies had previously said.
Spirit Airlines' stock lost 59.3 percent. The airline said in a regulatory filing that it's still trying to work out a deal to renegotiate the repayment of its debt. If it can reach an agreement, the airline said it could wipe out the company's stockholders, but it could also protect employees and customers.
The S&P 500 rose 1.39 to 5,985.38. The Dow added 47.21 points to 43,958.19, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 50.66 to 19,230.74.
In the crypto market, Bitcoin crossed above $ 93,000 as cryptocurrencies generally soared, before pulling back below $ 90,000 in afternoon trading. Mr. Trump has pledged to make his country the crypto capital of the world.

New York Officer Testifies At Trial on Driver's Killing: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In an internal trial, Lt. Jonathan Rivera of the New York Police Department faces charges that he acted rashly when he shot Allan Feliz during an altercation.
The deadly stop began over an unfastened seatbelt.
Jonathan Rivera, then a sergeant with the New York Police Department, was patrolling near Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx on Oct. 17, 2019, when his partner saw that the driver of a Volkswagen Atlas did not appear to have a seatbelt on.
Sergeant Rivera and his partner pulled over the driver, Allan Feliz, ran his driver's license and found several open warrants for failing to pay fines for spitting and littering. When the officers moved to pat him down, Mr. Feliz, 31, tried to drive away. As Sergeant Rivera's partner struggled to pull Mr. Feliz out of the car, Sergeant Rivera tried to subdue him with a Taser.
Then, he shot Mr. Feliz once in the chest, killing him.
On Tuesday, Lieutenant Rivera, who was later promoted, testified during a departmental trial at Police Headquarters in Manhattan that will determine whether he should keep his job. He said he believed that he had to shoot Mr. Feliz to save his partner's life.
"I feared the worst," said Lieutenant Rivera. "I feared I had no other option."
Prosecutors for the Civilian Complaint Review Board, New York City's independent police oversight agency, have accused him of assault in the first degree and menacing in the second degree. Lieutenant Rivera has not been criminally charged, but the prosecutors said his actions should lead to his termination.
On that day, at 2:53 p.m., Lieutenant Rivera failed to follow his training or make sound tactical decisions, said Amanda Rodriguez, one of the board's two prosecutors.
"Instead," she said during her opening statement, "panic took the lead."
The police are rarely challenged for shooting people in the line of duty. High-profile cases of brutality, including the death of George Floyd, brought a wave of promises from prosecutors who said they would move aggressively against officers who used deadly force. But charges have remained elusive, often because facts are ambiguous or cases lack stark evidence such as the citizen video of Minneapolis police officers killing Mr. Floyd.
Lieutenant Rivera's case was not clear-cut, according to previous investigations.
His actions were reviewed by the department's Force Investigations Division, which found that he had not violated guidelines, and the state attorney general's office. That office concluded in September 2020 that Lieutenant Rivera's partner, Officer Edward Barrett, was not in danger, but Lieutenant Rivera had "a reasonable perception -- or at least not an obviously unreasonable one" that he had to shoot.
"We could not prove that the use of deadly force was unjustified beyond a reasonable doubt, as the law requires in order to bring charges," Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement at the time.
But the oversight board, which has a lower standard of proof, pushed on, arguing that there was evidence to show that Lieutenant Rivera had violated the state's penal code and should be fired.
During his testimony on Tuesday, Lieutenant Rivera said he had no choice but to shoot: "Had to move quick, had to act, had to get his hand off the drive shift."
Mr. Feliz's family, however, had no doubt about the lieutenant's culpability. About 15 relatives packed the trial room, where videos taken from the officers' body-worn cameras were played repeatedly. Outside Police Headquarters, during a break in the trial, the family members held a news conference and called Lieutenant Rivera a killer.
"It's just so hurtful to see my brother's life be taken in that fashion," said Samy Feliz, who stood with his mother, his sister and Mr. Feliz's 5-year-old son, among others. "This is not fair. This is not justice."
The case will be decided by Rosemarie Maldonado, the department's deputy commissioner of trials and the administrative judge who presides over internal trials.
In videos showed during the trial on Tuesday, Lieutenant Rivera can be seen walking to the passenger side of Mr. Feliz's car while Officer Barrett and another officer, Michele Almanzar, approach on the driver's side.
The exchange between the officers and Mr. Feliz was friendly at first. Mr. Feliz, who was driving with a friend in the passenger side, complained about how poorly the Volkswagen handled in the snow and the officers chuckled.
But as soon as Officer Barrett saw the open warrants, he asked Mr. Feliz to step out of the car and said that he would have to pat him down. After briefly stepping out of the car, Mr. Feliz quickly got back in and tried to drive away.
Lieutenant Rivera immediately fired his Taser at Mr. Feliz, who howled in pain, as Officer Barrett tried to pull him from the car, striking him and pulling at his head.
Lieutenant Rivera, cursing, warned Mr. Feliz that he would shoot him and then lunged into the car, lying across the passenger, who had his hands up and begged not to be shot. Mr. Feliz put the car in drive and Officer Barrett, now a detective, managed to get out of the way as the car lurched forward and then back.
Lieutenant Rivera, 37, testified that he did not see his partner escape and was sure he would be caught under the wheel.
"At that moment, I feared that Detective Barrett was going to get dragged," he said.
The officers later learned that Mr. Feliz had given them his brother's driver's license.
Mr. Feliz, who was on federal probation for drug-related charges, was in possession of cocaine and methamphetamine. He knew that if the officers found the drugs, he would be arrested and sent back to prison, said Philip Karasyk, one of Lieutenant Rivera's lawyers.
"As a direct result of his behavior, and his behavior alone, Lieutenant Rivera was left with no choice, no reasonable alternative," Mr. Karasyk said during his opening statement.
Ms. Rodriguez, the prosecutor, said that Mr. Feliz's state of mind was not relevant because the officers had no idea he was in possession of drugs or on probation.
"We are not here to victim blame," she said.
Despite not bringing charges, Ms. James's office said it had "serious concerns" with how the police had handled the encounter. The office made several recommendations, including that officers should not dive into a vehicle when the driver is still in control and that they should not display a firearm and threaten to kill someone "unless the use of such force is otherwise justifiable."
"We believe that, going forward, the adoption of these recommendations would significantly limit the likelihood of the kind of escalation that resulted in Mr. Feliz's death," the office said in a final report on the shooting.
Prosecutors presented one witness: Marc Brown, a former police officer from South Carolina who is now an instructor on the use of force. He agreed with the attorney general's assessment.
Mr. Brown, who said he had reviewed the video footage, said the shooting was not justified.
Lieutenant Rivera unnecessarily put himself in jeopardy by lunging into the car, while the other officers should have concentrated on grabbing Mr. Feliz's hands, a much better way of controlling him than striking him or using the Taser, Mr. Brown said.
The next option, once the officers had failed to get Mr. Feliz out of the car, was to let him go.
"It's not worth it," Mr. Brown said. "If you're not going to win the vehicle extraction, letting him go is your next best option."
James Moschella, one of Lieutenant Rivera's lawyers, said that letting Mr. Feliz drive off, possibly at high speed, could have endangered others, including children who were about to be let out of school.
"Isn't that a risk in and of itself?" he said. Mr. Moschella then asked whether two reasonable officers could not have reached different conclusions about how to handle someone like Mr. Feliz.
"Isn't Lieutenant Rivera's opinion entitled to as much weight as yours?" Mr. Moschella asked.
"That's not for me to decide," Mr. Brown replied.

‘Worst Economic Nightmare Has Come True’: Europe Braces for Trump

LONDON — The outlook for Europe’s economy has been disappointing.
Last week — after Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election — it got worse.
Deep uncertainty about the Trump administration’s policies on trade, technology, Ukraine, climate change and more is expected to chill investment and hamstring growth. The launch of a possible tariff war by the United States, the biggest trading partner and closest ally of the European Union and Britain, would hammer major industries such as automobiles, pharmaceuticals and machinery.
And the need to raise military spending because of doubts about the United States’ guarantees in Europe would further strain national budgets and increase deficits.
In addition, Trump’s more confrontational attitude toward China could pressure Europe to pick sides or face retribution.
“Europe’s worst economic nightmare has come true,” said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at the Dutch bank ING. The developments, he warned, could push the eurozone into “a full-blown recession” next year.
With political turmoil in Germany and France, Europe’s two largest economies, this latest blow could hardly come at a worse time.
The same day that Trump’s victory was announced, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz effectively disbanded his coalition government over deep differences about spending priorities and deficits.
For Germany, which is already weathering a second year of recession, the economic challenges posed by another Trump administration are particularly acute. Its economy foundered after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and the flow of cheap Russian gas — a key ingredient in the country’s industrial success — ended.
Germany is struggling on two fronts. Volkswagen, the continent’s biggest automaker and Germany’s largest employer, recently announced that it would probably close plants and lay off workers. Competition from Chinese electric cars has already bitten into the sector’s sales overseas and in Europe.
Leaders are torn between placating China or confronting it. The German government last month voted against the EU’s plan to impose tariffs as high as 45% on electric vehicles made in China. Other countries such as Spain abstained. A majority approved, and in response, China slapped new duties on European brandy, most of which comes from France.
Tit-for-tat tariffs between the United States and the EU would further dim the outlook for the auto industry. The United States is the largest market for cars exported from Germany, accounting for nearly 13% of the 3.1 million autos that it sold abroad in 2023.
Trump’s talk during the campaign of making the EU “pay a big price” for not buying enough American imports and imposing across-the-board tariffs of 10% or 20% may be a starting point for negotiations. Yet even analysts who expect him to take more modest steps say targeted duties on the auto industry are likely.
“Many in Europe have not yet fully understood what it means to think about geopolitics and economic policy together,” said Hildegard Müller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry.
Higher American tariffs, of course, reach far beyond Germany and the automotive industry to include Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company behind Ozempic, as well as sectors such as food, wine, cheese, pearls, chemicals, nuclear reactors, glassware, shoes and more in more than two dozen countries.
Luisa Santos, deputy director of BusinessEurope, a lobbying group representing thousands of companies, warned that tariffs would raise costs and hamper investment.
“We’re still hoping that because of the importance of the economic relationship, they will be reconsidered and we won’t have them,” she said of tariffs. Direct investment from the EU in the United States totaled $2.4 trillion in 2022, which in turn created more than 3.4 million American jobs, according to the EU.
Currently, the average U.S. tariff for European imports is about 3% to 4%.
Meanwhile, higher U.S. duties on China, another of Trump’s trade promises, would probably encourage Chinese manufacturers to expand sales outside the United States, heightening competition with European producers.
European companies may look to set up or expand production in the United States. Yet any manufacturer that uses materials imported from China would find costs rising no matter where their facilities were.
Vestas, a Danish company and the world’s leading wind turbine maker, said it was already increasing production at its two American plants in Colorado. More than 40% of its orders originated in the Americas in the three months that ended in September.
“The world has become different in terms of tariffs,” Vestas CEO Henrik Andersen said on a call with industry analysts last week. Vestas has already had to navigate tariffs that were imposed during the first Trump administration and the Biden administration, he said. “Which is why you try to exclude more and more volumes and more and more components from China origin when it’s about the U.S.,” he said.
Tariffs are not the only problem for the wind industry. During the campaign, Trump pledged to kill offshore wind projects on “Day 1.”
The Danish company Orsted, one of the world’s largest offshore wind developers, is constructing Revolution Wind, a large project off New England, and working on another, Sunrise Wind, for New York.
Orsted CEO Mads Nipper said on Election Day that he hoped the need for the huge volumes of clean electricity to power data centers and artificial intelligence would prevail.
“It’s an industry being built from scratch, and it is being very strongly supported by not least the Northeast states, where the alternatives for energy supply and especially green energy supply are difficult,” he said.
Trump has also said he wants to halt some of the green-energy projects that benefited from the multibillion-dollar industrial policy package passed by Congress in 2022.
The need for a coordinated EU response dominated last week’s summit in Budapest, Hungary.
“The sense of urgency is greater than it was a week ago,” said Mario Draghi, the former Italian prime minister who recently completed a report on European competitiveness.
Draghi called for increasing yearly public investment by $900 billion to enable Europe to reverse its stagnant economy and compete better with the United States and China.
More important now, he said, is to redouble efforts to link the bloc’s economies with a single capital market and by issuing common debt, proposals that have bred contention.
“Don’t ask what the U.S. can do for you, ask what Europe should do for itself,” Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said at the meeting. “Europe must find a balance. We know what we have to do.”
By the meeting’s end, leaders adopted a declaration promising to ramp up Europe’s competitiveness.
But whether the EU can turn those sentiments into reality remains an unanswered question given increasing political fragmentation within Europe and the rise of right-wing parties that are skeptical of giving Brussels more power.

Full text: The United States is the biggest trading partner for the European Union and Britain, whose economies could be at risk from the president-elect's policies.
The outlook for Europe's economy has been disappointing.
Last week -- after Donald J. Trump's presidential election -- it got worse.
Deep uncertainty about the Trump administration's policies on trade, technology, Ukraine, climate change and more is expected to chill investment and hamstring growth. The launch of a possible tariff war by the United States, the biggest trading partner and closest ally of the European Union and Britain, would hammer major industries like automobiles, pharmaceuticals and machinery.
And the need to raise military spending because of doubts about America's guarantees in Europe would further strain national budgets and increase deficits.
In addition, the president-elect's more confrontational attitude toward China could pressure Europe to pick sides or face retribution.
"Europe's worst economic nightmare has come true," said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at the Dutch bank ING. The developments, he warned, could push the eurozone into "a full-blown recession" next year.
With political turmoil in Germany and France, Europe's two largest economies, this latest blow could hardly come at a worse time.
The same day that Mr. Trump's victory was announced, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, effectively disbanded his coalition government over deep differences about spending priorities and deficits.
For Germany, which is already weathering a second year of recession, the economic challenges posed by another Trump administration are particularly acute. Its economy floundered after Russia invaded Ukraine and the flow of cheap Russian gas -- a key ingredient in the country's industrial success -- ended.
Germany is struggling on two fronts. Volkswagen, the continent's biggest automaker and Germany's largest employer, recently announced that it would probably close plants and lay off workers. Competition from Chinese electric cars has already bitten into the sector's sales overseas and in Europe.
Leaders are torn between placating China or confronting it. The German government last month voted against the European Union's plan to impose tariffs as high as 45 percent on electric vehicles made in China. Other countries like Spain abstained. A majority approved, and in response, China slapped new duties on European brandy, most of which comes from France.
Tit-for-tat tariffs between the United States and the European Union would further dim the outlook for the auto industry. The United States is the largest market for cars exported from Germany, accounting for nearly 13 percent of the 3.1 million autos that it sold abroad in 2023.
Mr. Trump's talk during the campaign of making the European Union "pay a big price" for not buying enough American imports and imposing across-the-board tariffs of 10 or 20 percent may be a starting point for negotiations. Yet even analysts who expect him to take more modest steps say targeted duties on the auto industry are likely.
"Many in Europe have not yet fully understood what it means to think about geopolitics and economic policy together," said Hildegard Müller, president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry.
Higher American tariffs, of course, reach far beyond Germany and the automotive industry to include Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical company behind Ozempic, as well as sectors like food, wine, cheese, pearls, chemicals, nuclear reactors, glassware, shoes and more in more than two dozen countries.
Luisa Santos, the deputy director of BusinessEurope, a lobby group representing thousands of companies, warned that tariffs would raise costs and hamper investment.
"We're still hoping that because of the importance of the economic relationship, they will be reconsidered and we won't have them," she said of tariffs. Direct investment from the European Union in the United States totaled $ 2.4 trillion in 2022, which in turn created more than 3.4 million American jobs, according to the European Union.
Currently, the average U.S. tariff for European imports is around 3 to 4 percent.
Meanwhile, higher U.S. duties on China, another of Mr. Trump's trade promises, would likely encourage Chinese manufacturers to expand sales outside the United States, heightening competition with rival European producers.
European companies may look to set up or expand production in the United States. Yet any manufacturer that uses materials imported from China would find costs rising no matter where its facilities were.
Vestas, a Danish company and the world's leading wind turbine maker, said it was already increasing production at its two American plants in Colorado. More than 40 percent of its orders originated in the Americas in the three months that ended in September.
"The world has become different in terms of tariffs," Henrik Andersen, the company's chief executive, said on a call with industry analysts last week. Vestas has already had to navigate tariffs that were imposed during the first Trump administration and the Biden administration, he said: "Which is why you try to exclude more and more volumes and more and more components from China origin when it's about the U.S."
Tariffs are not the only problem for the wind industry. During the campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to kill offshore wind projects on "Day 1."
The Danish company Orsted, one of the world's largest offshore wind developers, is constructing Revolution Wind, a large project off New England, and working on another, Sunrise Wind, for New York.
Mads Nipper, chief executive of Orsted, said on last week that he hoped the need for the huge volumes of clean electricity to power data centers and artificial intelligence would prevail.
"It's an industry being built from scratch, and it is being very strongly supported by not least the Northeast states, where the alternatives for energy supply and especially green energy supply are difficult," he said.
Mr. Trump has also said he wants to halt some of the green energy projects that have benefited from the multibillion-dollar industrial policy package passed by Congress in 2022.
The need for a coordinated E.U. response dominated last week's summit in Budapest.
"The sense of urgency is greater than it was a week ago," said Mario Draghi, the former Italian prime minister who recently completed a report on European competitiveness.
Mr. Draghi called for increasing yearly public investment by $ 900 billion to enable Europe to reverse its stagnant economy and compete better with the United States and China.
More important now, he said, is to redouble efforts to link the bloc's economies with a single capital market and by issuing common debt, proposals that have bred contention.
"Don't ask what the U.S. can do for you, ask what Europe should do for itself," Giorgia Meloni, Italy's prime minister, said at the meeting. "Europe must find a balance. We know what we have to do."
By the meeting's end, leaders adopted a declaration promising to ramp up Europe's competitiveness.
But whether the European Union can turn those sentiments into reality remains an unanswered question given increasing political fragmentation within Europe and the rise of right-wing parties that are skeptical of giving Brussels more power.

Volkswagen Finds Itself Falling Behind in China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A brutal price war, sudden shifts in consumer demand and human rights issues in Xinjiang have left VW stumbling in a market it led for 40 years.
The high walls of industrial buildings at Volkswagen's assembly plant in the heart of northwest China's Xinjiang region extend for hundreds of yards, once a symbol of German industrial might and now a marker of Volkswagen's business and political quagmire in China.
For four decades, Volkswagen Group was the market leader in China, where drivers prized its wide range of cars, from frugal Volkswagen Santanas to potent Audis and Porsches. But VW has been replaced as China's go-to carmaker by the Chinese electric vehicle powerhouse BYD.
BYD rapidly expanded all-electric car sales over the past three years, forcing VW to make a big bet last year on that market. Then BYD caught VW off guard again early this year by ramping up sales of plug-in gasoline-electric hybrids that can go long distances on only battery power, with tiny gasoline engines as backups. VW has few offerings in that fast-growing category, a gaping hole it won't fully close until the end of next year.
"Chinese consumers see VW as the king of yesteryear, an era when global brands reigned supreme," said Michael Dunne, a China auto industry consultant. "Today, many Chinese consumers shrug at VW products with indifference. They prefer fresher, more compelling offerings from home-team brands."
China's state-owned banks and local governments have been pumping money into local automakers, allowing some manufacturers to sell cars far below the cost of making them. Volkswagen executives say that they refuse to join the price-cutting war and that they have relinquished market share as a result.
"Electric cars are being forced onto the market at discounts of up to 50 percent," a Volkswagen spokesman said. "We therefore decided last year that we do not want to continue growing at any price in this unhealthy environment."
Volkswagen's troubles in China are affecting the company as a whole. Its 10.2 percent drop in the number of cars sold in China during the first nine months of this year more than erased all of its sales gain in the rest of the world. The entire group's worldwide sales shrank slightly as a result, and the company announced on Tuesday that its profits plunged in the third quarter.
The company may have to close factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history -- as many as three plants, each employing thousands of workers -- partly because of competition from China.
Political missteps have compounded VW's troubles.
In May, VW started exporting battery-electric cars from China to Europe. The problem was that the European Union had already begun moving toward imposing tariffs on such vehicles brought in from China.
The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, began an investigation over a year ago into whether the Chinese government had improperly subsidized electric cars. Beijing responded by pressuring manufacturers not to cooperate with the European inquiry. Unlike some other foreign manufacturers, VW declined to share information with the European Commission.
VW began shipping Cupra Tavascan battery-electric cars in May to Europe from a new design and production complex in central China. But soon after, the European Commission decided to impose the tariffs. Companies like VW that did not cooperate were told they would face the highest tariff of all starting this week: 37 percent.
VW managed to wangle a reduction in its tariffs to 21 percent, and those tariffs took effect on Wednesday. But Tesla, which is one of VW's biggest rivals and had cooperated earlier, persuaded the commission to cut its tariff to just 7.8 percent. BYD is paying 17 percent. VW faces the possibility of a lasting disadvantage in its home market on any electric cars imported from China, the world's low-cost producer.
The latest difficulty for VW came on Oct. 23, when the foreign ministry said the Volkswagen brand's chief marketing officer in China had tested positive for cocaine, been jailed for 10 days and then deported. He had just returned from a vacation in Thailand when he was tested. VW declined to comment on the case.
But Volkswagen's longest-running problem in China lies in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang.
Volkswagen and a state-owned joint venture partner, SAIC Motor of Shanghai, built an assembly plant in Urumqi in 2013 to make inexpensive, gasoline-powered cars to sell in western China. Volkswagen had made a point of hiring numerous Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group in Xinjiang. Uyghurs have long faced discrimination from Chinese employers, and distrust of Uyghurs deepened after deadly attacks by Uyghur militants from 2008 to 2014.
Beginning in 2014, China cracked down hard on Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang. As many as a million ethnic Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other minorities were sent to indoctrination camps, detention centers and prisons. Associated forced-labor programs to send rural Uyghurs to factories and other urban jobs also drew heavy criticism from human rights groups and have prompted the United States and some European countries to restrict imports from Xinjiang since 2021.
VW had to stop the delivery of 30,000 Audis and other premium cars to American customers last spring after it realized that a VW supplier had been buying an engine component from Xinjiang, in violation of the American regulations. The luxury cars sat at American ports while replacement parts were vetted and installed.
At the same time, VW faces accusations by overseas activists that it has used forced labor by Uyghurs to build its test track near Urumqi. VW denies doing so. But when it hired an auditing firm late last year to review its compliance in Xinjiang with international labor standards, the audit was criticized overseas for not doing enough to protect the anonymity of the workers who participated.
Another problem for VW is that the joint venture assembly plant in Urumqi has not made cars since 2019 because of weak sales. It is down to 190 workers who do the final preparation of cars for delivery to VW dealerships in western China.
Demand for gasoline-powered cars has collapsed in China. Exports from Urumqi are impractical: Nearby Central Asian countries buy few cars, and the plant is 1,800 miles from the coast, too far for seaborne shipments.
In interviews this month, Volkswagen owners in Urumqi said they were happy with their gasoline-powered cars and did not want electric models. Their biggest concern about electric cars was that they were incompatible with the region's severe cold, which hurts electric cars' batteries and reduces their driving range.
But Xinjiang by itself is a small market for cars. With electric cars and plug-in hybrids making up 54 percent of China's car market and still rising, nationwide sales of gasoline-powered cars are expected to fade further.
VW needs to close assembly plants in China for gasoline-powered cars. It has halted production at a factory in Nanjing in eastern China and has not assigned any future car models to it -- harbingers of a possible closing.
Since February, VW has been saying it is in "advanced talks" to decide the future of its activities in Xinjiang. But exiting Xinjiang is proving hard for any foreign company.
BASF, the German chemicals giant, said it had started trying a year ago to sell its stakes in two joint ventures in Xinjiang. But it has yet to win government permission. In September, the Ministry of Commerce began investigating whether PVH, the corporate parent of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger clothing brands, had taken "discriminatory measures" by not buying products from Xinjiang.
Complicating VW's dilemma is that its partner in Xinjiang, SAIC, is wholly owned by the Shanghai municipal government and closely follows Beijing's wishes. But SAIC's continued involvement is starting to draw criticism from human rights activists in Europe. China's foreign ministry declined to comment, and SAIC Motor, which owns and manufactures the MG brand, did not respond to requests for comment.
In February, the foreign ministry urged VW and BASF not to leave Xinjiang, saying they should "cherish the opportunity to invest and develop in Xinjiang."

Geoff Capes, 75, Dies; Made Athletic Exploits Look Like Child's Play: [Biography]

Full text: He pulled dump trucks, flipped cars and tossed five-pound bricks as if they were Kleenex boxes. Tending to parakeets brought out his gentler side.
Geoff Capes, a herculean wonder from the English countryside who, in addition to winning the World's Strongest Man competition twice, was a champion breeder of parakeets, an activity that provided an escape from stunts like bending steel bars around his neck, died on Oct. 23 in Lincoln, England, in the East Midlands. He was 75.
The death, at a hospital, was confirmed by his son, Lewis Capes, who did not specify a cause.
At 6-foot-6 and 365 pounds, Mr. Capes was a crushing Adonis whose daily diet consisted of seven pints of milk, two loaves of bread, a dozen eggs, two steaks, a jar of baked beans, two tins of sardines, a pound of butter and a leg of lamb.
His gargantuan caloric intake powered his extraordinary feats in strongman competitions: pulling 12-ton trucks uphill, flipping cars, tearing London phone books in half and tossing five-pound bricks as if they were Kleenex boxes. He could run 200 meters -- nearly the length of two American football fields -- in under 25 seconds.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"When you saw him sprint, you realized just what an absolutely terrifying athlete he was, as in terrifyingly good," Colin Bryce, a television commentator for the World's Strongest Man competition, said in an interview. "He wasn't just a big lump."
Mr. Capes won the World's Strongest Man title in 1983 and 1985. He won the U.K. Truck-Pulling Championship in 1986. And he was a six-time champion of the World Highland Games, a competition of traditional Scottish sports during which participants wear kilts while throwing heavy objects, including telegraph poles.
His physical prowess made him a favorite of Queen Elizabeth II, who howled in laughter after her glove stuck to his sweaty, sticky hands when she congratulated him on winning the Braemar Games, another Scottish skills competition, in 1982. Prince Charles and Princess Diana stood nearby having a giggle.
For many years, Mr. Capes was England's most famous athlete. Television news reporters marveled at his diet and his muscular triumphs, including his simple method for changing flat tires -- lifting the car with one hand while putting the spare on with the other.
Mr. Capes appeared in numerous commercials, including one for the Volkswagen Polo, in which he flips over the tiny car to examine its underbelly as a voice-over says, "You don't have to be the richest or strongest man in the world to pick up a Polo."
Children played a simulated version of him in the computer game "Geoff Capes Strong Man." And in the 1980s he was a familiar sight on Christmas Day, when the World's Strongest Man competition aired on television after the queen's address to the nation.
"I don't think you can stress quite how much fame Geoff had because you couldn't ever recreate it in the modern era," Mr. Bryce said. "Unless you were in America, where you were like an N.F.L. star and you became a true household name. Geoff was a true household name in Britain."
Mr. Capes got his start in competitive sports as a shot putter. He won 17 national titles and was the European indoor champion in 1974 and 1976. He competed in three Olympics (1972, 1976 and 1980), finishing as high as fifth place in 1980.
He supported himself and his young family by working as a police officer. One afternoon, he was sent to arrest a man for not paying a fine. He knocked on his door. When the man opened it, Mr. Capes saw dozens of budgerigars -- a type of parakeet -- chirping about in cages.
"Could I have a look at your birds?" Mr. Capes said.
They brought back memories of his childhood, when he tended to injured birds and animals. The man invited him inside and served him a cup of tea. They had a lovely chat about the tiny, chatty budgies. Mr. Capes even held some of them in his giant hands.
Alas, after an hour, Mr. Capes reminded the man that he was there to arrest him.
"He came quietly and afterwards we kept in touch," Mr. Capes told The Sunday People, a London newspaper, in 1998. "Two weeks later he gave me my first ever pair of breeding budgies."
Mr. Capes began breeding them with the same enthusiasm with which he trained for strongman competitions. He competed in budgerigar shows throughout Europe, winning a world championship in 1995. He was named president of the Budgerigar Society in 2008 and frequently judged competitions.
"There's something about their color and beauty that fascinates me," Mr. Capes told The Sunday People. "They bring out my gentler side."
Geoffrey Lewis Capes weighed 12 pounds, 7 ounces when he was born on Aug. 23, 1949, in Holbeach, an agricultural town in Lincolnshire, England. His father, Bill Capes, was a land worker. His mother, Eileen (Alcock) Capes, was a matron at a care home who stood six feet tall and weighed 250 pounds.
"The family wasn't just working class," Mr. Capes was quoted as saying in The Daily Telegraph, "but was on the lowest rung of that very long ladder that is the English class system."
Growing up, he recalled, he was "always in fights."
"If the next town came down on a Friday and there were only eight or nine of them, I'd say, 'Go back and get some more,"' he told The Daily Telegraph in 2023. "I'd fight them on my own. I was quite quiet but there was an inner aggression."
He left school at 14 and became a laborer, hauling sacks of potatoes and picking up other odd jobs. He also joined a local athletic club, where he met Stuart Storey, a hurdler who would later compete in the 1968 Olympics.
"I was a problem child with challenging behavior, and he rescued me from this, put me straight and guided me through the early days," Mr. Capes told the British magazine Athletics Weekly in 2015.
Mr. Storey encouraged him to throw the shot put and enter competitions. Unable to afford decent clothing, Mr. Capes traveled to events wearing garments that his mother's patients left behind when they died.
He joined the local police department in 1969 and served as a patrol officer for two years before switching to a position teaching calisthenics to new recruits.
Mr. Capes's marriage in 1970 to Gillian Fox ended in divorce. He married Kashmiro Bhatti in 2018. She survives him. In addition to his son, he is also survived by a daughter from his first marriage, Emma Capes, and six grandchildren.
At the height of his breeding career, Mr. Capes owned more than 300 budgies. He had built them a small wooden aviary behind his home and cooked for them every morning.
"It's my own special recipe consisting of boiled eggs, mashed carrots and a few other secret ingredients that I'm not prepared to divulge," he told The Sunday People. "I mash it all up into a sort of porridge."
The birds devoured it.
"It gives them everything they need," he said, "for shiny plumage, healthy bones and strong beaks."

Canada Orders TikTok
To Shut Down Its Offices
The Canadian government on Wednesday directed the video app TikTok, which is owned by a Chinese tech giant, to close its offices in the country because of national security risks.
The app, hugely popular around the world, will still be available for people to use in Canada, said François-Philippe Champagne, the innovation minister, right.
The decision, based on the advice of Canada's security and intelligence community, was meant to address the risks posed by ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, Mr. Champagne said.
Canadian law provides for extra official scrutiny of foreign investments that could endanger national security, Mr. Champagne said.
TikTok said it intended to challenge the order in court.
TikTok faces an outright ban in the United States, as soon as January, over government concerns about security, data privacy and misinformation.
As TikTok's influence with young people has become inescapable, lawmakers in Washington have expressed concern that China could use the app to fuel misinformation. They are also worried that the app could share sensitive user data like location and browsing history with the Chinese government.
Canada banned TikTok from government-issued mobile devices last year. But the app remains one of the most popular in Canada, where it has been downloaded about 700,000 times a month recently. MEAGHAN TOBIN

Nissan Cuts 9,000 Jobs And Slashes C.E.O.'s Pay
Nissan Motor said Thursday that it was planning deep cuts to its global operations as it seeks to reorient its business and recover ground lost in the growing markets for hybrid and electric vehicles in China and the United States.
The Japanese automaker said it would slash 9,000 jobs and reduce its global production capacity by 20 percent. Nissan's chief executive, Makoto Uchida, will take a 50 percent pay cut in his monthly compensation.
Nissan reported on Thursday that global sales declined across its core markets -- North America, China, and Japan -- in the first half of its fiscal year. Nissan's operating profit fell 90 percent, to $ 214 million, during the April-to-September period.
Like many of its peers, including Ford Motor in the United States and Volkswagen in Germany, Nissan has struggled to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences in some of the world's largest car markets.
In China, growing demand for electric vehicles is being largely met by local brands such as BYD, which have churned out low-cost models tailored to the domestic market. The shift has displaced many traditional automakers, including Volkswagen, which had long dominated sales there.
In the United States, electric vehicle sales growth has slowed in recent years, but consumers are increasingly opting for hybrid gas-electric vehicles. This has provided a boost for Toyota, but has hurt sales for automakers like General Motors and Nissan, which lack similar offerings. RIVER AKIRA DAVIS

Coalition Split In Germany; Finance Chief Is Dismissed: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: After months of disputes, Chancellor Olaf Scholz ousted one of his governing partners, adding to the challenges for Europe since Donald Trump's election.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired his finance minister on Wednesday, effectively ending his three-party ruling coalition and destabilizing his center-left government just as the election of Donald J. Trump in the United States presented Europe with new economic and security challenges.
"I would have liked to have spared you this difficult decision," said Mr. Scholz during an impromptu news conference in the chancellery on Wednesday evening after several days of talks aimed at salvaging the coalition. "Especially in times like these, when uncertainty is growing," he added.
Mr. Scholz vowed to keep governing until the end of the year and then to demand a confidence vote in Parliament in January, a test he may fail. That would open the way for early elections, a rarity in Germany since World War II, possibly in March.
The extraordinary trouble in Berlin leaves the European Union evermore rudderless at a particularly difficult time. France's government is in a crisis after elections there this year yielded a deadlocked Parliament, and Russia has made important advances on the battlefield in Ukraine and continues to threaten Europe broadly.
Now Europe faces the possibility of a trade war with the United States and a weakening of the NATO alliance -- both of which Mr. Trump has threatened -- as Germany, its most populous country, becomes mired in political instability as well.
The collapse of the coalition in Germany came after the leaders of the three parties -- Mr. Scholz's Social Democrats, the left-leaning Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats -- had mostly stopped talking to each other in recent weeks over widening disputes in negotiations for a new federal budget.
On Wednesday night the resentment between Mr. Scholz and Christian Lindner, the leader of the Free Democrats and his finance minister, who spoke with reporters 30 minutes after the chancellor, was on clear display.
"Olaf Scholz has sadly shown that he does not have the strength to give our country a new start," said Mr. Lindner, who called Mr. Scholz's suggestions to promote economic growth "dull and unambitious."
Mr. Scholz told reporters that Mr. Lindner had acted irresponsibly for not being willing to compromise.
The coalition, which has governed Germany since the former chancellor, Angela Merkel, left office in 2021, was an uneasy set of political bedfellows from the start. It was the first three-party coalition since the early 1960s, one of the reasons, many in the government say, for its instability, frequent leaks and paralysis.
The coalition's collapse is stunning for a country long known for plodding and predictable consensus that avoided the political gyrations of some of its more volatile European partners. It may signal a new era of political instability for Germany, as populist parties on the far right and far left gain more popularity on a fracturing political landscape.
Speculation about a collapse of the coalition had grown since last week after Mr. Lindner wrote a position paper, leaked to the news media, that challenged the progressive fiscal policies of his two left-of-center coalition partners.
Many of his proposals, like the end to national climate policies or cuts to social services, appeared designed to antagonize them. Experts saw the paper as Mr. Lindner's attempt to get himself pushed out of the coalition without having to leave it himself. The opposition, which has been calling for an end to the coalition, called it the "divorce document."
Mr. Scholz and Robert Habeck, Germany's economy minister and member of the Greens party, had initially tried to hold the coalition together. Calling for "pragmatism" in a post on social media on Monday, Mr. Scholz continued: "Coalition governments can sometimes be challenging. But the government is elected, and there are issues that need to be resolved."
At the heart of the dispute was a roughly 10 billion euro, or $ 10.7 billion, hole in the 2025 budget.
On Monday Mr. Habeck sought to keep Mr. Lindner in the government by offering him several billion euros earmarked as a subsidy for a planned Intel factory to help balance the budget. "This is the worst time for the government to fail," he told reporters then.
On Wednesday, Mr. Habeck called the firing "as logical as it is unnecessary," saying that many offers were on the table to meet Mr. Lindner's economic demands.
On Wednesday, Mr. Scholz announced that his Social Democrats would govern with the Green Party as a minority government until at least the end of the year. They will need to secure parliamentary majorities on a case-by-case to pass any laws.
On some issues -- notably aid to Ukraine, rebuilding the military and cracking down on immigration -- they might be able to count on the support of the opposition Christian Democrats, who have similar views on them.
"Germany is Europe's biggest economy and the biggest contributor to the E.U. budget; they need to have certainty," said Sudha David-Wilp, the Berlin-based regional director of the German Marshall Fund, a think tank. "And a minority government means instability for the country and its partners in Europe," she added.
Ultimately such an arrangement can only work with the tacit support of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, or C.D.U., the biggest opposition party that is leading opinion polls to win the next election.
"We cannot afford this unstable government a single day longer," Carsten Linnemann, the party's secretary general, told the German tabloid Bild earlier this week.
The Scholz coalition had billed itself as a restart from the sleepy Merkel years. The partners successfully managed pressing problems early in its term after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and Germany stopped importing Russian gas.
But a ruling by the country's highest court in 2023 forced the government to make drastic cuts in the budget, leading to strife among the partners over the limit on borrowing that is anchored into the constitution.
The final break comes against the backdrop of a stagnant German economy, which is expected to contract by 0.2 percent in 2024, the second year in a row that Germany has stagnated. The country is the weakest member of the Group of 7 and among nations using the euro currency.
In a sign of deepening woes, Volkswagen, Germany's largest industrial employer, is threatening major job cuts and factory closures as it struggles to return its flagship brand to profitability.
With Mr. Lindner's insistence on economic reforms and his exit from the government, he appears to have picked the timing of his election campaign.
His Free Democratic Party has been struggling to break 5 percent support in the polls, the threshold for entering Parliament. Leaving the government on a principled stance could allow Mr. Lindner to pick up voter support for the next election whenever it is held.

Budget Squabbles May Tear Apart Germany's Fragile Ruling Coalition: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A breakup of the divided and unpopular coalition well before elections set for next September could leave the country directionless at a critical time for Europe.
Germany's three-party coalition government, wracked by infighting and policy paralysis over a stagnant economy, is teetering on the brink of collapse.
It does not look likely to last until the next scheduled elections in September 2025 and could fall imminently over a nasty budget debate that comes to a head this month, analysts say. The main political parties are already laying out their campaign positions, and coalition leaders are barely talking.
The growing rift became more evident Friday evening, when a leaked position paper by the leader of one coalition party called for a fundamental economic overhaul that contradicts government policies, and is meant to cut costs.
The 18-page economic paper was written by Christian Lindner, the leader of the pro-market liberal Free Democratic Party.
Mr. Lindner wants to cut some social service payments, drop a special "solidarity tax" intended to help fund German reunification, and follow European Union climate regulations rather than more ambitious national ones -- all demands that his coalition partners are highly unlikely to accept.
After coalition parties lost votes in three state elections in September, Mr. Lindner warned that the coming months would become the "autumn of decisions." And he has suggested that if the coalition did not work in his favor, his party could quit the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
"The way in which the government is currently presenting itself and also the unclear basic direction -- neither corresponds to my expectations of government conduct," Mr. Lindner said Thursday in an online interview. "The situation as it is now cannot continue."
The German economy shrank last year and barely escaped recession this year. Consumer and business confidence is low, and the German export model has been severely challenged by China's own slowdown and by sanctions on Russia.
What may keep the coalition together is the American presidential election.
If former President Donald J. Trump is re-elected, he is likely to pose formidable challenges for European security and trade. It would be a bad time for Germany, a central player in Europe, to be run by a caretaker government with little ability to make major decisions and preoccupied with its domestic politics, analysts warned.
Elected in 2021, the coalition was immediately confronted with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
It managed the initial crisis well, but is increasingly split over policy. Mr. Scholz's Social Democrats have been trying to preserve the country's generous welfare state even as the economy slowed; the Greens are pressing to fight climate change despite the financial costs; and the Free Democrats are demanding adherence to Germany's strict constitutional limits on budget deficits and debt.
The three key leaders of the coalition, Mr. Scholz; Robert Habeck of the Greens, the economic minister; and Mr. Lindner, the finance minister, are barely speaking to one another, according to local media reports.
"Lindner wants out of the coalition, he just doesn't know how yet," read a headline on Friday in Bild, the country's hugely popular tabloid.
At the same time, an opposition legislator, Norbert Röttgen of the Christian Democrats, and others have argued that the shock of a Trump victory, and what it could entail for Ukraine, NATO and European security, means that "you would need a German government that is willing and able to lead from popular consensus and a new mandate."
Germany's financial and military support for Ukraine has been crucial for Kyiv, second only to the American contribution. Mr. Trump often criticizes Germany for its supposed deficit in overall military spending, and as president he tried to pull thousands of American troops out of the country.
If Mr. Trump is elected and decides to reduce or stop aid to Ukraine or undermines credibility in NATO, a functioning German government is considered vital to any coordinated European response.
For a long time, the assumption was that the government would stay together until the next federal election, especially given the weak performance of the coalition partners in opinion polls. The opposition Christian Democrats are well ahead in the polls and the party's leader, Friedrich Merz, would most likely become chancellor if a vote were held now.
But Mr. Lindner's liberal Free Democratic Party, which won nearly 12 percent of the vote in 2021, has sunk in recent polls below the 5 percent threshold necessary to have seats in the next Bundestag, or Parliament. He has been hinting strongly that if he broke from the government over the budget, he could run a new campaign on a platform of defending taxpayers against the big-spending coalition parties.
If he does break away later this month, there could be new elections as early as March.
But Mr. Lindner could also be trying to press for advantage in the budget talks. His own party is divided, and coalition collapses are rare in Germany.
The gap in the budget is under 10 billion euros, or almost $ 11 billion, hardly a large sum. Still, Mr. Lindner's choice to reopen an agreement on pension reform has infuriated Mr. Scholz, and both sides have taken strong public positions on the issue that will be hard to pull back. Mr. Lindner objects to the cost, given an aging population and slower economic growth.
Even if the government survives until next September, it could remain essentially paralyzed on key issues, especially on how to produce sustained economic growth.
The government's inability to agree on central policies is damaging all the coalition parties, said Christian Mölling of the German Council on Foreign Relations. The arguments about policy, "are no longer rational political arguments but look more and more like an emotional, personal thing," he said.
With Mr. Scholz and President Emmanuel Macron of France so weak, "Europe is completely without a leader, there is no one," he said. "The most stable government is possibly Italy."
Germans have reasons to be concerned about their slowing economy, whether it is the crisis over Volkswagen's plans to shut factories, the break with Russia over energy after Moscow invaded Ukraine, or China's declining imports. So even if Germany's economy is in reasonable shape compared to neighboring France or even Japan, that may be little consolation.
According to the latest poll by the public broadcaster ARD, only 14 percent said they were satisfied with the work of the coalition, and 54 percent wanted early elections.

Ford Took Early Lead in E.V.s. Now G.M. Is Surging.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Ford is struggling to make money on battery-powered models while General Motors, which started more slowly, says it is getting close to that goal.
In the race to be second to Tesla in the U.S. electric vehicle market, Ford Motor leaped to an early lead four years ago over its crosstown rival, General Motors, with the Mustang Mach E, an electric sport utility vehicle with a design and a name that nodded to its classic sports car.
But the contest looks much different today.
Sales of G.M.'s battery-powered models are starting to surge as the company begins to reap its big investments in standardized batteries and new factories. Ford's three electric models, including the F-150 Lightning pickup truck and a Transit van, are still selling well but are racking up billions of dollars of losses.
The latest view into how Ford's quick-start strategy has run into trouble came on Monday, when the company reported that its electric vehicle division lost $ 1.2 billion before interest and taxes from July to September. In the first nine months of the year, it lost $ 3.7 billion.
Ford's chief financial officer, John Lawler, said it was a "solid quarter," noting that revenue had risen for the 10th quarter in a row, by 5 percent to $ 46.2 billion. But the company's overall profit of $ 896 million in the third quarter was down 24 percent from a year earlier, largely because of problems with electric vehicles, warranty costs and other factors.
"Our strategic advantages are not falling to the bottom line the way they should because of cost," Mr. Lawler said.
Most automakers other than Tesla are also losing money on electric vehicles and struggling to find their footing. They include Volkswagen, the world's second-largest automaker after Toyota, and Rivian, a start-up once regarded by auto experts as the next Tesla.
But Ford's challenges stand in stark contrast to the recent gains by G.M., its main U.S. competitor. G.M. executives say they are close to breaking even on its electric cars by one important measure.
Last week, G.M. reported a $ 3 billion profit for the third quarter, about the same as a year earlier. Its full-year earnings are likely to approach or surpass $ 10 billion and could set a record.
Like Ford, G.M. is losing money on battery-powered models, but it does not provide a specific figure. It has said, however, that it expects those models to start generating "variable profits" by the end of the year. That means each electric car or truck it sells will make money as long as fixed costs like the money spent on factories, machinery and development are not factored in.
"We're making substantial progress on our E.V. journey toward profitability," G.M.'s chief financial officer, Paul Jacobson, said in a conference call last week.
A big part of the difference between the two companies, both based in Michigan, is how they approached the new technology. Ford developed the Mach E and Lightning, which preceded the Tesla Cybertruck pickup by more than a year and a half, quickly, in part by using battery packs made by suppliers. LG Energy Solution, a South Korean company, makes Mach E batteries in Poland. The Lightning uses a battery pack made by SK On in Commerce, Ga. Some Mach E batteries are also made in China by Contemporary Amperex Technology Company, known as CATL.
Ford also built dedicated assembly lines for both models and, after strong initial sales, expanded capacity. Then consumer interest cooled, and the company had to quickly cut production and prices, putting profits further out of reach.
Ford's third model, an electric Transit delivery van, is bought mainly by businesses. The company has not expanded its consumer models beyond the Lightning and Mach E, recently suspending work on a large electric S.U.V.
G.M., by comparison, moved slowly at first, producing primarily the Chevrolet Bolt compact. The company took years to develop modular battery packs that are now allowing it to use the same components in many vehicles. It also started building battery factories in a joint venture with LG Energy Solution.
The idea was to reap economies of scale by using similar batteries in many models -- large pickup trucks, opulent Cadillacs and practical family crossovers.
The go-slow approach seems to be paying off. G.M.'s first battery factory, in Warren, Ohio, struggled to get going but is now operating at about 80 percent of its capacity, Mr. Jacobson said. A second battery plant, near Nashville, is at 40 percent and rising.
"Every cell that is produced is cheaper under our joint venture arrangement," Mr. Jacobson said. "That's beginning to bring pretty significant benefits."
G.M. has introduced nine electric models using similar batteries, allowing it to appeal to a wide range of consumers. Several more are on the way, including a battery-powered version of its popular Cadillac Escalade S.U.V. Ford's Mach E, Lightning and Transit don't use the same battery components as extensively as G.M.'s cars and trucks.
In the third quarter, G.M. sold more than 32,000 electric models in the United States, about 8,600 more than Ford, according to Kelley Blue Book, a research firm. One model is a Chevrolet Equinox S.U.V. that starts at $ 35,000; the cost to buyers is lower because the vehicle qualifies for a $ 7,500 federal tax credit.
The starting price of the Mach E is just under $ 40,000, and because its battery packs are made outside the United States, buyers are not eligible for a tax credit; the credit may still be available to customers who lease the car.
"G.M. seems to have figured out a way to put out lower-cost, high-efficiency E.V.s," Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst, said.
Ford has been working to streamline its electric vehicle operations. Mr. Lawler said its electric vehicle division had reduced costs by $ 1 billion this year. Soon, LG Energy Solution will start making Mach E batteries in Michigan, so the vehicle will be eligible for the federal tax credit.
Ford is also building battery plants of its own, one in Kentucky and another in Tennessee, in partnership with SK. A third is being built in Michigan and is wholly owned by Ford. The company says the plants will produce battery packs at much lower costs.
In addition, Ford promises that a new pickup truck set to go into production will be more appealing and cost less, and it has an engineering group in California working to develop affordable battery-powered models.
"We have learned a tremendous amount from consumers," Mr. Lawler said. "Most of our competitors are launching their first-generation vehicles. We are moving into our second generation."

Volkswagen's Profit Plummets As Its Unions Threaten to Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Germany's biggest automaker said its profit dropped 42 percent in the third quarter, as union leaders warned that workers were ready to walk out over a wage dispute.
Volkswagen reported a 42 percent drop in quarterly profit on Wednesday, while emphasizing an "urgent need" to cut costs and gain efficiency in a challenging marketplace as it considers plant closures and layoffs in Germany.
The automaker's negotiator pointed to the company's weak earnings ahead of his meeting with union leaders, who warned of imminent strikes if a solution to cut costs and restructure the brand was not found.
The Volkswagen Group, which owns 10 brands, including Audi and Porsche, is Germany's largest industrial employer, with 120,000 people working for its eponymous core brand. The country's vision of itself as an economic powerhouse and automotive giant is also deeply intertwined with Volkswagen, and local economies across the country depend on the company and its well-paid workers.
Representatives from the automaker and IG Metall, the union representing most of its workers, convened for a second round of wage negotiations on Wednesday in a conference room in the Volkswagen Arena, the stadium of the company's professional soccer team, VfL Wolfsburg.
After roughly seven hours of talks, Arne Meiswinkel, the chief of personnel at Volkswagen, who is leading negotiations for the company, told reporters that the company was seeking 10 percent pay cuts and reductions in bonuses. In exchange, he floated the prospect of discussing keeping all 10 factories in Germany open.
"To achieve this financial goal, we can also imagine discussing the prospects for securing the locations and employment," Mr. Meiswinkel said.
Before the talks, Volkswagen reported that profit fell to 2.86 billion euros, or $ 3.1 billion, for the months of August to September, its lowest level in three years. The company is struggling against falling demand in China, the world's largest car market, and high costs, especially in its homeland, Germany.
Union leaders went into the round insisting that the company guarantee that all 10 of its factories in Germany remain open, or they would begin preparing for walkouts.
The union is prevented from staging any strikes until the end of November, but leaders said they would begin preparing walkouts unless their demand was met.
"We expect Volkswagen to declare its willingness to enter into negotiations with us on a viable future concept for all sites," Thorsten Gröger, chief negotiator of IG Metall union, told reporters ahead of the talks.
"Otherwise, I say quite clearly, we will have to plan the further escalation with our negotiating and bargaining committee," he said.
On Monday, the company's top employee representative said management had informed the works council that it was considering shutting down as many as three factories in Germany and laying off tens of thousands of workers. The closures would be the first in the 87-year history of the company and a further blow to Germany's stagnant economy.
Daniela Cavallo, who leads the council representing the Volkswagen's employees in Germany and took part in the negotiations, said the company's willingness to talk about avoiding factory closures was a step in the right direction, but warned that they remained far from reaching a solution.
"We are still miles apart in terms of our positions," Ms. Cavallo said.

Full text: The continent's economy continued to limp along, expanding just 0.4 percent in the latest quarter, dragged down by a loss of competitiveness.
Europe struggled to turn around its economic fortunes in autumn, as Germany, the region's powerhouse, reported weak growth, offsetting stronger expansion in the continent's southern countries, the European statistical agency reported on Wednesday.
Economic output in the 20 countries that use the euro grew 0.4 percent from July to September versus the previous quarter. Compared with a year earlier, the eurozone grew 0.9 percent.
The anemic pace is keeping Europe behind the United States, where the economy grew at an estimated 2.8 percent annualized rate in the third quarter, powered by consumer spending and investment.
"Europe's recovery is falling short of its full potential," Alfred Kammer, director for the region at the International Monetary Fund, warned last week at a meeting in Washington.
Dragging Europe down is a loss of competitiveness that has continued to weigh on businesses -- a problem that Mario Draghi, former head of the European Central Bank, said in a recent landmark report had put Europe's "reason for being" at risk.
A key reason is that Russia's war in Ukraine is still taking a toll, the I.M.F. said. Although European governments and businesses have worked to adapt to the loss of Russian gas, stubbornly high energy prices have continued to hammer industries, especially in Germany, whose vaunted manufacturing sector has borne the brunt of the pain, the fund said.
The German economy defied recession expectations, growing 0.2 percent in the third quarter, after a 0.1 percent decline in April to June, Eurostat said. In a sign of deepening woes, Volkswagen, Germany's largest industrial employer, is threatening major job cuts and factory closures as it struggles to return its flagship brand to profitability.
European consumers have also been sitting on a huge pile of savings, reluctant to unleash spending that could help stimulate the economy as long as the costs of heating their homes and filling gas tanks remain high.
In France, a cost-of-living crisis has crimped household spending and become a major political issue. Those worries were lifted temporarily in the summer when Paris hosted the Olympic Games, with a surge in household consumption and government spending helping to lift growth 0.4 percent from the previous quarter.
But the figure masked underlying weakness in the economy: Investment has slowed and consumers have pulled back on spending since the Games. France is facing further risks to growth in the form of a rapidly widening debt and deficit, which has spurred a politically fragile new government to seek 60 billion euros, about $ 65 billion, of tax increases and spending cuts next year.
France and Germany together are top drivers of the eurozone economy, and continued slowdowns there have outweighed faster turnarounds in southern European countries that were once the region's laggards.
Spain is now one of the fastest-growing countries in the bloc, expanding at a 0.8 percent pace in the third quarter on the back of a boom in tourism and a rise in immigration that the government has welcomed to help fuel further economic growth. Portugal's economy pulled ahead by 0.2 percent from the second quarter.

Europe Imposes Higher Tariffs On Electric Cars Made in China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tariffs, some as high as 45 percent, are intended to protect Europe's automotive sector, but they could escalate a trade war with China.
Consumers in Europe may face higher prices for electric vehicles made in China after tariffs on the cars came into effect on Wednesday as part of an effort by European leaders to create what they call a level playing field for domestic auto companies.
The higher tariffs stem from an investigation the European Union started into subsidies provided by Beijing that helped carmakers in China produce and sell electric vehicles, giving them a competitive edge over their European rivals.
Chinese automakers, already forced out of the U.S. market because of tariffs levied against them there, have called the E.U. tariffs "protectionist" and "arbitrary," arguing that their economies of scale have led to the rapid development of electric vehicle production.
The new tariffs, which come on top of existing import duties of 10 percent, are based on the amount of subsidies each automaker in China received, starting at 7.8 percent for Tesla and going up to 35.3 percent for SAIC Motor of Shanghai. They are to remain in place for five years.
How will tariffs protect European carmakers?
The automotive sector is crucial to Europe, employing 13.8 million people and accounting for 7 percent of the overall E.U. economic output. But Europe's automakers were slow to develop battery and gasoline-electric hybrid technologies for cars, instead spending decades focusing on trying to make diesel-fired combustion engines more efficient.
Only after Volkswagen was found to be cheating on its emissions in 2015 did the European automakers shift their focus to battery technology in earnest. By that time, Chinese car companies, including those like BYD that began as battery producers, had been working on electric cars for years.
The United States and Canada have both imposed 100 percent tariffs on electric vehicles made in China, but European leaders said they aimed to slow imports of Chinese-made electric vehicles rather than stop them altogether.
"Europe doesn't want to hamper its own electric vehicle green transition by making Chinese cars prohibitively expensive," said Emre Peker, a London-based director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a private consulting firm.
The market share of Chinese-made electric vehicles in the European Union has jumped to more than 20 percent from around 3 percent three years ago, according to ACEA, a European auto industry group. A failure to impose tariffs would have resulted in significant job losses in Europe, a senior European official said this week.
A senior European diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity per diplomatic practice, said the tariffs were critical for protecting the European auto industry.
What Europe's carmakers say about the tariffs.
European carmakers opposed the tariffs, with several countries, including Germany, home to BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, having voted against them. German carmakers have large investments in China and are concerned that the Chinese will retaliate.
Volkswagen has argued it was more important to maintain free and open markets than to seek to dampen competition.
"Under a tariffs regime, an industry only loses time," Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen's financial chief, told reporters in a call on Wednesday. The Chinese automakers "will sell cars from within Europe," he said.
Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis, which owns more than a dozen brands including Chrysler, Fiat, Jeep, Peugeot and Ram, has also called the tariffs counterproductive.
"There should be no mistake these short-term actions will have negative mid- and long-term implications," Mr. Tavares said. "The best way -- the only way -- to protect ourselves, our industries, our workers is to compete with the newcomers and raise ourselves to their game."
How China has responded.
Chinese officials had hoped to avoid the tariffs, which they have called unfair. They have since charged that European producers of brandy, pork and dairy have dumped exports in China at low prices in violation of global trade rules.
Lin Jian, spokesman for China's foreign affairs ministry, said on Wednesday that the European Union's move would hurt the cooperation between the two sides, as well as Europe's efforts to address climate change.
"This is a typical act of trade protectionism," Mr. Lin said.
China's auto industry has suggested that its government impose tariffs on large gasoline-powered cars imported from the European Union in retaliation.
What happens next?
The European Commission said talks with China over a solution to the dispute would continue. The two sides have met eight times over the past year. But European officials say "significant remaining gaps" still exist.
European leaders said they were open to negotiating with individual car companies to set an agreed base price at which they could sell their cars in Europe. It was not immediately clear which companies would be involved in such talks.
Some Chinese automakers, such as BYD, have responded to the tariffs by setting up factories within the European Union or Turkey, which is within the European free trade zone. Leapmotor, another Chinese automaker, entered into a joint venture with Stellantis -- owner of the French brands Peugeot and Citroen, in addition to Jeep and Chrysler in the United States -- which will allow the company to produce its electric models in factories in Europe.

Volkswagen May Shutter 3 Factories To Cut Costs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The auto maker's top employee representative told workers that management planned to shutter three factories in Germany to cut costs amid slumping sales.
Volkswagen could shut down as many as three factories in Germany and lay off tens of thousands of workers as it seeks to regain its edge in Europe amid slumping sales and increased competition from China, the company's top employee representative said Monday.
The closures would be the first in the 87-year history of the company, Germany's largest employer, and would be a further blow to the country's already stagnant economy.
The representative, Daniela Cavallo, who leads the council representing the company's employees in Germany, told a gathering of workers at Volkswagen's home plant in Wolfsburg that the proposed closures were part of a plan that managers had presented to the works council.
The company "wants to close at least three VW factories, downsize all remaining plants, divest itself of core areas and, on top of that, realize heavy pay cuts for the remaining employees," she said.
Volkswagen is also considering cutting the work force at the plants in Germany that would remain open, Ms. Cavallo said, adding, "In concrete terms, this means taking out even more products, volumes, shifts and entire assembly lines far beyond to what we have already done."
Volkswagen is the flagship brand of the Volkswagen Group, which also includes Audi and Porsche.
No other company in Germany carries the same weight as Volkswagen. Its history is intertwined with the country's economic and industrial prowess of the post-World War II era, and local economies of entire regions across the country depend on Volkswagen and its well-paid workers.
Volkswagen declined to comment on the details of the plan, saying it would do so only once the company and employee representatives had agreed to a solution. But in a statement, managers said that because of shrinking demand and growing competition, employment costs in Germany remained too high and existing structures would have to change.
"Without comprehensive measures to regain competitiveness, we will not be able to afford significant investments in the future," Gunnar Kilian, a member of the management board, said in the statement.
A spokesman for Olaf Scholz, Germany's chancellor, suggested that "wrong management decisions" could be to blame for Volkswagen's troubles, and said workers should not have to pay the price.
"The aim now is to maintain and secure jobs," the spokesman, Wolfgang Büchner, told a regular briefing by government officials.
Mr. Scholz is under pressure to revive the flagging German economy, the largest in Europe, amid shrinking industrial output. The country is the only one of the world's seven leading economies that the International Monetary Fund is projecting will stagnate this year. The German government said this month that it expected the economy to contract 0.2 percent in 2024, down from an earlier projection of 0.3 percent growth.
Volkswagen suggested last month that factory closures in Germany might be necessary for its flagship brand to remain relevant. Automobile manufacturing is Germany's most important industry, contributing 564 billion euros, or $ 610 billion, to the country's economy.
But it is also heavily dependent on exports, especially to China, where German manufacturers sold around 4.3 million cars in 2021, according to the German Association of the Automotive Industry, a trade group. In recent years, however, Chinese consumers have turned to domestically produced electric vehicles, causing demand for German vehicles to fall.
Since the pandemic, the demand for cars in Europe has also dropped by roughly 500,000, as Volkswagen leaders have repeatedly pointed out. From the management's perspective, that number translates roughly to the output of two of Volkswagen's 10 plants in Germany, said Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen's chief financial officer.
"This is basically the magnitude of two factories," he said. "This is where we stand, and we have to look at it."
Volkswagen is also in wage negotiations with the IG Metall union, which represents most of the carmaker's workers and is seeking a 7 percent pay increase. The two sides decided to open the talks over a new pay deal several months early because of the restructuring plans.
The next round is scheduled for Wednesday, and Ms. Cavallo called on the company to present employees with a plan. Her announcement two days before the talks added to the uncertainty among workers.
"My colleagues and I, we are worried about our jobs," Britta John, a Volkswagen employee and spokeswoman for IG Metall in Braunschweig, told the German public broadcaster NDR. "The situation is really discouraging."

Heads of State Dither as the World Burns: [Review]

Full text: Cate Blanchett stars as a lusty, preening stateswomen in a geopolitical satire from the experimental filmmaker Guy Maddin.
"It's better to burn out than to fade away" is both a Neil Young lyric and the quote that encapsulates the ethos of "Rumours," an extremely funny geopolitical satire from the fertile imagination of Guy Maddin, the Canadian experimental filmmaker who once put Isabella Rossellini into a pair of beer-filled glass legs.
There are no prostheses, see-through or otherwise, in "Rumours," though there are substitute delights: a brain the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, a chatbot designed to ensnare pedophiles and mummified Iron Age corpses. All these creations bedevil the seven fictional heads of state who have convened at an annual G7 summit hosted by Germany, whose randy leader (Cate Blanchett) can't wait to get it on with her sexy Canadian counterpart (Roy Dupuis). Over a lengthy lunch in a gazebo at a woodsy estate, the seven struggle to draft a joint statement on an unspecified global crisis, unaware that their anodyne musings on peace and prosperity will soon be derailed by mud-splattered mayhem and onanistic zombies.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Sporadically ingenious, occasionally chilling and entirely bonkers, "Rumours" sees Maddin (writing and directing with his longtime collaborators Evan and Galen Johnson) abandoning his more familiar black-and-white, silent-film aesthetic for vibrant color. His fondness for soapy melodrama and bawdy humor, though, remains intact. Canada and Germany slip off for some sylvan slap-and-tickle, unnoticed by Canada's former lover, the uptight United Kingdom (Nikki Amuka-Bird). Back at the table, France (Denis Ménochet) and Japan (Takehiro Hira) are bonding over historical speeches, while Italy (Rolando Ravello) is repenting for having once dressed up as Mussolini. An apparently addled United States (Charles Dance, who remains however resolutely British) just wants a nap.
Shot in Hungary, Stefan Ciupek's richly textured and often surreal images drive a mood that darkens inexorably from goofy to skin-pricklingly ominous. As night falls, the seven find themselves abandoned in the forest with neither cell service nor servants. Unnerved by eerie sounds and a vile wind, they discover that an ancient bog man, which Germany had exhumed, has now caused other oozing carcasses to rise up, some with penises slung around their necks like knobby necklaces. Or maybe they're just filthy political protesters?
Though his humor can lean toward the clownish, Maddin (who claims David Lynch's "Eraserhead" as his biography) responds to the call of the weird with a refreshing lack of pomposity. At the same time, this film's utter contempt for our leaders' ineptitude, expressed in the hilarious sight of a circle of bog men frantically masturbating over a campfire, is strangely bracing. And, given our present moment, more than a little stomach-churning: We are all too well acquainted with political fiddling while our world burns.
Maddin has noted our indifference to Earth's degradation before, most notably in his wonderful short film "The Heart of the World" (2000). Here, by skewering the group's longings and grudges, fears and scandals, he's insisting that our leaders are only human. And that may be the most terrifying thing of all.

Chinese Automakers, Undeterred by E.U. Tariffs, Roll Confidently Into Paris: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Weeks after Europe imposed additional tariffs on electric vehicles made in China, the country's car companies were defiant at France's leading auto event.
China's ambitions to become a force in the European car market were on full display this week at the Paris Motor Show, where a record number of the country's automakers unveiled cutting-edge electric models despite a recent European Union decision to impose anti-subsidy tariffs on their vehicles.
At the event, designed to showcase Europe's top automakers, the displays that drew some of the biggest crowds were those from the likes of BYD, Leapmotor and Xpeng, which boasted how the speed of their technological advances -- including the use of artificial intelligence -- would help them compete with, or even surpass, their European rivals in the electric vehicle revolution.
Europe has an ambitious goal of fully transitioning to electric vehicles by 2035, and the continent's biggest carmakers -- among them Renault, Stellantis, BMW and Volkswagen -- all put forward new models aimed at appealing to European consumers. But Beijing is also eager to get in on that game, with the nine Chinese automakers at the Paris show appearing undeterred by what they view as protectionist efforts to slow their advance.
BYD, which made its European debut at the show two years ago, displayed seven models, which its officials said used electric and hybrid technology that surpassed that of its European rivals.
At the BYD stand, a large-screen video displayed landmarks from around the world, from the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It was a visual reminder of the company's ambition to make a Chinese car appealing to Western buyers.
In just a few years, BYD has grown its presence beyond China to 100 countries. In the first six months of this year, a quarter of all hybrid or fully electric vehicles sold on the planet were made by BYD, the company said.
"That's incredible," Stella Li, executive vice president of BYD, told reporters at the show, which runs through the weekend.
She criticized the tariffs imposed by Brussels this month on electric vehicles from China as unfair, a complaint echoed by other Chinese automakers.
The tariffs, which take effect on Oct. 31 and will remain for five years, go as high as 45 percent. But both European and Chinese officials have said they are in negotiations to reach an agreement that would address Brussels's concerns about unfair advantages enjoyed by automakers in China.
Ms. Li said the company would continue its expansion into Europe, bringing a new sport utility vehicle to market in France and Germany. The company said it was dropping the price on models already for sale in Europe, a move that many Chinese automakers have been making to appeal to consumers there.
Renault's chief executive, Luca de Meo, acknowledged the rising competition that Europeans face from Asian automakers. He unveiled a line of several new compact electric vehicles, including one made out of 90 percent renewable materials, in what he said was "a manifesto for technological innovation."
The lineup created what was probably the largest buzz around any European automaker at the show. It was "aimed at tackling challengers from the East," and beating them "if possible," he told reporters.
The challenge for European automakers is formidable. Europe is facing a drop in demand for new cars, with overall sales this year around 18 percent lower than prepandemic levels, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Electric vehicle sales are declining even more, accounting for only around 12 percent of market share this year.
In a display of solidarity with the French automakers, President Emmanuel Macron made an appearance at the event and lingered at the Renault stand, getting behind the wheel of one of the company's new hybrid models. Mr. Macron said he wanted to "show support for the sector."
Even so, some automakers have recognized that the challenge posed by Chinese automakers is not going away. Instead of fighting them, Stellantis, owner of the French brands Peugeot and Citroen, in addition to Jeep and Chrysler in the United States, has joined forces with Leapmotor, a leading maker of electric vehicles in China.
Stellantis bought a roughly 20 percent stake in Leapmotor last year. The two companies also set up a joint venture, which gives Stellantis access to the Chinese company's technology. In exchange, Leapmotor cars will have access to some 200 Stellantis dealerships in Europe.
Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis, described the tie-up as one in which "both companies stand ready to benefit."
He added that "interest from our dealers and our investors is palpable, and the market is hungry for tech savvy and affordable E.V.s." Over the long term, the collaboration between the European and Chinese companies is "aimed at transforming the landscape of electric mobility in Europe and beyond."
Standing beside Mr. Tavares, Leapmotor's chief executive, Jiangming Zhu, spoke in Chinese as he described an electric vehicle built by the two companies that would be affordable and appealing to European consumers' tastes and needs.
The joint venture's compact model will have a starting price of a little over $ 19,600, a price several thousand dollars below similar European-made electric vehicle models.

California officials have been working for months on a plan to "Trump proof" the state's leading edge environmental and climate policies, in the event that former President Donald J. Trump returns to White House and follows through on his promise to gut them.
Whether California succeeds could affect more than a dozen other states that follow its emissions rules, and could have global impact because the state's market muscle compels auto makers and other companies to conform to California standards.
The strategy now being crafted in Sacramento includes lawsuits designed to reach wide-ranging settlements with industries that generate greenhouse gases, and new rules and laws that rely on state authority and would be beyond the reach of the administration.
Mr. Trump, who considers climate change a "hoax," has promised to weaken every major federal climate regulation, as he did in his first term.
But he is also expected to try to blow up California's climate policies, which have set the pace for the rest of the nation and the world. The state is requiring about three-quarters of new trucks sold there after 2035 to be zero emissions. And in a request that is pending, California wants permission from the Biden administration to enact one of the most ambitious climate rules of any nation: a ban on the sale of new gas-powered passenger vehicles in the state after 2035.
Both rules are far tougher than federal policy and could have influence beyond the United States, given California's standing as the world's fifth-largest economy. China and the European Union have already adopted parts of California's car and truck tailpipe emissions reduction programs.
The Democratic-controlled state legislature has also passed a first-in-the-nation law requiring major companies to disclose their greenhouse emissions. And it has strengthened the authority of local governments to shut down oil and gas projects in their communities. Next month, Californians will be asked to approve a ballot measure to create a $ 10 billion "climate bond" to pay for climate and environmental projects.
Under a provision of the 1970 Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency has for decades given California a waiver that allows it to enact pollution controls that are stricter than federal regulations. Federal law also allows other states under certain circumstances to adopt California's standards as their own.
Sixteen states have pledged to follow the California car rule and 10 states have adopted the truck rule, meaning that the California regulations would apply to about 40 percent the United States auto market.
Mr. Trump has promised to revoke the waiver. "California has imposed the most ridiculous car regulations anywhere in the world, with mandates to move to all electric cars," Mr. Trump has said. "I will terminate that."
At the same time, the legality of the waiver is being challenged by 17 Republican attorneys general and several oil groups in a lawsuit that may head to the United States Supreme Court.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump has continued his long-running feud with California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom. Mr. Trump has called him an "environmental maniac" who is "crushing our great automakers in Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, crushing them under his leadership."
A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, Karoline Leavitt, declined to comment on California's plans.
Mr. Newsom, who is seen as having White House ambitions of his own, has made clear that he intends to forge ahead on environmental regulation regardless of whether Mr. Trump returns to the presidency.
"California has long led the nation in pioneering climate policies and innovation," said Mr. Newsom in a statement. "Those efforts will continue for years to come. That includes partnerships with private companies, such as automakers, and agreements with other countries -- everywhere from China to Norway to Canada -- to combat the climate crisis together."
Other top Democrats in the state, including Attorney General Rob Bonta, are working with the state's climate regulator, the California Air Resources Board, on the "Trump-proofing" strategy. Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said the state legislature will be ready to meet in a special session after the November election if necessary.
When Mr. Trump became president in 2017, California officials were caught flat-footed, said Mary Nichols, who was the state's top climate regulator from 2007 to 2020 and now informally advises state policymakers. "It came as a shock," she said.
As the Trump administration dismantled Obama-era environmental rules and then took aim at California's policies, the state fought back, Ms. Nichols said. California filed more than 70 climate and environmental lawsuits against the Trump administration, prevailing in more than half of them.
That kind of record is not assured in the future, in part because Mr. Trump reshaped the nation's courts, appointing more than 200 federal judges. Those appointments include three Supreme Court justices, who helped form a conservative supermajority that delivered decisions to restrict the government's authority to regulate climate, air and water pollution. As soon as January, the court could hear the case that is challenging California's waiver under the Clean Air Act.
State officials and lawmakers are working to try to protect California's policies even if it loses its waiver.
They plan to build upon their most successful legal gambit during Mr. Trump's first term. In 2019, the Trump administration revoked California's waiver -- the first time the federal government had done so since the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970. The Biden administration would later restore it, but the lapse had limited impact because California had secretly struck legal agreements with four of the world's largest automakers -- Ford, Volkswagen, Honda and BMW -- to reduce their tailpipe emissions according to limits set by the state.
The move blindsided and enraged Mr. Trump, and his administration in turn threatened to withhold federal highway funds from California, unsuccessfully sued the state for partnering with Quebec on its emissions reduction program, and opened an antitrust investigation into the automakers that signed on to the deal.
But the deal with automakers, which expires in 2026, endured and grew: Volvo and Stellantis have since signed on. California regulators are now talking to the companies about even stricter emissions limits, and expanding the agreement to include other automakers and possibly other states.
"We are going to fight back hard," said Phil Weiser, the Democratic attorney general of Colorado. "We are going to coordinate."
Ms. Nichols, the architect of the automaker deal, also said that "back channel" conversations are happening about ways to forge legal agreements to reduce emissions from other industries, including electric utilities, oil companies and global corporations that have business in California.
The state is betting that companies would prefer to enter into a legal agreement that requires them to cut emissions or pay for environmental remediation rather than gamble on a court decision that could result in much higher sums. Many companies would also like to avoid the uncertainty of federal rules that change with each administration.
"When you have a settlement with private industry, it doesn't matter if there is a change in administration," said Paul Nolette, a professor of political science at Marquette University who is familiar with California's strategy.
Mr. Nolette and others said the $ 206 billion settlement reached in 1998 between 46 states and tobacco companies offered lessons for how a climate deal between several states and industries could be structured.
The California attorney general's office hopes to create a foundation for such deals following its lawsuit last year accusing five of the world's largest oil companies of knowingly contributing to climate damage, and its lawsuit last month alleging that Exxon Mobil misled consumers into believing that many plastic products were recyclable when they were not.
The discovery documents and financial disclosures emerging from those complaints could lead to settlements under which companies might agree to emissions reductions, said Ms. Nichols and Mr. Nolette.
Legal settlements would likely be just one part of the state's "Trump-proofing."
"California has lots of other tools, including the power of the purse -- particularly when it comes to procurement," said Craig Segall, the former assistant chief counsel at the California Air Resources Board, who is now senior vice president at Evergreen Action, an environmental advocacy group.
For example, during the Trump administration, California banned the purchase of state vehicles made by companies that backed Mr. Trump's efforts to roll back the state's fuel-efficiency rules, including General Motors and Fiat Chrysler, which later became Stellantis. Eventually, those companies reversed course and sided with California.
Other leverage is under consideration, said Mr. Segall and others familiar with the planning.
State regulators could impose penalties on the use or purchase of vehicles that burn gasoline while California lawmakers could require that the resulting revenue be used to subsidize the purchase of electric vehicles.
Regulators could also limit emissions stemming from vehicles that are linked to enormous facilities like warehouses that are a hub for diesel trucks. A similar rule recently took effect in Los Angeles.
"Any state can have that," said Mr. Segall. "It doesn't need the federal waiver. These kinds of things are not popular, but in a world where there is destruction of the other climate tools, states can take these defensive measures."
More than a decade ago, California launched a "climate diplomacy" relationship with China that endures. Delegations of Chinese officials have met multiple times with California Air Resources Board officials to share information and research. The meetings have borne fruit: China essentially cut-and-pasted portions of the California clean car rules -- a policy move that helped drive China to the cutting edge of electric vehicle development.
California's outreach to other countries will continue, state officials said. In addition to China, the state has influenced the European Union, which is mandating EV-only auto sales after 2035 and truck sales after 2040.
The state has served as co-chair of the International Carbon Action Partnership, an organization of economies that have established "cap-and-trade" programs, in which industrial polluters buy and sell emissions credits. Among those economies is Quebec, which has linked its carbon dioxide cap-and-trade market with California's.
The Canadian province has used revenues of the program to help pay for incentives and chargers for electric vehicles, which now make up nearly 30 percent of new car sales in the region, compared with 8 percent in the U.S.
"Without the carbon market and the linkage with California, we wouldn't be able to achieve this in Quebec," said Benoit Charette, Quebec's environment minister. "No matter the result of the federal election, California is our partner."

Goodbye to Dysfunction and Creamy Ripe Cheeses: [Correction]

Full text: In 1973, Joe Holtz helped start the Park Slope Food Co-op, a Brooklyn institution that is equally loved and ridiculed. Will it survive his retirement?
For a 74-year-old, Joe Holtz can cover a lot of ground very quickly. The ground he was covering the other day was the three adjoining carriage houses in Brooklyn that were subsumed by the Park Slope Food Co-op as it grew and became the largest, busiest and most argument-inducing single-store food cooperative in the United States. Every square foot, in the breakneck tour he gave, reminded him of an episode in the store's history.
That history is inseparable from Mr. Holtz's. He helped to found the co-op. He was its first paid employee. He kept working there, as general manager, eventually adding the roles of treasurer and general coordinator, and showing little sign of slowing down until Oct. 2, when he sent an email to all 16,000 members announcing his retirement.
"I feel that responsible planning includes retiring while I can still walk, talk, think and be available to the Co-op," he wrote.
His last day is set for next June, by which point he will have been on the job for 50 years.
People at the co-op knew that he would eventually reach the end of his run. The in-house newsletter, The Linewaiters' Gazette, ran an article two years ago with the headline "What Happens After Joe Holtz Retires?" Still, those who have worked closely with him find a post-Holtz co-op hard to picture. As the article put it, he "carries in his mind the whole of the co-op, with all of its convoluted functions and dysfunctions."
Oh, the convolutions! Oh, the dysfunctionality! But also: the creamy ripe cheeses! The esoteric, seductively fresh fruits and vegetables! The strangely underpriced organic milk! Since its early days as a kind of distribution center for cheap lentils, the co-op has grown into one of the city's premier fancy-foods stores, with net sales of almost $ 55 million in its most recent financial statement.
It has done this while clinging stubbornly to a cooperative model in which members make the most consequential decisions, do most of the work and buy all of the goods. Outsiders, a group that includes members in bad odor for one infraction or another, are not allowed to shop.
Passing briskly through the basement, Mr. Holtz pointed out a channel on the floor where manure was sluiced out when horses were stabled there. After noting that there are two freight elevators, he strode up a staircase to the sales floor. There were fresh steelhead trout, frozen black cod and other seafood, every last fin and scale purchased, he said, in accordance with the exacting sustainability guidelines of the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
Near the bins of pink-fleshed Hidden Rose apples and wild chanterelles, he paused briefly beside a stack of warm beer. A few years ago, the co-op overturned a long-running ban on selling beer. There was a catch, though. The members insisted that it not be kept in a refrigerator.
"The co-op didn't want to be a source for people who wanted a cold beer in a hurry," Mr. Holtz said.
Not selling an item in a form that might turn out to be popular -- in fact, not selling it precisely because it might be popular -- is just the kind of thing that has made the Park Slope Food Co-op such an inviting target for scoffers, cynics and chroniclers of brownstone do-goodism.
Live tweets of the characteristically freewheeling debate in 2009 about banning plastic produce bags were gleefully republished in The Awl, which once called the co-op "that magical place in Brooklyn where neighbor turns against neighbor regarding issues such as boycotting Israeli food and, oh, anything else."
If the store's five-decade experiment in cooperative, noncapitalist democracy has proved anything, it is that when its members are given a voice in how things should be run, many of them will use it, and a few will use it loudly and abrasively.
To true believers, and Mr. Holtz is one of the truest, the internecine fights and labyrinthine rules are more feature than bug. They are, in a sense, the whole point of the co-op.
"It's a New York pastime to bag on the Park Slope Food Co-op, but they're completely missing what it is," said Kate Daloz, a writer who is a member. "The co-op is outside capitalism, so it's solving problems a different way."
Even Mr. Holtz has been ensnared by the co-op's thicket of regulations. In 2022, after he went back to work while he was waiting for the results of a Covid test, which came back positive, he was suspended without pay (he makes about $ 125,000 a year, he said, plus benefits) and barred from entering the premises for 30 days. Mr. Holtz protested to the committee that made the decision, calling his punishment "ridiculously heavy-handed."
"That was a huge controversy," said Marty Stiglich, who worked at the co-op for 17 years and built its renowned cheese department. "Everybody was outraged that that happened to Joe."
There is no unanimous opinion at the Park Slope Food Co-op on any subject, including Mr. Holtz. But he has managed to come out on the other side of each crisis and battle largely because his dedication is undeniable.
"Through all the trials and tribulations that have happened, Joe's in there with his sleeves rolled up," said Andy Feldman, a longtime member who served on the fearsomely named Disciplinary Committee, which meted out punishment to slackers, thieves, pugilists and other non-cooperators. (That committee has gone through several configurations and is now known as the Dispute Resolution Committee.) "He wants the co-op to be successful, in that it's kind of his baby."
In 1972, when he went to a meeting in Park Slope (then a slightly down-at-the-heels neighborhood) to talk about starting a food co-op, Mr. Holtz had been marinating in the counterculture for some time. He enrolled in the experimental curriculum of the State University of New York at Old Westbury but left after a year "in order to have more time to protest against the Vietnam War and other injustices," he said.
With three other refugees from his college, he got in a Volkswagen bus and headed toward San Francisco. "It didn't quite make it, the van," he said, but "we did." In the East Bay, he was impressed by early food co-ops -- or, as they called themselves then, food conspiracies.
Building a new way to get groceries appealed to Mr. Holtz. Like the other founding members he joined with in Park Slope, he had lost faith in many American institutions, including the one that filled supermarkets with feedlot beef and Wonder bread. Instead of letting their shopping choices be limited by the profit motive, why not get like-minded Brooklynites together to make purchasing decisions, share the labor and plow the savings on payroll into lower prices for brown rice and tofu?
"We wanted to be able to eat better and afford it," Mr. Holtz said. "But it was not as simple as that. We believed America was about individual success too much. So we were excited about the idea of people working together."
They posted a weekly time sheet so members could volunteer for shifts. "We thought people would just sign up on the work chart because they were excited about the co-op," he said.
But as many other young people learned in that era, ideals take you only so far. Within the year, this system collapsed. So did the next one, which required members to work but didn't keep track of whether they did or not.
In the next plan, not only were hours recorded, but members who didn't put in their allotted hours were banned from shopping until they caught up. The first time somebody was turned away at the door for not carrying their share of the work was a watershed moment. Or as Mr. Holtz put it: "The most important day in the history of the co-op."
The co-op would have rules -- more and more as time went on -- and they would be enforced.
Member labor fueled the co-op as it expanded from the second floor of 782 Union Street to the entire building, and then to the two buildings it bought next door. Mr. Holtz lobbied for each move.
"He was always looking five years down the road," Mr. Stiglich said. "In the early '90s he knew Whole Foods was coming, and we'd have to compete."
As many as 10,000 new food co-ops were born between 1969 and 1979, according to one history of the movement. Today, their numbers are in the hundreds, and many of those stay afloat by operating more like normal grocery stores. The Park Slope Food Co-op is one of the few that held to its original cooperative model.
"Joe Holtz steered that ship," said Ms. Daloz, who wrote a history of commune dwellers and goat farmers, "We Are as Gods: Back to the Land in the 1970s on the Quest for a New America."
A search for a new general manager is already on, and Mr. Holtz is not involved. After he leaves next June, Mr. Holtz said, he hopes to continue his work as a roaming consultant on the theory and practice of co-ops. He may also play a little Ping-Pong and spend more time at the summer cottage in the Catskills where he goes to unwind. It is part of an old bungalow colony that went on the market several decades ago when, Mr. Holtz said, "some people from Park Slope noticed it was for sale and bought it."
They turned it into a co-op.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The gas station is nestled on the side of the road, a lone hive of liveliness in an otherwise deserted stretch of eastern Lebanon.
By 9 a.m., a steady stream of cars is already pulling up to its pump, and the station's owner, Ali Jawad, waves them in one by one. They are neighbors, doctors, rescue workers, among the few people remaining in an area that has been hit with near-daily Israeli airstrikes. As he fills up their tanks, they share the latest news -- the buildings destroyed, the friends injured, the neighbors killed.
In between pumping fuel, Mr. Jawad fields calls from people who have fled, asking if the road has been hit and if their homes have survived another night of strikes. The few drivers passing by honk, and he waves as if to say: Yes, I'm still here, too.
"I'm never leaving," Mr. Jawad, 56, said one recent morning. "It's my duty to stay, to help people here."
Mr. Jawad's gas station is the last one still open on the outskirts of Baalbek, a city of ancient Roman ruins in eastern Lebanon that has nearly emptied over the past two weeks as most residents fled the barrage of Israeli airstrikes.
For those who have stayed, the station has become a badly needed lifeline. Today it is a town square of sorts, a hub for essential commodities as the war has intensified: fuel, friendship and information.
In a country where the government struggles to provide basic services, and where fuel shortages persist even in better times, the gasoline he provides is a critical stopgap. Demand for fuel has only soared as the war has intensified.
The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah started firing on northern Israel in solidarity with its ally Hamas after the Oct. 7 attacks last year, setting off back-and-forth exchanges of fire that displaced communities on both sides of the border. In recent weeks, Israel has stepped up its bombardment and invaded with ground troops as it expands its fight against Hezbollah. More than 1.2 million people have now fled their homes in Lebanon, according to the Lebanese authorities.
A few hundred have remained around Baalbek, where Mr. Jawad's pumps help fuel the excavators of rescue workers digging through rubble and the ambulances carrying injured people to hospitals. They power the generators that keep the hospital lights on, allow the last known open bakery to remain open and run the refrigerators for the grocery store next door.
Mr. Jawad also serves as a nexus for updates on the situation in Baalbek. Virtually all drivers share news of the billowing smoke from the strikes they passed along the way. His phone rings constantly with calls from neighbors asking for the latest developments.
"Did you see the strike yesterday?" Mr. Jawad asked one driver, as he pulled up to the pump. "The one at the entrance to Baalbek."
"No, I missed it. I was with relatives in Tripoli," the driver replied, referring to a city on the northern Lebanese coast.
"Oh, thank God," Mr. Jawad said.
A few minutes later, Mr. Jawad picked up a call: "Did you hear they hit Bednayel this morning? Yeah, 15 kilometers from here." Balancing the phone between his shoulder and his ear, he waved another car to the pump.
The driver, Khalid Zayim, 42, stepped out and let out a loud sigh. Smudges of soot and dust covered his gray jumpsuit, the uniform for the civil defense, the country's emergency medical workers who rush to the site of the strikes.
"It's a disaster," Mr. Zayim told him. "There's a shortage of everything."
In the past week, five of his 15 team members have fallen sick from the plumes of black smoke and other toxins they inhaled at the scene of the strikes, he said. Their few excavators have been so greatly in demand that they often have had to do without at some sites. That meant digging through rubble by hand for hours on end to find people buried beneath, though few were alive by the time the workers reached them.
Once his car's tank was full, Mr. Zayim sat back into the driver's seat and reached beneath the passenger's seat. Then he pulled out a twisted piece of metal from the site of the strike. "Look, a souvenir," he said, before setting off down the road back to his base.
Even before Israel ratcheted up its bombardment last month, many people across the country relied on informal networks of social support. The government, they had learned over decades of crises, was too hobbled by corruption and political paralysis to provide most basic services.
The country's Shiite community came to depend on the social safety net provided by Hezbollah, which ran its own welfare network of hospitals, schools and youth programs. While Hezbollah never invested as much in eastern Lebanon as the south, the few services it provided helped keep the impoverished region afloat. But now, with the group seemingly consumed by the war effort, even that support has largely vanished, Baalbek residents say.
"The party isn't helping," Mr. Jawad said, referring to Hezbollah, which is also a political party. "We used to see them driving back and forth, but now we don't even see them. They're in hiding because of the drones and the airstrikes."
The absence of formal aid has pushed Mr. Jawad to stay -- a point in which he takes great pride. The gas station a block down the road had closed a week earlier, after its owner fled. Glancing in that direction, Mr. Jawad scoffed. "Coward," he muttered under his breath.
The decision to stay has come at a cost. Late last month, he said an Israeli airstrike decimated a building behind his pumps, shattering the windows of his office and sending pieces of flaming hot metal flying across the station. One grazed his 24-year-old son's hand. His son screamed in pain, Mr. Jawad said.
The next day, their son and two daughters drove to the family's second home in Batroun, a city along Lebanon's northern coast. Gada Tasnoob Talib, 50, begged her husband to leave with them. "She told me, 'You're crazy. Leave. All the other people are leaving -- we have the money to leave,"' he recalled. "She doesn't understand it from my point of view. It's not about the money, it's about taking a stance: Either you help people or you don't."
The fight was among the most intense of their marriage. The two had been an item since she was 14 and Mr. Jawad chased her down the street to tell her that he liked her. Their budding romance was a scandal. She was Christian, Mr. Jawad was Shiite Muslim, and her parents did not approve until, months later, Mr. Jawad finally wore them down. The pair have hardly spent a day apart in the 36 years since.
Despite her own fears, Ms. Talib ultimately decided to stay behind with her husband. The ache of being away from each other now, of not knowing if he was safe, would be too much, she said. But the couple and their few remaining neighbors in Baalbek wonder how long the delicate web of support can last.
"What if they start attacking the roads? Then how do we get fuel from Beirut?" asked Mohammad Qassem, 30, the last known remaining butcher in Baalbek, who arrived at the station in a red Volkswagen van.
As he spoke, a ram in the back of the vehicle, its chestnut coat dusty and matted, crooned. It had been smuggled across the border from a farm in Syria that morning.
Days earlier, an Israeli airstrike had hit near one crossing between Lebanon and Syria that Israeli officials claimed Hezbollah was using to smuggle weapons. Mr. Qassem worried it was only a matter of time until those strikes expanded to the rest of the Lebanese-Syrian border -- and cut off their supply of meat for the butchery.
For now, they try to put aside their anxiety. Mr. Qassem says he will find some other way to feed the town if the border closes. Mr. Jawad says only death could drag him away.
"Baalbek will never die," Mr. Jawad proclaimed. "But who will pay the price? The civilians who die."

Volkswagen's Troubles Reflect Wider Issues in German Economy: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Germany's largest automaker rode a wave of strong sales for years, but lagging demand and pressure from China are forcing it to consider layoffs.
No industry is more important to the German economy than automobiles. And no carmaker is more important than Volkswagen.
Now, as the 87-year-old automaker is floating the prospect of job cuts and factory closures as it seeks to return to profitability, Volkswagen's struggles are being reflected in the overall troubles facing the country, which is grappling with a shrinking industrial sector and an economy that is forecast to contract for a second consecutive year.
"The fact that Volkswagen, Germany's largest car manufacturer, largest industrial employer and the world's No. 2 behind Japanese carmaker Toyota, is no longer ruling out plant closures and compulsory redundancies shows how deep the German industry is now in crisis," said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany.
The issues dragging on profitability at Volkswagen's core brand -- high-priced labor, cumbersome organizational structures and an inability to keep up with advances by Chinese automakers -- mirror those facing Germany's overall economy.
On Monday, the German government said the economy would contract 0.2 percent in 2024, down from a previous projection of 0.3 percent growth. Dragging output down is the industrial sector, which has failed to recover from the shocks of the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Germany also appears to have lost some clout in the European Union, which voted on Friday to impose higher tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, a key trading partner of Germany.
Some economists trace the root of the problems, both at Volkswagen and in Germany as a whole, to a missed opportunity to invest in the future during what many call the "golden decade," when the country's output expanded 14 percent after the global economic downturn of 2008.
"The German economy did really well, and so did Volkswagen," said Jens Südekum, an economist at Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf.
In those years, Volkswagen exported cars with combustion engines across Europe and to China, becoming the largest automaker in the world by sales in 2016. It held that position until 2019, despite a scandal over illegal cheating on emissions tests in Europe and United States, which cost the company more than 31 billion euros, or $ 34.6 billion.
The German government racked up budget surpluses from 2014 to 2019. Interest rates were negative, and Germany could have borrowed to invest in public infrastructure, digitization and the transformation to a green economy. Instead, it passed a law enshrining a balanced budget into its Constitution, a move that continues to limit investment.
"In a sense, Germany was too successful and people become complacent, thinking that success would just go on forever," Mr. Südekum said. "And now we know that's just not the case."
The same could be said of Volkswagen, which has sold millions of gas-powered cars in China since the 1990s. But it failed to take seriously the threat posed by Chinese brands such as BYD, Geely and Nio, which focused on developing fully electric and hybrid cars and building a supply chain to support them.
The lack of foresight vexed IG Metall, which represents 120,000 Volkswagen workers in Germany. The union has raised mismanagement claims against Volkswagen's leaders, who have scrambled to invest billions in recent years to shift production at German plants to electric vehicles.
Thousands of workers at Volkswagen staged a rally last month ahead of the first round of wage talks with company leaders. The workers blew whistles and banged on drums, vowing to defend the 120,000 jobs at six factories in Germany and demanding a wage increase of 7 percent.
"Cutbacks are not a future concept," Thorsten Gröger, a lead negotiator for IG Metall, told the crowd, which had gathered in the courtyard of the summer palace of the House of Hanover, a former royal dynasty. He called for the automaker to reduce bureaucracy and complexity and develop a strategy for the survival.
But company representatives point to the generous benefits enjoyed by Volkswagen's workers, including the possibility for up to 36 vacation days -- six more than the industry standard.
"We must reduce our labor costs in Germany," Arne Meiswinkel, the human resources chief at Volkswagen and lead negotiator for the company, said as talks started. "We can only maintain our top position and safeguard jobs in the long term if we work more economically."
Workers are pushing back, saying that while they are being asked to make concessions, Volkswagen in the past year has paid out €4.5 billion in dividends. The automaker also said this year that it would invest up to €5 billion in Rivian, a U.S. maker of electric trucks that has struggled to turn a profit.
"Try explaining that to the workers here," said Stefan Henze, a union representative from Volkswagen's software division, Cariad. "It doesn't add up."
The Volkswagen Group, which owns 10 brands, including Porsche and Audi, is in a stronger position than its flagship brand, which reported a 5 percent drop in its profit margin in the first six months of 2024.
German media have reported that as many as 30,000 jobs could be lost -- a number that the company has so far declined to confirm. Such a move would not be without precedent. The company let more than 37,000 employees go from 1971 and 1975, a move that it credits with turning around profitability at the time.
Workers have vowed to take their fight to the streets as soon as a mandatory peace period surrounding the start of talks expires, which could happen by the end of November at the latest.
"Talking has never saved any jobs," a programmer from a Volkswagen factory that produces electric motors, who gave her name only as Anne-Marie, said at the rally in Hanover.
German politicians have weighed whether they should intervene to help shore up Volkswagen, especially in the face of the economic slowdown the country is facing. The automobile industry provides work for 773,000 people, not including jobs at hundreds of smaller companies and suppliers.
One of the largest suppliers, ZF, announced this year that it would cut up to 14,000 jobs within four years, citing a drop in demand for electric vehicles among the reasons.
Last year, the German government abruptly stopped a subsidy to encourage the sale of electric cars, causing many customers to pull back. The move not only hurt demand, but it also caused customers to question Europe's overall ambition to ban the sale of new cars with combustion engines by 2035.
In recent weeks, some politicians in Germany have called for the ban to be lifted, or at least extended, a move that economists say creates further confusion for consumers.
At the same time, the European Union is readying to increase tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, with the aim of leveling the playing field for European automakers, which they argue have not benefited from the amount of state subsidies that their Chinese counterparts receive.
But Volkswagen, which is heavily invested in China, and the German government oppose the levies, which they fear could lead to retaliation from China.
Economists also warn that duties risk further harming growth when European companies like Volkswagen need to be able to be fast and flexible if they are to remain competitive.
"There should just be an eye toward less regulation and more allowing firms to be more nimble and encouraging further investment," said Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University who grew up in Hanover and studies the Germany economy.

For Global Companies in China, Pulling Out of Xinjiang Raises Thorny Problems: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Beijing's investigation of the parent of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, which stopped buying goods from Xinjiang, has put global firms in a difficult position.
An investigation by China of an American clothing retailer has escalated concerns among foreign companies about their dependence on Chinese supply chains and the future of their operations in the country.
China's Ministry of Commerce said last week that it was investigating PVH, the corporate parent of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, for allegedly taking "discriminatory measures" against products from Xinjiang, a region in China's far west that produces a fifth of the world's cotton.
At issue is whether PVH violated Chinese law by pulling back from purchasing cotton or garments from Xinjiang, where researchers have cited evidence of forced labor, mass arrests and confinement to re-education camps among the region's predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, particularly the Uyghurs.
The investigation has made clear that China will not tolerate companies that shun Xinjiang. That puts some multinationals in a legal vise grip because a growing number of governments, including the United States and the European Union, restrict or ban imports from Xinjiang.
The case is the first time Beijing has wielded a rule it put in place four years ago, known as the Unreliable Entity List, against a company for complying with another country's prohibition on goods from Xinjiang.
"Since this investigation is the first of its kind, companies in all sectors have been forced to reassess what it means for them," said Sean Stein, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. "Many are seeing higher risk," he added.
For companies, the PVH investigation adds to the public relations problems that doing business in Xinjiang can bring -- inside and outside China.
In 2021, H&M, Nike and other brands faced a damaging backlash from consumers in China after the companies said they would break ties with Xinjiang. This spring, several global automakers became the focus of a congressional investigation for buying parts from a supplier flagged by the U.S. government for participating in forced labor programs tied to the region.
Many international companies are heavily dependent on Chinese suppliers. From cars to solar panels, China is the world's largest manufacturer by far. More than 90 percent of China's cotton is produced in Xinjiang.
"European companies find themselves increasingly caught between a rock and a hard place," the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said in a statement. "If they cease operations in, or sourcing from, regions like Xinjiang they may face a severe backlash from both government and consumers in China," the chamber continued. "If they stay, they risk negative consequences from their home and other international markets."
Western companies have already grown warier of China because of geopolitical issues. Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, one of the world's largest asset management companies, said at a conference on Tuesday that global companies needed to re-evaluate investments in China because it is the biggest economic supporter of Russia, which is waging war on Ukraine.
The PVH investigation could provide another reason for companies to shift away from China, according to advisers for global companies.
"It is a serious and growing concern for many multinational corporations and may aggravate the incentive to decouple," said Lester Ross, the partner in charge of the Beijing office of Wilmer Hale, a law firm.
Companies in joint ventures with Chinese firms in Xinjiang are particularly stuck. Such arrangements are hard to change without official approval. The Chinese government, typically quick to push back against criticism, has made clear it wants foreign companies to stay in Xinjiang, a poor region that it wants to develop.
BASF, the German chemical giant, started trying to sell its stakes in both of its Xinjiang manufacturing joint ventures to its state-owned partner in late 2023. Last week, BASF said the sales had not been completed and were "subject to negotiations and required approvals of the relevant authorities."
Volkswagen, the German automaker, said in February that it was examining "the future direction" of its small joint venture in Xinjiang, where the staff and scale of operations had already shrunk considerably. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by saying companies should "cherish the opportunity to invest and develop in Xinjiang."
VW has yet to announce any changes.
PVH was given 30 days to respond to the government's claims. If PVH is found to have violated China's laws, penalties could include fines and travel limits on PVH employees, or even a halt to the company's exports from China, the ministry said.
In recent years, human rights groups and corporate responsibility organizations have pushed retailers, in particular, to avoid purchases from Xinjiang.
In July 2020, PVH said that within 12 months, it would stop buying garments, fabric and cotton from Xinjiang. The company responded last week to the Ministry of Commerce announcement by saying, "As a matter of company policy, PVH maintains strict compliance with all relevant laws and regulations in all countries and regions in which we operate."
PVH said this week that it had no further comment.
The Ministry of Commerce has not explained the timing of its decision to begin investigating PVH, which came against a backdrop of persistent trade frictions between the United States and China.
In the United States, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act bans all imports from Xinjiang unless the importer can prove that the goods are not tainted by forced labor. The United States also has a separate ban on any imports that contain even traces of Xinjiang cotton or tomatoes, two crops grown mainly on state-owned farms that researchers have linked to human rights abuses.
Companies in the European Union and Canada must comply with a patchwork of national regulations that ban the import of goods made by forced labor.
China has banned independent investigations of labor conditions in Xinjiang and has cracked down broadly on due diligence firms, making it almost impossible for companies to prove how their goods were produced.
Nury Turkel, a lawyer and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a think tank, said repression and forced labor involving minorities were continuing, both within Xinjiang and around China.
China has stopped publishing the number of people sent to re-education camps. Those detainees have not been released but instead transferred to prisons, fields or factories, he said.
Mr. Turkel said the United States needed to work with more countries to ban Xinjiang products, and toughen penalties for companies that violate bans.
The U.S. Commerce Department declined to comment. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the Chinese government was "trying to harass and intimidate" American companies that were complying with U.S. law.
"The United States must not let this bogus investigation stop our country from cracking down on China's ongoing human rights abuses," he said.
The Chinese government denies that human rights abuses have taken place. The government also portrays programs to send rural Xinjiang residents to jobs in distant factories as an effort to alleviate poverty, not forced labor.
Steve Vickers, a former senior Hong Kong police officer who runs a corporate security consulting firm there, said companies "are now caught in the middle of what is truly a messy dilemma."

When Taylor Swift released "1989 (Taylor's Version)" in an array of physical formats last year, Cora Buel knew she had to get the cassette right away. Buel, a 48-year-old based in Daly City, Calif., is a fan of Swift's music -- an affinity she shares with her teenage daughter, who has since bought her mother more tapes as gifts. One main reason? Buel drives a 1998 BMW Z3, and has no other convenient options for on-the-road album playback.
"Just get an old car that only plays cassettes," Buel said, "and you'll listen every day."
Although Buel might be an extreme proponent of retro design -- she works as chief revenue officer at ThredUp, an online consignment store -- the cassette's return is by now almost as unmistakable as the format's distinctive hiss and warble.
Dominant in the United States from the early 1980s until it was overtaken commercially by the compact disc in the early 1990s, the cassette tape has survived as an underground phenomenon, a deliberately anachronistic medium of choice for artists on the noise, avant-garde and low-fi fringes. But tapes began turning up at the trend-chasing retailer Urban Outfitters as long ago as 2015, the same year that digital streaming first overtook download sales. Nearly a decade later, Swift's latest album, "The Tortured Poets Department," stands as the top-selling cassette of the year so far, with about 23,000 copies sold through June 30, according to the tracking service Luminate.
Sure, cassette sales of Swift's new album pale beside its performance in even other physical formats, where it boasts sales of 1.1 million copies on CD and another 988,000 on vinyl. But "Tortured Poets" alone is on pace to beat the total annual sales of all albums on cassette for as recently as 2009, when the Luminate precursor Nielsen SoundScan reported a mere 34,000 units shipped. If Spotify killed the iTunes star, and vinyl is increasingly a high-priced luxury item -- never mind CDs for the moment -- then cassettes could be the cockroaches that outlive them all.
As labels look to capitalize on "superfans" who will buy multiple formats, artists releasing new music on cassette this year cross genres and generations. A sampling of musicians embracing the format includes: the pop polymath Charli XCX, the alternative-rock titan Kim Deal, the adventurous South Florida rapper Denzel Curry, the outré Thom Yorke band the Smile, the black-metal group Darkthrone, the pop-rock duo Twenty One Pilots, the meditative electronic producer Tycho, the masked country singer Orville Peck, the folk-pop troubadour Shawn Mendes, the reigning pop wunderkind Billie Eilish, the garage-rocker Ty Segall, the alt-pop eclecticist Remi Wolf and the sultry singer-songwriter Omar Apollo.
Though the last new car to be factory-equipped with a cassette deck was reportedly a 2010 Lexus, more than a quarter of light-duty vehicles on the road are at least 15 years old, according to a recent analysis by S&P Global Mobility. Susanna Thomson of the Oakland, Calif., band Sour Widows still listens to cassettes in her 1998 Volvo wagon, which has a tape deck and a CD player. "I-90," a song on the alternative-rock group's bittersweet new album, "Revival of a Friend," includes lyrics about driving down the interstate while singing along repeatedly to a beloved cassette; the tape in question was by the Southern California punk-rock outfit Joyce Manor.
"I have a little cassette library in my car that just stays there, and I'll rotate tapes out," she said.
At 29, Thomson presumably grew up after the cassette's heyday, but she said that listening to tapes was partly grounded in nostalgia for her. There's an element of protest, too. "Being passionate about cassettes, vinyl, CDs," Thomson said, can be "an act of resistance against the powers-that-be that have their horrible fingers in the world of art." While Thomson also has a Sony Walkman-style portable cassette player, it has a broken part, she said, and she doesn't know how to fix it.
To cassette listeners without access to automobiles of a certain age (and their tape decks), Thomson's tale of a busted Walkman might have a familiar ring. The best-known audio equipment manufacturers of the cassette era have long since exited the market.
Sony sold more than 200 million Walkmans from July 1979, when the devices debuted in Japan, until the music stopped around 2010. Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba and Bose no longer sell audio tape players, representatives for each of the four companies confirmed. The Consumer Technology Association, a trade group, stopped tracking sales of combination radio/cassette/CD players in 2016, when there were an estimated 653,671 units shipped, compared with a likely peak of around 25 million radio/cassette combos in 1994, according to a spokesperson.
Although the market for new cassette players became too small to bother measuring, a vast supply of the ostensibly obsolete gadgets was already in existence, in various states of repair, waiting to be rediscovered.
Liam Dwyer, the 20-year-old general director of WXBC, the student-run radio station at Bard College, originally got into tapes because an older Volkswagen that belonged to Dwyer's father had a cassette deck in it. While there's a tape deck at the station, Dwyer (who uses they/them pronouns) recently found a cassette player at school that someone was giving away -- a Technics, model unknown. "I haven't tested it yet, but I believe that it will work, or I will fix it up," they said.
Dwyer has been looking into acquiring a Walkman for portable use, partly because of an interest in how artists like Liz Harris, a.k.a. Grouper, incorporate tapes into sound art and instrumental music. The first tapes Dwyer picked up were by Golden Boy, a "breakcore" artist from their own hometown, Portland, Ore., and the music that Dwyer listens to on cassette is mainly electronic and experimental. A double cassette from the Frank Ocean associate Vegyn was a staple in the Volkswagen, but "the car, unfortunately, had to be towed."
If cassettes are popular, it's in part because they are cheap for do-it-yourself artists and independent labels to get made. For one recent title on Jack White's Third Man Records, cassettes cost $ 2.80 apiece to produce versus $ 6.92 per vinyl LP, Ben Blackwell, one of the label's founders, said. Tape enthusiasts' preferences in playback devices can be similarly economical.
Indeed, the main reason people buy used physical media, including cassettes, is to "get a bunch of stuff for a low price and then engage with it," said Mike Hunchback, a co-owner of Brooklyn Record Exchange. He noted that his customers tend to seek out used cassette players at thrift shops, at record stores like his or online. "The majority of people that are listening to cassettes now that I sell to, they are using a cassette player that is at least 20 years old," Hunchback said. "And the function of that cassette player is to listen to cassettes for fun."
He emphasized that enjoying old music need not require large amounts of disposable wealth, and he contended that "the overwhelming majority" of working cassette players from 25 years ago -- including unopened devices that purportedly can still be found collecting dust behind the counters of the city's delis and bodegas -- will meet listeners' needs. "The joy of it is to actually listen to it," he stressed.
That said, some who listen to vintage cassettes may also understandably have an appreciation for vintage audio gear. Johannes Stoeber, the general manager at Rutgers University's student-run radio station, WRSU, collects audio equipment, mainly for analog forms of playback, and he listens to cassettes on a recorder and playback machine from Nakamichi, a high-end Japanese company. A former musician in a symphony orchestra, Stoeber, 20, tries to emulate that experience of being "enveloped by the music" in his home listening. "I listen to cassettes and other physical forms of media mostly as a way to have more of an interaction with the music," he said.
Stoeber favors reel-to-reel or vinyl for classical music listening, but argues that rock from the 1960s and '70s goes well on cassette, and so does pop. While he's drawn to the tactile nature of working with tapes, as well as their versatility, Stoeber also contended that cassettes, including high-performing Type 2 and Type 4 tapes, can have a sonic character that's preferable to other formats, analogue media types among them. "Digital music is flat," Stoeber said. "Often vinyl can feel that way too, because it doesn't have the occasional bit of wow and flutter that introduces a little life into it."
Some new manufacturers have entered the cassette market, meeting a simmering demand but confronting a vastly different supply-side landscape than in the 1990s. FiiO, an electronics company with headquarters in Guangzhou, China, recently debuted a bare-bones, Walkman-style cassette player that sells for about $ 100. "The biggest challenge has been the near-complete disruption of the cassette player supply chain," the company's chief executive, James Chung, said in an emailed statement. "Restoring the technical prowess of 1990s Walkman devices is virtually impossible today." Then again, vinyl record production has largely overcome a similar supply squeeze in the past decade.
A Paris-based startup called We Are Rewind introduced its own minimalist, Walkman-like tape player via Kickstarter in 2020, citing inspiration from the timeworn cassette deck at the heart of the "Guardians of the Galaxy" film franchise, as well as from the 1980s-retro Netflix smash series "Stranger Things." Retailing for about $ 160 and up, We Are Rewind's portable tape machines also offer Bluetooth connectivity for wireless listening.
While the company's chief executive, Romain Boudruche, acknowledged an initial struggle to find suppliers, he said We Are Rewind sold almost 20,000 cassette players last year and hopes to double that number in 2024. He outlined plans for a smaller version and a boombox, plus collaborations with artists and brands. "The possibilities are really big, even if it's a still a niche," Boudruche said.
The North Carolina rapper Rapsody, who made her cassette debut earlier this year with a limited-edition tape of her new album, "Please Don't Cry," grew up listening to the format, but she first encountered its rebirth a couple of years ago: Her fellow Kendrick Lamar collaborator, Ab-Soul, sent her a package with a cassette of his 2022 album "Herbert" and, as it happens, a We Are Rewind player. Although Rapsody's tape has sold out twice, she was surprised at first to find out that her fans were listening to it. "I thought it was a collector's item," she explained. "But people really want the experience."
That's not to say that all cassettes sold these days are actually being played. "As with vinyl, most aren't really worried about that," Carl Mello, brand engagement director for Newbury Comics, wrote in an email. Mello noted, however, that Newbury Comics, a music and collectibles chain based in the Northeast, has been selling 30 units a month of a "cheapy" Walkman-style portable tape player by Jensen, "more than we sell of any individual turntable model."
The Haitian American rapper Mach-Hommy offers a nuanced perspective on cassettes. He has released oodles of them -- including this year's "Richaxxhaitian" -- and some of his tapes are listed for thousands of dollars on the resale website Discogs (which, by the way, has about 87,000 active listenings for cassettes released since 2020). But he is also a longtime listener, with his own hand-me-down dual-well cassette deck and vivid memories of perhaps ill-advisedly taping over one of his father's cassettes as a child. He has a Walkman, he said, but he doesn't use it much.
While Mach-Hommy said he's flattered by the resale values, he expressed ambivalence about what people do with the music on his tapes, whether that's push play or try to flip for profit. "I made it to listen to," he said. "But I've heard accounts of people being able to take some of these pieces, resell them, and open a business or buy a car, or steer themselves out of homelessness and destitution." In the end, he added, "it's up to you."

Full text: European Union officials say the duties are meant to protect the region's automakers from what they say are unfair trade practices in China.
The European Union voted on Friday to impose higher tariffs on electric vehicles imported from China, risking tensions with an important trading partner in an effort to protect an industry crucial to Europe's economy.
The decision affects billions of dollars of trade between two of the world's biggest economic powers. The move also reveals how the European Union is struggling to reconcile the conflicting interests of its members, some of whom see China as an essential partner while others view it as a dangerous competitor.
The tariffs are much lower than the 100 percent duties imposed by the United States and Canada, but analysts said they reflected Europe's willingness to build bridges with Washington by taking a tougher stance on Beijing, but without shutting out China entirely.
The vote sends "a signal that there's an emerging consensus in Europe that stronger pushback against China on the economic front is needed," said Noah Barkin, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund who specializes in Europe's relationship with China.
Still, the decision exposed the divisions among the 27 E.U. member states over how they should handle the issue with China. Five countries voted to block the tariffs, while 12 abstained.
The tariffs, which take effect on Oct. 31 and will last for five years, go as high as 45 percent. But both European and Chinese officials have said they remain in negotiations to reach an agreement that would address Brussels's concerns about unfair advantages enjoyed by automakers in China.
"The E.U. and China continue to work hard to explore an alternative solution," the European Commission said in a statement on Friday, adding that any deal would have to be within the rules set by the World Trade Organization. The vote stems from an investigation that the commission started last year into government subsidies given to electric vehicles made in China, part of a broader push against what the commission describes as anticompetitive behavior from China that has hurt European businesses.
The tariffs were calculated by the level of state support that Chinese automakers received from Beijing. The highest duties are being imposed on manufacturers that disclosed little about their subsidies, while Tesla, which has a large factory in Shanghai, was hit with the lowest because it negotiated with investigators.
China, which had lobbied individual countries to reject the tariffs, criticized the vote and called for the European Commission to postpone the duties while negotiations between the two sides continued. China is the European Union's second most important trading partner, after the United States. Last year, the two traded goods worth 739 billion euros, or $ 811 billion.
China's commerce ministry said the move represented "unfair, noncompliant and unreasonable protectionist practices." And the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said the lower prices of Chinese electric vehicles stemmed not from subsidies but from a supply chain that had developed through fierce market competition inside the country.
Talks will continue between Chinese and E.U. officials on Monday, a ministry spokesman said in the statement. He added a thinly veiled threat of retaliation if the tariffs were enacted, saying China would "take all measures to firmly safeguard the interests of Chinese companies."
China has already started investigations against subsidies on European goods, including dairy, brandy, pork and luxury cars.
European officials have said the tariffs could be paused or even ended should they reached an agreement with the Chinese that addressed their concerns about unfair advantages.
The Biden administration has voiced concerns that internet-connected Chinese cars and trucks pose a national security risk because their operating systems could send sensitive information to Beijing, but Europeans are more concerned about protecting their automotive industry. Last year, that industry provided 13.8 million jobs and accounted for 7 percent of the region's economic output.
In Germany, which voted against the tariffs, automakers and the government are concerned that the move could set off a trade war with China. Germany's three biggest automakers, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, are all heavily invested in China.
The decision by Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany to vote "no" reflected the pressure that he faced from the country's leading autoworkers union, as well as from industry leaders, who warned that increased duties could harm competition when overall demand for cars, including electric vehicles, in Europe was shrinking and production costs in Germany remained stubbornly high.
"It is the right signal from the German government, which -- with a view to the economy, prosperity and growth -- has backed the interests of the European and German automotive industry and its employees on such an important issue," said Hildegard Müller, the president of the German Automobile Association. Hungary, Malta, Slovenia and Slovakia also voted against the tariffs.
The European Union faces a shrinking share of the global economy and is lagging far behind the United States and China. A report published last month by Mario Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank, found that Europe needed to prioritize protecting its automotive plants and companies from state-subsidized foreign producers. Tariffs would "help level the playing field" while keeping Europe open to benefiting from productivity gains from China, according to the report, which was the result of a yearlong study requested by the European Commission on the causes of Europe's competitiveness crisis.
The 12 abstaining E.U. countries included Austria, Sweden and Spain, according to a European diplomat.
Carlos Cuerpo, Spain's economy minister, in a letter sent on Thursday to Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission's trade commissioner, called on the commission to continue negotiations with China. He wrote that the European Union needed to protect its automotive industry while avoiding an escalation of tensions with major trading partners like China, according to a European official who had seen a copy of the letter.
Others argue the tariffs will encourage the Chinese companies to shift their production to Europe, creating jobs and bringing their expertise to the continent. Two Chinese companies, Chery and Leapmotor, have already set up joint ventures with automakers in Europe, and BYD, China's leading automaker, is building its first factory in Europe.
But leaning too heavily on China to help prop up European industrial production could prove counterproductive in the long run, said Janka Oertel, the director of Asia for the European Council on Foreign Relations.
"Reindustrializing with the help of Chinese companies may seem like an easy fix to some in Rome or Madrid, but would further enhance dependence on Beijing and ability to strong-arm the European political process," she said.

European Union Likely to Clear Boost in Tariffs On China E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The European Union is expected to support wielding tariffs on electric vehicles made in China, seeking to prevent unfair competition.
European countries are expected on Friday to approve an increase in tariffs to as much as 45 percent on electric cars imported from China, a move that officials said would help protect European carmakers from a glut of cheaper vehicles subsidized by Beijing.
The vote, by the 27 countries in the European Union, will impose additional tariffs ranging from 7.8 percent for Tesla cars made in China to 35.3 percent for vehicles made by the Chinese automaker SAIC, with duties for other automakers falling somewhere in between. Those rates will come on top of the European Union's existing 10 percent tariffs on all imported cars.
Leaders in Brussels say the duties are aimed at creating a level playing field for automakers in Europe and their competitors in China, rather than to close the European Union market to Chinese imports.
But European countries are divided on the issue. France, Italy and Poland support the tariffs, while Germany remains opposed. Spain initially supported them but on a visit to China last month, the country's prime minister urged Brussels to consider a compromise.
To block the tariffs, 15 countries whose populations amount to 65 percent of the European Union's total inhabitants would need to vote against them.
Chinese leaders have spent recent weeks traveling through Europe's capitals, meeting with leaders from member countries and representatives in Brussels to try to reach an agreement that would prevent the tariffs from taking effect. European leaders said that although they were legally required to vote on the tariffs, they remained open to continuing talks on the issue with China.
The additional tariffs stem from an E.U. investigation into government subsidies given to electric vehicles made in China. The European Commission has indicated that it is open to continuing negotiations with China even after the vote, and the tariffs could be dropped, even after they have taken effect, should the two sides reach an agreement.
"The conclusions of the investigation is not necessarily the end of consultations on finding a solution," Martin Lucas, the commission's director-general in charge of trade defense, told the European Parliament on Monday.
The duties, which would come into effect on Oct. 31 and remain for five years, would still be significantly lower than the 100 percent tariffs imposed by the United States, Canada or Turkey.
President Emmanuel Macron of France has pushed his country's backing of the tariffs, insisting on Wednesday that the level of support that the Chinese automakers received from the state was "unbearable" and harmful to the European market.
"Broadly, we have to protect the level playing field in all the different sectors of our industry," he said.
Among those countries opposed to the tariffs is Germany, whose automakers including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen are all heavily invested in China, is concerned that the Chinese will retaliate against the tariffs.
"That is why negotiations with China on electric vehicles must continue," Germany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said in Berlin on Wednesday. He suggested the European Union look at other areas where Chinese competition was hurting Europeans, such as steel.
The automotive sector is crucial to Europe, employing 13.8 million people and accounting for 7 percent of the overall E.U. economic output. But sales have been falling, along with demand, leading manufacturers to consider layoffs and factory closures from Belgium to Germany to Italy.
Despite weaker overall demand for electric cars in Europe, China is taking a larger share of the market. Registration among owners of electric vehicles built in China has increased sevenfold in the past three years, according to the European Commission.
But some analysts point out that concerns about a tit-for-tat trade conflict with China were overblown, citing China's growing dependence on Europe.
"China really needs the European market, especially with the U.S. market closing down to Chinese products," said Noah Barkin, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. "China is going to respond if the E.U. introduces duties, but I doubt whether that response will be an over the top response."

At Stellantis, The Troubles Are Piling Up: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The automaker, created by a 2021 merger, is dealing with labor unrest, slumping sales and a revolt from its dealers.
Stellantis, an automotive colossus that owns more than a dozen brands including Chrysler, Fiat, Jeep, Peugeot and Ram, is facing challenges at seemingly every turn.
The company's sales and profit have been plummeting. Dealers stuck with parking lots filled with unsold cars are publicly criticizing Stellantis and its chief executive in unusually harsh terms. Stellantis's stock price has fallen almost 50 percent from its high point in March. And the union that represents its U.S. factory workers is threatening to go on strike at several plants.
United Automobile Workers locals are expected to vote in the coming days to authorize strikes against several Stellantis factories, protesting what they say are broken promises by the automaker.
The problems are raising questions about the future of Carlos Tavares, the Stellantis chief executive, who races cars in his spare time. After taking the reins at the French carmaker PSA in 2014, he acquired a series of rivals to build a company that last year sold more cars than General Motors did.
Last week, Stellantis said it was evaluating who should lead the company when Mr. Tavares's contract expires in early 2026. Mr. Tavares could remain chief executive, Stellantis said, but the statement was hardly a vote of confidence.
In 2021, PSA merged with Fiat Chrysler, and the combined company adopted the name Stellantis. While the company is based in Amsterdam, its U.S. operations accounted for more than half of Stellantis's profit in the first six months of 2024, meaning that problems here reverberate across the Atlantic. And the problems are deep, analyst say.
"I wouldn't want to be Carlos Tavares," said Erin Keating, the senior director of economic and industry insights at Cox Automotive, a market research firm.
Jeep and other Stellantis brands raised prices more than other automakers did in recent years, Ms. Keating said, and waited longer to offer discounts when demand slowed. High interest rates made those prices even more unpalatable to car buyers. As a result, many people who are ready to trade in Jeep Wagoneers or Dodge Chargers that they bought three or four years ago can't afford the latest models.
Dodge dealers have, on average, 149 days of supply on lots, including many 2023 models, according to Cox. That is almost twice the industry average. Market share of Stellantis brands in the United States had fallen to 8.6 percent as of the end of June from 10.4 percent a year earlier, Cox said.
Dealers are furious. Kevin Farrish, the chairman of the Stellantis National Dealer Council, which represents the company's independent car dealers, blamed decisions that favored short-term profits and helped Mr. Tavares qualify for a 50 percent pay raise last year, earning nearly $ 40 million.
"The reckless short-term decision-making to secure record profits in 2023 has had devastating, yet entirely predictable, consequences in the U.S. market," Mr. Farrish and other members of the council wrote in a letter to Mr. Tavares this month. "Those consequences include the rapid degradation of our iconic American brands."
"You created this problem," the dealers wrote in an unusually direct rebuke.
Stellantis declined to make Mr. Tavares available for an interview. In a statement, the company said his compensation was in line with other automotive chief executives', taking into account corporate profits.
The president of the U.A.W., Shawn Fain, has been just as strident in his criticism of Mr. Tavares, accusing him of backpedaling on promises to revive operations at a shuttered factory in Belvidere, Ill., and of planning to move production of the Dodge Durango, a large sport utility vehicle, from Detroit to Canada.
"Either we allow an out-of-control C.E.O. and his billionaire backers who have enjoyed years of record profits to close plant after plant and continue destroying our country," Mr. Fain told union members last week, "or we stand up."
The confrontation between Stellantis and the U.A.W. comes a year after strikes helped workers win record pay raises. As part of the contract that ended those strikes, workers won the right to walk out if the company didn't meet its commitments -- a right that the union is now threatening to invoke.
The company denied that it was violating any commitments to the U.A.W., and said it had not confirmed plans to move Durango production.
"Stellantis has abided, and will continue to abide, by the agreement the parties reached in 2023," Carlos Zarlenga, the chief operating officer of Stellantis North America, said in an email to Mr. Fain on Monday.
The problems at Stellantis raise doubts about the series of acquisitions during the last decade that made it the fourth-largest carmaker after Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai-Kia. (Stellantis is fifth if the alliance of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi is considered one company.)
The deal-making led by Mr. Tavares was supposed to allow the company's car brands to share the costs of developing new technology and save money by using common components. The rationale was that bigger carmakers had a better chance of surviving the upheaval caused by the industry's shift to electric vehicles and autonomous driving.
Those benefits have not materialized as much as the company hoped, analysts said. The company disagreed, saying in a statement that combining the automakers had saved $ 8 billion since 2019.
Stellantis offers a wide selection of midsize and small cars in Europe. In the United States, however, Jeep's model lineup is heavy on higher-priced, large sport utility vehicles after it discontinued the smaller Cherokee and Renegade models last year. That change came just as cost-conscious buyers began showing a preference for smaller S.U.V.s like the Toyota RAV4, Chevrolet Trax and Honda CR-V.
And Stellantis has been unable to arrest the decline of Chrysler, which began decades ago and was once a formidable rival to Chevrolet and Ford Motor. Chrysler's lineup has dwindled to one vehicle -- the Pacifica minivan, which is available as a plug-in hybrid or with a conventional gasoline engine. (Chrysler is still selling off remaining inventory of the 300 sedan, which it stopped producing last year.)
Stellantis said it was taking steps to regain market share, including cutting the starting price of its least expensive model, the Jeep Compass, to below $ 30,000. The company said this week that it would revive the Chrysler Voyager minivan with a starting price of $ 40,000, slightly less than the least expensive Pacifica. The new Voyager will go on sale at the end of this year.
Bigger discounts for models like the Ram 1500 Classic pickup helped Stellantis sales in the United States and Canada surge 20 percent in August, the company said.
Still, with so many unsold vehicles, Stellantis faces pressure to throttle production and cut jobs, "which is obviously upsetting to the U.A.W.," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry analytics and insights at CarGurus, a car shopping website.
Dealers complain that the company does not have a clear strategy.
"Our businesses are suffering. Our employees are suffering," said Sean Hogan, the vice president of Sierra Auto Group, which owns Stellantis dealerships in Los Angeles. "We're not seeing a plan to bring us back to a volume we once had."
Mr. Hogan, also the secretary of the company's dealer council, said he met with top Stellantis executives on Monday but was not satisfied by what he heard. The automaker is still not offering incentives that are generous enough to increase sales and allow dealers to make a decent profit, he said in an email.
Mr. Fain, the U.A.W. president, told members that at least one union local would hold a strike authorization vote soon. Under the terms of the contract with Stellantis, the union would be obligated to meet at least seven times with management to try to resolve its grievances. A strike would happen only if the talks were unsuccessful.
In the short term, factory shutdowns by striking workers may be a blessing in disguise for Stellantis, buying time to clear dealer lots of unsold vehicles. But the company would also risk damaging its brands by alienating car buyers who are sympathetic to union demands.
"Labor unrest is never good," Ms. Keating of Cox Automotive said.

Amazon's A.I. Deal Cleared by Watchdog
Britain's competition watchdog said Friday that it's clearing Amazon's partnership with artificial intelligence company Anthropic because the $ 4 billion deal didn't qualify for further scrutiny.
The Competition and Markets Authority approval comes after it started looking into the deal, part of wider global scrutiny for investments from Big Tech companies into leading startups working on generative AI technology.
The watchdog found that San Francisco-based Anthropic's revenue and its combined market share with Amazon in Britain were not big enough to require an in-depth investigation under the country's merger rules.
"We welcome the UK's Competition and Markets Authority decision acknowledging its lack of jurisdiction regarding this collaboration," Amazon said in a statement. "By investing in Anthropic, we're helping to spur entry and competition in generative AI."

Leading Contender to Buy Citgo Petroleum Emerges
Elliott Investment Management was named on Friday as the leading contender to acquire Citgo Petroleum, the oil refining giant that has been the subject of a long legal battle over billions of dollars the government of Venezuela owes foreign businesses, including U.S. energy companies.
A special master appointed to oversee the sale of Citgo said in a federal court filing that he recommended the company be sold to an affiliate of Elliott, Amber Energy. A federal judge would have to approve the deal, which values Citgo at up to $ 7.3 billion, including debt.
Citgo's main assets are three refineries in Illinois, Louisiana and Texas that together account for roughly 4 percent of the country's fuel-making capacity.
The sale is unlikely to directly affect operations at more than 4,000 independently owned gas stations that use the Citgo brand as franchisees.

Volkswagen Downgrades Annual Forecast Again
Volkswagen cut its annual outlook for the second time in less than three months on Friday, citing a weaker-than-expected performance at its passenger car division as pressure on Europe's top automaker continues to rise.
The lowered outlook is the latest from Germany's car giants, with Mercedes-Benz and BMW both downgrading their annual forecasts earlier this month as a result of weakening demand in China, the world's biggest car market.
It also comes two days after Volkswagen kicked off crucial talks with IG Metall, Germany's most powerful union, over pay and job protection, a historic conflict that could lead to the first German factory closures in the carmaker's history.
Volkswagen now expects a profit margin of around 5.6 percent in 2024, down from 6.5-7 percent previously and below the 6.5 percent LSEG estimate. REUTERS

China Suspects U.S. Retailer of 'Discriminatory Measures': [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: PVH, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, is targeted for allegedly avoiding purchases from the region where the Chinese government has cracked down on Muslim minorities.
China said on Tuesday that it would investigate whether PVH, the American retailer that owns the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, has taken "discriminatory measures" against products from Xinjiang in China's far west.
The announcement, by China's Ministry of Commerce, is a new escalation of China's effort to fight bans or consumer boycotts of goods from Xinjiang.
Many Western governments have begun restricting or banning products from Xinjiang following mass arrests and evidence of forced labor among the region's predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, particularly the Uyghurs. Researchers have cited evidence that cotton production in Xinjiang has been tainted by coercion.
Beijing is sending a message to multinational corporations that if they comply with consumer boycotts or government bans on products from Xinjiang, they may face retaliation in China.
China's action underlines how big companies increasingly find themselves sandwiched between pressures from the Chinese government, which defends its policies in Xinjiang, and Western countries and human rights advocacy groups.
PVH, which is based in New York, said in a statement that it was in communication with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. "PVH maintains strict compliance with all relevant laws and regulations in all countries and regions in which we operate," the company said.
On Friday, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a group with lawmakers from at least 22 countries and the European Union, issued a statement calling for Volkswagen to withdraw from Xinjiang. Volkswagen, Germany's largest automaker, has a 190-employee joint venture in Xinjiang with a carmaker owned by the Shanghai municipal government. Chinese state-owned enterprises like Volkswagen's partner follow Beijing's lead in opposing any withdrawal from Xinjiang.
The alliance issued its statement after Adrian Zenz, the director in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, issued a report that cited a leaked audit that Volkswagen had commissioned. His report said the automaker had failed to properly investigate accusations of complicity in Xinjiang's coercive policies toward Uyghurs. Volkswagen has said that the audit shows it behaved appropriately.
Volkswagen said on Monday that it was not building cars in Xinjiang, where workers prepare cars for delivery to dealerships.
China is not only a large consumer market but also the world's largest manufacturer. Many companies, particularly apparel retailers, depend heavily on factories in China and could be vulnerable if Beijing decided to impose sanctions on their subsidiaries or suppliers.
In the United States, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act bans the import of any goods from Xinjiang unless the importer can prove to American customs officials that the products were made without forced labor. The law took effect in June 2022.
Proving that has become practically impossible, as China has banned independent investigations of labor practices in Xinjiang. Advocacy groups say that forced labor is widely used in Xinjiang's vast cotton fields, which supply textile factories all over China. Xinjiang produces more than 90 percent of all the cotton grown in China.
The European Union is in the process of imposing a ban similar to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.
When consumer and human rights groups in the West began organizing boycotts several years ago of brands that used cotton from Xinjiang, big clothing brands initially tried to shun Xinjiang suppliers. PVH said in July 2020 that within the next 12 months, it would cease all business relationships with factories and mills that produced garments or fabric in Xinjiang, or that supplied cotton from the region.
China responded the next year by allowing nationalist groups to use the country's heavily censored internet to organize their own boycotts of Western brands that did not buy from Xinjiang. H&M soon found shoppers were shunning its stores.
Influential personalities who had endorsed Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, as well as Adidas, Nike and Converse, in China quickly stopped working on behalf of the brands. Burberry had to give up an online video game partnership.
Western companies quickly stopped saying much about their policies in Xinjiang. But the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act has given them a strong incentive to avoid Xinjiang products anyway.
China has quietly passed its own laws that ban compliance with laws, sanctions or boycotts in other countries. The commerce ministry has authority to deem commercial decisions as a threat to China's national security.
The Ministry of Commerce said Tuesday that it would allow PVH 30 days to provide documents regarding whether it had avoided buying from Xinjiang. If PVH is found to have violated China's laws, the ministry said, the penalties could include a halt to the company's imports and exports from China, restrictions or bans on investments in China, restrictions or bans on PVH employees from working or entering China, and possibly fines on the company.
The ministry could impose these penalties if it decides to put PVH on its "unreliable entity" list. The ministry added three U.S. defense companies to that list in May because they had sold weapons to Taiwan, an island democracy over which Beijing claims sovereignty. But that decision made little difference because the United States does not allow the defense contractors to sell arms to mainland China anyway.
China's strong threat to PVH comes as the Chinese government has been trying to woo foreign investors. The ministry tried to send a reassuring message, saying that its actions against PVH were aimed at preserving free trade, not suppressing it.
"The Chinese government is determined to promote high-level opening-up, firmly safeguard the multilateral trading system, and firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of various market operators," the ministry said. "Honest and law-abiding foreign entities have nothing to worry about," it added.

Foiling Tariff By Building Cars in E.U.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: BYD, which leads China's electric vehicle sector, is constructing a plant in Hungary while its Chinese rivals expand through joint ventures in Europe.
The leafy city of Szeged, Hungary, boasting wide avenues, a respected university and ornate, pale yellow villas near the country's border with Serbia, looks more like a relic of the Hapsburg empire than the location of Europe's automotive future.
But at a 740-acre construction site here, excavators have already begun preparing for what will be the first European assembly plant of China's leading automaker, BYD. Large concrete pipes and stacks of metal sheets stand ready, with the cornerstone to be set this fall.
Timing is crucial. The European Union is poised to decide by Oct. 30 whether to increase tariffs on electric vehicles entering the bloc from China. The duties, on top of an existing 10 percent tariff, would range from 9 to 35.3 percent and remain in effect for five years. They are significantly lower than the 100 percent tariffs imposed by the United States and Canada, but they come as Chinese automakers are eager to break into the European market.
BYD has already been seeking to raise its profile in Europe, working with distributors across 19 countries to offer electric and hybrid models and sponsoring the European Championship soccer tournament this summer.
"They have very ambitious plans," Sandor Nagy, a deputy mayor responsible for urban development in Szeged, said of BYD's plant, which the company plans to bring online next year. "And they obviously have a very strong incentive with the tariffs."
Other Chinese automakers, eager to convince Europeans that their cars are fun to drive and more affordable than models made by European companies, are also looking for ways to avoid the tariffs.
Chery, a Chinese car manufacturer, announced in April that it would begin producing electric vehicles in Barcelona, Spain, in partnership with Ebro EV Motors. Stellantis, whose European brands include Peugeot, Fiat and Opel, announced in May that it was entering into a partnership with Leapmotor of China, with production of electric vehicles in Europe to begin this fall.
Zhejiang Geely Holding, which acquired the Swedish automaker Volvo Cars in 2010, is also scouting for a possible production site in Europe. It owns Polestar, which is based in Sweden but produces its vehicles in China. This year, the company began making a sport utility vehicle at a plant in South Carolina, which will also be used to supply the European market.
The moves into Europe come as deliberations about the tariffs head into their final weeks. Wang Wentao, China's minister of commerce, is touring European capitals ahead of a meeting on Thursday in Brussels with Valdis Dombrovskis, the E.U. commissioner for trade.
E.U. officials worry that China poses a threat to Europe's auto industry, which accounts for nearly 7 percent of the region's economic output. They say Beijing has not offered a solution that sufficiently addresses their concerns that years of government support have granted Chinese automakers an unfair advantage over their European peers.
Analysts believe that shifting production closer to the market will benefit both sides: The European auto industry would gain jobs and access to cutting-edge technology, while Chinese producers would save on tariffs and shipping costs.
"I don't think it makes corporate sense from simply a profitability point of view to think you can supply the global car market from factories in China," said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
Chinese brands accounted for 3.7 percent of all electric vehicles sold in Europe in 2023, compared with 0.4 percent of market share four years earlier. That number is expected to climb in the next five years.
In July, Turkey announced that BYD would build an assembly plant there, with production of battery-powered and hybrid cars to begin in 2026. Turkey is not an E.U. member, but trade agreements mean that cars made there would not be subject to the tariffs.
In Szeged, BYD is aiming to ramp up production over the next few years, creating thousands of new jobs. The speed is part of a push to get its cars onto the European market, despite the recent slump in demand.
Already the company has been working to make itself known across Europe, setting up relationships with dealers. At the European soccer championship in Germany, BYD displayed its cars at fan fairs in 10 cities, and its logo flashed on the sideboards throughout the matches.
Germany is Europe's largest economy and its largest market for cars. But it also holds a special prestige for China. Germany's top automakers -- Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz -- helped to develop the auto industry there through joint ventures formed with Chinese companies in the early 1990s.
But German consumers are traditionally conservative and deeply loyal to their brands. Berlin's decision to abruptly cut subsidies toward the purchase of electric vehicles led to a nearly 37 percent drop in new registrations in the year through July, compared with the same time in the previous year.
That has not stopped Chinese automakers from trying to gain a toehold. Last week, several Chinese car manufacturers displayed their latest models at a trade fair in Frankfurt that is normally focused on automotive suppliers.
"Even if some in Europe turn against us, we will never turn against the European market," Victor Yang, senior vice president at Geely, told reporters at the fair.
The interest in Europe is not just from automakers. More Chinese suppliers have arrived over the past several years to be closer to the assembly plants that purchase their products, said Maarten Otte, the head of investor relations for Central and Eastern Europe at CTP, a logistics and industrial real estate firm.
Automakers such as BMW that rely on parts made by Chinese companies are concerned about the costs and the risks associated with shipping goods overseas and are looking to make their supply chains more affordable and secure, he said.
"So they say, 'If you want to produce for our European market, you need to be in Europe,"' Mr. Otte said. A combination of skilled workers available at lower wages and the availability of undeveloped land has made countries in Central and Eastern Europe especially interesting, he said.
The Hungarian government of Viktor Orban has pledged incentives to support the project but has not yet disclosed the amount. BYD did not respond to a request for comment.
Some analysts have drawn parallels between the situation playing out in Europe and Washington's approach to Toyota and Honda, Japanese brands that invested heavily in production in the United States in the 1980s.
But despite attempts to shift the relationship from cooperation to competition, China remains Europe's second-largest trading partner, after the United States, with bilateral trade worth 739 billion euros, or $ 814 billion, in 2023.
"All of these things combined produce an overall political situation where the national security-driven U.S. approach is certainly not desirable in Europe," said Mr. Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute.
This is especially true in Germany, where automakers are heavily invested in China and, fearful of endangering their interests there, oppose the tariffs.
And during a visit to China last week, Pedro Sánchez, the prime minister of Spain -- Europe's second-largest car manufacturer -- urged Brussels to reconsider its position, arguing that pursuing the tariffs would be harmful.
"We don't need another war, in this case a trade war," Mr. Sánchez said. "I think we need to build bridges between the European Union and China."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent, he helped start a collective that brought recognition to Hispanic photographers and illuminated life in the city's barrios.
To Charles Biasiny-Rivera, who worked as a street photographer in the barrios of New York City in the early 1970s, his craft was a matter of trust as much as eye.
"You really do have to understand that when you enter a neighborhood, the neighborhood sees you as a stranger, because they know everybody, so you don't want to become noticed," he said in a 2022 video interview. "So you hang out a little bit," he added, "smoke some cigarettes, say good morning, good afternoon to people.
"If you created a rapport with them," he said, "they wouldn't be peering at you all the time." For those peeking from windows, "the shades would go up, the shades would go down."
As an aspiring photographer of Puerto Rican descent, Mr. Biasiny-Rivera saw street photography as one of the few paths open to him at a time when the handful of Latino photographers he knew were struggling to make a mark in the field. He spent the rest of his career working to change that.
Mr. Biasiny-Rivera died at 93 on Aug. 10 at his home in Olivebridge, N.Y., a hamlet in the Catskill Mountains. His wife, Betty Wilde-Biasiny, said the cause was complications of lung cancer.
In 1974, Mr. Biasiny-Rivera helped found En Foco, a collective "devoted to documenting Latino life from the inside," as Holland Cotter of The New York Times wrote in a review of the 2021 exhibition "En Foco: The New York Puerto Rican Experience, 1973-1974," at El Museo del Barrio, a showcase of Latin American and Latino art in Manhattan. Mr. Biasiny-Rivera served as En Foco's executive director for more than three decades.
Over the years, En Foco expanded its purview: It grew into a nonprofit organization that supports photographers and artists from a variety of underrepresented communities, and it has mounted exhibitions of socially conscious work in museums and galleries around the country.
In 1985, Mr. Biasiny-Rivera founded a new avenue for such artists to show off their work: Nueva Luz, a lush biannual magazine that has featured the work of photographers like Carrie Mae Weems, Laura Aguilar, Delilah Montoya, Dawoud Bey and Sophie Rivera.
In 2004, he received the City of New York Mayor's Award for Arts & Culture from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
Mr. Biasiny-Rivera exhibited his own work at the Smithsonian Institution, the Bronx Museum of the Arts and El Museo.
In the 1990s, he exhibited his mixed-media series "Messages From God," which consisted of his photographs mounted alongside his own handwritten poetry, in the style of the prayer cards found throughout Latin America.
Still, it was his goal of developing the talent of others that really drove him, Bill Aguado, the longtime director of the Bronx Council on the Arts, said in an interview.
"If you had extraordinary work, Charlie was your advocate," Mr. Aguado said. "He had a passion for it. When he started talking about these issues, you could see that glow in his eyes."
Charles Biasiny-Rivera was born on Nov. 10, 1930, on Roosevelt Island in New York City, the youngest of three children of Puerto Rican parents. His father, Nikolas Biasiny, was a merchant seaman, and his mother, Josefina (Rivera) Biasiny, worked in a factory.
In addition to his wife, whom he married in 1988, he is survived by their daughter, Amelia F. Biasiny; a stepdaughter, Nikola Biasiny Tule; and two grandchildren.
As a teenager growing up in the South Bronx, Charles got his first camera, a cheap plastic model, and taught himself to process film by reading library books on the subject.
He attended Metropolitan High School in the Bronx but left at 14 and later joined the National Guard. He enlisted in the Air Force in 1952; stationed in Korea during the war there, he honed his skills behind the lens working as a military photographer.
In 1990, he earned a bachelor's degree in photography and Latin American studies from Empire State College (now University) in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., part of the State University of New York.
When he returned to New York City, he worked as a photography assistant, at one point setting up cameras, lenses and lighting for the British photographer Cecil Beaton when he traveled to New York for shoots.
"He started in the early age when you had to mix your own chemicals," Mr. Biasiny-Rivera said of Beaton in the 2022 interview, conducted by El Museo, "so he was aware of the process, but he didn't care to be involved with it." Beaton, he added, was more interested in charming the subjects, to calm them "so the muscles in the face would relax."
Carving out a career for himself seemed more of a challenge. "I didn't meet many other assistants, or photographers, that were Latinos," Mr. Biasiny-Rivera said in a 2020 interview for En Foco. "When I did stumble across a few, we had a lot to talk about."
He founded En Foco with his fellow photographers Roger Cabán and Felipe Dante, and the group would travel around the city in his Volkswagen bus mounting pop-up exhibitions in parks in Latino neighborhoods, particularly in the South Bronx and East Harlem.
As for their own work, early members divvied up areas of interest to cover that reflected the Latin American experience -- one would concentrate on agricultural work, for example, and another on theater and dance. Mr. Biasiny-Rivera, however, preferred not to specialize.
"I didn't want that," he said. "I just wanted to roam and discover."

A Trump Victory Would Be a Gift to China: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: There is a curious cognitive dissonance in how a lot of us think about the last decade's climate policies and this decade's economic problems.
During the final years of the 2010s, the Trump administration proudly tore up dozens of policies meant to lower American greenhouse gas emissions and build a competitive domestic clean energy industry. It prioritized oil, coal and natural gas businesses over wind, solar and batteries, and as president, Donald Trump often seemed to revel in picking policies that would increase emissions by design.
These choices came with costs: American automakers failed to make their cars more efficient, and within a few years, they had fallen behind their international competition, especially South Korean and Chinese automakers.
Today, the United States finds itself badly lagging behind China not just in hybrid and electric vehicles but also in many other crucial industries: solar, wind and battery production, as well as the refining of some minerals. China now makes more than half of the world's electric vehicles, and BYD, the Chinese automaker, is expanding so quickly that it has plans to open factories abroad in Europe, Central Asia, Southeast Asia and South America.
Those were the costs of just one Trump term. If Mr. Trump returns to Washington, he has promised to once again pull us out of the Paris climate agreement, which the United States had rejoined under the Biden administration. He again wants to kill the country's clean car standards. And he's threatened to cut off the generous federal subsidies for selling and building electric vehicles in the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's signature climate policy. Although he's recently softened some of his hate for electric vehicles -- "you know, because Elon endorsed me very strongly," he said in Georgia last month, referring to Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk -- he still believes only a "very small slice" of cars should run on electricity.
Mr. Trump's policies would devastate America's growing electric vehicle industry. They would allow China to consolidate its control of the world's electric vehicle and lithium-ion battery industries, and they would hamstring American -- or European or East Asian -- companies from developing the necessary expertise to compete with China.
For all of Mr. Trump's putative concerns about American manufacturing, his obsession with fossil fuels -- and the industry's financial hold on him -- has blinded him to what will drive industrial competitiveness in the future. America did not just happen to fall behind China in the years after he killed our climate policies. America has fallen behind China in large part because Mr. Trump killed our climate policies. With him once again in the Oval Office, America would be at risk of falling even further behind.
When Mr. Trump took office in 2017, American carmakers pushed him to roll back the Obama administration's strict tailpipe pollution rules that financially rewarded automakers that sold plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles.
But Mr. Trump wound up going so far in his rollbacks that some of the automakers blanched, either because the cuts went much further than executives expected or because they realized that the denuded standards would place their companies out of step with the global market. By 2019, a handful of automakers -- Ford, Volkswagen, Honda and BMW -- struck a deal with California to adopt slightly stricter rules. But other companies, including General Motors, did not reverse course on the rollback until after the 2020 election.
The dangers of this approach for American companies were clear at the time. When Mr. Trump took the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, many observers -- myself included -- warned that China would seize the opportunity to excel in the industries of the future, especially renewables. That became even more likely when Mr. Trump rolled back the rules on tailpipe emissions.
Mr. Trump's only answer to this risk was to impose tariffs on some Chinese-made renewables. But he did not provide the kind of robust spending or regulatory certainty that would have allowed American companies to compete with Chinese ones -- so China did, in fact, cement a lead in green tech during this period.
Today, China produces more than 80 percent of the world's solar panels, and it controls about six-tenths of the world's wind-power manufacturing capacity. Chinese companies make 75 percent of the world's lithium-ion batteries. The country also dominates the mining and refining of the minerals that go into renewables, electronics and batteries.
China achieved this commanding position by taking nearly the opposite approach that Mr. Trump did. Through the 2010s, the Chinese government used a combination of enormous subsidies, regulations and bureaucratic nudges to encourage the creation of a thriving electric vehicle industry. Chinese consumers got a rebate when they bought an electric vehicle, hydrogen car or plug-in hybrid. The government made it easier for them to get a license plate for a new-energy vehicle than a gas-burning car.
To be sure, China didn't foster the E.V. industry solely for environmental reasons. Unlike America, which has abundant oil and natural gas, China is relatively energy poor. Its standing as the world's largest oil importer is a profound national security problem, and China has sought to improve its position by embracing electric vehicles and fuel-efficient plug-in hybrids as well as building more coal plants, nuclear plants and solar and wind farms.
But the combination of Mr. Trump's apathy and China's investment means America is now rushing to catch up to China's lead in the solar, wind, battery and electric vehicle industries. It is an open question whether it can get there.
The Biden administration has been trying to help America in this race. The Inflation Reduction Act rewards companies that make electric vehicles and batteries, or refine certain critical minerals. The White House is reportedly considering creating a backstop for mineral prices to encourage their mining and refining. (China already employs a similar strategy in many sectors.) A potential Harris administration would most likely continue these initiatives.
But catching up will take time. Ford, despite a promising start, has failed to create an efficient or profitable electric vehicle division and recently delayed the launch of its new electric vehicle platform to 2027. G.M. has also struggled to get its electric vehicle unit off the ground. And the big, bloated cars on America's roads have created a profound safety crisis -- America's roads are, by one measure, more dangerous than Russia's in part because of our gargantuan gas-guzzling vehicles.
Can these failures be laid solely at Mr. Trump's feet? No. America's automakers, after all, resisted the electric vehicle transition for years. And the United States also faces some core challenges competing with China on E.V.s: Gasoline may be too cheap here relative to income, and consumers may be too wealthy, for the kind of rapid uptake of these cars we've seen in China.
But failing to build a competitive electric vehicle industry would present chronic trade and security concerns for the United States. Within the decade, electric vehicles will be just another type of car, and many countries will encourage people to switch to them. As such, American automakers' markets will continue to shrink.
More important, batteries are the kind of technology that will ripple across the economy and society, much like lasers, satellites and semiconductors. The military gear of the future -- autonomous ships, drone swarms and even short-haul airplanes -- will run on low-cost, energy-dense batteries. (Just look at Ukraine's success at using cheap, battery-powered drones to fight Russia's invasion to get a sense of how this could play out.) The United States and its allies must be able to spin up the rapid mass production of batteries in a crisis; the electric vehicle industry is how modern-day economies get good at making lots of batteries. Without an electric vehicle industry, without the ability to mass-produce batteries in an emergency, the United States will lose its status as an energy superpower.
It is possible to fall so far behind in an industry that a country cannot reasonably catch up. Europe, for all its wealth and education, has never developed a software industry to rival America's. Even America's fossil fuel industry -- for all its faults and societal costs -- leads the rest of the world in expertise and sheer technical skill. Nobody can frack like us.
But by the same token: Nobody can make a battery like China. The American economy will rely on batteries in the future, just as much -- if not more -- than it relies on fracking today. The United States is at risk of never learning to produce those batteries and falling ineluctably behind. A Trump victory would help cement that defeat.

G.M. and Hyundai Plan to Work Together on New Vehicles and Supply Chains: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: General Motors and the South Korean automaker say they will collaborate on new vehicles, buying parts and clean energy technologies.
General Motors and Hyundai said on Thursday that they would look for areas where they could collaborate on new vehicles, supply chains and technologies in a bid to cut costs and move faster.
The two automakers said they aimed to work together on internal combustion, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. But they did not provide details on where the joint work would be done, which executives would oversee the effort or how quickly they would come up with new models.
"G.M. and Hyundai have complementary strengths and talented teams," Mary T. Barra, G.M.'s chief executive, said in a statement. "Our goal is to unlock the scale and creativity of both companies to deliver even more competitive vehicles to customers faster and more efficiently."
The companies have signed a nonbinding agreement and said they would begin exploring possible areas of cooperation immediately.
Like other automakers, G.M. and Hyundai have invested tens of billions of dollars to develop electric vehicles that have so far fallen short of the lofty sales goals some executives had set. Consumer enthusiasm for battery-powered models has cooled in the past year, largely on concerns about the high prices of electric models and the challenges of charging them.
Sales of such cars and trucks are growing at a modest pace, though generally at a faster pace than for conventional gasoline vehicles. Many manufacturers, including Tesla, have cut prices to spur demand and are scrambling to reduce costs.
"This partnership will enable Hyundai Motor and G.M. to evaluate opportunities to enhance competitiveness in key markets and vehicle segments, as well as drive cost efficiencies and provide stronger customer value," Hyundai's group executive chair, Chung Eui-sun, said in a statement.
G.M. has been losing money on the electric models it makes but has said it expects those vehicles to become profitable by the end of the year. Ford Motor lost $ 2.5 billion on its electric vehicle business in the first half of this year, and has set up a development team in California to design models that are less costly to produce.
Automotive partnerships have had a mixed record of success, however. Several years ago, Ford invested in the electric vehicle start-up Rivian, but later decided to sell most of its shares. Ford also established a partnership with Volkswagen, but the companies have reduced their collaboration, and Volkswagen said this year that it would work with Rivian, mainly on software.
G.M. and Honda also formed a partnership to develop electric vehicles. Honda and its luxury brand, Acura, recently introduced two electric sport utility vehicles that are assembled at G.M. factories with G.M.'s battery technology. But the two companies have scrapped plans to work together on more models, and Honda has said it is solely developing its next slate of battery-powered models. Tesla has at different times worked with Toyota and Mercedes-Benz before shifting its strategy.

Then and Now Merged At MTV Video Awards: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Taylor Swift set a record and Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Katy Perry delivered noteworthy performances as the show struck a balance between past and present.
Wednesday night's MTV Video Music Awards marked the show's 40th anniversary, and much of the festivities strived for déjà vu by honoring memorable performances and moments from shows past. Montages of "V.M.A. flashbacks" like Michael Jackson heartily kissing Lisa Marie Presley, Madonna writhing through "Like a Virgin," and Eminem storming the building with a regiment of bleached look-alikes peppered the telecast.
This year's show paid homage to those events too, sometimes explicitly. Eminem, for instance, opened the show performing his latest single, "Houdini," alongside an army costumed to look like him, with dark beards underneath blond wigs that referenced the old days. The host Megan Thee Stallion donned an outfit that nodded to the silky green top Britney Spears wore in 2001 to perform "I'm a Slave 4 U," and sported a yellow boa constrictor to boot -- though Megan's genuine discomfort with the creature worked to comedic effect.
The V.M.A.s are forever looking to inaugurate new stars to take up the mantle of the classic music-video era icons. This year's class, including Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Tyla and Rauw Alejandro stood out amid the throwback references. Katy Perry bridged the gap between eras, and Taylor Swift did what she does best at award shows -- dance zealously to other artists and collect hardware. Here are the highlights.
Taylor Swift set a V.M.A. record and reminded viewers to vote.
The chants of "Tay-lor" turned UBS Arena, where the V.M.A.s were held, into a grand pep rally as Swift collected the award for Video of the Year alongside Post Malone, who was featured on "Fortnight." She has now bested Beyoncé for most awarded solo artist, with 30, though Swift did not use her speech to note the occasion. (Beyoncé has 25 awards for her solo work; 30 in total.) Rather, she thanked her collaborators and gave a special shout-out to one in particular. "This video seems very sad when you watch it but it was actually the most fun video to make," she said. "Something that I'll always remember is that when I would finish a take and I would say cut, I'd always just hear someone cheering." It was her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. "Everything this man touches turns to happiness and fun and magic."
She wrapped her speech with a reminder to register to vote in the upcoming presidential election, coming a day after she endorsed Kamala Harris. -- ROSS SCARANO
Katy Perry was at her campy, chart-topping best.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Katy Perry accepted her Video Vanguard award after running through a sterling medley of hits including "Teenage Dream," "I Kissed a Girl," and "Firework"-- and she did it on her period, as she announced to the audience, still sweating. While introducing Perry, her husband Orlando Bloom remarked on her particular sense of humor, a cartoonish kind of camp that left an indelible mark across 21st-century pop music. (Her whipped cream bra, worn in the 2010 video for "California Gurls," is a defining image of the era.) At her best, her singles were exuberant and unafraid to be silly ("Do you ever feel like a plastic bag?" -- do you? Have you?), and her Vanguard performance was Perry at her best.
Opening with enough wire work to fill a martial arts movie, Perry moved powerfully through her highlights, while also sprinkling in newer singles -- including "I'm His, He's Mine" with Doechii, scheduled for release Friday -- without ever letting the audience dwell on any of her missteps. Ahead of her upcoming album, Perry has taken a critical drubbing for appearing out of step with contemporary music. But she performed like her career depended on it Wednesday night, and in accepting the award, she pointedly reflected on her past, saying, "There are no decade-long accidents." She acknowledged her early days, citing a "repossessed Jetta" and the "bygone places" like Myspace and the Warped Tour that had given her a foothold in the industry. Then she plugged the Sept. 20 release date for her upcoming album, "143." She had earned the moment. -- SCARANO
Chappell Roan brought the fire -- and warmed hearts.

In her first V.M.A. performance, Chappell Roan channeled medieval marauding, performing "Good Luck, Babe!" in full body armor alongside dancing knights and in front of a castle that seemed set ablaze.
That's wasn't the only fiery moment. On the red carpet before the show, Roan responded to a photographer who appeared to have told her to "shut up," wedging an expletive in the directive as Roan was getting ready to pose for cameras. "You shut the [expletive] up," she retorted.
Later, she accepted the award for best new artist wearing a chain mail dress and dedicated the honor to the drag artists who inspire her, "queer and trans people that fuel pop" and "the gays who dedicate my songs to the people who they love or hate."
Roan, who hails from Willard, Missouri, ended the speech with a shout-out: "For all the queer kids watching right now in the Midwest, I see you, I understand you because I'm one of you. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't be exactly who you want to be," punctuating it with a final expletive. -- GONZALEZ
Sabrina Carpenter just had fun leaning into the moon man aesthetic.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Sabrina Carpenter, who performed at the award show for the second year in a row, embraced all things space and extraterrestrial, seemingly a nod to the moon man trophies awarded to winners.
She was introduced by Cyndi Lauper, who won the award for best female video for "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" at the first V.M.A. 40 years ago. Underscoring that enduring truism, Lauper praised Carpenter's use of the word "mother[expletive]," in her hit song "Please, Please, Please." Carpenter performed it in a mash-up with "Taste" and "Espresso," hits from her recent album "Short n' Sweet." Carpenter kissed an alien, danced with a moon man and led a group of astronauts through a choreographed dance in a set that was pure celestial play. And the inspiration seemingly paid off -- later in the night, she took home her first moon man when "Espresso" won song of the year. -- SHIVANI GONZALEZ
Tyla made a distinction.
No doubt the Video Music Awards had good intentions when the Afrobeats category was added in 2022, recognizing the global impact of African pop. Only one problem: Afrobeats isn't synonymous with African pop. It's the name of a particular beat from Nigeria, and it's as specific a term as reggae or samba. That called for diplomacy from the category's winner this year: Tyla, who had a worldwide hit with "Water."
Tyla is from South Africa; the beat of "Water" is amapiano, a South African style, not Afrobeats. She savored the award, saying it showed "African music can be pop music, too." But she went on to offer a gentle lesson. "This is just so special, but also bittersweet because I know there's a tendency to group all African artists under Afrobeats," she said. "It's a thing. And even though Afrobeats has run things and has opened so many doors for us, African music is so diverse. It's more than just Afrobeats. I come from South Africa, I represent Amapiano. I represent my culture." She smiled through it, but her point was clear. -- JON PARELES
LL Cool J is still hard as hell.
Hip-hop lovers may have worried that last year's celebration of the genre's 50th anniversary might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to honor the greats. LL Cool J's muscular set, featuring his Def Jam label mates Public Enemy, dispelled any such notion. LL Cool J made hit singles in three decades, including the mid-80s, when the genre was still considered a fad. Last week, he released his latest album "The Force" -- no dusty museum installation.
On Wednesday, he strutted through a medley that was confident, muscular, droll, proud, romantic and raunchy, while MTV had equipped the fans in the front rows with coordinated hats and signs fit for a political convention. -- SCARANO
Shawn Mendes returned to the stage with new music.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The last time Shawn Mendes was on the V.M.A. stage, it was 2021 and he was performing "Summer of Love" with Tainy. He'd last released an album, "Wonder," in 2020 but later postponed a 2022 tour to focus on his mental health.
Wednesday Mendes returned to the stage to perform an acoustic and stripped-down new single, "Nobody Knows," from his upcoming album "Shawn," expected to release in October. Fans on social media speculated that the song contained a reference to his ex-girlfriend and fellow V.M.A. performer, Camila Cabello. In the song, Mendes sings, "When the bottle is open, anything can happen/flying too close to the sun"; Cabello's Instagram bio reads, "long, thick black hair turned white from flying too close to the sun." -- GONZALEZ

Volkswagen, Looking to Cut Jobs, Is Planning to End Labor Agreement: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A week after the automaker announced it was considering closing factories in Germany, the company said it was exiting a labor contract that protected workers from layoffs.
Volkswagen told union leaders on Tuesday that it was ending a labor agreement that protected workers from layoffs, a week after the automaker said it was considering closing factories in Germany amid slumping sales and rising costs.
The company warned last week that it needed to restructure its namesake brand to remain competitive in the face of falling demand in Europe and abroad and increased competition from China. The cost-saving measures could include closing one or two assembly plants in Germany, a step that would be a first in the auto manufacturer's 87-year history.
On Tuesday, Volkswagen said in a statement that the decision to quit the agreement that offered job security to some 120,000 workers, along with several other labor deals, was necessary to ensure the company's future.
"We must put Volkswagen in a position to reduce costs in Germany to a competitive level in order to invest in new technologies and new products from our own resources," Gunnar Kilian, the head of human resources and labor at Volkswagen, said in the statement.
The job-security agreement between Volkswagen and the union, IG Metall, which represents workers in the automotive and other heavy industries, has existed since 1994. It had provided protection from layoffs through 2029, but the company would be able to severe it with three months' notice.
The agreement will remain in effect until the end of the year, and through guarantees provided by other labor agreements, layoffs could begin only by June 2025, Volkswagen said.
Daniela Cavallo, who leads the works council at Volkswagen and is a member of IG Metall, vowed that the union would fight to defend the labor agreement. "We will put up a fierce resistance to this historic attack on our jobs," Ms. Cavallo said in a statement. "With us, there will be no layoffs."
Volkswagen is seeking to save 10 billion euros by 2026 to reach its earnings target of 6.5 percent. But it is losing out to electric vehicle manufacturers in China and increasingly feeling the pressure at home as those automakers expand in Europe.
New companies, many of them Chinese, have taken a 6 percent bite out of the market in Western Europe in the past four years, "leading to a smaller pie with a battle royale situation for market share," Matthias Schmidt, an auto analyst in Berlin, wrote in a note.
Volkswagen said it was also ending other labor agreements, including one that obligated it to offer permanent positions to all vocational trainees and apprentices at the company, as well as a deal that offered temporary employees wages above the standard rate in the automotive industry.
The decision to quit the various agreements reflects how dire things are for Volkswagen, which has spent decades of building its brand around the image of superior quality linked to German engineering, said Helena Wisbert, a professor of automobile economics and director of the Center Automotive Research in Duisburg.
"Volkswagen operates in a very price-sensitive market, but has so far been able to charge a premium for its higher production costs in Germany as a 'Made in Germany' markup, since Volkswagen has always been associated with quality," Ms. Wisbert said. "This calculation no longer works because the markets are not developing as expected and competition has increased significantly."
Volkswagen and the union are expected to begin negotiations on a new wage deal this fall. The union is seeking a 7 percent pay increase, along with additional demands including averting plant closures.
But ending the job protection deal means that unless the two sides can reach a new agreement, employees hired before 2005 will be eligible for wages and benefits that applied 20 years ago, which the union estimates could run into the "millions" of dollars.
Such a situation would hurt the company's efforts to return to profitability, meaning that layoffs "could not be ruled out," Volkswagen said in a statement.
The Volkswagen Group employs some 650,000 people around the globe and owns 10 brands, include Porsche and Audi. Last week, the company informed union leaders at a plant in Brussels that it had no plans to continue production of its Q8 model there beyond 2025. If the company decides not to produce a new model at the plant, it will close and 3,000 jobs will be lost.

Northvolt To Cut Costs As Demand Falls in E.U.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Swedish battery manufacturer said it would eliminate jobs and seek partnerships as it grappled with competition from China.
Northvolt, a Swedish battery manufacturer, said it would cut jobs, seek partnerships and merge some operations as it tried to streamline its business in the face of declining demand for electric vehicles in Europe.
The restructuring will "regrettably include some difficult decisions on the size of our work force," Northvolt said in a statement on Monday, without specifying how many jobs would be affected.
The company, which has been seen as Europe's strongest competitor to Chinese battery manufacturers, also plans to pause production of cathode materials -- one of the basic building blocks of a battery -- at a factory in Skelleftea, Sweden, and focus instead on the company's gigafactory in the same location, it said. Northvolt also said it remained committed to planned factories in Germany and Canada.
"We are having to take some tough actions for the purpose of securing the foundations of Northvolt's operations to improve our financial stability and strengthen our operational performance," Peter Carlsson, a founder and the chief executive of the company, said in the statement.
Carmakers across Europe are struggling with slowing demand for electric vehicles and competition from China, which has begun flooding the market with affordable electric vehicles. Last week, Volkswagen, a leading shareholder in Northvolt, said it was considering closing factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history as it sought to regain competitiveness in the sluggish market.
China also dominates in the production of materials, like graphite and processed lithium, that are essential to the flow of electricity within a battery. Northvolt has invested tens of billions of dollars in lithium-ion battery production, but it has struggled to compete because of a combination of state subsidies and economies of scale that has benefited its rivals in China.
The company has faced a string of challenges this year, including accidents at a plant in Sweden and the loss of a contract with BMW worth two billion euros, or $ 2.15 billion, in June. The company reported a $ 1.2 billion annual loss in 2023, widening from a $ 285 million loss in the previous year.
Demand for battery-powered vehicles in Europe stagnated this year, growing only 1.3 percent in the first half of 2024, down from 14.6 percent in the previous year, according to the European Union.
"E.U. battery production capacities are running at 20 to 30 percent lower than in China," Thierry Breton, the European Union's internal market commissioner, told a group of industry leaders at a meeting in Brussels on Monday.

Volvo Delays Mission
To End Fuel-Based Cars
Sweden-based Volvo Cars has eased off on its pledge to stop selling cars with internal combustion motors by 2030, saying that the slow rollout of places to charge up and withdrawal of purchase incentives will leave room for a few cars that still need fossil fuels.
Volvo Cars, part of China's Geely Holding, now foresees a model lineup at the end of the decade that's at least 90 percent electric cars and has widened that to include both battery-only and plug-in hybrids that combine battery power with an internal combustion engine.
On top of that, up to 10 percent could be a "limited number" of mild hybrids, which mainly run on internal combustion and store electric power from braking in a 48-volt battery to assist acceleration and improve fuel economy.
The company said it was adjusting to "changing market conditions and customer demands."
"We are resolute in our belief that our future is electric," the chief executive, Jim Rowan, said in a statement on Wednesday. "However, it is clear that the transition to electrification will not be linear, and customers and markets are moving at different speeds of adoption."
The push into electric cars is driven by European limits on emissions that end sales of internal combustion cars by 2035, with a possible exception for those running on carbon-neutral fuels. The regulatory push is part of efforts to meet goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the 2015 Paris accords.
But the uptake of electric cars has hit headwinds. Germany suddenly dropped purchase subsidies at the start of this year, and construction of places to charge away from home have lagged. That pushes consumers toward internal combustion or hybrids that can make it home on the fuel-powered motor in case the battery gets low. Associated Press
LABOR
Tennessee G.M. Workers
To See Union Pay Raises
About 1,000 workers at a General Motors joint venture electric vehicle battery plant in Spring Hill, Tenn., will get big pay raises now that they have joined the United Auto Workers union.
G.M. and LG Energy Solution of Korea, which jointly run the plant, agreed to recognize the union after a majority of workers signed cards saying they wanted to join, the UAW said on Wednesday.
Both sides will bargain over local contract provisions, but worker pay and other details will fall under the UAW national contract negotiated last fall, the union said in a prepared statement. Starting pay which was $ 20 per hour will rise to a minimum of $ 27.72. Over three years, minimum production worker pay will rise to $ 30.88, the contract says.
The joint venture, Ultium Cells LLC, said in a release that the union recognition came after an independently certified process that ended Tuesday. "We believe this will support the continuity of operations, drive innovation, and enhance world-class manufacturing," it said.
Representation of the battery plant gives the U.A.W. another foothold in the southern states. Workers at a 4,300-employee Volkswagen assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., voted in April to join the union, and contract bargaining is expected to begin this month. Associated Press

Former Chief Of VW Faces Fraud Trial Over Testing: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Nine years after the carmaker admitted to concealing emissions on a massive scale, Martin Winterkorn will be tried in a German court.
Almost nine years after Volkswagen admitted that it had rigged millions of cars to cheat on emissions tests, the company's former chief executive went on trial Tuesday on charges stemming from the fraud, a vast corporate conspiracy that changed the auto industry.
Martin Winterkorn, 77, who led Volkswagen from 2007 until he resigned under pressure in September 2015, appeared at a court in Braunschweig, Germany, after a judge rejected his pleas to postpone the trial because he said he was in poor health. The trial will be a test of whether German authorities can hold top executives accountable for wrongdoing that cost Volkswagen tens of billions of dollars and contributed to poor air quality in Europe and the United States.
Mr. Winterkorn, who was once Germany's highest-paid executive, faces criminal charges including fraud, market manipulation and making false statements. Prosecutors accused him of failing to notify authorities and owners of Volkswagen cars when, in 2014, he became aware of software designed to illegally cloak emissions that exceeded limits imposed by European and U.S. regulators.
With Mr. Winterkorn's knowledge, prosecutors said, Volkswagen continued to sell such vehicles until the cheating was exposed by California regulators and the Environmental Protection Agency in 2015. Over a decade, Volkswagen and its Audi, Skoda and Seat units sold nine million cars with the illicit software.
Prosecutors have also accused Mr. Winterkorn of authorizing a recall of the affected vehicles in 2014 with the purpose of preventing regulators from learning about the forbidden software. And he is accused of lying under oath to a German parliamentary committee investigating the cheating.
The market manipulation charge arises from allegations that Mr. Winterkorn failed to notify Volkswagen shareholders of the financial risk posed by the software as required by securities law.
The trial started on Tuesday, with prosecutors reading all three indictments against Mr. Winterkorn, who arrived early wearing a dark blue suit. He looked tired as the charges were read, but his lead attorney, Felix Dörr, said Mr. Winterkorn was in good health.
The case illustrates how difficult and time-consuming it can be for prosecutors to hold high-ranking corporate managers accountable for illegal activity that takes place on their watch. Mr. Winterkorn, who was known for his authoritarian management style and short fuse, has insisted that he had no knowledge of the cheating, blaming underlings for the wrongdoing.
The trial comes at an inopportune time for Volkswagen, which faces profitability problems amid increasing pressure from Asian competitors. On Monday, the carmaker warned that it would consider closing factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history, ending a decades-old guarantee of job security for workers.
The wheels of justice moved exceptionally slowly in Mr. Winterkorn's case. The trial was postponed repeatedly while he received treatment for knee and hip problems. But the court in Braunschweig, a city near Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg, rejected his most recent pleas to delay the proceedings.
The charges carry a maximum of 10 years in prison, although it is unusual for German judges to impose long prison sentences for white-collar crimes. Rupert Stadler, the former chief executive of Volkswagen's Audi unit, received a suspended sentence last year after he pleaded guilty to charges related to the scandal.
The illegal software that Volkswagen used recognized when a diesel vehicle's emissions system was being tested and dialed up pollution controls to comply with regulations.
At other times, the cars spewed excessive quantities of toxic nitrogen oxides, which cause asthma and other respiratory problems. The engines' emissions systems were not capable of consistently operating within legal limits.
The scandal has had long-lasting effects on the auto industry. Volkswagen and other carmakers had, for years, marketed cars that ran on diesel as cleaner alternatives to gasoline cars. They argued that diesel cars had better fuel economy, and therefore emitted less greenhouse gases.
Few people listened to environmental activists who pointed out that pollution levels in European cities were much higher than they should have been if the technology was as clean as advertised.
Volkswagen's wrongdoing, which was initially uncovered by graduate students at West Virginia University working with a $ 70,000 grant, exposed the degree to which the auto industry had obscured the hazards of diesel.
Other automakers including Fiat Chrysler, now part of Stellantis, and Mercedes-Benz paid fines to settle accusations they had also illegally concealed emissions, though none was accused of doing so on the same scale as Volkswagen, the second-largest carmaker in the world after Toyota.
The scandal prompted European authorities to tighten air quality standards and encourage sales of electric vehicles, which have surpassed diesels in popularity. Diesels once accounted for more than 50 percent of new cars in Europe, but recently accounted for 13 percent.
In the United States, Volkswagen agreed to pay $ 15 billion to settle civil and criminal claims stemming from the scandal. That included fines, compensation to owners of diesel vehicles and a fund that local governments could tap to buy electric school buses or pay for other projects to reduce air pollution. As part of the settlement, Volkswagen funded the creation of Electrify America, which operates one of the largest electric car charging networks in the country today.
Testimony in German criminal trials does not always take place on consecutive days, and the proceedings can last years. Four lower-ranking Volkswagen executives have been jointly on trial in Braunschweig since 2021. That trial is expected to last until January.
Outside the courthouse on Tuesday, Matti Holtz, a Volkswagen factory worker and a father of two, stood with others while carrying a protest poster. Mr. Holtz, who owns a Volkswagen, said he wished punishment for Mr. Winterkorn, not only for the "fraud of the customers," but also because of the "intentional poisoning of people and nature."
The court has scheduled about 90 days of testimony in Mr. Winterkorn's case, which is expected to last until September 2025.

Volkswagen warned on Monday that it would consider closing factories in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history and end a decades-old guarantee of job security for workers, as it faces profitability problems amid increasing pressure from Asian competitors.
The company said in a statement that the measures were meant to shore up its namesake brand, but it declined to provide any details.
"In the current situation, even plant closures at vehicle production and component sites can no longer be ruled out without swift countermeasures," the company said. "The situation is extremely tense and cannot be resolved through simple cost-cutting measures."
IG Metall, the powerful union that represents German automotive workers, responded by saying it would fight any job cuts. It added that Volkswagen managers had told it that a cost-cutting plan announced last year was not working and that additional savings worth "billions" were needed. Volkswagen declined to confirm that number.
Last year, Volkswagen and worker representatives agreed to measures that would save the company 10 billion euros, or $ 11 billion, by 2026. But those plans, which included job cuts largely based on attrition, are no longer enough, the company said on Monday.
"The European automotive industry is in a very demanding and serious situation," Oliver Blume, chief executive of Volkswagen, said in a statement. "Germany in particular as a manufacturing location is falling further behind in terms of competitiveness. In this environment, we as a company must now act decisively."
The automaker owns 10 brands, including Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, but its flagship brand remains core to its identity and that of Germany's storied history as an automobile nation. But Volkswagen has faced falling sales, amid decreased demand in Europe, especially for its electric vehicles.
Volkswagen's share of the Chinese market, its largest market, has shrunk as fast-moving domestic rivals roll out affordable electric cars. Despite plans by the European Union to introduce tariffs on imports of electric cars from China, those competitors are starting to expand into Europe.
The German economy, Europe's largest, contracted in the months from April to June, shrinking 0.1 percent from a year earlier. The latest figures dampened hopes that the country might be pulling out of stagnation, which analysts say is driven by high energy and labor costs.
Shutdowns of Volkswagen's German factories would be a first for the company, which was founded in Wolfsburg in 1937. But closing plants, as well as ending the agreement that provides workers with job guarantees through 2029, will face stiff opposition from union leaders and workers' representatives, who hold half the seats on the company's supervisory board.
Daniela Cavallo, a union leader and the head of the council representing Volkswagen workers, blamed company management for failing to develop a competent strategy and instead seeking to save by cutting jobs.
"We will fiercely defend ourselves against this," Ms. Cavallo said in a statement. "There will be no plant closures with us."
Clashes with unions have cost several chief executives at Volkswagen their jobs. Already the unions are gearing up for wage negotiations that are set to begin this fall. Nearly half of Volkswagen's 650,000 workers around the globe are in Germany.
"The company -- and the VW brand -- are in a very dangerous situation," said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Gelsenkirchen, Germany.

Full text: The new tariffs announced by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will match levies imposed by President Biden and could further strain relations between Canada and China.
In a significant escalation of trade tensions between Western countries and China, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday that Canada would impose 100 percent tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, joining the United States and the European Union in protecting domestic car production.
The move aligns Canada's automotive policy with that of the United States, the market for the vast majority of Canadian-made vehicles where President Biden in May announced 100 percent tariffs on Chinese electric cars. And it also appears to be a form of insurance for the tens of billions of dollars in subsidies that Canadian governments have committed for the development of electric vehicle and battery factories being built in the country by Honda, Stellantis, Volkswagen, General Motors, LG and others.
In addition, Canada will also impose a new 25 percent tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum. The tariffs will most likely worsen the country's rocky relations with China and could raise the possibility of retaliation by the Chinese government against Canadian agricultural exports.
"I think we all know that China is not playing by the same rules," Mr. Trudeau told reporters on Monday in Halifax, Nova Scotia. "What is important about this is we're doing it in alignment and in parallel with other economies around the world."
Canada opened public consultations on the tariffs at the beginning of July. The 100 percent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles will go into effect on Oct. 1.
The new U.S. tariffs are expected to begin by the end of August. And the European Union has said that, at the end of October, it would impose additional tariffs of 9 percent to 36.3 percent on Chinese electric cars, depending on the manufacturer, beyond the standard 10 percent tariff it already levies on imported vehicles.
Twenty-five percent of federal subsidies for consumers to buy electric vehicles covered imports from China in 2023, according to government documents obtained by Automotive News Canada, an industry publication. A year earlier, just 2 percent of the subsidies went to Chinese-made cars, the government analysis said. Most of the Chinese-made vehicles being subsidized were Teslas produced in Shanghai.
The only zero-emission vehicle currently made in Canada is a General Motors delivery van.
Automotive manufacturing companies and Unifor, the union that represents autoworkers in Canada, have been pushing Mr. Trudeau's government to match the U.S. tariffs on Chinese electric cars and trucks. Those calls grew louder after a lobbying firm working for BYD, a leading Chinese electric vehicle maker, filed notice that it was working to sell passenger cars in Canada.
BYD, which has been expanding around the world, currently only sells electric buses in Canada and the United States. The company has been selling imported electric and hybrid cars in Mexico and other Latin American countries.
Some environmentalists oppose high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles and have urged the Canadian government to explore other ways to keep domestic manufacturers competitive. They argue that tariffs will slow the use of zero-emission vehicles by keeping prices relatively high.
"Canada made a decision today that will result in fewer affordable electric vehicles for Canadians, less competition and more climate pollution," Joanna Kyriazis, the director of public affairs at the clean energy policy research group Clean Energy Canada, said in a statement on Monday. She added that Canada should have followed Europe in opting for lower tariffs.
Mr. Trudeau came to office in 2015 promising to renew relations with China, which had soured under a previous Conservative government. Instead, they sank to a new low in 2018 after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive at the Chinese technology company Huawei, on an extradition request from the United States.
In what Canada characterized as hostage-taking, China then arrested two Canadians. Ms. Meng and the two Canadians were ultimately allowed to return to their home countries in 2021.
China also temporarily blocked imports of canola, an oil seed, from Canada. While the step was ostensibly taken because of insects in the grain, Canada viewed it as further retaliation.

Full text: José Mujica and Lucía Topolansky have long been married to one another -- and their leftist political cause.
He led a band of armed rebels. She was an expert in forging documents. They robbed banks, they staged prison breaks and they were in love.
It was the early 1970s, and José Mujica and Lucía Topolansky were members of a violent leftist guerrilla group, the Tupamaros. To them, their crimes were justified: They were fighting a repressive government that had taken over their small South American nation, Uruguay.
He was 37 and she was 27 when, during a clandestine operation, they first came together. "It was like a flash of lighting in the night," Mr. Mujica, now 89, recalled many years later of their first night together, hiding out on a mountainside.
Amid war, they found love. But just weeks later, they were thrown in prison, where they were subjected to torture and abuse. Over 13 years, they managed to exchange only a single letter. The guards confiscated the rest.
In 1985, Uruguay's dictatorship ended. They were released on the same day, and they quickly found one another.
It was a critical moment in their extraordinary love story. After more than a decade apart, their love was still alive -- and so was the shared cause that had first united them.
"The next day we started looking for a place to gather our companions. We had to start the political fight," Ms. Topolansky, 79, said in an interview in their home last week. "We didn't waste a minute. And we never stopped, because it's our vocation. It is the meaning of our life."
Over the following decades, Mr. Mujica and Ms. Topolansky became two of their nation's most significant political figures, helping transform Uruguay into one of the world's healthiest democracies, regularly lauded for the strength of its institutions and the civility of its politics.
They were both elected to Uruguay's Congress, and would drive to work together on the same moped.
In 2009, Mr. Mujica, known widely as Pepe, was elected president, capping a remarkable political journey. At his inauguration, as per tradition, he received the presidential sash from the senator who had received the most votes: Ms. Topolansky. She gave him a kiss, too.
In 2017, Ms. Topolansky was named Uruguay's vice president in a different leftist administration. At various moments, she was the country's acting president.
At the same time, away from the spotlight, they built a quiet life on a small chrysanthemum farm outside Uruguay's capital, Montevideo. Together they tended to their flowers and sold them at markets. They have often been spotted together in their sky blue 1987 Volkswagen Beetle or listening to tango at one of their favorite Montevideo bars.
They have said prison robbed them of their chance to have children. Instead, they have cared for countless dogs, including a three-legged mutt named Manuela who became famous for often accompanying Mr. Mujica while he was president.
They are not always romantics. In 2005, they had been living together for 20 years but were still unmarried. One night, Mr. Mujica did an interview on a national television show. "He told the journalist that we were going to get married. I was watching the show and that's how I found out," Ms. Topolansky recalled last week, laughing. "At this age, I just caved in."
They were married at a simple ceremony at home. That night, they went to a political rally.
"We united two utopias," Ms. Topolansky told a documentary filmmaker years ago. "The utopia of love, and the utopia of political struggle."
The details of their first encounter have remained vague. Ms. Topolansky said she had provided Mr. Mujica with falsified documents. Mr. Mujica has said Ms. Topolansky was part of a team that helped him and other Tupamaros escape from prison, and he first spotted her when he stuck his head up from a tunnel.
Ms. Topolansky said the details are hard to recall for a reason. "It's a lot like those war stories, where human relationships are distorted because of the context. You're fleeing, you can be arrested, they can kill you. So you don't have the regular boundaries of normal life," she said.
But it was also those difficult conditions that lit their fire. "When you live a clandestine life, affection is really important. You give up a lot. So when a relationship and love show up, you gain so much," she told the filmmaker several years ago.
Now they say they have entered one of their most difficult moments. In April, Mr. Mujica was diagnosed with a tumor in his esophagus. Radiation therapy has left him weak.
Last week, he sat in front a wood stove in the home they have shared for almost four decades, as Ms. Topolansky helped him put on an extra layer as the sun set. "Love has ages. When you're young, it's a bonfire. When you are an old man, it's a sweet habit," he said. "I'm alive because of her."

Steering Drill Rap's Sexy Swerve: [Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk]

Full text: Drill music hasn't always been this fun. The subgenre's ominous beats and menacing lyrics infiltrated mainstream hip-hop over a decade ago, but its ascendant stars have been stalled by violence, police surveillance and the flattening effect of at-home copycats. Cash Cobain, the 26-year-old breakout rapper and producer from the Bronx, is helping to raise its trajectory. With lusty rhymes and unorthodox samples, he's become a central figure of "sexy drill," a more lascivious offshoot, and one that has tilted the sound of rap nationally.
En route to a Coney Island performance in early August, sitting in the passenger seat of a new Mercedes sedan, Cobain rapped along to "Rump Punch," a song from his upcoming album, as it oozed through the speakers. In between doo-wop-esque lines of flattery for a paramour ("When it comes to pretty, you the pinnacle"), the track sandwiches a hilariously profane offer of oral sex between dreamy keys and a simple repeated drumstick clack.
When people hear his music, he explained, "everyone should feel that, feel like they can't control their body. Their body just gotta dance because the music is so sexy."
It's a sound that has caught the ears of the melodically inclined hornballs that constitute rap's upper reaches, perhaps best defined by the 2022 moment when Frank Ocean debuted a gold and diamond-studded sex toy for his jewelry line and used a Cobain track to soundtrack the introductory Instagram post. But the lusty stamp that counts most came when Lil Yachty passed along several Cobain beats to Drake, who barely tweaked one for "Calling for You," a single that reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the past year, Cobain has rapped on tracks he produced for PinkPantheress and Central Cee, Don Toliver and J. Cole.
By the time Cobain was set for a New York City victory lap, a show in April called Slizzy Fest, demand was such that police preemptively shut it down for overcrowding. (Fans got wind that Drake might attend.) Cobain led fans to Union Square and held an open-air show, rapping along to music boosted by a Bluetooth speaker. Born Cashmere Small (yes, his stage name nods to the late Nirvana frontman), Cobain is now on a national tour supporting Ice Spice, the reigning queen of "pop drill" and his collaborator on the remix of "Fisherrr," a single that has steadily crept East to West across airwaves since its release in February. The song and the tour are a conjoining of drill's sonic offspring, each taking the sound past its hyperlocal roots. His new album, "Play Cash Cobain," is set to arrive Friday with cover art by Drake, and it both trades in Cobain's usual tropes and offers a bunch of groovable swerves.
Amid a pop-rap landscape that writhes in bald sexuality, Cobain's sound is distinguished by a livelier energy and idiosyncratic choices. The drums don't appear until almost 40 seconds into the album's opener, "Slizzyhunchodon." Cobain swaps drill's minor-key darkness for major chords, layers in New Jersey club tempos and, most identifiably, whittles unexpected loops from well-chosen samples.
"Some songs you may not know where the hell the hook is at. The beat might not drop until the middle of the song," he said. "I'm just looking for, like, something different every time."
His unorthodox approach doesn't stop internet beatmakers from trying to emulate it. Start typing "Cash Cobain" into a search field and Google and YouTube will autofill "Cash Cobain-type beat." Video platforms are riddled with producers who've set '90s R&B loops to drill kicks, so much so that his signature tag, which you can hear on every song he produces, announces its legitimacy each time: "got this beat from Cash not from YouTube."
"It's the way he just goes about using a loop or a sample within his beat," said Don Toliver, the platinum-selling Houston rapper. He tapped Cobain's production and rapping for "Attitude," the second single from his 2023 album, which features a loop that samples Pharrell Williams singing the first and last "ohs" of the refrain to his 2018 single with Snoop Dogg, "Beautiful."
"It screams to me like, let's go, like it's time to go up," Toliver said of the track. "So I just wanted to match the energy from me as best as I possibly could."
Growing up among extended family in the Bronx and later in Queens, Cobain would hear everything from Willie Nelson to Japanese jazz to Billy Ocean, mostly played by a grandmother who majored in world studies in college. But his mother, Priscilla, who had Cobain at 17, steered into the likes of Patti LaBelle, Mary J. Blige, Jodeci and 50 Cent.
The grown-ups bought Baby Cash every cheap drum set and keyboard Toys "R" Us offered until he was old enough to search "beat making" on his grandmother's desktop computer. He eventually found the demo version of the audio program FL Studio and went on to downloading too-big files and several viruses.
"He would mess up so many computers, I would just rip the hard drives out," Priscilla said in a video interview. She held a pile of disks in an open palm, letting them slide through her manicured fingers before scooping up more. "He [expletive] them up and we let him."
At around 13, Cobain hit the limits of the free beat-making software ("I couldn't go back to it, edit it, nothing," he said) and decided he wanted to rap. To do so, he played to Priscilla's supportive inclination. Riding in her beat-up Volkswagen along Third Avenue in the Bronx, they listened to Lloyd Banks's "Beamer, Benz or Bentley," a staple of New York radio that could be endlessly looped to add guest verses. They half-jokingly added their own right there in the car, and Cobain told her they sounded good enough to record -- but first he'd need a microphone. She got him a $ 20 one from a local shop, but he eventually talked her into buying a $ 300 snowball mic from Guitar Center in 2011, a year before the Chicago rapper Chief Keef's "I Don't Like" became an early drill anthem.
By the time the genre permeated New York a few years later, police departments nationwide were connecting the music with gang activity described in its lyrics and by its performers on social media. Though drill artists like Pop Smoke, Fivio Foreign, Sheff G and others had begun to perform in Europe and on festival stages across the United States, the N.Y.P.D. removed them from local stages, citing public safety concerns.
Cobain had by then dived into drill beats, sparking some interest on SoundCloud, but it wasn't until the pandemic's forced isolation that he locked in with other New York artists looking to make the same kind of party music he was. "Everybody was in the crib and everybody was on Clubhouse," said Chow Lee, a frequent collaborator who described entire days wasted hanging on the social audio app talking with Lonny Love, Payroll and other artists who are now staples of the current scene.
When restrictions began to lift, they'd throw underground parties to showcase the early sexy drill that they'd been posting to SoundCloud and YouTube. "You can't really build a community around drill because you can't be outside performing," said Gabe P., the host of the internet rap show "On the Radar," which first showcased Cobain and Chow Lee in 2021.
He added, "These parties felt like safe spaces where you could have fun. There'll be girls there. The girls will be having fun, they feel safe and the artists feel safe. And I think they just created that environment."
Cobain's live shows extend the vibe. The sound system at the free show in Coney Island was shoddy, so the audience leaned in to fill in the lyrics of "Dunk Contest," which describe various sexual acts Cobain wants to perform on girls mentioned by name. They reach a tittering pitch when Marni, his sometime girlfriend ("She's my sweetheart. The Slizzy Princess"), waves as he sings, "I don't think that I should talk 'bout Marni." They repeat the dynamic two days later onstage at Terminal 5 for the New York stop of Ice Spice's "Y2K" tour to a raucous crowd that half-sings, half-squeals in response.
Before that Coney Island performance, Cobain killed time over a plate of chicken tacos. Surrounded by a couple of burly bodyguards, they all test out the arcade punching bag game once the tacos are done, and fans who happen upon them will flutter about taking selfies and broadcasting on Instagram live as they join his walk to the makeshift stage. It's a low-key flashback to the Union Square caravan and flies in the face of the concerns that had the police pulling his drill peers from stages just a few years earlier.
When Cobain is asked what it means to him to perform in his hometown, he raises his eyebrows above his black sunglasses.
"It means everything," he said. "I just know that I'm not rapping about killing nobody. I don't have nobody rapping about killing me, or at least I hope not. It feels amazing for real, because I know how New York can get."

Born Cashmere Small (yes, his stage name nods to the late Nirvana frontman), Cobain is now on a national tour supporting Ice Spice, the reigning queen of “pop drill” and his collaborator on the remix of “Fisherrr,” a single that has steadily crept East to West across airwaves since its release in February. The song and the tour are a conjoining of drill’s sonic offspring, each taking the sound past its hyperlocal roots. His new album, “Play Cash Cobain,” is set to arrive Friday with cover art by Drake, and it both trades in Cobain’s usual tropes and offers a bunch of groovable swerves.
Amid a pop-rap landscape that writhes in bald sexuality, Cobain’s sound is distinguished by a livelier energy and idiosyncratic choices. The drums don’t appear until almost 40 seconds into the album’s opener, “Slizzyhunchodon.” Cobain swaps drill’s minor-key darkness for major chords, layers in New Jersey club tempos and, most identifiably, whittles unexpected loops from well-chosen samples.
“Some songs you may not know where the hell the hook is at. The beat might not drop until the middle of the song,” he said. “I’m just looking for, like, something different every time.”
His unorthodox approach doesn’t stop internet beatmakers from trying to emulate it. Start typing “Cash Cobain” into a search field and Google and YouTube will autofill “Cash Cobain-type beat.” Video platforms are riddled with producers who’ve set ’90s R&B loops to drill kicks, so much so that his signature tag, which you can hear on every song he produces, announces its legitimacy each time: “got this beat from Cash not from YouTube.”
“It’s the way he just goes about using a loop or a sample within his beat,” said Don Toliver, the platinum-selling Houston rapper. He tapped Cobain’s production and rapping for “Attitude,” the second single from his 2023 album, which features a loop that samples Pharrell Williams singing the first and last “ohs” of the refrain to his 2018 single with Snoop Dogg, “Beautiful.”
“It screams to me like, let’s go, like it’s time to go up,” Toliver said of the track. “So I just wanted to match the energy from me as best as I possibly could.”
Growing up among extended family in the Bronx and later in Queens, Cobain would hear everything from Willie Nelson to Japanese jazz to Billy Ocean, mostly played by a grandmother who majored in world studies in college. But his mother, Priscilla, who had Cobain at 17, steered into the likes of Patti LaBelle, Mary J. Blige, Jodeci and 50 Cent.
The grown-ups bought Baby Cash every cheap drum set and keyboard Toys “R” Us offered until he was old enough to search “beat making” on his grandmother’s desktop computer. He eventually found the demo version of the audio program FL Studio and went on to downloading too-big files and several viruses.
“He would mess up so many computers, I would just rip the hard drives out,” Priscilla said in a video interview. She held a pile of disks in an open palm, letting them slide through her manicured fingers before scooping up more. “He [expletive] them up and we let him.”
Around age 13, Cobain hit the limits of the free beat-making software (“I couldn’t go back to it, edit it, nothing,” he said) and decided he wanted to rap. To do so, he played to Priscilla’s supportive inclination. Riding in her beat-up Volkswagen along Third Avenue in the Bronx, they listened to Lloyd Banks’ “Beamer, Benz or Bentley,” a staple of New York radio that could be endlessly looped to add guest verses. They half-jokingly added their own right there in the car, and Cobain told her they sounded good enough to record — but first he’d need a microphone. She got him a $20 one from a local shop, but he eventually talked her into buying a $300 snowball mic from Guitar Center in 2011, a year before the Chicago rapper Chief Keef’s “I Don’t Like” became an early drill anthem.
By the time the genre permeated New York a few years later, police departments nationwide were connecting the music with gang activity described in its lyrics and by its performers on social media. Though drill artists such as Pop Smoke, Fivio Foreign, Sheff G and others had begun to perform in Europe and on festival stages across the United States, the NYPD removed them from local stages, citing public safety concerns.
Cobain had by then dived into drill beats, sparking some interest on SoundCloud, but it wasn’t until the pandemic’s forced isolation that he locked in with other New York artists looking to make the same kind of party music he was. “Everybody was in the crib and everybody was on Clubhouse,” said Chow Lee, a frequent collaborator who described entire days wasted hanging on the social audio app talking with Lonny Love, Payroll and other artists who are now staples of the current scene.
When restrictions began to lift, they’d throw underground parties to showcase the early sexy drill that they’d been posting to SoundCloud and YouTube. “You can’t really build a community around drill because you can’t be outside performing,” said Gabe P., the host of the internet rap show “On the Radar,” which first showcased Cobain and Chow Lee in 2021.
He added, “These parties felt like safe spaces where you could have fun. There’ll be girls there. The girls will be having fun, they feel safe and the artists feel safe. And I think they just created that environment.”
Cobain’s live shows extend the vibe. The sound system at the free show in Coney Island was shoddy, so the audience leaned in to fill in the lyrics of “Dunk Contest,” which describe various sexual acts Cobain wants to perform on girls mentioned by name. They reach a tittering pitch when Marni, his sometime girlfriend (“She’s my sweetheart. The Slizzy Princess”), waves as he sings, “I don’t think that I should talk ’bout Marni.” They repeat the dynamic two days later onstage at Terminal 5 for the New York stop of Ice Spice’s “Y2K” tour to a raucous crowd that half-sings, half-squeals in response.
Before that Coney Island performance, Cobain killed time over a plate of chicken tacos. Surrounded by a couple of burly bodyguards, they all test out the arcade punching bag game once the tacos are done, and fans who happen upon them will flutter about taking selfies and broadcasting on Instagram live as they join his walk to the makeshift stage. It’s a low-key flashback to the Union Square caravan and flies in the face of the concerns that had the police pulling his drill peers from stages just a few years earlier.
When Cobain is asked what it means to him to perform in his hometown, he raises his eyebrows above his black sunglasses.
“It means everything,” he said. “I just know that I’m not rapping about killing nobody. I don’t have nobody rapping about killing me, or at least I hope not. It feels amazing for real, because I know how New York can get.”

Ford Cuts Back On Investment In Electric Fleet: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The automaker said it would invest less in battery-powered cars and scrap a planned electric three-row sport utility vehicle.
Ford Motor, which had once hoped to race ahead of other established automakers in electric vehicles, is again slowing the pace of its investments and new battery-powered models.
The automaker said on Wednesday that it would delay the introduction of a new large electric pickup truck by about 18 months, to 2027, and scrap a three-row electric sport utility vehicle.
The company is also reducing the amount of money it plans to spend on electric vehicles in an effort to stem multibillion-dollar losses on the technology, while adding plans to introduce a new electric delivery van in 2026. A new medium-size electric pickup is expected in 2027 as well, the company said.
"The competitive nature of the market is changing globally," Ford's chief financial officer, John Lawler, said in a conference call. "That means these vehicles need to be profitable, and if not, we will pivot and adjust and make those tough decisions."
Mr. Lawler said investments in electric vehicles would now account for about 30 percent of the company's capital budget, down from 40 percent. The company will take a charge of $ 400 million to account for the cost of manufacturing equipment it purchased for the production of the canceled electric S.U.V., and it may have up to $ 1.5 billion in additional expenses related to the project.
"This is certainly not great news in terms of Ford's progress on E.V.s," said Sam Abuelsamid, a principal research analyst at Guidehouse Insights, a research firm. "Clearly they have not yet come to grips with cost-reduced E.V.s and getting more affordable products on the market."
The rate of growth in electric vehicle sales has slowed significantly in the United States and Europe, prompting Tesla and other automakers to cut prices. Last month, Ford reported that its electric vehicle division had lost $ 2.5 billion in the first half of the year before certain expenses were taken into account. The company overall made $ 3.2 billion.
Nearly 600,000 electric cars and trucks were sold in the United States in the first six months of the year, an increase of 7 percent from a year earlier -- a significant slowdown. In 2023, sales increased 46 percent.
After initially showing enthusiasm for electric models, some consumers have shied away from such cars over the past year over concerns about higher prices and the challenges of charging them. Some of those reluctant buyers have turned to hybrid models, which use batteries, electric motors and gasoline engines, and sales of those vehicles have surged in recent months.
Other manufacturers are also running into difficulties. Volkswagen recently teamed up with Rivian, a start-up, in an effort to hasten development of electric models and reduce costs. Volkswagen's U.S. electric vehicle sales fell 28 percent in the first half of the year, to just under 12,000 vehicles.
Like Ford, General Motors has also slowed work on new battery plants and delayed the introduction of some electric models. G.M. has been losing money on its electric models but has said it expects them to become profitable by the end of this year.
Just a few years ago, Ford hoped to have the capacity to make as many as two million electric vehicles a year by 2026, a target it abandoned last year. The company sells three electric models in the United States: the F-150 Lightning pickup, the Mustang Mach-E S.U.V. and the E-Transit van.
Sales of the F-150 Lightning have fallen short of expectations, and Ford recently cut production of the vehicle to one shift per day from two.
The automaker has three battery plants under construction: one each in Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan. The Kentucky plant is scheduled to begin production next year, Ford said. The company has suspended construction of a fourth that had been planned for Kentucky. Ford said its Tennessee plant would supply battery packs for a new electric delivery van to be assembled at a plant in Ohio in 2026, and for a new large electric pickup truck that is still in development. The pickup will be built at a plant that is under construction at the same site as the Tennessee battery plant.
The medium-size pickup truck is the product of a separate team that Ford set up in California to develop more affordable electric vehicles.
Instead of building a large electric S.U.V., Ford plans to produce a hybrid model with three rows of seating.

Europe Proposes Reduced Tariffs for Tesla Vehicles Made in China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The European Commission plans to lower a proposed duty on the U.S. automaker's electric vehicles imported from China to 9 percent, less than that of its Chinese peers.
The European Union is proposing to charge Tesla an additional tariff of 9 percent on its vehicles imported from China while other automakers face rates as high as 36.3 percent, as part of efforts to protect European producers from unfair competition.
The updated tariffs, announced in Brussels on Tuesday, would represent a significant increase for major companies making electric vehicles in China and are meant to level the playing field with Chinese E.V. manufacturers, many of which enjoy subsidies from Beijing. Final tariffs will come on top of the existing 10 percent already charged for electric vehicles produced in China.
The European Union began investigating Chinese automakers in October. Officials said they lowered the rate for Tesla, down from a proposed 21 percent, because the company did not benefit from the same level of subsidies from the Chinese government as leading Chinese automakers. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The tariffs for Chinese automakers, which would go into effect for five years, all dropped slightly from an original proposal in June, ranging from 17 percent for China's largest producer of electric vehicles, BYD, to 36.3 percent for SAIC Motor, the state-owned maker of MG Motor. Geely Auto, the parent company of Volvo Car, faces a rate of 19.3 percent.
Companies that cooperated with the investigation, including the German automakers BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen, face tariffs of 21.3 percent for cars they produce in China. Unlike Tesla, which has its own independent production site in Shanghai, the German car companies are all involved in joint ventures with Chinese automakers. Because Volkswagen also has an entity with SAIC, some of its cars will be subject to the highest tariffs.
Compared with the 100 percent tariffs the Biden administration imposed on Chinese E.V.s in May, the European proposals reflect what experts say is a desire to maintain trade with China, while protecting domestic production. Since the initial tariffs were announced several Chinese automakers have announced plans to shift production to Europe.
Imported E.V.s from China have grown to more than 20 percent of the market share in Europe over the past three years, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. But E.V. sales slowed in the first half of 2024, growing by just 1 percent compared with the same time the previous year, according to Rho Motion, a research firm focused on batteries.
Negotiations between Beijing and Brussels over the tariffs are ongoing, and China could propose measures to avoid the tariffs, such as reducing state subsidies to Chinese automakers, though this move is unlikely.
Nevertheless, China claims the E.U. measures are protectionist. Earlier this month, Beijing lodged a complaint with the World Trade Organization over the proposed tariffs. In response to the European Union's announcement on Tuesday, China said it firmly opposed the approach that Brussels had taken, arguing that the competitiveness of Chinese-made electric vehicles came not from subsidies, but from scale and supply chain advantages.
The tariffs would "exacerbate trade tensions between China and the E.U., sending a profoundly negative signal to global cooperation and green development," the Chinese Chamber of Commerce said in a statement.
The initial tariffs announced reached as high as 38 percent for those automakers that had not cooperated with the investigation, including Tesla. But at the time, the commission noted that the American automaker, which produces its Model 3 in Shanghai for sale to Europe, may be eligible for an "individually calculated" rate. The lowered rate for Tesla came after the company had requested an investigation into the subsidies it received from the Chinese government.
Member states must vote on the new tariffs, which would take effect on Oct. 31.

Wally Amos Dies at 88; Turned Aunt's Recipe Into Famous Amos Cookies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With a background as a talent agent, his aunt's recipe and a winning personality, he built one of the world's best-known brands of baked goods.
Wally Amos, an indefatigable entrepreneur who in 1975 took a $ 25,000 loan from a few friends in Hollywood to start Famous Amos, one of the first brands to push high-quality cookies in its own stores and one of the world's best-known names in baked goods, died on Tuesday at his home in Honolulu. He was 88.
His children Shawn and Sarah Amos said the cause was complications of dementia.
At a time when flavorless, preservative-packed cookies were about the only thing available to consumers not blessed with a baker in the family, Mr. Amos's confections stood out. Derived from a recipe he had learned from his aunt, they used real ingredients, no coloring or chemicals added, and he kept them as close to handmade as possible, even as his company exploded into national distribution through the early 1980s.
What began with a single store in Los Angeles that made $ 300,000 in revenue its first year became by 1981 a $ 12 million company (about $ 42 million in today's currency), with dozens of Famous Amos stores across the country and packaged products sold in supermarkets and department stores like Bloomingdale's as well.
His cookies were small -- bite-size, for most mouths -- and came in three varieties: chocolate chip with peanut butter, chocolate chip with pecans, and butterscotch chips with pecan. All were handmade, at the store.
"You can't compare a machine-made cookie with a handmade cookie," Mr. Amos told MSNBC in 2007. "It's like comparing a Rolls-Royce with a Volkswagen."
The cookies were widely proclaimed delicious, but a big draw was Mr. Amos himself. An energetic, ever-smiling pitchman, known for his Panama hat and colorful Indian gauze shirts, he loved the hustle of building a brand, going on the road to promote it for weeks at a time. (Today both his hat and one of his shirts are held by the Smithsonian Institution.)
His first store, on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, became an attraction in itself. The opening day drew thousands, and he would frequently get the city to shut down the block out front for a street party, which he made sure was stocked with celebrities.
Mr. Amos, a former talent agent, treated his cookies like another client -- the door to the shop's kitchen had a star on it, just like an actor's trailer -- and he understood the importance of building a personal brand decades before it became practically a requirement.
Within a few years he was a household name across much of the United States, appearing on the cover of Time and as a guest on the TV sitcoms "The Jeffersons" and "Taxi." Much later, he would also appear on "The Office."
But, as was the case with many entrepreneurs, his passionate creativity was not matched by business acumen, and he struggled to keep up profits as the company expanded. He sold off equity stakes through the 1980s, and in 1988 he sold the remainder to a private equity firm, the Shansby Group, for $ 3 million (about $ 8 million today).
Mr. Amos stayed with the company for a year as a paid spokesman before leaving in frustration. By then he had developed a second career of sorts as an author and speaker, regaling readers and audiences with his rags-to-riches story and tips for entrepreneurial success.
He also became an advocate for childhood literacy. His mother had never learned to read, and neither had he until late in his childhood. He worked closely with the group Literacy Volunteers of America, and in 1987 he hosted his own public-access cable TV program, "Learn to Read."
Years later, after he had gotten back into the cookie trade with a small shop near his home in Honolulu, he set aside an adjacent room stocked with children's books. Every Saturday, he would take a seat in a rocking chair, surrounded by children, and read to them for hours.
Wallace Amos Jr. was born on July 1, 1936, in Tallahassee, Fla. His father worked for the local electric utility, and his mother, Ruby (Hall) Amos, was a domestic worker who later helped run Mr. Amos's first store.
After his parents divorced when he was 12, Wally moved to Harlem to live with his aunt, a baking wiz named Della Bryant. Entranced by her skill with an oven, he set his mind on a culinary career. He attended the Food Trades Vocational High School in Manhattan and got an apprenticeship in the kitchen at the fashionable Essex House hotel.
But after finding himself repeatedly passed over for promotion in favor of white students, he dropped out of school and joined the Air Force. He spent most of a four-year stint in Hawaii.
Mr. Amos then returned to New York, took secretarial classes and eventually went to work in the mailroom at the William Morris talent agency. By 1961 he had worked his way up to the title of junior agent -- the first Black person to hold that position at the agency and one of the first in the country.
In that job he arranged package tours for Motown acts, including Marvin Gaye and the Temptations. But again he found his career stymied by racism, and when the opportunity arose to move to Los Angeles to open his own agency, he took it.
For nearly a decade he scratched by, representing second-tier actors and musicians. To relieve stress, he found himself baking cookies at night, then sharing them at pitch meetings and film shoots.
Eventually, a friend suggested that he go into the baking business himself. With a $ 25,000 investment from Mr. Gaye, the singer Helen Reddy and a few others, he leased a building on Sunset Boulevard. Famous Amos was born.
Mr. Amos was always forthcoming about his struggles in growing his brand and about the decisions that led him to lose control of it.
"I'd lost the company really because I didn't use to listen to people a lot because I was Famous Amos," he told The Times in 1999. "The first couple of years after I left Famous Amos, I didn't even make cookies anymore, and I used to always make cookies at home. I didn't even want to talk about chocolate chip cookies, really. I shaved my beard and stopped wearing hats."
In 1991, he launched a new cookie venture, Wally Amos Presents, but the owners of Famous Amos sued him for trademark infringement. Frustrated, he changed the company name to Uncle Noname. After two years of litigation, they agreed that he could use the name Uncle Wally as long as he didn't sell cookies -- so he sold muffins instead.
The Uncle Wally brand was successful, if not quite the home run Famous Amos had been; it ended up appearing in some 5,000 retail outlets, though Mr. Amos eventually sold his portion.
He was married five times, most recently to Carol Williams, who survives him. Along with his son Shawn and his daughter Sarah, he is also survived by two other sons, Michael and Gregory; seven grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.
Mr. Amos developed more brands over the last two decades, including the Cookie Kahuna and Aunt Della's, but none caught fire. In 2016, he appeared on the business reality TV series "Shark Tank," offering a 20 percent stake in the Cookie Kahuna for $ 50,000 investment, but the panel of investors -- the "sharks" -- all passed.
Mr. Amos never seemed to mind that he had built and lost a famous brand. In the end, he was happy just making cookies.
"Being famous is highly -- very, very, very highly -- overrated," he told Honolulu magazine in 2014. "I am fortunate that, through all the tribulations, all the ups and downs that I've experienced, I still make a cookie that tastes good."

Full text: A copywriter, he and a partner in 1972 came up with "Try it, you'll like it" and "I can't believe I ate that whole thing." Soon, sales were, well, fizzing.
Howie Cohen, an advertising copywriter, often said he was congenitally familiar with indigestion. So perhaps it was only natural that in the 1970s, he, along with an ad agency colleague, would conjure up a catchy slogan that would not only sell more Alka-Seltzer but also become an American pop culture punchline: "I can't believe I ate the whole thing."
That bedside lament, spoken by the comedian and dialectician Milt Moss -- he actually said that thing on camera -- vaulted from a 30-second TV commercial to sweatshirts, supermarket windows and even church marquees.
It proved even more popular than "Try it, you'll like it," the first catchphrase for Alka-Seltzer that Mr. Cohen coined with his business partner, Bob Pasqualina, an art director at the Manhattan agency Wells Rich Greene.

Mr. Cohen, who helped popularize products and companies like Petco ("Where the pets go") and the fast-food chain Jack in the Box (exploding its clown mascot in a TV commercial in announcing a new, more sophisticated menu), died on March 2 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 81.
His death, which was not widely reported at the time, was announced on Facebook by his brother, Jerry, who said the cause was cancer.
Alka-Seltzer's creative advertising had already found success in the 1950s and '60s. It had introduced its mascot Speedy and its "plop, plop, fizz, fizz" jingle. It had brought "tummies" to television commercials. And it had played on cultural stereotypes ("that's a spicy meatball"), offending some viewers. But by the early 1970s, sales were lagging.
Mr. Cohen and Mr. Pasqualina, who had recently joined Wells Rich Greene, were tasked with creating a campaign that would run until the agency could come up with a long-term strategy to make Alka-Seltzer a household name again.
Mr. Cohen recalled in a 2019 memoir that those two popular ads, both of which the partners came up with in 1972, were inspired by his upbringing in the Pelham Parkway neighborhood of the East Bronx.
The "try it" tag line had its roots, he wrote, in his mother's dinnertime plea that he eat the liver and onions that regularly congealed untouched on his plate.
"We only had 30 seconds, so we couldn't get too complicated," Mr. Cohen told The New York Times in 1972. "One of us came up with 'Try it, you'll like it.' We said it over and over again, because we couldn't think of another line, and the repetition became the thing."
In the ad, Jack Aaron, a stage actor who had appeared in commercials, plays a man sitting in a restaurant recounting a meal he once had -- an indigestible one, it turned out -- at the encouragement of a waiter, who kept telling him, "Try it, you'll like it."
"I used to work part time as a waiter," Mr. Aaron told The Times in 1972. "Now I eat at Sardi's, and the waiters all say, 'Try it, you'll like it."'
If "try it" was inspired by Mr. Cohen's abstinence, the "whole thing" line resulted from his overindulgence. He, Mr. Pasqualina and a production crew were in London gorging on an Italian dinner hosted by the director Milos Forman, who had filmed a commercial the two admen had created for Diet Rite cola.
"I'm a nice Jewish kid from the Bronx, so I ate everything until I couldn't fit one more thing in my body," Mr. Cohen would often recall. "I leaned back in my chair and said, 'I can't believe I ate the whole thing.' And my wife said, 'There's your next Alka-Seltzer commercial."'
In the commercial, a woman, trying to fall back to sleep, urges her pajama-clad husband, who is sitting groaning on the edge of their bed, to take two Alka-Seltzer tablets to settle his stomach after overindulging. He repeats the "whole thing" line over and over.
Both ads are enshrined in the advertising industry's Clio Awards Hall of Fame.
A marketing survey found that about 85 percent of Americans could identify Alka-Seltzer through the "whole thing" slogan, which would later be immortalized in the game Trivial Pursuit and on the animated TV series "The Simpsons."
"They say the best lines come from the heart," Mr. Cohen wrote in 2019 in his book "I Can't Believe I Lived the Whole Thing: A Memoir From the Golden Age of Advertising." "'I can't believe I ate the whole thing' came from my stomach."'
Mary Wells Lawrence, one of the founders of Wells Rich Greene and Mr. Cohen's mentor, described Mr. Cohen and Mr. Pasqualina as "two of the most talented people we ever had."
Ms. Wells Lawrence, who died in May, wrote in her own memoir that earlier Alka-Seltzer ads had grabbed attention and entertained, but that "they were not as believable, as earnestly sincere and therefore not as persuasive as Howie and Bob's sweet, funny commercials -- especially 'I ate the whole thing."'
Howard Stephen Cohen was born on Sept. 25, 1942, in the Bronx to Samuel and Jeannette Cohen. The elder Mr. Cohen owned a steel fabrication company that he had inherited from his father.
Howie Cohen wrote in his memoir that he grew up in a one-bedroom apartment adjacent to an elevated train. When he was 13, he was given a tape recorder as a bar mitzvah gift and began producing commercials. After graduating from New Rochelle High School in Westchester County, he attended the University of Miami and earned a bachelor's degree in business from New York University.
Destined to inherit his father's company but eager not to, he applied to ad agencies and in 1965 landed a job as a copy trainee on the Volkswagen account at Doyle Dane Bernbach.
He joined Wells Rich Greene in 1967; left to start his own firm with Mr. Pasqualina; returned to Wells Rich Greene as a creative director; became the president of its Los Angeles office; and founded another agency with the adman Mark Johnson, which he sold in 1997 to the Phelps Group. He remained as partner and chief creative officer until he retired in 2017. He also wrote a blog called Mad Mensch.
In addition to his brother, his survivors include his wife, Carol (Trifari) Cohen, whom he married in 1972; two children, Jonathan and Johanna; a stepdaughter, Cristina; and a granddaughter.
In 2012, Mr. Cohen was asked by Google to reimagine the "I can't believe I ate the whole thing" ad for a 21st-century digital version.
"I look at the internet tools and technologies that we have and see exciting new ways to express an idea," he told The Los Angeles Times. "But emotions will always trump algorithms. Advertising is about connecting in a human way."

Rental Agencies Are Rethinking Electric Vehicles After Disastrous Resales: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Rental car firms are offering temporary deals on electric cars, which they are selling after they lost value more quickly than expected.
If you've been wanting to try an electric vehicle, renting can be an affordable option. But finding one may soon become much more difficult.
Electric vehicles have been financially disastrous for rental companies, especially Hertz, which in January scaled back plans to acquire 100,000 Teslas after the cars' resale values plunged much faster than the company had expected.
Hertz's experience had a chilling effect on its industry, and many rental car companies are now trying to sell off electric vehicles at deep discounts. And it may be a while before they start buying again.
Last year, more than 4 percent of the cars sold by manufacturers to rental companies were electric, according to S&P Global Mobility. So far this year, that number is just 1.4 percent.
In theory, renting an electric car is a great way for people to try and become comfortable with new types of vehicles like battery-powered cars that produce no tailpipe emissions. "The potential that rental companies can have in reshaping consumer behavior and helping to promote adoption is critical," said Stephanie Valdez-Streaty, the director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. "But there's a long way to go."
Ms. Valdez-Streaty said rental firms had recently been offering good deals on electric vehicles, but those were unlikely to last as the companies thinned their fleets of such cars.
Hertz and other rental car companies found that offering customers electric vehicles at a profit was more difficult than they had expected. Most rental car complexes at airports lacked chargers. Many renters were not prepared for how quickly electric cars accelerated, leading to more accidents and higher insurance premiums. And some companies found they couldn't get spare parts for such cars as quickly as they could for gasoline cars.
"They thought E.V.s would be more simple and straightforward and cheaper to maintain," said Karl Brauer, an executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, an online car search site. "They're finding that's not true."
In a statement, Hertz said it would "continue to offer our customers the widest possible choice of vehicle makes and models, including electric vehicles."
The biggest problem for the rental companies was the rapid depreciation of cars made by Tesla, the leading manufacturer of electric cars. The company, led by Elon Musk, sharply cut prices on new models last year to prop up sales. That pushed down the prices for used Teslas. A study released last month from iSeeCars.com found that used electric vehicles had lost value faster than the average used gas car had this year and, in May, cost less on average than used gasoline cars for the first time.
Resale values are a critical part of the financial calculus for rental companies because they generally sell cars before they accumulate too many miles. Rental car companies record losses when they sell cars for less than they expected to. In the first three months of the year, the diminished value of Hertz's electric fleet lowered its profit by $ 195 million.
Rental companies "are 100 percent dependent on residual values," said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity firm that invests in sustainable transportation. "It's just a very difficult business model."
James Iovino, who lives in Baldwin, N.Y., listed about nine electric vehicles on the car-sharing website Turo. But he got out of the business a month or so ago after E.V. prices dropped.
"I got burned for the same reason Hertz got hurt -- Elon Musk opens his mouth and the industry takes a dive," he said.
But some rental car companies say they are not dumping battery-powered cars because of the recent drop in prices.
Enterprise Mobility has several thousand electric vehicles available in the United States, Canada and Europe, and will add more depending on market demand, said Mike Wilmering, a spokesman for the company. Enterprise is also working on making more chargers available to its customers.
"We're looking beyond how many chargers are available and working to identify power needs and access -- both in our locations and the communities we serve," Mr. Wilmering said. "We want customers to have a great experience with E.V.s, and we're keeping them at the center of our long-term strategy."
Some people who have never driven an electric vehicle face a steep learning curve when they are given a battery-powered car. Rental companies typically do not have the staff to give customers a tutorial. Hertz, for example, offers information online for electric vehicle renters and sends them instructions by email.
Tom Moore and his wife rented a Tesla from a Hertz location in Portland, Ore., last year as a test run for buying an electric car.
His wife, who did the bulk of the driving, asked a Tesla-owning neighbor back home in Mountain View, Calif., for a lesson before their trip. It was a good idea -- the Hertz employees did not offer any instructions before handing over the key fob.
"They just said, 'This is your parking place,"' Mr. Moore said.
Hertz said it "learned a lot as a first mover in the E.V. rental market, and, as we align our fleet with consumer demand, we're focused on continuously enhancing the rental experience, which includes making it easy and rewarding for all customers."
Refueling has been another issue. Many rental companies expect customers to recharge electric vehicles to around 70 percent before returning them. That means customers must plan to stop at a charger near the end of their trips, which is not always easy to do when people are trying to catch flights and there aren't enough fast chargers near the rental car center.
Rental companies don't want to be responsible for charging because they like to get cars back on the road quickly. It can also be difficult for rental companies to install chargers at airports.
"Airports are notorious for being unfriendly for electric infrastructure development," said Raghu Iyengar, an executive at Volkswagen of America whose duties include sales to rental companies. Demand from rental companies for Volkswagen's ID.4 electric sport utility vehicle has been close to zero, he said.
People who rent Teslas have access to its Supercharger network, the largest fast-charging system in the United States. But most Superchargers work only with Tesla cars. People who rent cars made by automakers like Kia, General Motors or Polestar must use chargers offered by other operators, each with its own mobile phone app for payment. Renters also need to be aware that there are few or no fast chargers in many parts of the country, especially in rural areas.
But even in the heart of the technology industry, driving a rented electric car can be difficult.
Kerry Dietz, a retired architect who lives in Springfield, Mass., reserved the "manager's special" last year at Thrifty Car Rental, which belongs to Hertz, during a trip to Berkeley, Calif. She owned a Tesla at the time and was no stranger to electric driving. But Thrifty gave her a Polestar, a car designed in Sweden and manufactured in China that was not able to use Tesla's charging network.
"I spent the entire time we were there trying to find a place to charge -- a place to charge where stuff worked," Ms. Dietz said. "It was a really frustrating experience."
As electric vehicles become more popular, rental companies will have to figure out how to offer them, Mr. Iyengar of Volkswagen said. "There's going to be an electric tide that lifts all boats," he said, "and rental is going to follow that."

A Brand-New Electric Bus, No Charge. (That Was the First Problem.): [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The matter before the school board was straightforward. The tiny school district in Wymore, Neb., needed a new school bus to replace one so old and beat-up that it was used only to ferry the football team back and forth to the practice field a few blocks away.
The new bus would be larger than the old one, board members learned at the meeting 18 months ago, and also totally free, thanks to a federal grant. But the biggest difference: The new bus would be powered not by a diesel engine but by electricity.
The bus didn't stir up much discussion that first meeting, recalled Christopher Prososki, the superintendent, who's known around town as Dr. P.
"A free bus is a free bus," he said.
But this bus wasn't like the others.
Kids who rode it for the first time said it made a whirring sound like a U.F.O. Its driver said the hum reminded him of the Flying Car in The Jetsons. The school board president nicknamed it "the Biden bus," annoying the superintendent.
As the months passed in Wymore, a town of about 1,300 nestled in the plains, the electric bus became a surrogate for far bigger issues this quiet corner of the nation is facing. In conversations in the school boardroom, at the volunteer fire hall and at the American Legion bar, the bus exposed fears of an unwelcome future, one where wind turbines tower across the flatlands, power generated by Nebraska solar farms is sent out of state and electric cars strand drivers on lonesome gravel roads.
Changes like these were bound to cause new headaches or worse in this part of the country, upsetting a comfortable and familiar way of life, some residents said. "We'll fight it tooth and nail," said John Watts, who worries that an all-E.V. future would jeopardize his 40-acre salvage yard just outside town that specializes in parts for muscle cars.
I took a special interest in reaction to the new school bus because Wymore is my hometown, too: John Watts was my high school classmate. So was David Zimmerman, now a family farmer a few miles from town and president of the school board. When I called to ask him about the bus, he answered the phone like this:
"You're not going to tell me my cows are farting too much and polluting the atmosphere, are you?"
The railroad glory days
Most people whiz past Wymore on Highway 77 without stopping. There's not much reason to linger. Downtown streets are still paved in brick, as they've been for 100 years, but the gaps where businesses once stood -- the Grand Theatre, the Narrow Gage cafe -- give Main Street the look of a mouth that's missing a few teeth.
It wasn't always like this.
The railroads made Wymore. There were hotels and restaurants and residents who traveled about by electric tram. Champagne music maestro Lawrence Welk once performed at a dance pavilion on the outskirts of town. My grandparents had their first date, a screening of an early talkie, at one of the downtown movie theaters.
Even in a railroad town like Wymore, the car became king. Camaros kicked off parades. Old convertibles delivered homecoming queens to their kings. At his used car shop in the adjoining community of Blue Springs, Fuzz Morris towed Monte Carlos and El Caminos that went into ditches along country lanes.
By the 1970s and 1980s, when I was growing up there, the town was shriveling as trains were making their final runs and the old depot was burned down for a firefighting exercise. My friends and I still cruised the sleepy three-block main drag in mindless circles, my T-top Ford Mustang serving as disco, restaurant and clubhouse.
Back then, my classmate John Watts was driving his hot rod, a 1965 Chevy Impala SS, through town with quiet purpose, rarely stopping to chat and dreaming of the day he would run his own salvage yard.
David Zimmerman was there, too, an apple-cheeked football player also destined to build a future in Wymore. Today he runs a family farm just past the edge of town where he and his sons grow corn and soybeans and tend a herd of 103 cattle. His wife teases him for getting so attached to his animals that he sometimes keeps one or two from going to market.
He gives back to the community by serving on the school board, where he didn't exactly welcome Wymore's new electric bus.
Time for a new bus
School officials knew they needed to replace the oldest bus in their fleet of seven, a 1999 yellow monster that roared and had seen better days. But money was tight at Wymore's tiny Southern School District, which graduated 27 students this year.
Dr. Prososki, a former social studies teacher with boyish looks, a physique that gives off gym-coach vibes and a Ph.D. in education, offset his small budget by finding grants to fund everything from weight-room equipment to a program to teach welding. He switched the district's two school buildings to LED lighting and weatherized the windows, saving thousands of dollars on energy bills.
His method of getting things done: "Drown out the negativity."
A new diesel-powered bus was going to cost about $ 120,000. So when Dr. P heard from a bus dealer that Wymore, as a rural, low-income district, might qualify for a free alternative-energy bus, he was eager to learn more.
"I didn't know a whole lot about electric cars or buses," Dr. Prososki said. "This was outside my wheelhouse."
Through the Environmental Protection Agency, schools can apply for grants to replace older diesel-burning buses with ones powered by propane, natural gas or electricity, but must promise to destroy the old diesel engine. It's part of the Biden administration's efforts to fight climate change.
At the meeting in November 2022, six board members sat around a long table as Dr. Prososki told them that the district was getting an electric bus. Anticipating resistance, he ran through the benefits: Districts can save as much as $ 11,000 a year on maintenance, he said, quoting School Bus Fleet magazine. And the bus came with a 10-year warranty on the battery.
A vote wasn't necessary because the school district wasn't going to spend any money on the bus. So Dr. P moved down the evening's agenda, discussing things like new locks for the building and servicing the boilers.
Mr. Zimmerman remembers staying mostly quiet during that meeting. But his mind was firing.
He is a sixth-generation farmer, deeply familiar with the intricacies of a changing business. He closely tracks the latest farming techniques, so he'd already been reading up on alternative energy and the electrification of farm equipment. It didn't sound practical to him at all.
Farm vehicles like tractors and combines aren't built for speed; some are driven less than 10 miles an hour. Like most farmers, when he's done with work for the day, he leaves the giant machines parked in the field and instead zooms home for supper in his pickup.
The idea of slowly driving an electric tractor home, every single night, to recharge it, struck Mr. Zimmerman as outlandish. So did a lot of the conversation around alternative energy.
When he was a member of the county planning board, he had voted against building a wind farm near Wymore. (He was outvoted that day, but since then a new board has passed rules so strict that it's nearly impossible to build a wind farm in the county.)
He often thinks about his friend who hauls turbine blades across the nation in a huge, fossil-fuel-burning truck and wonders what will happen to all these turbines when they inevitably wear out. "What is our carbon footprint just getting all this going?" he said. "Who is going to dig up the cement and take the turbines in 35 years?"
"We're just kicking the can down the road," Mr. Zimmerman said. "We're going to spend trillions of dollars making our world better, and are we making it better or not?"
"And here's the problem with the bus," he said.
Mr. Zimmerman was thinking about our classmate, Mr. Watts, the salvage-yard owner, who buys old vehicles and strips them for parts. Bus shells make great storage sheds, and engines are of particular value, Mr. Watts said. "I can completely dismantle it and recycle everything."
But he doesn't have the means or expertise to do that with electric vehicles. Besides, the electric-bus grant required the destruction of the old bus engine, so Mr. Watts couldn't even make money on that. Instead, the old bus had to be taken to a special junkyard, 100 miles away, that could punch a hole through the engine block to make sure it could never be used again.
"My uncle Rex was an organ donor," Mr. Zimmerman said. "His heart is in somebody, his kidneys are in somebody. So, what do we do with this bus in 20 years?"
The federal government is trying to develop a cost-effective recycling industry for both wind turbines and E.V. batteries. In the meantime, supporters of alternative energy point out that, as the turbines spin and E.V.s drive down the road, at least they aren't burning fossil fuels.
In Wymore, Jim Zvolanek, another school board member at the time, welcomed the bus. He drives a Volkswagen ID.4, one of the town's only other electric vehicles.
A veteran of the Navy who studied electronics at a trade school, Mr. Zvolanek considers himself a tech nerd. "Am I a tree hugger? Probably not," he said. "But it's to the point now where the renewables are even cheaper than other forms of energy," he said.
While he was shopping for his own E.V., he recalled laughing when he came across historic pictures of an early design of a car that had a fake horse's head attached to the front. The purpose was to calm actual horses, but also to soothe human fears about the new technology.
"It ain't no different now than it's ever been," he said. "People don't like change."
Around town, some people teased him that his E.V. battery eventually would stop holding a charge, just like battery-powered hand tools do.
Some worried it would happen to the school bus, too.
Wires and fires and mud
Snide comments about the bus started popping up on social media. "Great until the battery dies and they are nowhere near a charging station, leaving kids stranded," someone wrote on a Facebook page for people from the area.
The comments were typical of Wymore, a place wed to its traditions. To this day, an old siren still blows to summon railroad workers to jobs, even though the tracks were dismantled years ago. Change has long been unwelcome. The front page of the Dec. 27, 1923, Weekly Wymorean featured a poem lamenting the end of horse-drawn transportation.
"O, horse, you are a wonderful thing; no button to push, no horn to honk; you start yourself, no clutch to slip, no spark to miss, no gears to strip," the poem began. "No gas bills climbing up each day, stealing the joy of life away."
Hearing residents' doubts about the bus, Mr. Zimmerman was growing more concerned.
He went to an annual conference of school-board members where an electric bus was on display. He peered underneath and was startled by what he saw.
"What are all these wires and cables and crap?" he said. "OK, so I know I'm Dumb Farmer Dave, but what happens when it goes down the road and gets salt all over it and goes through the mud and through the manure lots. It looked like a lot of exposed wires."
And over at the Wymore fire hall, a school maintenance worker who doubles as a volunteer firefighter told his colleagues about the electric bus. The assistant fire chief and mayor, Collin Meints, perked up. He started thinking about worst-case firefighting scenarios, with an electric bus full of children. He had heard that lithium battery fires are hard to put out. Would a bus battery be the same?
Another concern: the electricity itself. If rescuers had to cut into the bus to rescue someone, could they be electrocuted?
Blue Bird, the bus maker, marks high-voltage parts by painting them bright orange and provides free safety training on shock risks, which it says are low. And Mr. Meints did his own homework, studying up on special fire equipment specifically designed to put out battery fires.
Still, he said, it's "new enough that not everyone is 100 percent sure."
Last October, as children were preparing for a chilly night of trick-or-treating, the future rolled into Wymore in the form of a 2023 Blue Bird Vision electric bus. Dr. Prososki went to the school parking lot to take a look, and the school maintenance worker plugged it in.
Nothing happened.
The brand-new bus wouldn't charge.
He wound up having to ship it to Colorado for repairs. The fix took months.
While the district was waiting, winter arrived, and a cold snap left the diesel buses that were parked outside the school all night difficult to start. That problem made Mr. Zimmerman think of the new electric bus. Didn't he read somewhere that E.V. batteries can struggle in cold weather? The electric bus was supposed to go 120 miles per charge, but how would Nebraska winters affect that?
This past March, the new bus finally made its debut. School officials had already agreed on a way to allay everyone's concerns. It wouldn't drive beyond the edge of town.
Gavin Nielson, a band teacher, got behind the wheel to pilot that first morning route. "We were just flying by the seat of our pants," he said.
The bus was so quiet that Mr. Nielson could hear his metal straw rattle in its travel mug as he navigated the brick streets downtown. And when he pulled up to some bus stops, where were the kids?
It turned out that children had been accustomed to running outside when they heard the loud diesel engine come roaring down the street. The new bus was almost too quiet.
"I told parents that, hey, you're going to have to start looking because I don't like to honk. It's generally rude," he said.
The school year has ended. Today the electric Blue Bird is parked behind the high school gym, next to the diesel buses, at the front of the line.
Now that the bus has proved itself, Mr. Zimmerman said he was "optimistically cautious" about next year.
He and his wife talk about the bus sometimes when they sit on their porch at dusk. From there, they can see twinkling lights on the horizon of a wind farm just across the state line in Kansas.
"It's annoying," he said, "but you get used to it."

WYMORE, Neb. — The matter before the school board was straightforward. The tiny school district in Wymore, Nebraska, needed a new school bus to replace one so old and beat-up that it was used only to ferry the football team back and forth to the practice field a few blocks away.
The new bus would be larger than the old one, board members learned at the meeting 18 months ago, and totally free, thanks to a federal grant. But the biggest difference: The new bus would be powered not by a diesel engine but by electricity.
The bus didn’t stir up much discussion that first meeting, recalled Christopher Prososki, the superintendent, who’s known around town as Dr. P.
“A free bus is a free bus,” he said.
But this bus wasn’t like the others.
Kids who rode it for the first time said it made a whirring sound like a UFO. Its driver said the hum reminded him of the Flying Car in The Jetsons.
As the months passed in Wymore, a town of about 1,300 nestled in the plains, the electric bus became a surrogate for far bigger issues this quiet corner of the nation is facing. The bus exposed fears of an unwelcome future, one where wind turbines tower across the flatlands, power generated by Nebraska solar farms is sent out of state, and electric cars strand drivers on lonesome gravel roads.
Changes like these were bound to cause new headaches or worse in this part of the country, upsetting a comfortable and familiar way of life, some residents said. “We’ll fight it tooth and nail,” said John Watts, who worries that an all-EV future would jeopardize his 40-acre salvage yard just outside town that specializes in parts for muscle cars.
I took a special interest in reaction to the new school bus because Wymore is my hometown, too; Watts was my high school classmate. So was David Zimmerman, now a family farmer a few miles from town and president of the school board.
School officials knew they needed to replace the oldest bus in their fleet of seven, a 1999 yellow monster that roared and had seen better days. But money was tight at Wymore’s tiny Southern School District, which graduated 27 students this year.
Prososki, a former social studies teacher with a doctorate in education, offset his small budget by finding grants to fund everything from weight-room equipment to a program to teach welding.
A new diesel-powered bus was going to cost about $120,000. So when Dr. P heard from a bus dealer that Wymore, as a rural, low-income district, might qualify for a free alternative-energy bus, he was eager to learn more.
Through the Environmental Protection Agency, schools can apply for grants to replace older diesel-burning buses with ones powered by propane, natural gas or electricity, but must promise to destroy the old diesel engine.
At the meeting in November 2022, six board members sat around a long table as Prososki told them that the district was getting an electric bus. Anticipating resistance, he ran through the benefits: Districts can save as much as $11,000 a year on maintenance, he said, quoting School Bus Fleet magazine. And the bus came with a 10-year warranty on the battery.
A vote wasn’t necessary because the school district wasn’t going to spend any money on the bus. So Dr. P moved down the evening’s agenda.
Zimmerman remembers staying mostly quiet during that meeting. But his mind was firing.
He is a sixth-generation farmer, deeply familiar with the intricacies of a changing business. He closely tracks the latest farming techniques, so he’d already been reading up on alternative energy and the electrification of farm equipment. It didn’t sound practical to him at all.
Farm vehicles like tractors and combines aren’t built for speed; some are driven less than 10 mph. Like most farmers, when he’s done with work for the day, he leaves the giant machines parked in the field and instead zooms home for supper in his pickup.
The idea of slowly driving an electric tractor home every single night to recharge it struck Zimmerman as outlandish.
Zimmerman was also thinking about our classmate, Watts, who buys old vehicles and strips them for parts.
Bus shells make great storage sheds, and engines are of particular value, Watts said. “I can completely dismantle it and recycle everything.”
But he doesn’t have the means or expertise to do that with electric vehicles. Besides, the electric bus grant required the destruction of the old bus engine, so Watts couldn’t even make money on that.
“My uncle Rex was an organ donor,” Zimmerman said. “His heart is in somebody; his kidneys are in somebody. So what do we do with this bus in 20 years?”
The federal government is trying to develop a cost-effective recycling industry for both wind turbines and EV batteries. In the meantime, supporters of alternative energy point out that as the turbines spin and EVs drive down the road, at least they aren’t burning fossil fuels.
In Wymore, Jim Zvolanek, another school board member at the time, welcomed the bus. He drives a Volkswagen ID.4, one of the town’s only other electric vehicles.
While he was shopping for his own EV, he recalled laughing when he came across historic pictures of an early design of a car that had a fake horse’s head attached to the front. The purpose was to calm actual horses but also to soothe human fears about the new technology.
“It ain’t no different now than it’s ever been,” he said. “People don’t like change.”
Snide comments about the bus started popping up on social media. “Great until the battery dies and they are nowhere near a charging station, leaving kids stranded,” someone wrote on a Facebook page for people from the area.
Hearing residents’ doubts about the bus, Zimmerman was growing more concerned.
He went to an annual conference of school board members where an electric bus was on display. He peered underneath and was startled by what he saw.
“What are all these wires and cables and crap?” he said. “OK, so I know I’m Dumb Farmer Dave, but what happens when it goes down the road and gets salt all over it and goes through the mud and through the manure lots? It looked like a lot of exposed wires.”
Last October, the future rolled into Wymore in the form of a 2023 Blue Bird Vision electric bus. Prososki went to the school parking lot to take a look, and the school maintenance worker plugged it in.
Nothing happened.
The brand-new bus wouldn’t charge.
He wound up having to ship it to Colorado for repairs. The fix took months.
While the district was waiting, winter arrived, and a cold snap left the diesel buses that were parked outside the school all night difficult to start. That problem made Zimmerman think of the new electric bus. Didn’t he read somewhere that EV batteries can struggle in cold weather? The electric bus was supposed to go 120 miles per charge, but how would Nebraska winters affect that?
This past March, the new bus finally made its debut. School officials had already agreed on a way to allay everyone’s concerns. It wouldn’t drive beyond the edge of town.
Gavin Nielson, a band teacher, got behind the wheel to pilot that first morning route. When he pulled up to some bus stops, he wondered, where were the kids?
It turned out that children had been accustomed to running outside when they heard the loud diesel engine come roaring down the street. The new bus was almost too quiet.
“I told parents that, hey, you’re going to have to start looking because I don’t like to honk,” he said.
The school year has ended. Today the electric Blue Bird is parked behind the high school gym. And now that it has proved itself, Zimmerman said he was “optimistically cautious” about next year.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A court-appointed monitor said he was looking into allegations that a union official was punished for resisting actions that would have benefited the union president's partner and her sister.
A court-appointed monitor disclosed on Monday that he was investigating accusations that the president of the United Automobile Workers union retaliated against a vice president for resisting actions that would have benefited the president's domestic partner and her sister.
The monitor made the disclosure in a court filing seeking access to internal union documents as part of an investigation that began in February into potential financial misconduct.
Since then, the monitor and the union have clashed over how much access the monitor should have to union documents, and the pace at which the union has produced them. In Monday's filing, the monitor, Neil Barofsky, sought an order granting him extensive access.
The union declined to comment.
The monitor was appointed as part of a 2021 consent decree that ended a federal corruption case against the union. It concerned 11 top officials who were convicted of felonies, including two former U.A.W. presidents.
The U.A.W.'s current president, Shawn Fain, was an obscure union official before winning the top job in March 2023 on a platform of reforming the union, getting tough with large U.S. automakers and organizing nonunion companies.
Under Mr. Fain, the union waged a set of six-week-long strikes last year that won members substantial wage and benefit increases. The union then capitalized on the momentum of the strike by unionizing a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., this April -- the first foreign-owned plant in the South to be unionized -- before losing another high-profile election in May at two Mercedes plants in Alabama.
Mr. Barofsky's investigation initially looked into accusations involving Mr. Fain and the union's second-ranking official, its secretary-treasurer Margaret Mock.
A union official accused Ms. Mock of denying legitimate requests for money by members of the union's board. After the board voted to rein in her authority, Ms. Mock accused Mr. Fain of retaliating for her refusal to authorize inappropriate spending.
Mr. Barofsky's investigation has since expanded to include accusations that a regional director embezzled union funds, and the accusation involving Mr. Fain and his partner.
According to Monday's filing, Mr. Fain stripped a vice president of his authority to oversee the union's Stellantis department in late May, citing "dereliction of duty." After that, the monitor received complaints from other union officials that Mr. Fain had taken the action in retaliation for the vice president's refusal to go along with actions that would have benefited Mr. Fain's partner and her sister.
Much of the back and forth between the union and the monitor has focused on access to internal documents. Mr. Barofsky says the union has produced only a tiny fraction of the documents he requested by early April, more than a month into the investigation.
Thereafter, Mr. Barofsky proposed that the union expedite the process by searching its records for key terms and handing over any document that contained them. The union argued that the terms would require it to hand over more than 200,000 documents. The monitor then revised the terms in such a way that they would produce about 116,000 documents, of which he said the union has produced only about 70,000.
In a filing of its own last week, the union argued that Mr. Barofksy had made "a massively broad electronic search request that necessarily encompasses a significant amount of documents that are irrelevant to the investigation."
The union added that the search terms pulled in "the most highly sensitive privileged and collective bargaining strategy documents that the union holds" even when they had no bearing on the accusations.
The back and forth over the documents is not the first point of contention between the union and the monitor. Late last year, after the U.A.W. released a statement calling for a cease-fire in Gaza, Mr. Barofsky called Mr. Fain to discuss the union's statement in a personal capacity, according to a letter subsequently sent to Mr. Barofsky by a lawyer for the union.
In the letter, Benjamin Dictor, the union lawyer, said that Mr. Barofsky's call to Mr. Fain "on an issue so blatantly outside of the monitor's jurisdiction was inappropriate as your office holds disproportionate power over the U.A.W."
A spokesperson for Mr. Barofsky said: "This false account is offensive and an obvious attempt to distract attention from the most recent report. We have adhered to standard norms of a monitorship in referring complaints to union leadership."

E.U. Warns China: Brace For Tariffs: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The European Union took the next step toward collecting heavy tariffs on electric vehicles, ahead of a final decision in October.
The European Union took the next step on Thursday toward collecting new tariffs on Chinese electric cars, telling automakers to obtain guarantees from banks that they would be able to pay the taxes set to be made final in October.
The move was expected. The bloc had said on June 12 that it would impose additional tariffs of 17 to 38 percent on electric vehicles imported from China. An investigation by the European Union had found what officials in Brussels describe as unfair subsidies by the Chinese government for electric car manufacturers.
The Chinese government has denied that it subsidizes the industry. Beijing contends that low prices for electric cars made in China reflect vigorous competition and innovation instead.
The two sides began talks on June 22 to try to resolve the dispute. "We are continuing to engage intensively with China on a mutually acceptable solution," said Valdis Dombrovskis, the E.U. trade commissioner.
The imposition of provisional tariffs requires automakers to provide European countries with financial guarantees of eventual payment, although they do not need to send money yet.
The provisional tariffs vary considerably by automaker based on the European Union's estimates of the scale of each Chinese manufacturer's government subsidies. The highest tariffs are being imposed on manufacturers that disclosed little about their subsidies, including a tariff of 37.6 percent on SAIC Motor. Lower tariffs apply to BYD, at 17.4 percent, and Geely, at 19.9 percent.
Tariffs for the American electric vehicle company Tesla, which makes cars in Shanghai for the European market but is ramping up production in Germany, will be calculated individually and might be imposed in the fall.
Automakers will need to guarantee that they will be able to make payment for vehicles that arrive in the European Union starting Friday, for a period that runs through October. However, the bloc must still determine in the coming months if the subsidies for Chinese cars have caused significant harm in Europe's car market.
Worries are spreading among governments around the world that China is seeking to export its way out of economic difficulty as a housing market crash has made Chinese households less willing to spend. In May, President Biden quadrupled U.S. additional tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, to 100 percent.
Turkey imposed 40 percent additional tariffs last month on gasoline-powered and hybrid gasoline-electric cars imported from China. Turkey had already put additional tariffs last year on China's electric cars. On Tuesday, Canada began a trade investigation that could also lead to tariffs on electric cars from China.
Brazil is gradually raising tariffs on electric cars imported from any country starting this month, after a surge in imports from China early this year.
China has threatened to retaliate against the European Union. Its Ministry of Commerce said on June 17 that it had opened an investigation into whether pork from the European Union was being dumped in China at unfairly low prices. The case could result in tariffs on dozens of products, from pork chops to pickled pig intestines.
In January, the commerce ministry began a trade case against imports of Cognac and other European wine-based spirits that come mainly from France. The French government has been an early supporter of tariffs on electric cars from China.
China's car industry has suggested that the ministry impose tariffs on large gasoline-powered cars imported from the European Union if the bloc puts tariffs on electric cars. China has a 40 percent sales tax on cars and sport utility vehicles with very large gasoline engines, almost all of which are imported from North America or Europe.
China also has a basic tariff of 15 percent on imported cars. Europe has a basic tariff for cars of 10 percent and the United States has a 2.5 percent tariff. The various tariffs now being drafted or imposed are in addition to these basic tariffs.
China is returning to the playbook that it followed during its last big trade dispute with the European Union, in 2013 over China's shipments of solar panels to Europe at low prices. Back then, Beijing persuaded Germany to lead a coalition of E.U. member countries that blocked solar panel tariffs.
But it might be harder for China to stop the electric vehicle tariffs. Europe's solar industry was decimated a decade ago after the union rescinded its tariffs. Few in Europe want electric car production to suffer a similar fate.
The European Union has also tightened its rules for countries to overturn tariffs. China would need to win over a majority of member countries in a final vote in October, and those countries would have to represent at least 65 percent of the bloc's population.
Member countries will also hold a preliminary vote in two weeks on whether they support the provisional tariffs. But the vote is not binding on the European Commission, the bloc's executive body.
Chinese automakers are starting to build factories in Europe to meet demand and avoid tariffs, following a strategy pioneered by Japanese automakers to bypass trade restrictions in the United States. "It's just like what Toyota did in the 1980s," said John Zeng, an analyst at GlobalData Automotive.
But China has a glut of car factories at home, with the capacity to build twice as many cars as are sold in China, which is the world's largest car market.
The trade case has produced a split in Europe's car industry. German carmakers have opposed the tariffs. They face steeply declining sales in China as Chinese automakers have gained market share at their expense. So German carmakers are increasingly exporting from their factories in China, including to Europe.
But auto parts manufacturers in Europe have tended to favor the imposition of tariffs, as big automakers like Volkswagen increasingly assemble cars from parts made by Chinese companies.

Auto Sales Grow Slightly Despite Rates and Uncertainty: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: High interest rates, economic uncertainty and a cyberattack appear to have dampened sales in the three months through June.
Much of the auto industry, with the notable exception of Tesla, reported modest sales growth in the three months through June as high interest rates, high vehicle prices and uncertainty about the economy weighed on consumers.
Sales in late June were also slowed by disruptions at car dealers stemming from a cyberattack on a company that supplies software and data services to dealerships.
Cox Automotive, a market research firm, estimated on Tuesday that 4.1 million new cars and trucks were sold in the second quarter in the United States, up a little from the period in 2023. That's a marked slowdown from the year's first three months, when sales grew 5 percent. In the first six months of 2024, 7.9 million new vehicles were sold, an increase of 3 percent from the first half of last year, Cox said.
Slow growth is likely to continue through the end of the year, said Jonathan Smoke, Cox's chief economist. "The market is roiled by uncertainty," he said. "We probably can't quite keep the pace of sales of the first half, but we aren't expecting a collapse in sales."
Cox has forecast that 15.9 million new cars and trucks will be sold in the United States this year. That would be an increase from the 15.5 million sold last year, but still well below the 17 million vehicles sold annually before the pandemic.
General Motors said on Tuesday that it sold nearly 700,000 cars and light trucks in the United States in the second quarter, an increase of less than 1 percent from the period last year. The company said it was its best performance since the fourth quarter of 2020.
The quarterly total included nearly 22,000 electric vehicles, up 40 percent from a year earlier. Almost all were models that use G.M.'s more advanced Ultium battery technology. Its top-selling electric models were the Cadillac Lyriq, a luxury sport utility vehicle, and the Chevrolet Blazer, also an S.U.V.
G.M. said sales in the first six months of 2024 totaled 1.3 million vehicles, down slightly from the same period in 2023.
Toyota sold more than 621,000 vehicles in the second quarter in the United States, an increase of 9 percent from the year-ago period. In the first three months of the year, Toyota's sales rose 20 percent.
The Japanese automaker, the world's largest, is still getting a boost from hybrid and plug-in hybrid models, whose sales have picked up significantly as consumer interest in electric vehicles has tailed off. Toyota sold nearly 250,000 hybrid and electric models in the second quarter, a rise of 63 percent from the period in 2023.
Reflecting the softening demand for E.V.s, Tesla said its global sales fell 4.8 percent, to around 444,000, in the second quarter from the period a year ago. The company's sales have fallen for two consecutive quarters; they declined 8.5 percent in the first three months of the year from a year earlier.
Tesla does not report sales for the U.S. market. Cox estimated that Tesla's U.S. sales fell 16 percent in the second quarter, to 175,000 cars.
The company's global second-quarter sales were higher than analysts had expected, supported by price cuts in some markets and the company's offer of loans carrying an interest rate as low as 1 percent on the Model Y sport utility vehicle.
Tesla once had the market for electric cars almost all to itself, but it has faced growing competition from Chinese carmakers like BYD, Nio and SAIC. The Chinese brands undercut Tesla on price in their home market while offering features like dashboard screens that can be rotated by voice command.
BYD said on Monday that its second-quarter electric vehicle sales jumped 21 percent from a year earlier, and 40 percent when including plug-in hybrid cars.
In Europe, Tesla was in fifth place in April in electric car sales, according to Schmidt Automotive Research, behind Volkswagen; Geely Auto, which owns Volvo and Polestar; Stellantis, which owns Peugeot and Fiat; and BMW.
Tesla's market share for electric vehicles in the United States is expected to fall below 50 percent this year as G.M., Honda and other established carmakers offer models with newer designs than the Model Y and Model 3, which account for 95 percent of Tesla sales.
Stellantis -- the maker of Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep vehicles -- suffered a sales decline of 21 percent in the second quarter, to about 345,000 cars and trucks.
As a result, Stellantis slipped behind Honda and Hyundai-Kia in sales. Honda said its U.S. sales rose 3 percent in the second quarter, to more than 356,000 vehicles. Hyundai and Kia together sold 421,558 cars and trucks.
Ford Motor is expected to report sales figures on Wednesday.
Cox said the average price of new vehicles sold domestically in May was $ 48,389, near the record of about $ 50,000 set at the end of 2022.
High interest rates have also dampened demand. The average interest rate paid on new-vehicle loans in June was 10 percent, the highest in 24 years, Cox said.

Musk's Views May Push Some Tesla Buyers Away: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Tesla chief executive's polarizing statements have alienated some potential customers and may be partly responsible for a recent slump in sales.
Few auto executives are as closely identified with the companies they manage as Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, is. And probably none are more prolific in broadcasting their political views on social media.
But as Mr. Musk's public persona has become increasingly right wing, Tesla appears to be paying a price in sales, especially to liberal and left-leaning customers who are much more likely to buy battery-powered cars than conservatives are, according to analysts and many car owners who responded to a questionnaire on The New York Times's website about whether his behavior affected their views of Tesla.
His image as an erratic, impulsive manager appears to have rubbed off on the cars, raising doubts in some people's minds about their quality and helping to explain why Tesla sales have been falling. On Tuesday, the company reported that its global sales in the second quarter fell 4.8 percent from the same period a year earlier, after an 8.5 percent drop in the first three months of the year.
"Musk is a true lightning rod," said Ben Rose, the president of Battle Road Research, which has a generally positive view on Tesla's stock. "There are people who swear by him and people who swear at him. No question, some of his comments are a real turnoff for some people. For a subset, enough to buy another brand."
Tesla and a representative for the company's board did not respond to requests for comment.
Some of the more than 7,500 people who responded to The Times's questionnaire said they were offended by what they perceived as antisemitism from Mr. Musk, which he denies. Some were upset by the way Mr. Musk has managed Twitter, now called X, since he bought the company in 2022. He fired thousands of employees and removed guardrails on content shared on the social media platform. His increasingly friendly relations with former President Donald J. Trump and other conservative personalities were also cited as concerns. A vast majority of the readers who responded to the questionnaire were critical of Mr. Musk.
"You're basically driving around a giant red MAGA hat," said Aaron Shepherd, a product designer at Microsoft in Seattle who said he was planning to buy an electric Volkswagen ID.4 instead of a Tesla.
It is not possible to know what price Tesla has paid for Mr. Musk's political statements and activities. What is clear is that Tesla, once the dominant seller of electric vehicles worldwide, has lost market share in many countries for a variety of reasons. Chief among them is the company's reliance on the Model Y sport utility vehicle and the Model 3 sedan, which haven't been substantially updated in years, for almost all of its sales. Other companies are luring buyers by introducing new or updated cars more frequently.
In China, domestic carmakers like BYD have gained ground on Tesla by offering more affordable cars with technology features that appeal to Chinese consumers, like rotating screens. In Europe, BMW, Volkswagen and other local brands are doing well by offering more luxurious or cheaper cars than Tesla. And in the United States, Hyundai-Kia, Ford Motor and General Motors have increased sales by offering a growing selection of models.
Times readers who responded to the online questionnaire said they had been turned off by Mr. Musk's statements and by their experience with Tesla's cars and service operations -- the company sells and services cars directly, rather than through dealers.
"There's a time when I'd have given Musk an organ if he needed one," said Tim Yocum, an engineering director at a software company. But Mr. Yocum, who lives in Chicago, said that he had experienced problems with his Tesla Model S and that he had been unsatisfied with the company's repair and maintenance services. Mr. Musk's veer to the right has also upset him.
"Tesla is the only manufacturer in contemporary times that has unapologetically let its C.E.O. take a tiki torch to its good name," Mr. Yocum said. "This car will be the last Tesla I own."
Such comments help illuminate surveys that say Tesla's reputation has suffered recently. The company slipped to 63rd place in the 2024 Axios Harris Poll 100, which asked respondents about their views on corporate brands. In 2021, the company was in eighth place.
Mr. Musk has maintained that his public statements and persona don't affect Tesla's sales. "We make the best cars," he said at The Times's DealBook Summit in November. "Whether you hate me, like me or are indifferent, do you want the best car or not the best car?"
Mr. Musk still has plenty of passionate admirers. And some said the executive's public statements would not influence their decision to buy a Tesla. Many people gave him credit for pushing the auto industry to produce electric vehicles, a powerful tool to combat climate change.
"He has led a company that has successfully disrupted a corrupt, lazy car industry," said Julian Mehnle, a software engineer who lives in San Francisco. While no fan of Mr. Musk, Mr. Mehnle said, "I'm adult enough to separate these concerns from my choice of consumer products."
Robert Dean, an architect who lives in Redding, Conn., echoed those sentiments: "Musk is a gigantic, disruptive talent with a transformative and positive effect on the world we live in. He also is an oddball personality, but I'm not marrying him; I'm buying cars from a company he brilliantly leads."
Most of Tesla's shareholders remain largely supportive of Mr. Musk. Last month, investors endorsed a $ 45 billion compensation plan for him by a wide margin.
Yet car buyers whom The Times heard from and analysts said Mr. Musk's political activity had clearly hurt the company's reputation with left-leaning consumers. And there is little evidence that Mr. Musk's turn to the right has attracted more conservatives to buy Teslas. In fact, 77 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters said this year that they were not interested in battery-powered cars, up from 70 percent who said the same last year, according to the Pew Research Center.
"He might be winning some people who like his positions," said Greg Silverman, the global director of brand economics at Interbrand, a consulting firm that advises clients on marketing strategies. But, he added, the odds that Mr. Musk is attracting more customers rather than pushing them away "are very low."
Interbrand research indicates that a chief executive or other company representative who offends customers can reduce sales as much as 10 percent, Mr. Silverman said.
Some car owners' concerns went beyond Mr. Musk's political statements. They cited accusations of racial discrimination at Tesla factories, or the perception that he has allowed racist content to flourish on X. Tesla has denied that it tolerates discrimination at its factories.
"My mother was seriously debating buying a Tesla," said Achidi Ndifang, who works in information technology in Baltimore. "As a Black person, I felt like it would be an insult for my mother to drive a Tesla."
Derek Morf, a high school math teacher in Verona, N.J., reported feeling alarmed when Tesla removed the Disney Plus app from some dashboard screens late last year, apparently because Mr. Musk was angry at Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney.
Mr. Morf didn't care that much about the Disney app. But, he said, he found it unsettling "that the vehicle I purchased could have features changed in an instant simply because one man had that much control."
Such concerns could be a liability for Tesla as it pours resources into autonomous driving technology. Mr. Musk has promised to unveil a self-driving taxi on Aug. 8. The technology cannot succeed without trust from consumers.
Many Times readers pointed out that other car companies also had baggage. Volkswagen had an emissions scandal a few years ago. Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motor, held and spread antisemitic views. A decade ago, G.M. sold cars with faulty ignition switches that were blamed for more than 100 deaths.
Established car companies still sell gasoline cars that emit greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Tesla sells only electric cars.
But probably no other current auto executive has as loud a megaphone as Mr. Musk has, or is more willing to use it.
"If people think that the C.E.O.s of other companies are saints, they are a bit naïve in my opinion," said Jan Leys, a Tesla owner in Zurich. "They just don't have as big a mouth and/or platform as Elon Musk."

Full text: The amount Volkswagen said it planned to invest in the electric vehicle maker Rivian.
Volkswagen, the German car company, said this week that it would invest up to $ 5 billion in Rivian, the American electric vehicle manufacturer that makes electric pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and delivery vans.
The deal will help Rivian, which has never turned a quarterly profit, make more electric vehicles and help convince investors of its stability. It will provide Volkswagen with the software expertise that auto analysts say it sorely lacks. And it's a bet by Volkswagen, which could become a large shareholder of Rivian if regulators approve the deal, that Rivian will meet its promise of becoming "the next Tesla," something that has so far proved elusive.
Rivian, which was founded in 2009 as Mainstream Motors, had billions in investments by 2021, including from Amazon, BlackRock and Ford.
But as the case with many new electric vehicle companies, Rivian has also experienced hiccups in trying to ramp up to production, made harder by supply chain issues during the pandemic. In March, Rivian said it would pause construction of a $ 5 billion factory in Georgia to save money. (It already has a factory in Normal, Ill.)
In addition to giving Rivian access to Volkswagen's managerial expertise, the investment is also important for the company's financial health. The company loses tens of thousands of dollars for each vehicle it makes, and it reported losses of $ 5.4 billion in 2023, after losing $ 6.8 billion the previous year.
R.J. Scaringe, Rivian's founder and chief executive, said the investment would help the company make a new S.U.V. and finish construction of the factory in Georgia. But he also noted its importance to the company's bottom line.
"This is important for us financially," Mr. Scaringe said after the partnership was announced on Tuesday. As of Thursday evening, shares of Rivian were up about 40 percent since the investment was announced.

Markets Mostly Languid as Wall Street Hovers Near Highs: [Business/Financial Desk]

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/markets-mostly-languid-as-wall-street-hovers-near/docview/3072505707/se-2?accountid=26463

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A mostly subdued day of trading Wednesday left stock indexes on Wall Street close to the highs they set last week.
The S&P 500 index rose 0.2 percent after drifting between small gains and losses most of the day. About 65 percent of the stocks in the benchmark index fell.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished less than 0.1 percent higher, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.5 percent.
Several big stocks helped offset the broader decline in the S&P 500.
Amazon.com rose 3.9 percent, surpassing $ 2 trillion in market value for the first time. The rise in the e-commerce giant's stock market valuation comes a little more than a week after Nvidia hit $ 3 trillion and briefly became the most valuable company on Wall Street.
The Cheerios maker General Mills fell 4.6 percent after reporting that revenue for its most recent quarter decreased more sharply than analysts expected. The company has been dealing with lower sales volumes as consumers grow more cautious and price-conscious amid stubborn inflation.
Chipotle eked out a 0.3 percent gain on the first day of trading after its 50-for-1 stock split. It was previously among the most expensive stocks in the S&P 500.
FedEx helped offset the losses with a gain of 15.5 percent. The package carrier reported results for its latest quarter that easily beat forecasts.
Rivian soared 23.2 percent after Volkswagen said it would invest up to $ 5 billion in the struggling maker of electric vehicles.
Several big technology companies gained ground. Apple rose 2 percent and Microsoft gained 0.3 percent. Their large values tend to heavily influence the direction of the market.
The S&P 500 rose 8.60 points to 5,477.90. The Dow gained 15.64 points to 39,127.80, and the Nasdaq rose 87.50 points to 17,805.16.
Wall Street's big focus this week is on the government's latest inflation report Friday. The personal consumption expenditures index, or P.C.E., is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation.
"The market is basically just sort of idling, like a racecar that's waiting for the green light," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. "The light will turn Friday morning, when the P.C.E. numbers come out."
Wall Street expects the index will show that the rate of inflation eased to 2.6 percent in May, following a 2.7 percent reading in April.
The Fed is trying to tame inflation back to its 2 percent target, but the rate has been sticky. The P.C.E. has been hovering just below 3 percent for months. The better-known Consumer Price Index has hovered around 3 percent throughout 2024, though it was as high as 9.1 percent in the middle of 2022.
The latest updates on inflation could influence the central bank's decision on when to begin cutting interest rates, which remain at their highest level in more than 20 years.
"Noisy inflation data may be sufficient to keep policymakers cautious in their moves, but the global disinflationary process is well established," said Solita Marcelli and other analysts in a report from UBS. "Easing price pressures and other economic considerations should encourage central banks to start or continue cutting rates."
In the bond market, Treasury yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.32 percent from 4.25 percent late Tuesday. It's been mostly falling since topping 4.70 percent in late April, which has relaxed the pressure on the stock market.
Investors are hoping that the Federal Reserve will soon begin cutting interest rates. Wall Street is betting on a rate cut at the central bank's September meeting.
The economy has remained relatively strong, despite inflation and high borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Economic growth has been slowing, though, and consumers are shifting spending to necessities.

Volkswagen Will Invest In Rivian: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: VW and Rivian, a maker of electric trucks that has struggled to increase sales and break even, will work together on software and other technologies.
Volkswagen, the German automaker, said on Tuesday that it would invest up to $ 5 billion in Rivian, a maker of electric trucks that has struggled to turn a profit, and that the companies would cooperate on software for electric vehicles.
The deal creates an unusual alliance between the world's second-largest carmaker and an electric vehicle start-up that has strained to live up to investors' expectations that it would achieve the kind of success that made Tesla the world's most valuable automaker.
If successful, the partnership would address weaknesses at both companies. It would provide Volkswagen with the software expertise that auto analysts say it sorely lacks. And Rivian, in addition to cash, would benefit from the manufacturing expertise of an automaker that produces nearly 10 million vehicles a year, putting it just behind Toyota Motor in the global auto industry.
Volkswagen said it would initially invest $ 1 billion in Rivian, and over time increase that to as much as $ 5 billion. If regulators approve the transaction, Volkswagen could become a significant shareholder. The infusion represents a big vote of confidence in Rivian, which loses tens of thousands of dollars on each vehicle it sells.
Rivian's pickups and sport utility vehicles have received glowing reviews in the automotive press, but the company has struggled to ramp up manufacturing at its factory in Normal, Ill. In recent months, many investors have grown worried that the company may not survive long enough to become profitable.
R.J. Scaringe, Rivian's founder and chief executive, said the cash from Volkswagen would help Rivian launch a midsize S.U.V. called the R2 that will sell for about $ 45,000, and to complete a factory in Georgia. Rivian halted construction of the Georgia plant in March in an effort to save more than $ 2 billion.
"This is important for us financially," Mr. Scaringe said of the Volkswagen partnership on a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.
The cheapest vehicle Rivian currently sells, the R1T pickup, starts around $ 70,000, a price that has limited its sales to affluent early adopters. Its R1S S.U.V. starts at $ 75,000. Even at those prices, Rivian lost $ 39,000 for every vehicle it sold in the first three months of the year.
Rivian's stock jumped more than 50 percent in extended trading on Tuesday after the deal was announced.
The electric vehicle market has been divided between relatively young companies like Tesla and Rivian, which make only battery-powered cars, and established carmakers like Volkswagen, General Motors and Toyota, which have often struggled to master the new technology.
Except for Tesla, none of newer U.S. carmakers specializing in electric vehicles have won significant market share. Some, like Fisker and Lordstown Motors, have ceased production and filed for bankruptcy protection.
Auto analysts have long considered Rivian among the electric vehicle start-ups most likely to survive, in part because it has raised billions of dollars in investment. Amazon is one of its largest shareholders and the main customer for the company's delivery vans.
But Volkswagen and Rivian operate very differently, and it could be a challenge for them to work together. Volkswagen, which is based in Wolfsburg, Germany, is known for rigid, top-down management and is owned in part by the state of Lower Saxony. Rivian, based in Irvine, Calif., has the more freewheeling culture of a technology start-up. Rivian said in April that it expected to sell 57,000 vehicles this year, far fewer than Volkswagen sells in a week.
Mr. Scaringe and Oliver Blume, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said the deal blossomed after the two met at a Porsche customer center and bonded over their love of cars.
"We have a very similar mind-set," Mr. Blume said during the conference call.
Ford Motor was for a time a big shareholder in Rivian, and the two companies once said they would build S.U.V.s together. But that plan never came to fruition, and Ford sold most of its Rivian shares. Ford and Volkswagen have a separate partnership that includes joint development and production of electric vehicles.
The Volkswagen-Rivian alliance could encourage other established carmakers to consider investments or partnerships connecting them with start-ups like Lucid Motors -- companies that have well-regarded technology but are unprofitable and struggling to establish themselves in a crowded market. Another large automaker, Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Fiat and Peugeot, has invested in a Chinese company, Leapmotor, for access to its electric car technology.
Vehicles using the software developed by the new joint venture will go on sale during the second half of the decade, Volkswagen said. Any of Volkswagen's brands, which include Audi and Porsche, could use the technology, Mr. Blume said. Scout, the American off-road brand that Volkswagen is reviving at a factory under construction in South Carolina, could also use the software.
But Volkswagen and Rivian will continue to market their vehicles separately.

China and E.U. Attempt To Head Off a Trade War: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The economic minister of Germany, whose auto sector is enmeshed with China, met with Chinese officials as the E.U. moves to impose tariffs on electric cars.
With billions of dollars in trade at stake, China and the European Union have agreed to engage in talks to try to resolve an escalating dispute over tariffs.
China's commerce minister, Wang Wentao, and Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Union trade commissioner, will hold discussions on the European Union's plan for tariffs on electric cars from China, the Chinese commerce ministry said late Saturday.
Hours earlier, Robert Habeck, Germany's vice chancellor and economic minister, said that the European Union was willing to hold consultations, and he expressed a hope that tariffs could be avoided.
This month, the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, proposed tariffs of up to 38 percent on electric cars from China, atop an existing 10 percent tariff on imported cars. The commission said it found that China's electric car sector was heavily subsidized by the government and state-controlled banking system. China's exports of electric vehicles pose a growing challenge to Europe's automakers.
Mr. Habeck, speaking in Shanghai after meetings in Beijing, defended the tariffs. "These tariffs are not punitive," he said, adding that the tariffs are intended to offset subsidies that violate World Trade Organization rules.
It is unclear what a possible trade deal might look like. Executives at Volkswagen and other European automakers have called for Chinese manufacturers to build cars in Europe with European workers earning European wages, instead of importing cars from China.
But Chinese automakers have already built dozens of electric car factories in China with what the European Union describes as extensive subsidies, and are still building more factories.
Before agreeing late Saturday to talks, Mr. Wang, China's commerce minister, who had met with Mr. Habeck, accused the European Union of violating W.T.O. rules.
The National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planning agency, said in a statement that "China will take all measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies." It added that the tariffs were inconsistent with international efforts to address climate change.
The tariffs would put Germany in a tricky position. German automakers have extensive operations in China and worry that they will be hurt by retaliatory trade actions by Beijing.
On Saturday in Beijing, Mr. Habeck visited several Chinese economic ministries but did not meet with Premier Li Qiang, China's No. 2 official. Mr. Habeck then flew to Shanghai to hold a news conference and meet with German businesses leaders there. He declined to comment on why he had not met Mr. Li, who in some ways is his counterpart.
Mr. Habeck criticized China for supplying Russia with goods that have both civilian and military applications for its war on Ukraine. China's trade with Russia increased more than 40 percent last year, and half of the increase was related to these dual-use goods, he said.
"These are technical goods that can be used on the battlefield, and this has to stop," he said.
But the focus of Mr. Habeck's trip was the trade dispute. He visited a BMW research center in Shanghai on Sunday before heading to nearby Hangzhou, a tech hub.
World Trade Organization rules allow tariffs intended to offset the effects of subsidies. For its part, China denies that it improperly subsidizes its electric vehicle companies and says that its leading role in the industry worldwide is a result of efficient manufacturing and innovation.
Anticipating the tariffs, China's commerce ministry in January took the first steps toward imposing tariffs on imports of Cognac and other wine-based spirits, produced mainly by France, one of the countries that has led calls for tariffs on China's electric cars. On Monday, China's commerce ministry threatened to impose tariffs on pork imports from Europe.
And state-controlled media in China has reported in the past week that the Chinese auto industry is asking the commerce ministry to impose tariffs on imports of gasoline-powered cars from Europe, a move that would chiefly affect German automakers.
Mr. Wang, the commerce minister, called on Germany to help end the European Union's tariffs. "It is hoped that Germany will play an active role in the E.U. and promote the E.U. and China to move toward each other," the ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
China, the world's largest car market, has nearly halved its imports of German cars in the past five years as its domestic automakers have become increasingly competitive. China's car companies dominate the worldwide production of electric and plug-in hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles, which now nearly match sales of gasoline-powered cars in China.
But many of China's wealthiest customers still covet German brands. Mercedes sells more of its most luxurious cars, German-built Maybachs, in China than in the rest of the world combined.
German automakers also have joint ventures with Chinese companies to assemble cars in China. Volkswagen is making further large investments in manufacturing and engineering in China while beginning to cut staff in Germany.
Germany is crucial to China's efforts to stop the new European tariffs from being finalized this fall. That was also the case the last time that China and Europe engaged in a major trade dispute.
In 2013, under pressure from China, Germany rallied European governments to overturn proposed European Commission tariffs on solar panels from China. Chinese solar panel manufacturers quickly swamped Europe, and the European industry collapsed.
Leaders in Europe pushing for tariffs on China's electric vehicles argue that Europe's car industry now faces a similarly dire threat.
To block the tariffs, Beijing would need to persuade a majority of European Union countries, representing at least 65 percent of the bloc's population, to overrule the European Commission.
In its response to Europe's tariffs, China is expected to target key countries, analysts said.
Possible tariffs on gasoline-powered cars would hit Germany, the bloc's most populous country, with 19 percent of the union's people. Italy is third in population and it, too, exports luxury gasoline-powered vehicles to China -- Ferrari and Lamborghini sports cars.
France is Europe's second-most populous country, and China's potential Cognac tariffs are aimed at one of its national symbols.
Spain, the fourth-most populous country in Europe, is the leading European exporter of pork to China, a product Beijing has also threatened to penalize.
Beijing allowed German automakers, led by Volkswagen, to open car factories with Chinese manufacturers in the 1980s, bypassing China's 100 percent tariffs then on imported cars. China cut tariffs on imported cars to 25 percent in the years after it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, and in 2018 further reduced tariffs on most imported cars to 15 percent in a move to ease trade tensions with the United States during the Trump administration.
In addition to the 15 percent tariff, China also collects a 10 percent tax from buyers of gasoline-powered cars. Cars and sport utility vehicles with very large gasoline engines, which are mainly imported, pay an additional tax of 40 percent.

Full text: On a sunny Sunday afternoon at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, just days before Juneteenth, large crowds of people were lounging on brightly colored picnic blankets and under tents atop the hill, making them hard to miss.
With R&B and hip-hop filling the breezy air, this was just the early vibes of the Lay Out, a series of summer park gatherings that its creator says exists "to center Black joy." By 5 p.m., the park would be swelling with mostly Black attendees dancing and drinking together, playing games and enjoying one another's company for a day of rest.
"It's my favorite event of the summer: I'm a picnic girlie, and I just like all the Black people," said Toni Leotaud, 31, who lives in Brooklyn. "I know I'm going to see mad people that I know."
Now in its fifth year, the Lay Out has become one of the main attractions in Brooklyn each summer, especially its celebration of Juneteenth. (One of the events is always scheduled to take place around June 19, the national holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States.)
Emily Anadu, the event's chief executive and one of its founders, said the idea for the Lay Out came about in 2020, inspired by coronavirus pandemic restrictions and the protests that broke out that summer after the murder of George Floyd. One demonstration near her home in the Fort Greene neighborhood left a police van engulfed in flames. She woke up the next morning to help with cleanup around the park but was surprised by what she saw.
"I remember going out there, and it was like nothing had happened -- it was like Pleasantville," she said. "Everything was cleaned up, but someone swept the ashes into the words 'Black Lives Matter."'
Having lived in New York City for nearly 20 years and in Fort Greene for most of them, Ms. Anadu recalled how it was once normal to see an abundance of Black people. During the early months of the pandemic, as she spent hours walking through park, it became viscerally clear to her just how much the demographics had changed.
"It just felt uncomfortable to have this huge dichotomy between the extreme pain that people were feeling, like I am not safe in my body in this country," Ms. Anadu said, "and then for a lot of people experiencing time off from work and beautiful days in the park."
Days after the protest, Ms. Anadu set out to organize a park gathering where Black people could comfortably "take up space" in what had once been a mostly Black neighborhood. Over about three days of planning, she consulted with a few friends in a group chat about her idea, and through word of mouth and online promotion, the first Lay Out took place on Sunday, June 7, about a week after the protests.
She said more than 500 people had been at that first event, adding that it was a bit nerve-racking to have so many attendees, given the social-distancing guidelines. But the event was outside, Ms. Anadu reasoned, and the size of the crowd was a testament to just how much "we needed each other."
On Sunday, the Lay Out returned with different sponsored activities, including tennis workshops, mini basketball games, Black-owned businesses and a nearby after-party. We spoke with attendees about what had brought them to the park.
Toni Leotaud, 31, and Leigh Brant, 34
Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, and Hillside, N.J.
What is your favorite memorable moment at the Lay Out?
Leigh Brant: Last year, in the middle of a set, they started playing Keyshia Cole, and a circle formed around a man who was proposing. And everyone stood in a circle around them and was singing "Love." It was beautiful.
Daniel Jones, 34
Bushwick, Brooklyn
Is this how you usually spend your Juneteenth weekend?
Since they started doing it, yeah, every Juneteenth I'm here.
What keeps bringing you back?
Do you not see this? The culture, the music, the vibes -- they got food down there. It's just the energy is always on 10.
Fatou Ndiaye, 35
Lisbon
How long are you visiting for?
For a month. I knew June is a great month in New York -- there's so many stuff. And Juneteenth is during this month, too, so I really wanted to live it.
Brods
What brought you here today?
I'm actually here selling food. We're called Wadadli Jerk, and this is the fourth year we're doing this. We actually started when the Lay Out started during the pandemic.
What do you love most about it?
The beautiful people. It's just nice to see beautiful Black people enjoying themselves and just being who we are.
Iris Stevens, 32, and Sadé Council, 37
Harrison, N.J., and Flatbush, Brooklyn
What keeps bringing you back to this event?
Iris Stevens: I actually used to live in Brooklyn, and even though I'm back living in Jersey, there's just a certain vibe with everyone coming here together in the name of fun and joy. It's something that always draws me back.
What do you think is different about this event versus previous ones?
Sadé Council: It seems a little bit more organized in terms of space, and, like, we have a little bit of a gated area, which is lovely. But it's just the same good vibes as always. It feels like a family reunion. And it's just beautiful to come and celebrate my borough with my friends and seeing friends that I haven't seen in a long time.
Rony Byas Jr., 34
Bedford-Stuyvesant
What are you most looking forward to today?
Honestly? There's a joint that I got an eye on who I know is going to be here, so I'm going to shoot my shot.
What do you love about Juneteenth?
It's a holiday for Black people to get together and just be cool. July Fourth isn't really our day -- we weren't necessarily free, and I feel like this is Black people's July Fourth.
Quiana Parks
What has been your most memorable experience spinning here?
The first year I D.J.ed here. It was right after the protest -- I had just returned back to New York from Virginia, and I asked Emily if I could bring music to the Lay Out, and it was my favorite moment when I played "Ease on Down" from "The Wiz" and I'm on top of the hill, and I saw all these beautiful Black people running up the hill. I was in tears because it was so liberating. I was anxious because I had just got back to Brooklyn and I hadn't yet settled spiritually yet. And that moment just opened me back up.
West Foster, 24; Devine Bauman, 23; and Jetta Strayhorn, 21
Central Harlem
What does community mean to you?
Jetta Strayhorn: I'm from Atlanta, so community specifically for Black people has always meant a lot to me. Community specifically is a group of people that will be there for each other no matter what and can make you feel like every part of you is accepted, and thankfully, I found my people.
What are you post looking forward to for this Lay Out?
West Foster: I'm looking forward to community, connection and diasporic reconnection.
Fareed Abdullah, 41
Harlem
Is this your first time at the Lay Out?
It is my first time at the Lay Out. One of my good friends kept on saying how much of an amazing experience it would be. And I figured while I'm here in the U.S., got to come and enjoy it. In a couple of weeks, I'll be moving to the Emirates.
What are you most enjoying so far?
Honestly, the spirit of community. Everybody's nice. It's good for my goddaughter to be here to see beautiful people doing amazing things. The vibe is very friendly. The park is giving life. Ellie's here showing out. I'm just loving the environment.
Alexyz Kemp, 42
Clinton Hill, Brooklyn
What makes the Lay Out so special for you?
It's the blackest my neighborhood looks, but also I run into old friends and I get to see future generations and how they're hanging out, seeing how they're trying to make their voice heard and impact the community.
What does Juneteenth mean to you?
Juneteenth to me means freedom and respecting and acknowledging the ancestors that came before us. And it means communication. It means tap your neighbor and say, "Hey neighbor, we're free." Just the fact that we still uphold each other, uplift each other and we're still out here fighting for those freedoms today.

Facing Tariffs on Its Electric Cars, China Threatens Pork Imports From Europe: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Acting quickly after the European Union imposed extra tariffs of up to 38 percent on China's electric cars, Beijing opened a trade case on Europe's pork.
China on Monday threatened to impose tariffs on pork imports from Europe, in what appeared to be retaliation for the European Union's decision last week to impose preliminary tariffs on electric cars imported from China.
China's Ministry of Commerce announced that it had opened an investigation into whether pork from the European Union was being dumped in China at unfairly low prices. The case could result in tariffs on dozens of products, from pork chops to pickled pig intestines.
The ministry said it was acting in response to an application from the China Animal Agriculture Association, a government-affiliated group, and released a copy of the request. The association accused the European pork industry of benefiting from inappropriate government subsidies as it suffered from overcapacity -- the same accusations that European and American officials have leveled against China's car industry.
Olof Gill, a spokesman for the European Commission, said in a statement that the European Union's executive arm was analyzing China's action and would "follow the proceeding very closely in coordination with E.U. industry and member states, and intervene as appropriate to ensure that the investigation fully complies with relevant" World Trade Organization rules.
The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, a business group, said in a statement that China's action was not a surprise after the European Union's recent electric vehicle tariffs. The chamber added that it "encourages both sides to take action to depoliticize the business environment and find ways to address the underlying causes."
The E.V. tariffs have been a divisive issue in Europe. Labor unions and European auto parts producers have been worried about job losses as China's electric car exports to the continent rise quickly. But European automakers like Volkswagen have been expanding electric car production in China and shifting their purchasing from Europe to low-cost Chinese suppliers. They have been wary that trade frictions may prompt China to target imports of luxury cars from Europe next.
By choosing pork imports as the apparent payback for the electric vehicle tariffs, China is turning to a playbook it followed during its last major trade fight with the European Union over a decade ago.
In 2013, the European Union moved to impose 11.8 percent tariffs on solar panels from China. China responded by threatening tariffs on wine from Europe and then launched a successful campaign to persuade national governments in Europe to force E.U. leaders in Brussels to back down.
Farmers are a potent political lobby in Europe who have been looking for ways to increase sales to China. Experts in China's trade policy said Beijing might be hoping to pressure the European Union to back down again.
In addition to the pork trade case, the Ministry of Commerce already began in January a case against imports of Cognac and other European wine-based spirits that come mainly from France. The French government has been an early supporter of tariffs on electric cars from China, following allegations that China has heavily subsidized the industry.
It's not clear China will succeed in stopping the European Union's electric vehicle tariffs. Chinese imports of solar panels decimated Europe's solar panel manufacturing industry after the union rescinded its tariffs. European governments are still looking for ways to revive the industry. Few in Europe want electric car production to suffer a similar fate.
China also has a huge overall trade surplus with Europe. In recent months, China has sent four shipping containers' worth of exports to Europe for each container of imports that comes the other way.
For China's part, tariffs on pork could help protect an important industry from international competition. Pork prices fell 14 percent last year, as the country's pig farmers expanded their herds. Prices have begun to recover in the past month but are still half of what they were three to five years ago, when an epidemic of African swine fever killed much of China's herd.
China is by far the world's largest market for pork, a dietary staple. Average consumption per person in some provinces, like Hunan, reaches nearly a quarter-pound of pork a day.
China has yet to retaliate over the Biden administration's decision in early May to raise American tariffs on electric cars, lithium batteries and other products from China. China has criticized the U.S. tariffs, but has refrained from the rapid escalation in retaliatory tariffs that it pursued during the Trump administration. That approach in 2018 and 2019 ended up backfiring for Beijing. The Trump administration quickly broadened its tariffs, many of which have stayed in place ever since.
Beijing imports fairly little from the United States after years of government-led efforts to reduce dependence on imports, so it has had limited options for broad retaliation.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The world's largest experiment in driverless cars is underway on the busy streets of Wuhan, a city in central China with 11 million people, 4.5 million cars, eight-lane expressways and towering bridges over the muddy waters of the Yangtze River.
A fleet of 500 taxis navigated by computers, often with no safety drivers in them for backup, buzz around. The company that operates them, the tech giant Baidu, said last month that it would add a further 1,000 of the so-called robot taxis in Wuhan.
Across China, 16 or more cities have allowed companies to test driverless vehicles on public roads, and at least 19 Chinese automakers and their suppliers are competing to establish global leadership in the field. No other country is moving as aggressively.
The government is providing the companies significant help. In addition to cities designating on-road testing areas for robot taxis, censors are limiting online discussion of safety incidents and crashes to restrain public fears about the nascent technology.
Surveys by J.D. Power, an automotive consulting firm, found that Chinese drivers are more willing than Americans to trust computers to guide their cars.
"I think there's no need to worry too much about safety -- it must have passed safety approval," said Zhang Ming, the owner of a small grocery store near Wuhan's Qingchuan Pavilion, where many Baidu robot taxis stop.
Another reason for China's lead in the development of driverless cars is its strict and ever-tightening control of data. Chinese companies set up crucial research facilities in the United States and Europe and sent the results back home. But any research in China is not allowed to leave the country. As a result, it's difficult for foreign carmakers to use what they learn in China for cars they sell in other countries.
Then there are the safety issues. As China charges ahead, companies and regulators elsewhere have become more cautious.
The Cruise robot taxi service of General Motors halted service in the United States last fall after one of its cars in San Francisco hit and dragged a pedestrian who had been knocked into its path by a human driver. California regulators later suspended the company's state license. Cruise has resumed limited testing in Phoenix.
Waymo, formerly Google's self-driving car division, is testing more than 200 self-driving cars in the Phoenix suburbs and in San Francisco, as well as nearly 50 in Los Angeles and in Austin, Texas. Waymo was notified twice by federal regulators last month that they were reviewing its safety.
Ford and Volkswagen shut down their robot taxi joint venture, Argo AI, two years ago, but both companies are still developing advanced assisted driving systems.
Last fall, Japan suspended its test of driverless golf carts that travel seven miles per hour after one of them hit the pedal of a parked bicycle. No one was injured. The testing resumed in March.
No company has made bigger bets on computer-guided driving than the American automaker Tesla. But its Autopilot system for highway driving, which it introduced in 2014, and its new Full Self-Driving system, for street and highway driving, are not truly driverless. Motorists are required to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the steering wheel.
Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, announced on April 5 a "Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8."
Many Chinese makers of electric cars are introducing advanced assisted driving features on their mass-production cars.
On June 4, Beijing authorized nine Chinese automakers -- including Nio, BYD and SAIC Motor -- to begin tests of advanced assisted driving systems that go beyond Tesla's Full Self-Driving. At least initially, the tests will be done in restricted areas, not on public roads.
Baidu and Huawei, the electronics giant, are supplying part or all of these automated systems to many Chinese automakers. Baidu also has a joint venture with Zhejiang Geely, called Jiyue, to make driverless cars.
The China Society of Automotive Engineers forecasts that 20 percent of the cars sold in China in 2030 will be completely driverless and that another 70 percent will have advanced assisted driving technology.
Predicting the future popularity of driverless cars in the United States is difficult because it depends on how quickly carmakers switch to electric vehicles. Driverless technology works much better with battery electric cars than with gasoline-powered cars or most hybrid gasoline-electric cars. Electric motors can increase or decrease power with less of a lag and in more finely controlled increments.
In China, battery electric cars represent about 25 percent of the market, compared with 7 percent in the United States.
As with many technologies, including electric car batteries and solar panels, Chinese companies started developing driverless cars by studying American inventions, but then leaped forward in commercializing them. In the years before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than a dozen Chinese firms set up autonomous driving research centers in California, mainly in Silicon Valley. Some, like Baidu, hired hundreds of software engineers. They obtained permission from the California Department of Transportation to test cars on public roads.
These companies moved most of their research to China during the pandemic, when Beijing sealed the country's borders but allowed key researchers to return. They have continued to work in China.
"If you take California out of the equation, China's autonomous driving industry would be nowhere near where it is now," said Michael Dunne, a San Diego automotive consultant who specializes in China.
China has been a big market for Tesla and its advanced assisted driving technologies, like Autopilot. But Beijing is now cracking down on any movement of this data out of China.
Mr. Musk visited Beijing in April to seek approval for his company to offer Full Self-Driving in China. He reached deals to keep in China any data gathered in the country, and to obtain high-resolution maps of Chinese roads through an agreement with Baidu.
China does not allow foreign companies to have direct access to high-resolution maps, which are crucial to driverless systems.
Assisted driving or driverless cars use tiny cameras mounted on their exteriors, or in some cases miniature laser systems, to collect information. Most of that data is processed by the car's computers, which make decisions on steering and vehicle speed.
Although most of the data from cameras and lasers on cars is not uploaded to the carmakers, the potential for tracking people and mapping sensitive locations has troubled security experts.
Europe and the United States still allow manufacturers to send driving data to China, but that may change. Gina M. Raimondo, the U.S. commerce secretary, said last month that the United States would propose rules this fall to regulate cars that were electronically linked to China. Europe has also begun studying the issue.
Baidu believes it has a three- to five-year lead over Tesla in Chinese cities like Wuhan, according to Wang Yunpeng, president of Baidu's intelligent driving business group. By operating fully driverless cars in these places, Baidu has learned how the traffic works, block by block, he said in a speech last month.
From steamy coastal ports in southeastern China like Shenzhen and Fuzhou to metropolises in the mountains of western China, like Chongqing and Chengdu, cities across China are encouraging broad experimentation.

As U.A.W. Scores Wins in Red States, Tensions Rise Over War in Gaza: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A tentative new contract at an Ohio battery maker on Monday was big for President Biden's E.V. transition, but for some, the victory was upstaged by the U.A.W.'s activism on college campuses.
The United Automobile Workers has scored a remarkable string of victories -- most recently, a landmark contract on Monday for electric vehicle battery workers -- as its new leadership strives to restore the union's image as the voice of an iconic segment of the American working class.
But competing for headlines is a part of the union that represents tens of thousands of university workers, which at the moment is singularly focused on a mission far from building cars and trucks: ending Israel's war in Gaza.
U.A.W. leaders insist that they can smooth out the dissonance between the dual thrusts of U.A.W. activism -- one on college campuses, the other on red-state assembly lines. But it will not be easy. The U.A.W. signs that are crowding pro-Palestinian encampments on campuses, furnished by the union's international headquarters in Detroit, have alone struck sour notes among some union members uncomfortable with such outward signs of politics on such a fraught topic.
"It's so bad for the union," said Isaac Altman, a U.A.W. member and staff lawyer in the family court bureau of the Legal Aid Society of Nassau County, N.Y., who has clashed with his local over a pro-Palestine resolution he called "slightly more radical than Hezbollah." (The resolution called for an immediate cease-fire and an end to "the occupation and blockade of Palestinian land, sea and air by Israeli military forces.")
The competition for attention may only get worse. On Monday, union negotiators reached a tentative agreement with General Motors that could prove to be a landmark in the auto industry's transition to electric vehicles. It would give huge wage increases and far more safety protections to employees at an E.V. battery plant in Lordstown, Ohio, solid evidence that President Biden's efforts to combat climate change could fulfill his promise that a green future will not leave workers behind.
"It's a huge deal," said Dave Green, the regional director of the U.A.W. in Ohio and Indiana. "We've been trying to have a just transition and stop this race to the bottom for wages for E.V. workers. This contract is very exciting."
At the same time that the contract emerged, the University of California was suing a U.A.W. local in the Golden State that represents 48,000 teaching assistants for striking over pro-Palestinian protests, a less-than-ideal image, union officials say, as the new U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, tries to organize politically conservative blue-collar workers.
University union members, now back to work, received strike pay -- $ 500 a week -- and other support from U.A.W. headquarters from the moment that University of California, Santa Cruz, graduate students walked off the job on May 20, no different from the autoworkers who manned the picket lines in Michigan, Missouri and Ohio last fall.
The union's blue-collar leadership was not exactly brought kicking and screaming to the Gaza protests. Its higher-education locals pressed the national leadership to get involved, but when, in December, the U.A.W. became the first major union to demand a cease-fire in Gaza, the board vote was unanimous.
Asked about the turmoil at California and New York union locals over Gaza, Mr. Green, who represents the U.A.W. in the Republican states of Ohio and Indiana, answered with a curt "no comment."
Without question, under Mr. Fain's muscular leadership, the U.A.W. has made strides toward reconnecting with the working class, a plus for President Biden, whom the union has endorsed. A six-week wave of strikes against the Big Three automakers last fall yielded the biggest pay raises for autoworkers in decades. An 11th-hour deal at the edge of a strike in April against Daimler Truck in North Carolina gave workers 25 percent raises.
Just days later, workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee voted overwhelmingly to join the U.A.W., a breakthrough as the union pushes to organize foreign automakers -- especially electric vehicle plants -- in the union-hostile Southeast.
It has not all been smooth sailing: Last month, workers at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama voted against U.A.W. representation. On Monday, a court-appointed monitor watching the union for corruption accused Mr. Fain and the new leaders of obstructing attempts to access information in violation of a 2020 consent decree reached by the leaders whom Mr. Fain ousted to avoid a Justice Department takeover of the union.
The tentative contract reached this week at Ultium Cells, an E.V. battery joint venture in the shadow of a shuttered auto plant in Northeast Ohio that former President Donald J. Trump promised but failed to save, was meant to get the union back on a positive track. It includes 30 percent raises over three years for most workers, 112 percent raises for the lowest paid, $ 3,000 bonuses upon ratification and new positions for health and safety workers.
But just like Mr. Biden, Mr. Fain also has to placate pro-Palestinian activists, who are a legacy of past U.A.W. leadership that set out over the last decade to increase flagging membership by organizing teaching assistants and other employees of higher education, especially on the politically active West and Northeast coasts. For the U.A.W., the biggest success came in the last seven years, when tens of thousands of teaching assistants and other workers at the University of California, the University of Washington, the University of Connecticut, New York University and Harvard voted to join the auto union. More than one-quarter of the union's 391,000 members now work for universities.
"We have set out to rebuild this union and turn it into a fighting union, one that fights for union-organizing but also for humanity as a whole," said Brandon Mancilla, a U.A.W. board member who came to the union through organizing Harvard graduate students and has been instrumental in its stand on Gaza. "Of course, when you take on as ambitious and broad a mission as this, you're going to have issues that a lot of the mainstream don't see as central to traditional unions."
Not everyone sees it that way, inside the union and out. Last month, Republicans in Congress got involved when Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, subpoenaed the president of a small New York U.A.W. local that represents legal aid workers over its contentious vote for a cease-fire in Gaza and attendant accusations of antisemitism.
The local itself is badly split, with some calling the Republican probe a witch hunt and others suing their own union.
"It completely undermines us with management, it completely undermines us in the court of public opinion, and it distracts from the union doing what it's supposed to be doing: advocating for workers," Mr. Altman said. "It's preposterous."
U.A.W. leaders sought in interviews to tie together the union's blue-collar successes, its resurgent political activism on Gaza and the new clash with its federal monitor. An old-line labor union, they said, is ruffling a lot of feathers.
"We encourage the monitor to investigate whatever claims are brought to their office, because we know what they'll find: a U.A.W. leadership committed to serving the membership and running a democratic union," Mr. Fain said. Mr. Fain reasoned that taking a position on the issue was in line with the activism of the union's longtime president Walter Reuther against the Vietnam War and in support of civil rights, as well as with the U.A.W.'s stand against apartheid in South Africa.
"Everything we're doing is about us as workers having greater control over working conditions," said Rafael Jaime, the president of U.A.W. Local 4811 in California and a doctoral student in English at the University of California, Los Angeles. He cited pay, health care and safety, "but also a say in how we engage in protests on campus," adding, "We want to have a voice."
U.A.W. officials downplayed any disconnect. Some white, skilled tradesmen in the South may recoil at left-wing activism, officials said, but plenty of Southern workers, especially workers of color, agree with calls for an end to the war in Gaza, especially when it is tied to U.S. tax money, the officials added. Tim O'Hara, who was the vice president of the U.A.W. local in Lordstown, Ohio, when the G.M. plant shut down in 2018, preferred to talk up the new Ultium contract.
Lordstown's local has always been "iconic," he said. "They have now set the pattern for the contracts that will be negotiated for the Big 3 battery facilities" across the country.
Mr. Mancilla, the U.A.W. board member, noted that the union had also endorsed Mr. Biden's re-election, although many workers are not likely to vote for him. The activism on Gaza might not be a "day-to-day conversation" for organizers in Southern auto plants, he said. But he added, "I wouldn't say anyone is being quiet about anything. We're not hiding that we endorsed Joe Biden, even though many of our members might have different party affiliations."
Members of the United Automobile Workers protested at U.C.L.A., above, over the war in Gaza.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The tariffs had been expected for months, but many European automakers warned that they would drive up prices for consumers and set off a trade war with China.
The European Union said on Wednesday that it would impose additional tariffs of up to 38 percent on electric cars built in China, a move it said would help level the playing field for automakers in Europe.
The tariffs, which have been expected for months, come on top of existing 10 percent duties, but the level of their impact has been disputed. Some European automakers argue they will set off a trade war, but other experts have said they will not stop China's dominance in the industry.
Instead, they argue that incentives to make low-emission cars more attractive to drivers are needed instead, if the European Union hopes to meet its goal to ban the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles in 2035.
What does this mean for consumers?
Industry experts predict that the increased duties on electric vehicles from China will hurt consumers more than they do Chinese automakers, by increasing the price of the most affordable electric cars on the market.
But according to an investigation by the European Union, the entire supply chain of Chinese electric cars enjoys government subsidies that allow automakers there to drastically reduce their production costs. This gives Chinese producers an unfair competitive edge over their European rivals, the European investigation found.
BYD's Dolphin model, for example, sells in Europe for about 32,400 euros, or about $ 34,900, compared with nearly €40,000 for a Tesla Model Y and €37,000 for a Volkswagen ID.4.
Clamping down on E.V. exports to E.U. nations could drive more automakers in China to shift assembly to European countries like Hungary or Spain, where costs for labor and parts are higher, resulting in higher costs for consumers.
How will this affect European automakers?
Many European car manufacturers are heavily dependent on China, the world's largest market for automobiles, for both exports and production in the domestic market.
"This decision for additional import duties is the wrong way to go," Oliver Zipse, chief executive of BMW, said on Wednesday. "The E.U. Commission is thus harming European companies and European interests."
German manufacturers -- BMW as well as Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen -- not only sell to the Chinese but also have large production and research and development operations in China. They fear that any retribution from Beijing could harm their business.
Others remain interested in collaborations with the Chinese. Last month, Stellantis said it would start selling two models in Europe from its joint venture with the Chinese automaker Leapmotor as part of efforts to circumvent the tariffs.
Was the E.U. just following the United States?
The Biden administration announced last month that it would impose new tariffs of 100 percent on Chinese electric vehicles. That measure quadrupled the tariffs that the United States previously charged for foreign cars, in an effort to shield the American auto industry from Chinese competition.
Some analysts had worried that tariffs set at a lower level might not be enough to stop Chinese-made electric vehicles from going into the United States, given the big price difference between Chinese- and American-made cars.
But Wendy Cutler, the vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former U.S. trade official, said the 100 percent level would be high enough to block that trade. "That's what we call a prohibitive tariff. It really cuts trade off," she added.
The European Union began an investigation into Chinese E.V. subsidies in October, citing what leaders said was unfair competition, especially from China's three leading makers of electric cars, BYD, Geely and SAIC.
Is it a setback for climate policy?
Tariffs like these have set off a debate among some economists and climate activists about whether they're an obstacle in the fight against global warming. Gasoline-powered vehicles are a major producer of the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet.
The argument against tariffs is that they make electric vehicles more expensive, slowing the transition away from fossil fuels. The Chinese government and several German automakers took up a similar line of argument, as did experts who pointed out that Western countries should be interested in cheaper electric vehicles if they wanted to meet their goals to combat climate change.
"Protectionist measures can only lead to higher car prices for the consumer and, in this case, also kick the can of achieving announced emission goals further into the long grass," said ManMohan Sodhi, a professor of supply chain management at Bayes Business School in London.
How did the E.U. get here?
The European Union is eager to avoid falling into a situation similar to one in the late 2000s, when Beijing pumped large sums of money into solar energy technology, enabling domestic manufacturers to make multibillion-dollar investments in new factories and gain market share globally.
China's boom in production caused the price of panels to plummet, forcing dozens of companies in Europe and the United States out of business. That led the European Commission to open an anti-dumping investigation that resulted in punitive tariffs on the Chinese panels.
But China retaliated, announcing its own investigation into exports of European wine and solar panel components, a move that divided members of the bloc. That allowed China to pit them against one another, ultimately leading the Europeans to back down.
More than a decade on, Germany's solar industry is still struggling, and cheap solar panels from China dominate the market.
What happens next?
Even before the announcement on tariffs from Brussels, demand for Chinese E.V.s in Europe had begun slowing down, as Germany and France cut back on subsidies for electric cars.
Last month, Great Wall Motors said it was closing its headquarters in Munich, citing "the increasingly challenging European electric vehicle market, coupled with numerous uncertainties in the future."
But BYD, China's leading manufacturer of electric cars and a sponsor of the 2024 European soccer championship that begins in Germany on Friday, remains focused on Europe. The company is already building a factory in Hungary and is considering a second one.

E.U. Imposes Higher Tariffs on Chinese Electric Vehicles: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Leaders in Brussels, Washington and beyond are trying to curb China's automobile ambitions amid rising trade tensions and fears of a glut of Chinese cars flooding global markets.
The European Union said on Wednesday that it would impose additional tariffs of up to 38 percent on electric vehicles imported from China into the bloc, in what E.U. leaders called an effort to protect the region's manufacturers from unfair competition.
The move, a month after President Biden quadrupled U.S. tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to 100 percent, opens another front in escalating trade tensions with China amid growing fears about a glut of Chinese green tech goods flooding global markets.
The actions by the European Union and the United States also reflect the challenges that traditional automakers in Europe and the United States face from up-and-coming Chinese companies founded with a focus on electric vehicles and much lower cost bases than their rivals in the West.
But unlike U.S. carmakers, several of their European counterparts are deeply entwined in the Chinese market, and their cars produced there will also be subject to the higher tariffs. They have criticized the European Union's move to increase duties from 10 percent, fearing retaliation from China, as well as an increase in prices across the market and a drop in demand for battery-powered cars.
The increases announced on Wednesday, which come on top of the existing 10 percent duties, are preliminary and will take effect on July 4. They range from 17.4 percent to 38.1 percent for three of the leading Chinese manufacturers, BYD, Geely and SAIC. The tariffs were calculated based on the level of cooperation with European officials, who have spent the past few months investigating the level of support from the Chinese government for these companies.
Other automakers producing electric vehicles in China, including European companies with factories or joint ventures there, face a tariff of 21 percent or 38.1 percent, the European Union said. Those rates also depend on their cooperation with the investigation.
The European Union defended the action, saying in a statement that an investigation that started Oct. 4 had found that the electric-vehicle supply chain in China "benefits heavily from unfair subsidies in China, and that the influx of subsidized Chinese imports at artificially low prices therefore presents a threat of clearly foreseeable and imminent injury to E.U. industry."
China denounced the tariffs as lacking "factual and legal basis" that amounted to "weaponizing economic and trade issues," said He Yadong, a spokesman for the Commerce Ministry.
"This is not in line with the consensus reached by Chinese and European leaders on strengthening cooperation, and will affect the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade cooperation between China and Europe," Mr. He said.
The European Commission, the European Union's executive branch, opened the investigation to determine whether the Chinese government was effectively subsidizing its production of electric cars and sending them to Europe at prices that undercut European competitors.
The automotive sector provides nearly 13 million jobs across the 27-nation bloc, the world's second-largest market for electric vehicles after China. Imports of electric cars from China last year reached $ 11.5 billion, up from $ 1.6 billion in 2020,.
About 37 percent of all electric vehicles imported to Europe come from China, including cars made by Tesla, BMW and Dacia, owned by Renault. Chinese brands account for 19 percent of the European market for E.Vs. Their numbers have been growing steadily, according to a study by Rhodium Group.
Europe is open to engaging with Chinese officials to resolve the dispute, said senior E.U. communications officials, who insisted that the bloc was not looking to introduce higher tariffs for the sake of it but was moving to defend its nations' industry.
Tesla, which produces its Model 3 and Model Y in Shanghai for the European market, petitioned for duties on its cars to be calculated individually, the E.U. officials said. Other companies seeking an individual review have nine months to submit their petition, although none had done so by the time of the announcement on Wednesday.
Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said last month that Europe was taking a "tailored approach" to calculating its increase in tariffs from the existing 10 percent, which would "correspond to the level of damage" caused. Tariffs for the other exporting companies will be based on the weighted average of the duty imposed on the three that were investigated.
Before the announcement, China had warned that it could retaliate by raising tariffs on gas-powered cars imported from Europe, agricultural and aviation goods. China already applies a 15 percent duty on all electric vehicles imported from Europe.
Those include cars made by BMW and Volkswagen, for example, which not only sell to China but also have large production facilities there.
The German carmakers fear that the tariffs will drive up prices in Europe and set off retaliation from the Chinese, ultimately hurting them in both markets. Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany criticized the increased duties last week during a visit to a plant in Rüsselsheim, which is owned by Stellantis's Opel.
"Isolation and illegal customs barriers -- that ultimately just makes everything more expensive, and everyone poorer," Mr. Scholz said. "We do not close our markets to foreign companies, because we do not want that for our companies, either."
Economic experts had warned that increasing tariffs to as high as 20 percent could disrupt trade routes. The Kiel Institute for the World Economy calculated that such an increase would prevent $ 3.8 billion worth of electric vehicles from China from entering Europe.
But other experts point out that Chinese manufacturers' cost advantage over Europe's legacy automakers in the production of components like electronics modules and battery cells means that Europe would need to impose duties of at least 50 percent to be effective.
Even if European automakers were able to plug that gap, a drop in the number of Chinese models will drive up the overall price of electric vehicles, given the higher labor and production costs, the institute said.
"It is by no means a foregone conclusion that European car manufacturers will fill the gap," said Julian Hinz, a trade researcher at the institute. Another threat to European producers, he said, is the reality that Chinese manufacturers already have plans to expand production into Europe.
BYD, the leading Chinese automaker, has set its sights on becoming a top maker of electric vehicles in Europe by 2030. Late last year, it named Hungary as the site where it plans to build its first assembly plant in the European Union. The company said it was considering setting up a second factory elsewhere in Europe.
Chery, another Chinese manufacturer, announced last month that it would open a plant near Barcelona, Spain, as part of a joint venture with Spain's EV Motors.
Other European countries are also eager for Chinese automakers to relocate to their home turf, with the idea they would create jobs and strengthen domestic supply chains.
President Emmanuel Macron of France has made a concerted effort to attract more battery production, including from Chinese companies, to a northern region where factory jobs have been in decline. Bruno Le Maire, France's finance minister, has gone even further, declaring that the Chinese auto industry is "very welcome in France."
With a view to the possibility that the Chinese firms expand in their backyard, many European automakers point out that they are more concerned about increasing their competitiveness than they are about the tariffs.
Volkswagen, which has several production and research sites in China, said it was worried about the tariffs, which the company sees as harmful, especially when demand for electric cars in Europe is dipping.
"The increase in import tariffs in the E.U. could trigger a fatal dynamic of measures and countermeasures and result in an escalation of trade conflicts," the company said Wednesday in a statement. "We assume that the negative effects of the decision will outweigh any positive aspects."
The tariffs are expected to enter into force early next month. Affected companies and the Chinese government will then have several days to weigh in. The commission would then have until November before the final tariffs went into force, for a period of five years.

Tesla Investors In Scandinavia Seek Respect Of Labor Rights: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Tesla mechanics in Sweden have been striking for six months with little movement from their employer. Nordic shareholders hope to change that.
The fight over Elon Musk's pay package and the vote over whether to move Tesla's headquarters to Texas have been the main focus of attention ahead of the company's shareholders meeting on Thursday, but not for investors from Nordic countries.
Tesla's major shareholders in Sweden, Denmark and Norway are instead looking to the meeting to bring the issue of labor rights at the automaker to the fore.
Behind the campaign is the strike of Tesla's mechanics in Sweden. Now stretching into its sixth month, the dispute has drawn in unions from across the region that have joined in blockades aimed at bringing the U.S. carmaker to the negotiating table to reach a collective agreement with its Swedish workers.
Several of the biggest shareholders in the Nordic countries are urging others to back a proposal that would require Tesla to respect the right of workers to assemble.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. It has remained resistant to unions in Europe, even in countries with strong traditions of organized labor. Mr. Musk has expressed his disdain for organized labor. "I disagree with the idea of unions," he said at the DealBook Summit in New York last year.
None of Tesla's factories are unionized, potentially giving the company an advantage over rivals like Ford Motor, General Motors and Volkswagen that must pay union wages. But in the United States, Tesla is a prime target for the United Automobile Workers union, which is in a strong position after winning the largest wage increases in years recently for workers at unionized plants.
The proposal up for vote on Thursday was put forward by Folksam Group, an insurance company from Sweden, along with a Canadian pension fund and equity funds from the United States. Together they are calling on Tesla's board to adopt a policy that would commit to "noninterference and good faith bargaining in accordance with internationally recognized human rights standards with respect to freedom of association and collective bargaining," according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Among those backing the proposal, which is up for vote on Thursday, are KLP, Norway's biggest pension fund, which holds 900,000 Tesla shares worth some 1.7 billion Norwegian crowns, or $ 162 million.
"We as a long-term investor expect that companies we invest in will adhere to the highest international standards in its business operations, in particular when they have business operations across the globe where the standards may vary from country to country," said Kiran Aziz, KLP's head of responsible investments.
The Norwegian fund was one of several investors from the Nordic countries to send a letter to Tesla's management last year addressing the issue of labor rights.
Despite the strike and the campaign by those Nordic shareholders, Mr. Musk enjoys a strong following among many of the Sweden's most tech-savvy drivers. Although a majority of Swedes have expressed support for the strike, many are fans of Mr. Musk. Tesla sold 20,400 cars in Sweden last year, and the Model Y is the country's best seller.
Tesla mechanics who are members of the IF Metall union walked off their jobs in late October. Dozens remain on strike and the union has been picketing the company's facilities across Sweden.
The union say Tesla is flouting Sweden's tradition of collective agreements. About 90 percent of Swedish workers are covered by these agreements, which also apply to nonunion employees and set work conditions across industries.
Tesla has refused to engage in the process of collective bargaining that sets such an agreement, arguing that the company pays its workers competitively and complies with local labor laws.
That has not stopped the union from rallying more than a dozen other labor organizations to support its side through sympathy measures, which are allowed under Swedish law. For several months, workers from other industries have been refusing to provide Tesla with services ranging from unloading of its cars at ports, to trash removal to the delivery of new license plates.
Last month, Sweden's largest union, Unionen, joined the effort with a walkout by workers who carry out equipment inspections for the company.
Tesla has so far found workarounds and has managed to keep its business going without significant disruptions for customers.
KLP, the Norwegian pension fund, has also said that it would vote against Mr. Musk's $ 46.5 billion pay package. Although the vote on pay is unrelated to the labor dispute, the fund said that "the total award value remains excessive" despite Tesla's significant growth. KLP also voted against the pay package in 2018.
Major shareholders appear divided over whether to support the pay package, which was nullified by a judge at a Delaware court in January. Tesla is now asking shareholders to approve the pay package and Mr. Musk has been lobbying shareholders for support over the social media platform X, which he owns.
In reaction to a post by Mr. Musk urging small investors to be allowed to vote, some Swedish retail brokerage firms broke with tradition in Europe by saying they would allow their customers to cast votes at the annual general meeting on Thursday, after they received requests to do so.
"We always want to do our best to meet our customers' requests, and decided to make an exception this time and to make it possible for them to vote at this specific Tesla annual general meeting," said Sofia Svavar, a spokeswoman for Avanza, an online bank based in Stockholm.

E.V. Batteries Can Fuel The Grid (and Win Drivers): [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Automakers are exploring energy storage as a way to help utilities and save customers money, turning an expensive component into an industry asset.
Electric cars are more expensive than gasoline models largely because batteries cost so much. But new technology could turn those pricey devices into an asset, giving owners benefits like reduced utility bills, lower lease payments or free parking.
Ford Motor, General Motors, BMW and other automakers are exploring how electric-car batteries could be used to store excess renewable energy to help utilities deal with fluctuations in supply and demand for power. Automakers would make money by serving as intermediaries between car owners and power suppliers.
Millions of cars could be thought of as a huge energy system that, for the first time, will be connected to another enormous energy system, the electrical grid, said Matthias Preindl, an associate professor of power electronic systems at Columbia University.
"We're just at the starting point," Dr. Preindl said. "They will interact more in the future, and they can potentially support one another -- or stress one another."
A large flat screen on the wall of the Munich offices of the Mobility House, a firm whose investors include Mercedes-Benz and Renault, illustrates one way that carmakers could profit while helping to stabilize the grid.
The graphs and numbers on the screen provide a real-time picture of a European energy market where investors and utilities buy and sell electricity. The price changes from minute to minute as supply and demand surge or ebb.
The Mobility House buys power when solar and wind power is abundant and cheap, storing it in electric vehicles that are part of its system and plugged in around Europe. When demand and prices climb, the company resells the electricity. It's a classic play: Buy low, sell high.
People in the automobile and energy industries have been talking for years about using car batteries for grid storage. As the number of electric cars on the road increases, those ideas are becoming more tangible.
Renault, the French carmaker, is offering Mobility House technology to buyers of its R5 electric compact car, for which the company began taking orders last month. The car, which Renault will begin delivering in December, starts at 29,490 euros (about $ 32,000) in France.
Buyers who opt in will get a free home charger and sign a contract allowing Renault to draw power from the vehicles when they are plugged in. R5 owners will be able to control how much power they give back to the grid and when. In return, they'll get a break on their electricity bills.
"The more they plug in, the more they earn," said Ziad Dagher, a Renault executive in charge of the program. Renault estimates that participants could cut 50 percent from their home energy bills.
Renault, which will offer the technology in France before rolling it out in Germany, Britain and other countries, will share in the profits that the Mobility House generates from energy trading.
If such services prove successful, the financial argument for electric vehicles, an important tool against climate change, will become stronger.
"It would really drive E.V. adoption," said Adam Langton, a BMW executive who works on energy issues.
BMW already offers software that allows owners to charge their electric cars when renewable energy is most abundant. That allows the company to earn carbon credits and pay customers who take part in the program.
A new generation of electric vehicles that BMW will begin selling next year, known as the Neue Klasse, will have so-called bidirectional capability, meaning the cars will be able to take electricity from the grid and release it back in addition to using the energy to power their motors.
Ford was a pioneer in two-way charging with the F-150 Lightning pickup, which can power a home during a blackout. General Motors, Hyundai and Volkswagen also offer or plan to offer cars with bidirectional charging. As such vehicles become more common, the storage potential could be enormous.
By the end of the decade, an estimated 30 million electric vehicles could be on U.S. roads, up from about three million now. All those cars could store as much power as a day's output from dozens of nuclear plants.
But of course those millions of cars may also put a strain on the grid, which is already getting increasing electricity demand from heat pumps and data centers, said Aseem Kapur, chief revenue officer at GM Energy, a unit of General Motors that provides services to electric vehicle owners. By helping to smooth out demand, "E.V.s can be a significant resource," he said.
But a few problems need to be worked out before that vision can be realized.
Owners may not be eager to have their cars serve the grid because they are worried that constant charging and discharging will wear down their batteries faster.
Some energy experts said the degradation would be insignificant, especially if utilities drew on only a small fraction of a battery's capacity. Renault is dealing with that issue by offering participants in its energy storage program the same eight-year, 160,000-kilometer warranty that people who don't take part receive.
Another challenge is that some U.S. utilities and the state regulators that oversee them prefer running centralized grids in which energy flows almost entirely in one direction -- from power plants to homes and businesses.
To overcome resistance from utilities, Maryland last month adopted a law that requires them to accommodate bidirectional charging schemes and provide financial incentives.
There is growing recognition that electric vehicle batteries are valuable investments that most owners will actively use for only a few hours a day.
"We want to unlock the full value of electric vehicle batteries," said Gregor Hintler, chief executive of the Mobility House for North America.
If all the electric cars in New York City were used as storage, said Dr. Preindl, the Columbia professor, "those vehicles would be the most valuable power plant in New York by far."
Consolidated Edison, the utility that serves New York City and some of its suburbs, is exploring how managing charging times and using electric vehicles for storage could help it cope with the fast growth of battery-powered cars.
Contrary to popular fears, "the grid is not going to collapse" because of electric cars, said Britt Reichborn-Kjennerud, the director of e-mobility at Con Ed. "The bigger concern is that if we don't plan differently for this very fast-increasing load, the grid won't be ready in time to support the transition."
Con Ed supplies the power to a Bronx depot for New York City electric school buses, where Mobility House software allows more vehicles to use the facility.
Fleets of electric vehicles owned by businesses or governments are a particularly promising form of backup energy storage. Vans or trucks have large batteries and tend to have predictable routes and schedules.
Ford Pro, the commercial-vehicle division of Ford Motor, has begun offering free chargers to customers who allow them to be switched off during peaks in electricity demand. Owners also save on their electricity bills.
Ford provides the software to manage the chargers and accommodate customers' driving needs, and it manages the relationship with utilities. Ford is testing the service in Massachusetts before expanding it to other states. The next step will be a two-way system that allows the vehicles to send energy to the grid.
"What smart charging can do is cut costs," said Jim Gawron, director of charging strategy at Ford's electric vehicle division. "That has been a key barrier for customers."

Auto Deals Are Making A Comeback: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Automakers and dealers are starting to offer discounts, low-interest loans and other incentives to lure buyers as the supply of cars grows.
For much of the last four years, automakers and their dealers had so few cars to sell -- and demand was so strong -- that they could command high prices. Those days are over, and hefty discounts are starting a comeback.
During the coronavirus pandemic, auto production was slowed first by factory closings and then by a global shortage of computer chips and other parts that lasted for years.
With few vehicles in showrooms, automakers and dealers were able to scrap most sales incentives, leaving consumers to pay full price. Some dealers added thousands of dollars to the manufacturer's suggested retail price, and people started buying and flipping in-demand cars for a profit.
But with chip supplies back to healthy levels, auto production has rebounded and dealer inventories are growing. At the same time, higher interest rates have dampened demand for vehicles. As a result, many automakers are scrambling to keep sales rolling.
Wes Lutz, owner of Extreme Dodge in Jackson, Mich., said he had several Dodge Challengers and Chargers that were eligible for $ 11,000 discounts from Stellantis, the manufacturer of Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep and Ram models. The automaker is also offering discounts of up to $ 3,600 on certain versions of the Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle.
"It seems like we may be headed back toward incentives and overproduction," Mr. Lutz said. "It's not there yet, but it's getting close."
With a shrug, he added, "It may not be good for me or for the manufacturer, but it's sure good for the consumer."
Cash-back offers, subsidized loans and other incentives are important tools for selling cars. They allow automakers and dealers to offer monthly payments that are more affordable for consumers and ease the impact of high interest rates.
In the last few years, shortages and consumers' preferences for large vehicle have pushed the average purchase price of new vehicles to just under $ 47,000, and the average monthly payment to $ 735, according to Edmunds, a market researcher. The average interest rate on used car loans was 11.6 percent in April, according to Edmunds.
At those levels, many consumers can no longer afford cars without substantial incentives.
But when taken to extremes, incentives can erode automakers' profits and create a surge of sales that inevitably gives way to a painful drop. Repeated waves of discounting also condition consumers to purchase cars only when offered a deal.
Two decades ago, the industry went on an incentive binge. General Motors for a time sold cars at the heavily discounted prices it previously offered only to its employees. Extreme discounting helped weaken G.M. and Chrysler before they filed for bankruptcy in 2009 during the financial crisis.
For now, the industry has avoided that trap. At the end of May, automakers had almost 2.9 million cars and light trucks in stock, about one million more than at the same time last year, according to Cox Automotive, a market researcher. Nearly 7 percent of those vehicles were 2023 models. By comparison, there were 4.1 million vehicles in stock in 2019, according to Automotive News.
Toyota, Honda, Subaru, and G.M.'s Chevrolet and Cadillac brands have kept tight reins on their inventories and in general have not yet elevated incentives significantly.
But Ford, Lincoln, Dodge, Chrysler, Nissan, Volvo and several other brands have higher stocks -- enough to last more than 100 days at the current rate of sales. They're offering some big incentives, but mostly targeted at specific models, and sometimes specific versions of certain models.
Ford, for example, is offering $ 5,500 off its Escape S.U.V., but only on the 2023 models that remain in dealer stock. Stellantis is offering $ 4,000 cash back on the Ram pickup, but it is limited to the 1500 Classic version. Volkswagen is offering interest-free financing on the 2024 Taos small S.U.V., but not on its other models.
"So far we're not seeing the across-the-board incentives that we had in the past," said Charles Chesbrough, a senior economist at Cox Automotive.
The growing number of incentives on new vehicles has helped pull down prices of used cars and trucks. In April, used car prices declined nearly 7 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Among the most heavily discounted models at the moment are electric vehicles, sales of which have slowed in recent months. Consumers' enthusiasm for those models has ebbed, mainly over concerns about the higher prices of electric vehicles and the challenges of keeping them charged, especially on road trips.
Now automakers are offering generous incentives to entice consumers. Volkswagen is offering discounts of up to $ 18,750 on leases on the 2023 ID.4, which is still readily available in some places. That includes the $ 7,500 federal tax credit, which can be rolled into leasing deals under the Inflation Reduction Act.
Other considerable deals are available on the Chevrolet Blazer electric vehicle, the Cadillac Lyriq, the Kia EV6, the Volvo XC40 Recharge hybrid and the Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup. Tesla, which regularly raised prices during the pandemic, has spent the last year and a half slashing them. Recently the company has been offering 0.99 percent loans on its Model Y S.U.V.
The incentives come on top of other trends that are helping reduce the price of electric vehicles, including falling manufacturing costs and rising competition.
Increased discounting is helping tempt what are known in the industry as "want buyers" -- consumers who don't need a new car but are drawn by new technologies, design or features.
"You have your 'need buyer,' whose car had died or needs a lot of expensive repairs, and they have to get a new vehicle," said Adam Silverleib, owner of a Honda and a Volkswagen dealerships outside Boston. "But a lot of those 'want buyers' went away when interest rates went up, and now incentives are bringing some of them back."
Among them is Brian Pawlowski, a digital marketing executive in Chelsea, Mich. He had been driving a 2017 Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid that had only 55,000 miles on the odometer. But he was itching to get a fully electric model.
"I'm a person who likes the environment," he said. "I could have kept the Volt, but I wanted to upgrade to newer technology."
He began looking for deals on electric cars and found a two-year lease on a Hyundai Ioniq 5 S.U.V. The deal came with a $ 13,000 discount and other terms that left him with a monthly payment of $ 369 for a vehicle with a sticker price of $ 52,000.
"When the sales guy laid it all out," Mr. Pawlowski said, "it was pretty hard to pass up."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: She was the first photographer allowed to document life among the Hopi, in the Southwest, since the early 20th century. Her work appeared in books and magazines.
Susanne Page, whose intimate photographs of the Hopi tribe and Navajo nation opened a rare window on the everyday culture of Indigenous people in America's Southwest, died on May 13 in Alexandria, Va. She was 86.
The cause of her death, at the home of her daughter, Kendall Barrett, was brain cancer, another daughter, Lindsey Truitt, said.
Ms. Page was in the midst of a 40-year career as a photographer for the United States Information Agency when she began creating vivid images of Native Americans and the flora and fauna that sustained them -- work that embraced the beauty of the natural world and its profound spiritual significance to those Indigenous people. Her work appeared in magazines like National Geographic and Smithsonian and in several books.
Along the way she introduced the subject of Native Americans of the Southwest to Jake Page, an editor and columnist at Smithsonian.
Intrigued by her first book, "Song of the Earth Spirit" (1972), about traditional Navajo life in Arizona, Mr. Page commissioned her to write an article about Navajo witchcraft. While that article failed to materialize, Hopi elders, impressed by the seriousness of the Navajo book, invited Ms. Page, who went by the name Susanne Anderson then, to document their tribe, offering her access to its reservation in Northern Arizona.
She seized on the opportunity, becoming the first outside photographer to be authorized to work on the reservation since early in the 20th century. She also invited Mr. Page to help on the project, a prospect so enticing to him that he retired from Smithsonian so that he could join her.
In December 1974, the temperature in their rented Volkswagen plunged to 10 degrees Fahrenheit as they climbed a mesa in the Northern Arizona highlands, where the Hopi have lived for a millennium -- a site inhabited longer than any other place in North America, Mr. Page wrote.
Their arrival at their destination was inauspicious: A boldly-lettered sign warned, "No Outside White Visitors: Because of your failing to follow the laws of our tribe as well as the laws of your own, this village is hereby closed."
Still, in some two dozen visits, they cultivated friendships with tribe members, and in 1982 they published "Hopi," with photographs by Susanne and text by Jake. They married shortly afterward.
Their access to the Hopi gave readers the opportunity "to join an expedition to capture an eagle from a nest high up in a hidden canyon," the publisher, Harry N. Abrams, proclaimed, and to follow "a lengthy pilgrimage to the sacred shrines that mark the ancestral lands of the Hopi -- a religious trek that only 14 living people in the world have ever made."
The couple later collaborated on "Celebration of Being: Photographs of the Hopi and Navajo" (1990),"Navajo" (1995) and "Indian Arts of the Southwest" (2008).
"I have tried to photograph people the way I feel that they see themselves rather than the way an outsider might want to see them," Ms. Page said.
Susanne Calista Stone was born on March 3, 1938, in Upper Montclair, N.J. Her mother, Virginia (Young) Stone, managed the household. Her father, Charles Francis Stone III, was in the Army and worked for the Central Intelligence Agency after World War II.
The family lived on Army bases during the war before settling in Washington. After graduating from high school in Arlington, Susanne attended art school in London and George Washington University.
She was a single mother when her career in photojournalism began in 1967, while working as an editor for a photo magazine that the U.S. Information Agency published for distribution in the Soviet Union as part of Cold War cultural exchanges.
Armed with a 14-year-old Nikon camera, she tackled her first assignment: compile a photo essay of a veterinarian in rural Appalachia.
Her photographs have been published in numerous publications and exhibited in many galleries and are in the collection of the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian.
Her marriages to Fred Anderson and Tom Truitt ended in divorce. In addition to her daughters Lindsey and Kendall, she is survived by another daughter, Sally Truitt; her stepdaughters, Dana, Lea and Brooke Page; 10 grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter. Mr. Page died in 2016, and Ms. Page's sister, Sally Stone Halvorson, died in 2014.
Photograph Ms. Page's many photographs of the Hopi tribe include one of a girl named Sewa, who was playfully smeared with corn smut by her family in 1978.; Tribe members in kachina doll outfits in 1980. "I have tried to photograph people the way I feel that they see themselves rather than the way an outsider might want to see them," Ms. Page said. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY SUSANNE PAGE); Sue Page in 2023.

Why Unions Now Struggle To Expand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Teamsters union has made little headway in organizing workers at Amazon and FedEx despite wage and other gains it secured at UPS last year.
Last year, two unions representing workers at three large automakers and UPS negotiated new labor contracts that included big raises and other gains. Leaders of the unions -- the United Automobile Workers and the Teamsters -- hoped the wins would help them organize workers across their industry.
The U.A.W. won one vote to unionize a Volkswagen factory in Tennessee last month and lost one this month at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama. The Teamsters have made even less progress at UPS's big nonunion rivals in the delivery business, Amazon and FedEx.
Polling shows that public support for unions is the highest it has been in decades. But labor experts said structural forces would make it hard for labor groups to increase their membership, which is the lowest it has been as a percentage of the total work force in decades. Unions also face stiff opposition from many employers and conservative political leaders.
The Teamsters provide an instructive case study. Many of the workers doing deliveries for Amazon and FedEx work for contractors, typically small and medium-size businesses that can be hard to organize. And delivery workers employed directly by FedEx in its Express business are governed by a labor law that requires unions to organize all similar workers at the company nationally at once -- a tougher standard than the one that applies to organizing employees at automakers, UPS and other employers.
Some labor experts also said the Teamsters had not made as forceful a push as the U.A.W. to organize nonunion workers after securing a new contract with UPS.
"You didn't have that energy that you saw with the U.A.W.'s leaders," said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies labor at Washington University in St. Louis.
Teamsters officials said the UPS deal, which increases the average annual compensation, including benefits, of a UPS driver to $ 170,000 from $ 145,000, was helping them gain members. At DHL, a delivery company where the union has long had a big presence, the union added 1,100 members last year and is pushing to gain another 1,500. The Teamsters are also pursuing a legal challenge against Amazon that could allow them to gain ground at the company and its contractors.
"It's been very helpful for us to mobilize," Sean O'Brien, the Teamsters' president, said in an interview, referring to the UPS contract. "We've set the standard in the industry."
But the union has also suffered losses. Yellow, a trucking company that employed 24,000 Teamsters, shut down and filed for bankruptcy protection last year.
Amazon and FedEx said they were confident in their approach to managing and compensating workers. Amazon said it had made investments that bolstered pay and benefits at its delivery contractors. FedEx said its nonunion model allowed it to quickly increase pay whereas UPS's union employees were bound by the terms of five-year contracts.
"Our culture, built and tested over 50 years, is based on the philosophy that if we take care of our people, they will deliver outstanding service for our customers, which will drive business results for our company," Tracy Brightman, FedEx's chief people officer, said in a statement.
Around 310,000 UPS employees belong to the Teamsters. Many of them see FedEx and Amazon drivers on their routes and talk about pay, benefits and working conditions.
"We make much more money than anyone else in the industry," said Essence Carlisle, a part-time package handler at UPS's hub in Louisville, Ky. "I definitely intend to make a career here."
The UPS deal gave part-time employees, over half the company's unionized work force, a 26 percent raise, to at least $ 21 per hour. Ms. Carlisle makes close to $ 24 an hour and works around 20 hours a week, giving her time to run a bakery on the side, she said. Her friends who have full-time driving jobs at Amazon make around $ 19 an hour, she said.
As big as the raises at UPS were, they did not increase pay by a lot more than inflation. The top wage rate immediately after the latest deal, $ 44.25 per hour, was 22 percent higher than five years earlier. Over that period, consumer prices rose 21 percent.
And UPS typically hires new union workers into part-time jobs, which they hold for a few years. As a result, some people may be unwilling to seek a job at the company.
Even so, last year's Teamsters contract was widely discussed online, spawning memes of UPS drivers arriving at customers' doors in designer clothing.
"Joking or not, everybody was like, 'Hey, man, I need a job at UPS,"' said Juan Martinez, a UPS driver in Southern California.
Under the new contract, Mr. Martinez expects to earn $ 110,000 to $ 120,000 a year, depending on how much overtime he gets, he said. He said his income allowed him to spend more on his children's education.
Under the Teamsters' deal with UPS, the top hourly wage will increase to $ 49 by the end of the five-year contract. Amazon said in January that the average pay of workers at its delivery contractors was $ 20.50 in the United States. FedEx declined to provide an average wage rate for its delivery workers.
Despite UPS's superior pay over the years, the Teamsters have not made many inroads at FedEx or Amazon.
The high turnover of delivery and warehouse workers at Amazon and FedEx -- where each part-time position was on average filled and vacated twice last year -- makes it difficult to organize them.
Another challenge is that delivery workers at Amazon, and drivers who deliver for FedEx Ground, are employed by contractors. Mr. Rosenfeld, the labor academic, said trying to organize a few dozen people at each contractor could be time consuming and costly.
Last year, 84 workers at an Amazon contractor near Los Angeles joined the Teamsters. But days earlier, Amazon terminated the contract with the operator, Battle-Tested Strategies, the company said, for failing to follow proper safety procedures, among other things.
The Teamsters asked the National Labor Relations Board to rule that Amazon was a joint employer of the workers and order the company to reinstate the contract. The board has yet to rule.
A favorable ruling would be "a massive deal" and an "inspiration for thousands of other workers across the country," said Randy Korgan, a Teamsters official.
Johnathon Ervin, the owner of Battle-Tested Strategies, said he believed Amazon had terminated the contract, which led to job losses for all his employees, because of the unionization effort. An Amazon spokeswoman, Mary Kate Paradis, disputed that.
Mr. Ervin said the minimum pay for his workers under the Amazon contract was $ 19.75. "If you are asking people to make this a career, you should have better work conditions and pay the drivers more," said Mr. Ervin, a 26-year Air Force veteran.
Amazon didn't respond directly to that criticism. The company noted that its contractors, which it refers to as delivery service partners, had created 279,000 driving jobs over the last five years.
"Helping D.S.P.s create a good overall working experience is important to us, which is why we've invested more than $ 8 billion in state-of-the-art technology, safety features, rates, programs and services for Amazon D.S.P.s and their drivers," Ms. Paradis said in a statement.
Labor groups have made some gains at Amazon, including organizing workers at a Staten Island warehouse. But Amazon is challenging the election there, and that union has been embroiled in infighting.
At FedEx there is another potential barrier to unionization.
FedEx was founded as an airline, and employees of its Express business come under the Railway Labor Act, which requires unions to organize nationally, across a whole company, at once. Union officials say it's easier to hold individual votes at each company location as allowed under the National Labor Relations Act, which governs workers at UPS and automakers.
Even so, some FedEx employees do belong to a union. Nearly 6,000 pilots at FedEx Express are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association. The Teamsters are trying to organize the mechanics who work on the company's planes.
FedEx said its delivery workers had benefited from not being in a union because the company raised wages significantly during the home-delivery boom of 2021 and 2022, when UPS workers' raises were set by an agreement reached before the pandemic. A FedEx spokeswoman noted that the company incurred an additional $ 1.4 billion in labor costs in its 2022 fiscal year.

Last year, two unions representing workers at three large automakers and UPS negotiated new labor contracts that included big raises and other gains. Leaders of the unions — the United Auto Workers and the Teamsters — hoped the wins would help them organize workers across their industry.
The UAW won one vote to unionize a Volkswagen factory in Tennessee last month and lost one this month at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama. The Teamsters have made even less progress at UPS’ big nonunion rivals in the delivery business, Amazon and FedEx.
Polling shows that public support for unions is the highest it has been in decades. But labor experts said structural forces would make it hard for labor groups to increase their membership, which is the lowest it has been as a percentage of the total workforce in decades. Unions also face stiff opposition from many employers and conservative political leaders.
The Teamsters provide an instructive case study. Many of the workers doing deliveries for Amazon and FedEx work for contractors, typically small and medium-size businesses that can be hard to organize. And delivery workers employed directly by FedEx in its Express business are governed by a labor law that requires unions to organize all similar workers at the company nationally at once — a tougher standard than the one that applies to organizing employees at automakers, UPS and other employers.
Some labor experts also said the Teamsters had not made as forceful a push as the UAW to organize nonunion workers after securing a new contract with UPS.
“You didn’t have that energy that you saw with the UAW’s leaders,” said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies labor at Washington University in St. Louis.
Teamsters officials said the UPS deal, which increases the average annual compensation, including benefits, of a UPS driver to $170,000 from $145,000, was helping them gain members. At DHL, a delivery company where the union has long had a big presence, the union added 1,100 members last year and is pushing to gain another 1,500. The Teamsters are also pursuing a legal challenge against Amazon that could allow them to gain ground at the company and its contractors.
“It’s been very helpful for us to mobilize,” Sean O’Brien, the Teamsters’ president, said in an interview, referring to the UPS contract. “We’ve set the standard in the industry.”
But the union has also suffered losses. Yellow, a trucking company that employed 24,000 Teamsters, shut down and filed for bankruptcy protection last year.
Amazon and FedEx said they were confident in their approach to managing and compensating workers. Amazon said it had made investments that bolstered pay and benefits at its delivery contractors. FedEx said its nonunion model allowed it to quickly increase pay whereas UPS’ union employees were bound by the terms of five-year contracts.
“Our culture, built and tested over 50 years, is based on the philosophy that if we take care of our people, they will deliver outstanding service for our customers, which will drive business results for our company,” Tracy Brightman, FedEx’s chief people officer, said in a statement,

U.A.W. Asks Officials to Redo Union Vote at Alabama Plants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The union, which lost an organizing vote at two factories last week, argued to federal officials that the automaker had violated labor laws.
A week after losing a hard-fought election at two Mercedes-Benz factories in Alabama, the United Automobile Workers asked federal officials on Friday to order a new vote, saying the German carmaker violated labor laws to suppress support for the union.
Mercedes-Benz conducted a "relentless anti-union campaign" marked by "wanton lawlessness," the U.A.W. said in a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board. Among other things, the union said, Mercedes fired four employees who supported the union, prevented pro-union employees from campaigning and forced employees to watch anti-union videos.
Workers at the Mercedes factories outside Tuscaloosa, which manufacture sport utility vehicles and battery packs, voted 56 percent to 44 percent against joining the union. But the labor board can order a new election if, after a hearing, a regional director determines that improper conduct by an employer affected the vote, a spokeswoman for the board said.
Mercedes denied that it had used improper methods to defeat the union drive. A majority of workers "indicated they are not interested in being represented by the U.A.W.," the company said in a statement on Friday.
"Throughout the election, we worked with the N.L.R.B. to adhere to its guidelines, and we will continue to do so," Mercedes said.
The Alabama result interrupted a string of victories by the U.A.W. in the South, including persuading a large majority of the workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., to vote to join the union and securing substantial pay raises in a new contract with Daimler Truck in North Carolina.
Organizing workers in Southern states, which have long been hostile to unions, is a high priority for the U.A.W. The region is attracting a large share of the billions of dollars that companies are investing in electric-car and battery factories.
By the same token, Southern elected leaders like Alabama's governor, Kay Ivey, a Republican, have worked to keep unions out, seeing them as a threat to their ability to attract more factories and jobs.

Yellen Warns China Excess Is Grave Risk: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen warned that China's industrial strategy posed a global threat that requires a united response.
Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said on Tuesday that the United States and Europe needed to work together to push back against China's excess industrial capacity, warning that a wave of cheap Chinese exports represents a grave threat to the global economy.
Ms. Yellen's remarks, delivered during a speech in Germany, highlighted what is expected to be a central topic of discussion when the Group of 7 finance ministers meet in Italy this week.
"China's industrial policy may seem remote as we sit here in this room, but if we do not respond strategically and in a united way, the viability of businesses in both our countries and around the world could be at risk," Ms. Yellen said at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, where she received an honorary doctoral degree.
China's excessive production of green energy technology has become a pressing trans-Atlantic concern in recent months. Officials in President Biden's administration have grown increasingly worried that his efforts to finance domestic manufacturing of clean energy and other next-generation technologies will be undercut by China, which is churning out steel, electric cars and solar panels at a rapid clip.
The Biden administration is now looking to Europe to help the developed world prevent the kind of China shock of the early 2000s, which helped decimate manufacturing in exchange for cheap goods. Last week, Mr. Biden increased tariffs on some Chinese imports, including levying a 100 percent tax on electric vehicles. He also formally left in place levies on more than $ 300 billion worth of Chinese goods that President Donald J. Trump had imposed.
The United States hopes that a united front will convince China that its largest trading partners are prepared to erect trade barriers that will prevent Chinese electric vehicles, batteries and panels from dominating Western markets.
Ms. Yellen emphasized on Tuesday that the United States was not trying to carry out an anti-China policy, but said China's actions posed a threat to the global economy that warranted a coordinated response.
She pointed to China's push to dominate clean energy technology and other sectors, saying that ambition "could also prevent countries around the world, including emerging markets, from building the industries that could power their growth."
The trend toward protectionist policies is likely to become another point of contention between China and the world's most advanced economies. Liu Pengyu, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, derided Mr. Biden's decision to impose new tariffs on Chinese goods last week as a "political maneuver."
"We hope the U.S. can take a positive view of China's development and stop using overcapacity as an excuse for trade protectionism," Mr. Liu said.
The new U.S. tariffs could put additional pressure on Europe to erect trade barriers of its own to prevent China from redirecting more of its exports there. Europe's officials are already considering additional levies on Chinese cars, which pose a particular threat to Germany.
About 37 percent of all electric vehicle imports to Europe are produced in China, including Chinese brands and ones made by Tesla and German automakers with plants there. Europe is the world's second-biggest E.V. market, and imports there skyrocketed last year to $ 11.5 billion, from $ 1.6 billion in 2020.
The European Commission is investigating whether Chinese state subsidies intended to help the country's companies make cheap cars are damaging Europe's auto industry. The sector provides nearly 14 million direct and indirect jobs in Europe, and the six million cars that it exported last year generated a trade surplus of more than 100 billion euros.
Europe's investigation could result in preliminary duties on Chinese electric vehicle imports as soon as July, though any tariffs are likely to be far lower than the 100 percent imposed by the Biden administration. But unlike Europe, which is already importing cars from China, the United States has erected several barriers to prevent Chinese E.V.s from coming to its shores.
Europe's investigation into China's subsidies and whether they merit tariffs has aggravated a political divide. Some countries, such as Germany, which is Europe's biggest maker of electric cars, have been against an investigation. German officials are wary of pressing penalties that might incite Beijing to shut out German carmakers such as BMW and Volkswagen.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a speech in Stockholm last week, "We should not forget: European manufacturers, and also some American ones, are successful on the Chinese market and also sell a lot of vehicles that are produced in Europe to China." He added that at least half of electric vehicles imported to Europe from China were Western brands.
Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, has been pushing for "de-risking" Europe's relationship with China. Her approach is backed by President Emmanuel Macron of France, who hosted his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, this month and has urged Brussels to step up protection against what his administration sees as unfair Chinese competition.
The Brussels investigation has focused less on whether China is dumping large numbers of cars into Europe and more on how subsidies have allowed E.V.s made by BYD, Geely and SAIC, the three biggest Chinese E.V. makers, to offer cut-rate prices. The Chinese government has criticized the European Union for not investigating Western brands with factories in China -- including Tesla, which exports more E.V.s from China to the European Union than any other producer.
The Rhodium Group, an independent think tank that focuses on China, said that to compensate for Chinese state subsidies, the European Commission would have to impose duties of up to 50 percent on Chinese E.V.s. But the group suggested that such a move would be unlikely in Europe unless officials took a more "drastic" review of World Trade Organization rules, and suggested that tariff rates of 15 to 30 percent were more realistic.
In the meantime, Chinese electric vehicle makers, including BYD and Great Wall Motor, are setting up factories in Hungary to build cars that would be viewed as European-made products, which could raise trade issues eventually with the United States.
The Biden administration is watching with similar concern as Chinese car companies invest in factories in Mexico, which could potentially be used to enter the U.S. market.
Following her speech, Ms. Yellen told reporters that the United States and countries in Europe have different concerns when it comes to commerce with China and, as a result, they could use different tools to address them. But she added that because many of the concerns about China's heavy subsidization of exports are broadly shared, it is "more forceful to communicate to China as a group."
The approach by the United States and Europe to work together to confront China does pose the risk of retaliation, inflaming trade tensions that could weigh on the world economy. Chinese officials said last week that they would respond to the new trade measures imposed by the United States.
In an interview with The New York Times this week, Ms. Yellen argued that the new U.S. tariffs were targeted and that she did not believe that China wanted to escalate tensions.
"I anticipate some response on China's part, but my hope is that it's moderate and proportional," Ms. Yellen said.

Full text: The report also found that Jaguar Land Rover and Volkswagen bought parts from a supplier the U.S. government had singled out for its practices in Xinjiang.
A congressional investigation found that BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and Volkswagen purchased parts that originated from a Chinese supplier flagged by the United States for participating in forced labor programs in Xinjiang, a far western region of China where the local population is subject to mass surveillance and detentions.
Both BMW and Jaguar Land Rover continued to import components made by the Chinese company into the United States in violation of American law, even after they were informed in writing about the presence of banned products in their supply chain, the report said.
BMW shipped to the United States at least 8,000 Mini vehicles containing the part after the Chinese supplier was added in December to a U.S. government list of companies participating in forced labor. Volkswagen took steps to correct the issue.
The investigation, which was begun in 2022 by the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat, highlights the risk for major automakers as the United States tries to enforce a two-year-old law aimed at blocking goods from Xinjiang. The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act bars goods made in whole or in part in Xinjiang from being imported to the United States, unless the importer can prove that they were not made with forced labor.
In a statement, Mr. Wyden said that "automakers are sticking their heads in the sand and then swearing they can't find any forced labor in their supply chains."
"Somehow, the Finance Committee's oversight staff uncovered what multibillion-dollar companies apparently could not: that BMW imported cars, Jaguar Land Rover imported parts and VW A.G. manufactured cars that all included components made by a supplier banned for using Uyghur forced labor," he added. "Automakers' self-policing is clearly not doing the job."
The part in question is known as a LAN transformer and is part of a system that allows a vehicle's electronic components to communicate with one another. The automakers did not buy the component directly from Sichuan Jingweida Technology Group, also known as JWD, the Chinese manufacturer that was said to have used forced labor. Rather, it was part of an electronic unit they bought from Lear Corporation, a supplier of automotive electrical systems.
Lear said in a statement that it did not have a direct relationship with JWD, but bought the parts through another supplier. When Lear learned that JWD had been added to the forced labor list, the company said, "we promptly notified our customers of products containing these components and worked with our supplier to expeditiously re-source the manufacture of these components to another sub-supplier."
It added, "We take these matters seriously and share the committee's desire to combat forced labor."
The Chinese government runs programs that send groups of people in Xinjiang to work at private companies and farms, and human rights experts say some of these arrangements are coerced. Reports published in the last few years by researchers from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and Sheffield Hallam University had linked JWD to government-sponsored labor transfer programs, including transfers of hundreds of Xinjiang people to the company in 2018. In December, the U.S. government added JWD to a list of companies that have worked with the Xinjiang government to recruit, transport or receive forced labor.
Lear notified all three carmakers in January that it had sold them the JWD part. Volkswagen subsequently voluntarily disclosed to U.S. customs agents that cars then in transit to the United States contained the part. The company arranged to replace the part in U.S. ports before they entered the country.
But the committee said BMW, even after receiving its letter from Lear, continued to import that part and thousands of Mini vehicles containing it until at least April. BMW appeared to have stopped its imports only after the committee repeatedly questioned it about JWD, according to the report.
BMW said in a statement that it had taken steps to halt imports of the components and would voluntarily replace the parts in vehicles that contained them. "The BMW Group has strict standards and policies regarding employment practices, human rights and working conditions, which all our direct suppliers must follow," the company said.
Jaguar Land Rover also received the letter from Lear in January, but told the committee that its North American subsidiary was not informed about it, according to the report. The company continued importing the JWD component until shortly after April 22, when Lear reiterated the information to Jaguar Land Rover.
Jaguar Land Rover said the parts were used in older vehicles no longer for sale and were imported only as replacements. The company, which is based in Britain, said that when it learned that the parts were on the forced labor list, it immediately stopped shipping them and earmarked them for destruction.
"JLR takes human rights and forced labor issues seriously and has an active ongoing program of human rights protection and antislavery measures," the company said in a statement.
Volkswagen also continues to maintain a facility in Xinjiang through a joint venture with a Chinese state-owned company. Volkswagen told the committee that an outside firm audited the facility and found it free of forced labor in 2023, but it declined to provide Congress a full copy of the audit.
Volkswagen said in a statement that "we acted as quickly and responsibly as possible to replace the part" and comply with the law.
"Volkswagen takes allegations of human rights violations very seriously and is committed to preventing the use of forced labor in our supply chain," the company said.
China denies the existence of forced labor and human rights abuses in Xinjiang. According to the U.S. government, from 2017 to 2019 the Chinese authorities in Xinjiang detained over one million ethnic Uyghurs and other minorities in re-education centers.
Today, high rates of imprisonment and many forms of political indoctrination continue, according to a report from the Congressional Research Service. The New York Times has also documented China's program of mass detentions in Xinjiang.
China is the world's largest car market and the fastest growing. The country accounted for about one-third of the cars that BMW and Volkswagen sold in the first quarter, and about one-fifth of Jaguar Land Rover sales.
But foreign carmakers have been fighting to maintain market share amid an onslaught of new Chinese competitors focused on electric vehicles. And it has become increasingly difficult for foreign carmakers to maintain a good rapport with the Chinese government while adhering to human rights standards of the United States and Europe.
Cars have tens of thousands of components, and the JWD part lies several layers deep in the supply chain of these major automakers. Still, the Senate committee said the incidents underscored the inadequacy of current systems used to identify forced labor, like questionnaires, self-reporting and limited audits of direct suppliers.
Richard Mojica, a customs attorney at Miller & Chevalier, said automakers faced an "enormous" task in trying to trace their full supply chains, partly because they are heavily dependent on the cooperation of direct suppliers, which does not always happen.
The United States "has not yet detained automobiles and automotive components in meaningful quantities," he said. But an uptick in government enforcement could push carmakers and their suppliers to map out these supply networks with more urgency.
Companies buying cotton, tomatoes, solar panels, critical minerals and other goods from China have also grappled with exposure to Xinjiang in their supply chains.
On Thursday, the Biden administration added 26 Chinese textile companies to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act's entity list, citing their ties to forced labor. Mr. Wyden said he would call on U.S. customs to step up enforcement and crack down on violators.

U.A.W. Loss At Mercedes Was a Blow: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: After Mercedes workers voted against joining the United Automobile Workers, the union will have less momentum as it campaigns to organize Southern factories.
After suffering a setback at two Mercedes-Benz plants in Alabama on Friday, the United Automobile Workers union's efforts to organize other auto factories in the South are likely to slow and could struggle to make headway.
About 56 percent of the Mercedes workers who voted rejected the U.A.W. in an election after the union chalked up two major wins this year. In April, workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee voted to join the union, the first large nonunion auto plant in the South to do so. Weeks later, the union negotiated a new contract bringing significant pay and benefit improvements for its members at several North Carolina factories owned by Daimler Truck.
"Losing at Mercedes is not death for the union," said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "It just means they'll have less confidence going to the next plant. The U.A.W. is in it for the long run. I don't think they're going to stop just because they lost here."
Since its founding in 1935, the U.A.W. has almost exclusively represented workers employed by the three Michigan-based automakers: General Motors, Ford Motor, and Chrysler, now part of Stellantis. And it has long struggled to make headway at plants owned by foreign manufacturers, especially in Southern states where anti-union sentiment runs deep.
Workers at the Volkswagen plant had voted against being represented by the U.A.W. twice by narrow margins before the recent union win there. An effort a decade ago to organize one of the Mercedes plants failed to build enough support for an election.
Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, noted that broad union organizing efforts seldom proceeded smoothly. In the 1930s, the U.A.W. won recognition at G.M. and Chrysler but struggled at Ford, which continued employing nonunion workers for a few years.
"I have no doubt they will continue organizing and eventually try for another vote," he said.
In its past efforts in the South, the union was hampered by a negative image, which may have also played a part in the U.A.W.'s loss at Mercedes. For years, the three Michigan automakers were cutting jobs and closing plants, in part because of rigid and costly labor contracts. The union was also hurt by corruption cases that put several former senior officials, including two former U.A.W. presidents, behind bars.
Business leaders in Alabama ran a campaign against the U.A.W. that was based in part on the contention that the union was responsible for the decline of Detroit. In a January opinion essay published in The Alabama Daily News, the chief executive of the Business Council of Alabama, Helena Duncan, said the state would suffer the same fate if workers voted for the union.
"Much of the decay that exists in the 'Motor City' today results from untenable demands that the U.A.W. placed on its automobile manufacturers, an unwise move that sent untold numbers of jobs to right-to-work states like ours and crippled a once great metropolis," Ms. Duncan wrote.
A year ago, the union elected a new president, Shawn Fain, who was untouched by the corruption scandals and vowed to take a more aggressive approach in contract talks. Then last fall, the union came away with substantial pay and benefit gains in negotiations with the Detroit automakers, after targeted strikes over some 40 days. Hundreds of Southern autoworkers began reaching out, asking for help organizing their nonunion plants. The U.A.W. responded by announcing that it would spend $ 40 million on organizing drives over the next two years.
"I'm not scared at all," Mr. Fain said Friday in Alabama after the union lost the Mercedes vote. "I believe workers want unions, I believe they want justice, and we're going to continue doing what we can do."
Mercedes in a statement emphasized its direct relationship with workers and said it looked forward to making sure the company was "not only their employer of choice, but a place they would recommend to friends and family."
The union has signaled that it expects to focus its organizing efforts on another Alabama plant -- a Hyundai factory in Montgomery. But organizing that plant will probably be even harder than the campaign at the Mercedes factories, said Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan business professor who follows the auto industry.
The U.A.W. had allies at Volkswagen and Mercedes. Unions are powerful players in Germany, where those two companies are based. Under German law, worker representatives must occupy half the seats on a company's supervisory board, the equivalent of an American board of directors.
Volkswagen and Mercedes both have groups called works councils through which managers and employees discuss and negotiate workplace issues and production plans. In its drive at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, the U.A.W. had the support of the company's works council and IG Metall, the powerful union that represents all German automotive workers.
The U.A.W. won't have that kind of support at Hyundai's Montgomery plant, Mr. Gordon said. "In general, Korean car companies have more adversarial relationships with unions than do the German manufacturers," he said. "Korean companies are less used to sitting together in a conference room with unions."
Last year, weeks after the U.A.W. won pay and benefit increases from the three Michigan-based automakers, Hyundai announced that it would increase its workers' pay sharply over the next four years -- a move widely seen as an attempt to dampen workers' interest in joining the U.A.W.
"The decision to be represented by a union is up to our team members," Hyundai said in a statement.
The Montgomery plant makes two popular sport utility vehicles -- the Tucson and Santa Fe -- and employs about 4,000 workers. An earlier U.A.W. drive to organize the plant in 2016 petered out without coming to a vote.
Last fall, the union said it planned to target plants owned by 10 foreign-owned automakers -- Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo -- and others owned by Tesla, which is based in Texas, and two smaller electric vehicle start-ups, Lucid and Rivian, both based in California.
The U.S. plants owned by those foreign and U.S. companies employ nearly 150,000 workers in 13 states, the union said.
In Alabama, however, the U.A.W. faced perhaps a more hostile environment than anywhere else. While it was campaigning at Mercedes, Gov. Kay Ivey spoke out against the union and headed a group of six Southern governors, all Republicans, who issued a letter suggesting unionizing could cause automakers to move jobs out of their states. One senior Alabama politician described the U.A.W. as "leeches."
Mercedes brought in Nick Saban, the hugely popular former football coach at the University of Alabama, to talk to workers in an effort to persuade them to vote against the U.A.W.
Unions are traditionally seen as a Northern institution and are often linked with the civil rights movement, which alienates many people in Alabama, Mr. Gordon said. "It's a very tough place for the U.A.W.," he said.
That antipathy could also make it hard for the U.A.W. to negotiate contracts guaranteeing its members raises and other gains even if it wins unionizing votes. Lawmakers who oppose unions may put pressure on employers not to make big concessions in negotiations.
Mr. Fain and the U.A.W. have argued that unions are the best way for workers to demand higher wages when automakers are enjoying strong sales and profits in North America.
Public support of unions is stronger than it has been in years, including in the South. This year, 600 workers at an electric bus factory in Alabama voted to join the Communications Workers of America union. A week ago, they negotiated a new contract delivering pay raises and enhanced benefits.
The U.A.W. and other unions also have enjoyed the support of President Biden, who last fall joined striking autoworkers on a picket line in Michigan. The union endorsed Mr. Biden in this year's election.
But that close association with the president may also hurt the U.A.W. with conservative workers in a Southern state who prefer Mr. Biden's opponent -- former President Donald J. Trump. Mr. Fain and Mr. Trump have often criticized each other, but polls have shown that a sizable minority of union households support the former president.

This Trend-Spotter Lives Above the Store: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Faith Popcorn blends work and life in her Upper East Side townhouse.
Faith Popcorn, thought leader, trend-spotter and flamboyant futurist, never saw townhouse ownership in her own future.
In the early 1990s, Ms. Popcorn (originally Plotkin) was living in a small studio apartment with a Murphy bed, a rental turned co-op. She felt wonderfully comfortable there -- until a friend from California, who "had this gorgeous place in Beverly Hills," came to visit. "She embarrassed me," Ms. Popcorn recalled. "She said: 'You are moving! This is ridiculous."'
The implicit message: Ms. Popcorn needed at long last to act like an adult.
She is, in fact, skittish about revealing her age, preferring to say she is a decade younger than Willie Nelson, whom she adores and who just turned 91. (Go ahead and do the math -- we'll wait.) But Ms. Popcorn is happy to have it known that her consulting firm, BrainReserve, which provides marketing advice to companies like PepsiCo, Home Depot, Pfizer, American Express and Comcast, celebrates its 50th anniversary this month. These days, she works from home: The Upper East Side townhouse she bought in 1995 serves as home and headquarters.
"We've had so many different kinds of people here, company presidents and chairmen, no names but heads of countries," Ms. Popcorn said. "We brainstorm. We think together." And because many of BrainReserve's clients run Fortune 500 companies, and many of those top executives are men, the house is decorated in a sort of corporate baronial style.
"I chose the furniture with the goal in mind of making men comfortable," Ms. Popcorn said of the custom-made sofas and chairs, many tufted and all upholstered in velvet. "It's not about big and small but about neutral colors."
There is blue-gray velvet in the ground-floor entryway and taupe velvet in the second-floor living room, a space that can seat 18.
Ms. Popcorn owns more than 35 pieces of Palissy majolica, between the townhouse and her home in Wainscott, N.Y. She became interested in the ceramic style after reading about it in Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past." "I love animals of all shapes and kinds," she said, "and Palissy's vases and plates with snakes, fish, lizards and snails lying pondside celebrate abundant animal life."
The Pullman kitchen between the living room and the dining room, one of three kitchens in the house, is hidden by a wine-colored velvet curtain.
But the silver bar cart, about the size of a vintage Volkswagen, is out by the staircase, fully stocked and always open for business.
As soon as she found this narrow five-story stucco building in Lenox Hill, Ms. Popcorn was a goner. "It was like a canal house," she said. "Beautiful."
The real estate agent said it was in foreclosure. Ms. Popcorn said she didn't have any money. But her company was doing well, and she ran the numbers: If she gave up her office space on Madison Avenue and moved operations to the house, she could swing it.
"I didn't realize at the time that the house needed everything," Ms. Popcorn said. "I made so many rookie errors. It was the longest closing in Citibank history. I didn't have the guts. I thought, Oh, I'll just lose the 10 percent deposit."
But, Ms. Popcorn continued, "I squeaked through somehow, and then I was so happy because a couple of years later, I adopted my first daughter." Later, she adopted another daughter. Their childhood portraits, painted by Joe Duffy, an artist and designer, are on display in the dining room on the second floor.
Ms. Popcorn bought the Warhol prints from the writer Fran Lebowitz. "She must have needed the money," Ms. Popcorn said. "I know they were for sale, and at the time I didn't have any money. I really did not have money, and I think Fran wanted $ 1,000 a piece for them. But a friend told me, 'Buy them.' Everything seems cheap in retrospect."
Ms. Popcorn is fond of saying she lives above the store. In fact, her bedroom and study are above the living room and dining room, the site of business meetings and business meals.
There's more Palissy majolica above the fireplace.
When Ms. Popcorn was worried about taking on the expense of the house, her sister told her that their grandmother, who had owned several buildings in Lower Manhattan, would have wanted her to have it. That fortified her to complete the transaction and to undertake a comprehensive renovation.
Standing on the terrace, she said, "At some point I realized that my bedroom here was at exactly the tree line of where it was when I stayed at my grandmother's apartment."
In the '80s, Ms. Popcorn accurately foretold the trends of "cocooning," the desire to isolate from a scary world, and "icon toppling," the rejection of pillars of society like government and religion. Another term she coined, "cashing out," from the early 1990s, recognized the eagerness to find work/life balance -- and to leave the corporate world altogether. And Ms. Popcorn came up with "AtmosFear" long before climate change and Covid-19 became front-page news.
Visitors to the home seem to expect something straight out of tomorrowland. "Everybody who comes here is like, 'Oh!"' Ms. Popcorn noted. "Maybe they're surprised it's retro. But I didn't want clients to be in something that felt like a spaceship. I felt I should put them in an unchallenging, comfortable place not defined by time."
It's clear from the look of her study on the third floor that Ms. Popcorn, too, prizes comfort. Throw pillows crowd the sofa. More velvet -- here, it's claret-colored. Several pieces of majolica are on the mantelpiece ...
... along with ceramic Japanese Chins, a tribute to the seven members of the breed Ms. Popcorn has had over the years.
Behind her desk are photos of Judy Garland. "When I was young, people told me I looked like her," she said.
Guests tend to fall into one of two categories: friends running away from their own homes (there's a very nice guest room with a compact kitchen on the top floor) or clients buffeted by ill winds and tough choices.
"We're helping them reposition their companies," Ms. Popcorn said. "No matter what decade you're in, the future is painful because the future means change. It means rethinking things. Sometimes it means they have to buy new technology. It means figuring out if they have enough of this or that thing."
Ms. Popcorn likens her house to a refined version of the Factory, Andy Warhol's New York City studio. "I love the fact that he worked there, he entertained there, he was crazy there," she said. "My feeling is that if you love your work and you love your life, there is no need to separate them. It's one big, beautiful thing."

Full text: Naval Vessel's Tuneup Attracts a Following
Readers responded at nytimes.com to Tracey Tully's article last Sunday about a dry-dock visit by the Battleship New Jersey to Philadelphia for maintenance. Comments were edited. I served on the New Jersey as a midshipman in the summer of 1956. It was a great experience for a kid from Ohio. Firing those 16-inch guns was something you never forget. I am pleased to see she is being well taken care of.
David G. Sutliff, St. Augustine, Fla.
Reporting for Stars and Stripes, I covered the last few days of the Battleship New Jersey's deployment off Vietnam. Every aspect of its mission that I saw was carried out with precision and professionalism. This included firing support for Marines operating near the Demilitarized Zone with rounds as large as Volkswagen Beetles fired from its big guns. I wish I could find photos from the assignment or at least clippings from Stars and Stripes, which carried shots from a side view of smoke flashing out of the guns. It was one of my favorite assignments.
Tom Gable, Del Mar, Calif.
My first midshipman summer cruise was on the Battleship Iowa. It was the summer of 1956 and the Iowa, and the Battleship New Jersey sailed from Norfolk, Va., to carry hundreds of midshipmen to various ports in Europe. Born and raised near Greensboro, N.C., I was very excited about meeting Europeans. It was the first time that I had been out of the state except the trip to Norfolk. We raced the New Jersey across the Atlantic. I can't remember which ship won the race, but I do remember that we were making 40 knots and that that beautifully designed ship was a marvel. We went through various exercises to train on how the boilers and turbines worked, auxiliary equipment like the evaporators, which made freshwater for the ship, and how to fire the various types of guns on these platforms. I toured Lord Nelson's flagship, the H.M.S. Victory at Portsmouth, saw the chalk cliffs of Dover and met girls in England, Germany and Denmark.
James Jordan, Falls Church, Va.
Always a sad story: a ship of such history being retired, but fortunately not scrapped. I have always regretted not being able to obtain a small piece of the ship I served on, the aircraft carrier Franklin D. Roosevelt, which was scrapped in 1963, a year after I was discharged -- an odd attachment given that I was not fond of military service, but the view over our shoulder is that way, isn't it?
Barry Moyer, Washington
I am so happy and proud that the New Jersey was not scrapped like all of her kindred ships. She's a tremendous symbol of American heroism and determination that's rapidly evaporating. Yes, one day she'll also be scrapped. But as someone who remembers her still in service, I'm happy that she'll probably be floating for the rest of my life.

Workers Reject Bid in Alabama For Auto Union: [National Desk]

Full text: The election, fiercely opposed by the state's political leaders, was seen as a test of the United Automobile Workers' ability to unionize factories in the South.
Workers at two Mercedes-Benz factories near Tuscaloosa, Ala., voted on Friday against allowing the United Automobile Workers to represent them, a stunning blow to the union's campaign to gain ground in the South, where it has traditionally been weak.
The defeat came after Kay Ivey, Alabama's governor, and other Republican leaders argued that a pro-union vote would choke off the investment that has transformed the state into a major auto producer. The union's setback dims the chances that it will be able to quickly organize workers at Hyundai and Honda, which also have large factories in Alabama.
The vote had national significance as a test of whether the U.A.W. could build on a string of recent victories and make strides in a state whose elected officials have been hostile to organized labor. The union has said it wants to organize every automobile factory in the United States, expanding its membership to include the employees of companies like Toyota and Tesla.
But the loss at the Mercedes plants will almost surely slow down the union's campaign and probably force it to do more spadework to secure the support of workers before seeking to hold elections at other auto plants. Union leaders will want to spend time figuring out how best to counter the messages and tactics of local lawmakers and company executives.
"This loss stings," Shawn Fain, the president of the U.A.W., said at the storefront headquarters of the union's local branch down the road from the Mercedes factories in Vance and Woodstock, Ala.
But "most of us lost elections in our lives," he added. "We learn from it. We move forward, and that's what we intend to do."
Mercedes workers voted 56 percent to 44 percent against joining the union, according to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election. Close to 4,700 ballots were cast, representing a large majority of the 5,075 employees who were eligible to vote.
Auto executives and conservative lawmakers are likely to closely study the vote at Mercedes to figure out the best approaches to fend off the U.A.W. and other unions in future contests and to deter union campaigns from the get-go.
"The workers in Vance have spoken, and they have spoken clearly!" Ms. Ivey said in a statement. "Alabama is not Michigan, and we are not the sweet home to the U.A.W."
The South has become an important battleground. States like Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee are attracting much of the billions of dollars that automakers and suppliers are investing in electric vehicle and battery factories. The U.A.W. wants to represent workers at those factories.
Mercedes produces sport utility vehicles in Vance and battery packs for electric vehicles in Woodstock. Polling had been underway all week at the two factories.
"We thank all team members who asked questions, engaged in discussions and, ultimately, made their voices heard on this important issue," the company said in a statement on Friday.
In a campaign conducted largely by word of mouth, union activists argued that in addition to better pay and benefits, the U.A.W. would protect Mercedes workers from abrupt changes in their schedules and long shifts, including on weekends.
"If it wasn't for us building those cars, you wouldn't be putting the money that you're putting in your pockets," said Kay Finklea, who works in quality control at Mercedes and campaigned for the union. "So treat us with dignity, treat us with respect and pay us."
But activists acknowledged that many workers who were unhappy with working conditions at Mercedes were also reluctant to join the union, swayed by warnings from company executives and politicians that membership would lead to onerous dues and loss of control over their jobs.
Mercedes tried hard to block the union. Last month, in an apparent attempt to address employee complaints, the company shook up local management, appointing Federico Kochlowski as chief executive of the German company's U.S. unit.
Mr. Kochlowski, who has worked at Mercedes for about 20 years in various manufacturing positions in China, Mexico and the United States, acknowledged that there were problems at the Alabama plants and promised to make improvements.
"I understand that many things are not OK," he said in a video posted by Mercedes online. "Give me a shot."
Bart Moore, who works in material handling at Mercedes delivering parts to the assembly line, said he was hopeful that Mr. Kochlowski would follow through on his promises. "We'll see what he comes through with," Mr. Moore said. "You never know."
The U.A.W. has filed six charges of unfair labor practices against Mercedes with the labor relations board, saying the company disciplined employees for discussing unionization at work, prevented organizers from distributing union materials, conducted surveillance of workers and fired workers who supported the union.
"This company, like most others, operated off the same playbook of fear, threats, intimidation," Mr. Fain said Friday.
Mercedes denies the claims.
Past attempts by the U.A.W. to represent workers at Mercedes and other automakers in the South had failed. But the U.A.W. is stronger than it has been in years after winning a unionization vote last month at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee where it previously lost two elections. The union also won hefty pay raises last year for workers at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram.
Mercedes's campaign against the union "had way more effect than we anticipated," said Robert Lett, who works in the Woodstock battery factory and campaigned for the union. But he said the union would try again.
"It doesn't change our resolve," Mr. Lett said of the loss. "The fire is there for a change."

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — Workers at two Mercedes-Benz factories near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, voted Friday against allowing the United Auto Workers to represent them, a stunning blow to the union’s campaign to gain ground in the South, where it has traditionally been weak.

Turning Point As Auto Union Eyes Alabama: [National Desk]

Full text: Southern political leaders say a win for the United Automobile Workers would threaten their economies. Activists want to strike a blow against a system they say exploits the poor.
More than 5,000 Mercedes-Benz workers in Alabama are voting this week on whether to join the United Automobile Workers union, a decision both supporters and opponents say will have consequences far beyond two factories near Tuscaloosa where the German carmaker churns out luxury sport utility vehicles and batteries for electric cars.
Conservative political leaders have portrayed the union campaign to organize Mercedes workers as an assault by outsiders on the region's economy and way of life. The vote tally is expected to be released by federal officials on Friday.
Six Southern governors, including Kay Ivey, an Alabama Republican, issued a statement last month criticizing unions as "special interests looking to come into our state and threaten our jobs and the values we live by." Alabama recently passed a law intended to discourage union organizing.
For the union, a win would add to a string of victories in the South, where organized labor has traditionally been weak, and provide momentum to the U.A.W.'s efforts to win over workers at other nonunion automakers like Hyundai, Toyota, Honda and Tesla.
If the U.A.W. loses, it could sharply slow down a campaign by the union's president, Shawn Fain, to organize auto and battery plants across the country. That effort began after the union last fall reached new contracts with hefty pay raises and other benefits for workers at General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram.
In Alabama, which was a crucible of the civil rights movement, union organizers and supporters cast the Mercedes campaign as part of a decades-long struggle to dismantle an economic system based on exploitation of poor people.
"You are not just fighting for a union," Bishop William Barber II, an activist and professor at the Yale Divinity School, told a group of organizers, workers and supporters at a Montgomery church on Monday. "You are fighting for justice."
U.A.W. supporters were optimistic as workers cast their ballots at a Mercedes car factory in Vance, Ala., and at a company-owned factory in nearby Woodstock that assembles battery packs for electric vehicles. The National Labor Relations Board is overseeing the weeklong polling.
"I feel like we have the upper hand right now," said Sammie Ellis, a union organizer who installs wiring in Mercedes vehicles. He spoke outside a cluttered storefront office down the road from the factory in Vance where activists seated on folding chairs plotted strategy amid piles of placards with slogans like "Mercedes Workers United" and "End the Alabama Discount."
The Alabama discount is a reference to what union activists say is the state's main attraction to investors: low wages and compliant workers. "They come to take advantage of how Alabama workers are living in poorer conditions than workers in other parts of the country," said Joe Cleveland, an official with an International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers local in Anniston, Ala.
Mercedes said in a statement that the company "has a proven record of competitively compensating team members and providing many additional benefits."
Workers who have been at Mercedes for four years can earn $ 34 an hour, and some employees say they are grateful for the way the company has treated them.
"Mercedes has done a lot for me," Yolanda Berry, a team leader at the carmaker, said in a video posted on X by Autos Drive America, an industry association that represents Mercedes and other foreign automakers with plants in the United States. Ms. Berry said she had earned less than $ 14 an hour at a previous job.
The U.A.W. is on a roll in the South after workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., voted in April to be represented by the union. Also that month, the union won significant pay raises for Daimler Truck workers in North Carolina. A victory at Mercedes, which became a separate company from Daimler Truck in 2021, would bolster the union in its next campaign, organizing workers at a Hyundai factory in Montgomery, about 100 miles south of Tuscaloosa.
The South Korean company produces S.U.V.s at the Montgomery plant, including the Tucson and Santa Fe models. Union organizers are also targeting a Honda factory in Lincoln, Ala., where the Japanese company makes S.U.V.s and pickups. But that effort is in its early stages.
On Monday, about 50 activists and Hyundai workers gathered at Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Montgomery to sing union fight songs and hear from Bishop Barber.
Paraphrasing the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Bishop Barber accused Southern political leaders of pitting races against each other. They fear Blacks "and poor whites uniting together and forming a voting bloc that does fundamentally reshape the economic architecture of the country and of the state," he said.
Opposition to the union from Alabama's Republican political leadership has been intense. After likening the U.A.W. to "leeches," Nathaniel Ledbetter, the Republican speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives, helped push through a law that denies state funding to companies that voluntarily recognize unions.
The law will not directly affect the Mercedes vote, but it reflected the state of alarm among Republicans with close ties to business interests and their determination to stop union advances. Ms. Ivey signed the bill into law on Monday.
A spokeswoman for Ms. Ivey declined a request for an interview, referring to public statements she has made on the issue.
"Unionization would certainly put our states' jobs in jeopardy," Ms. Ivey said in a statement she issued with the governors of Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, all Republicans.
Mr. Ledbetter's office did not respond to requests for comment.
A union drive at the Hyundai factory in Alabama in 2016 failed, but activists say things have changed. "The first time around, people were easily intimidated and scared by anti-union tactics," said Quichelle Liggins, who has worked at the Hyundai factory for 12 years. "This time, we're ready."
In an apparent effort to blunt the appeal of a union, Hyundai was one of several automakers that raised worker pay after the U.A.W. won gains for members at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis. The raises at Hyundai, announced in November, amounted to 14 percent over the previous year, according to the company.
But pay is not the only issue for many autoworkers in Alabama. Ms. Liggins, a single mother of two, said she hoped a union would protect people like her from long hours and unpredictable work schedules. "I had a manager tell me my job was more important than my family," she said.
In a statement, Hyundai said, "We are deeply committed to supporting quality jobs that pay competitive salaries and offer industry-leading benefits."
The company said that, with rare exceptions, it gave employees 30 days of notice about changes to their schedules. Employees are not required to work more than 10 hours a day, Hyundai said in a statement, and overtime is voluntary except during the introduction of a new model when repair and quality control teams may be required to work longer.
Mercedes, based in Stuttgart, Germany, is used to dealing with unions in its home country, where by law half the members of the company's supervisory board represent employees. But in Alabama the company has opposed the union campaign. The U.A.W. has even accused the company of using illegal tactics.
The U.A.W. has filed six charges of unfair labor practices against Mercedes with the labor relations board, saying the company disciplined employees for discussing unionization at work, prevented organizers from distributing union materials, conducted surveillance of workers and fired workers who supported the union.
Mercedes denies the claims. The company "has not interfered with or retaliated against any team member in their right to pursue union representation," it said in a statement, adding that it "firmly denies it has made any adverse employment decision based on union affiliation."
Mercedes has also raised pay in recent months and made an effort to give workers more notice about changes in their schedules, workers said. But Mr. Ellis, the activist, said the improvements had come only "because of the union knocking at the door."

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — More than 5,000 Mercedes-Benz workers in Alabama are voting this week on whether to join the United Automobile Workers union, a decision supporters and opponents say will have consequences far beyond two factories near Tuscaloosa where the German carmaker churns out luxury SUVs and batteries for electric cars.
Conservative political leaders have portrayed the union campaign to organize Mercedes workers as an assault by outsiders on the region’s economy and way of life. The vote tally is expected to be released by federal officials Friday.
Six Southern governors, including Kay Ivey, an Alabama Republican, issued a statement last month criticizing unions as “special interests looking to come into our state and threaten our jobs and the values we live by.” Alabama recently passed a law intended to discourage union organizing.
For the union, a win would add to a string of victories in the South, where organized labor has traditionally been weak, and provide momentum to the UAW’s efforts to win over workers at other nonunion automakers like Hyundai, Toyota, Honda and Tesla.
If the UAW loses, it could slow down a campaign by the union’s president, Shawn Fain, to organize auto and battery plants across the country. That effort began after the union last fall reached new contracts with hefty pay raises and other benefits for workers at General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram.
In Alabama, which was a crucible of the civil rights movement, union organizers and supporters cast the Mercedes campaign as part of a decadeslong struggle to dismantle an economic system based on exploitation of poor people.
“You are not just fighting for a union,” Bishop William Barber II, an activist and professor at the Yale Divinity School, told a group of organizers, workers and supporters at a Montgomery church Monday. “You are fighting for justice.”
UAW supporters were optimistic as workers cast their ballots at a Mercedes car factory in Vance, Alabama, and at a company-owned factory in nearby Woodstock that assembles battery packs for electric vehicles. The National Labor Relations Board is overseeing the weeklong polling.
“I feel like we have the upper hand right now,” said Sammie Ellis, a union organizer who installs wiring in Mercedes vehicles. He spoke outside a cluttered storefront office down the road from the factory in Vance where activists seated on folding chairs plotted strategy amid piles of placards with slogans like “Mercedes Workers United” and “End the Alabama Discount.”
The Alabama discount is a reference to what union activists say is the state’s main attraction to investors: low wages and compliant workers. “They come to take advantage of how Alabama workers are living in poorer conditions than workers in other parts of the country,” said Joe Cleveland, an official with an International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers local in Anniston, Alabama.
Mercedes said in a statement that the company “has a proven record of competitively compensating team members and providing many additional benefits.”
Workers who have been at Mercedes for four years can earn $34 an hour, and some employees say they are grateful for the way the company has treated them.
“Mercedes has done a lot for me,” Yolanda Berry, a team leader at the carmaker, said in a video posted on the social platform X by Autos Drive America, an industry association that represents Mercedes and other foreign automakers with plants in the United States. Berry said she had earned less than $14 an hour at a previous job.
The UAW is on a roll in the South after workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, voted in April to be represented by the union. Also that month, the union won significant pay raises for Daimler Truck workers in North Carolina. A victory at Mercedes, which became a separate company from Daimler Truck in 2021, would bolster the union in its next campaign, organizing workers at a Hyundai factory in Montgomery, about 100 miles south of Tuscaloosa.
The South Korean company produces SUVs at the Montgomery plant, including the Tucson and Santa Fe models. Union organizers are also targeting a Honda factory in Lincoln, Alabama, where the Japanese company makes SUVs and pickups. But that effort is in its early stages.
On Monday, about 50 activists and Hyundai workers gathered at Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Montgomery to sing union fight songs and hear from Barber.
Paraphrasing the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Barber accused Southern political leaders of pitting races against each other. They fear Blacks “and poor whites uniting together and forming a voting bloc that does fundamentally reshape the economic architecture of the country and of the state,” he said.
Opposition to the union from Alabama’s Republican political leadership has been intense. After likening the UAW to “leeches,” Nathaniel Ledbetter, the Republican speaker of the Alabama House of Representatives, helped push through a law that denies state funding to companies that voluntarily recognize unions.
The law will not directly affect the Mercedes vote, but it reflected the state of alarm among Republicans with close ties to business interests and their determination to stop union advances. Ivey signed the bill into law Monday.
A spokesperson for Ivey declined a request for an interview, referring to public statements she has made on the issue.
“Unionization would certainly put our states’ jobs in jeopardy,” Ivey said in a statement she issued with the governors of Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, all Republicans.
Ledbetter’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
A union drive at the Hyundai factory in Alabama in 2016 failed, but activists say things have changed. “The first time around, people were easily intimidated and scared by anti-union tactics,” said Quichelle Liggins, who has worked at the Hyundai factory for 12 years. “This time, we’re ready.”
In an apparent effort to blunt the appeal of a union, Hyundai was one of several automakers that raised worker pay after the UAW won gains for members at Ford, GM and Stellantis. The raises at Hyundai, announced in November, amounted to 14% over the previous year, according to the company.
But pay is not the only issue for many autoworkers in Alabama. Liggins, a single mother of two, said she hoped a union would protect people like her from long hours and unpredictable work schedules. “I had a manager tell me my job was more important than my family,” she said.
In a statement, Hyundai said, “We are deeply committed to supporting quality jobs that pay competitive salaries and offer industry-leading benefits.”
The company said that, with rare exceptions, it gives employees 30 days’ notice about changes to their schedules. Employees are not required to work more than 10 hours a day, Hyundai said in a statement, and overtime is voluntary except during the introduction of a new model, when repair and quality control teams may be required to work longer.

Why the U.S. Fears E.V.s From China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Automakers in the United States and their supporters welcomed President Biden's tariffs, saying they would protect domestic manufacturing and jobs from cheap Chinese vehicles.
The Biden administration's new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles won't have a huge immediate impact on American consumers or the car market because very few such cars are sold in the United States.
But the decision reflects deep concern within the American automotive industry, which has grown increasingly worried about China's ability to churn out cheap electric vehicles. American automakers welcomed the decision by the Biden administration on Tuesday to impose a 100 percent tariff on electric vehicles from China, saying those vehicles would undercut billions of dollars of investment in electric vehicle and battery factories in the United States.
"Today's announcement is a necessary response to combat the Chinese government's unfair trade practices that endanger the future of our auto industry," Senator Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said in a statement. "It will help level the playing field, keep our auto industry competitive and support good-paying, union jobs here at home."
On Tuesday, President Biden announced a series of new and increased tariffs on certain Chinese-made goods, including a 25 percent duty on steel and aluminum and 50 percent levies on semiconductors and solar panels. The tariff on electric vehicles made in China was quadrupled from 25 percent. Chinese lithium-ion batteries for electric cars will now face a 25 percent tariff, up from 7.5 percent.
The United States imports only a few makes -- electric or gasoline -- from China. One is the Polestar 2, an electric vehicle made in China by a Swedish automaker in which the Chinese company Zhejiang Geely has a controlling stake. In a statement, Polestar said it was evaluating the impact of Mr. Biden's announcement.
"We believe that free trade is essential to speed up the transition to more sustainable mobility through increased E.V. adoption," the company said.
In the first quarter of this year, Polestar sold just 2,200 vehicles in the United States. Later this year, however, it is scheduled to start producing a new model, the Polestar 3, at a South Carolina plant operated by Volvo Cars, which Geely owns.
Volvo sells a Chinese-made plug-in hybrid sedan, the S90 Recharge, in the United States, and plans to start importing a new small sport utility vehicle, the EX30, to the United States from China this year. The car is expected to start at $ 35,000, making it one of the most affordable battery-powered models available in the country. The model has quickly become Volvo's top-selling vehicle in Europe.
Volvo said on Tuesday that it was evaluating the potential impact of Mr. Biden's new tariffs on its plans.
Internal combustion models that are made in China and sold in the United States include the Buick Envision S.U.V. made by General Motors, and Ford Motors' Lincoln Nautilus. They are unaffected by the tariffs.
Tesla, G.M., Ford, Volkswagen, Hyundai and several other automakers have invested tens of billions of dollars in battery and electric vehicle factories in the United States. But with the exception of Tesla, automakers in the United States, Europe and Japan trail Chinese companies in scale, raw materials production and key technologies.
Contemporary Amperex Technology Company Limited, or CATL, the Chinese manufacturer that is the world's largest producer of electric car batteries, said last month that it had developed a battery that could charge up enough in 10 minutes to allow a car to travel about 370 miles -- a major leap compared with the batteries used by established Western and Asian automakers, including Tesla.
China's lead in electric vehicles, which are seen as central to the auto industry's future, has spurred concerns that Chinese cars could hit the U.S. market at prices that G.M., Ford and other traditional automakers wouldn't be able to compete with.
BYD, a leading and fast-growing Chinese car and battery company, already sells a compact electric car, the Seagull, for less than $ 15,000 in China. And on Tuesday, it said it would begin selling a plug-in hybrid pickup truck in Mexico, although it added that it did not yet plan to sell the vehicle in the United States.
Chinese automakers like BYD, Geely and SAIC have been increasing car exports to Europe, Latin America and various Asian countries. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is investigating Chinese state subsidies to electric carmakers.
Some representatives of the U.S. auto industry have said the Chinese government's support of its automakers has left factories there with the capacity to make vastly more cars than can be sold in the country.
"They've got a major E.V. overcapacity problem," said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the main lobbying arm for U.S. automakers.
"They're building too many E.V.s -- too many heavily subsidized E.V.s -- for the domestic market and have no choice but to look abroad to offload those vehicles at budget prices," Mr. Bozzella added. "The competitiveness of the auto industry in the U.S. will be harmed if heavily subsidized Chinese E.V.s can be sold at below-market prices to U.S. consumers"
Chinese officials have denied that the country is overproducing electric vehicles, solar panels and other products targeted by the Biden administration. "We hope the U.S. can take a positive view of China's development and stop using overcapacity as an excuse for trade protectionism," a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, said on Tuesday.
Automakers have already had a taste of how price competition can disrupt their electric vehicle plans. Over the last year, Tesla has cut prices on its models several times, reducing the costs of some models by more than 20 percent in total. Those cuts, combined with a slowdown in the growth of electric car sales, have made it extremely hard for G.M. and Ford to make money on battery-powered models.
In the first three months of the year, Ford's electric vehicle division lost $ 1.3 billion before taking into account some expenses. Both Ford and G.M. have slowed electric vehicle production and delayed the introduction of new models. While G.M. is losing money on electric cars, the company has said it expects those vehicles to begin generating profits later this year.
The Biden administration has sought to support and encourage the production of batteries and electric vehicles in the United States to address climate change and encourage more domestic manufacturing.
China isn't the only obstacle in the way. Americans' enthusiasm for electric cars has waned over the past year, mainly because such vehicles sell for relatively high prices. Some buyers are also reluctant to buy because they are not sure there will be enough places to charge those cars easily and quickly.
In the first quarter of this year, 269,000 E.V.s were sold in the U.S. market, according to Kelley Blue Book. That was an increase of just 2.6 percent from a year earlier. Total sales of cars and light trucks grew more than 5 percent to 3.8 million vehicles.
"In a lot of ways, buying an E.V. requires a lifestyle change," said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, a market researcher. "A lot of people just say, 'I don't want the hassle of an E.V."'

Ticket Splitting in Battlegrounds Gives Democrats Hope for Senate: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: More than 7,000 U.A.W. workers at Daimler Truck plants in North Carolina are set to strike at midnight in a labor action that could carry political consequences.
Barring a last-minute breakthrough, more than 7,000 workers are set to walk off their truck and bus assembly lines on Friday night in the swing state of North Carolina, injecting the United Automobile Workers' new activism in the South directly into the 2024 election.
North Carolina has never been hospitable to organized labor, and the midnight strike at the North American subsidiary of the German industrial giant Daimler Truck has been greeted with trepidation by the state's Democratic establishment, which has long tried to project a moderate, pro-business bent.
But Shawn Fain, the U.A.W.'s brash new president, doesn't much care.
"We don't expect politicians to save the day, but at the end of the day, politicians have an obligation to the people that elect them," he said in an interview on Thursday, adding: "It's our generation-defining moment. This is a time where politicians need to pick a side."
In September, President Biden joined the picket line of the U.A.W.'s successful strike of the Big Three U.S. automakers, and Thursday, a White House spokeswoman, Robyn Patterson, indicated that the president could be equally aggressive if there was a Daimler walkout.
"President Biden strongly believes that those benefiting from our strong support for manufacturing made in American should work in good faith to do everything possible to ensure jobs -- including those in North Carolina -- remain well-paid, middle-class jobs, and that all workers have a fair and free choice to join a union if they choose," she said.
Democratic leaders in North Carolina, including Gov. Roy Cooper, were far more equivocal -- and deferential -- to Daimler Truck, a major employer in the state.
"North Carolina workers are the best and most productive in the world and need to be paid fairly," Mr. Cooper said in a statement on Thursday. "We're proud that Daimler Trucks and its amazing U.A.W. workers are building the future of electric school bus travel right here in North Carolina, and I will continue to monitor the contract negotiations and urge a swift resolution."
Josh Stein, the Democratic attorney general who is running to replace Governor Cooper, who is term-limited, was similarly careful in a statement.
"North Carolina workers deliver the best products in the world, and they deserve to be valued," he said. "I've been in touch with both parties to encourage them to continue to work toward an agreement that supports workers and enables the company to continue to succeed."
Making matters more delicate, one of the central grievances of the union is the electric vehicle transition pressed by Mr. Biden, in part through the $ 5 billion Clean School Bus Program, which has channeled $ 14 million worth of federal funds directly to Daimler's Thomas Built bus division in High Point, N.C., and millions more through school districts buying Thomas Built electric buses. The union says the workers at the High Point plant are among the lowest paid in the company.
"Our taxpayer dollars aren't being injected into these companies to assist with an E.V. transition just for a few people on top to get rich and leave everybody else behind," Mr. Fain said. "There have to be better standards."
To the U.A.W., a successful strike in the state with the second-lowest percentage of union workers in the country is vital. The six-week work stoppage at the three largest U.S. automakers last fall secured the largest pay raises in decades.
That helped propel U.A.W. organizers into the nonunionized South, where workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee voted overwhelmingly last week to join the union, a breakthrough that created a beachhead for union organizers. Daimler Truck North America is unionized, but U.A.W. officials want to win record wage gains at Daimler's plants in Mount Holly, Cleveland, High Point and Gastonia, N.C., and parts distribution centers in Atlanta and Memphis ahead of an organizing vote next month at Mercedes-Benz in Alabama.
"Our fight at Daimler is intimately connected with something else happening in the South," Mr. Fain told members in a broadcast from Detroit on Tuesday night. "Autoworkers at nonunion auto companies have launched a national movement to unionize."
But Tennessee and Alabama are not in play in 2024. North Carolina is, and Democratic politicians there appear to be reticent hosts.
Mr. Cooper and Mr. Stein have positioned themselves as centrists whose success has revolved around improving education and job training, and diversifying the economy in North Carolina, said Ferrel Guillory, a professor at the University of North Carolina.
"There's no particular upside, politically speaking, for center and center-left Democrats to come across in the same way that a Gretchen Whitmer would," he said, referring to the governor of heavily unionized Michigan. "Cooper and Stein aren't anti-union, but they're not northern politicians either."
In contrast, Mr. Biden has proclaimed himself the "most pro-union president in history" as he has collected union endorsements, the most recent coming on Wednesday from the North America's Building Trades Unions. If Mr. Biden steps in aggressively, he could find himself clashing with North Carolina's top Democrats when the state's highest offices are on the line.
A year ago, the Biden administration appeared to use the leverage provided by federal electric school bus subsidies to help the United Steelworkers unionize Blue Bird, a school bus company in Fort Valley, Ga. Two weeks before the union vote, the Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the Clean School Bus Program, demanded that recipients of federal subsidies detail the benefits they were offering their workers, and required the companies to "remain neutral in any organizing campaign."
This time, an E.P.A. spokesman said, the agency has not engaged with Daimler.
Mr. Fain said on Thursday that the union has worked with the administration, and he laid the responsibility for the possible strike at management's feet. But he was aware of the political ramifications of a major labor action in a swing state.
"You're either going to stand with the working-class people and the people that make this country move and make this world move, or they're going to stand with corporations and business leaders and the billionaires," he said. "And if that's what they choose, then when it comes time to vote, we can see a shift."
Pro-union groups want to see Democrats step up. Ahead of the Volkswagen vote in Chattanooga, Tenn., the Republican governors of Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas issued a statement saying that unionizing would jeopardize auto jobs in their states. Erica Smiley, the executive director of Jobs With Justice, which helps workers seeking to unionize and bargain collectively, said on Thursday that Mr. Cooper should draw a contrast in North Carolina, which has been largely anti-union.
"Workers are doing their part to ask for democracy and to fight for it," she said. "They're giving an opportunity for us and for politicians like Roy Cooper to right centuries of wrongs."
A Daimler spokeswoman, Anja Weinert, said the company was continuing to negotiate "in good faith."
Any new contract should "allow Daimler Truck North America to continue delivering the products that enable our customers to keep the world moving," she said.
The U.A.W. sees it differently. On Thursday, it filed four complaints with Mr. Biden's National Labor Relations Board, accusing Daimler Truck of retaliating against union organizers, interfering with collective bargaining, discriminating against union members and bargaining in bad faith.
The union, which has already endorsed the president's re-election, would clearly like help from Mr. Biden. In talking points ahead of the strike, the U.A.W. leaned into the electric school bus subsidies.
"The government is spending up to $ 345,000 per bus in taxpayer money," union officials wrote. "Meanwhile, the workers who build the product see their quality of life going in the wrong direction. Members are asking: Why should American taxpayer dollars subsidize corporate greed?"

China's E.V. Innovations Worry Rivals Elsewhere: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: More capable autonomous driving is just one way Chinese automakers are threatening to pull ahead -- their E.V.s are also becoming bigger and roomier.
Automakers in China are building a new generation of bigger, more technologically advanced and competitive electric cars, threatening to leap further ahead of their global rivals as they step up exports around the world.
The dozens of car companies operating in China plan to put 71 new battery electric models on sale this year. Many new models have taller hoods for a bolder appearance and more storage space. The cars have bigger tires that improve braking. The seats are thicker and more comfortable. The batteries are ever smaller, more powerful and quicker to recharge.
The changes are aimed at making the cars even more appealing for customers in China and more competitive abroad. Along with plug-in hybrid cars, battery electric cars are taking sales away from gasoline-powered cars and their manufacturers.
China is also moving ahead with the technology and regulations for self-driving cars. The authorities approved data security arrangements this week for more capable autonomous vehicles. They approved cars from Tesla, the American electric vehicle company that also builds and sells cars in China, as well as five Chinese manufacturers, including BYD, Tesla's principal global rival, and Nio, a longtime player in China's auto sector.
The approvals show the Chinese government's eagerness to push the development of self-driving vehicles, which are widely seen as central to future competitiveness in the car industry. The technology is more compatible with battery electric cars than with plug-in hybrids or gasoline-powered cars, and Chinese companies are trying to catch up with Tesla, the leader in these systems.
In the United States, Tesla's so-called Autopilot feature has been the subject of a series of government safety investigations. But in China, regulators and the general public have tended to see the technology as safer than relying on human drivers.
Chinese automakers have been investing heavily in driver-assistance software. An electric car "is becoming a robot on wheels," said Frank Wu, the vice president of design at Jiyue. The company is a joint venture of Zhejiang Geely, a Chinese automaker, and Baidu, one of China's main artificial intelligence companies and Tesla's partner in its self-driving efforts in China.
Better batteries and falling costs underpin China's push in electric cars. CATL, based in southeastern China and the world's largest manufacturer of electric car batteries, announced last week at the Beijing auto show that a 10-minute charge of its newest battery would give a range of 370 miles. A 30-minute full charge would give a range of 620 miles, the company said.
Achieving these distances involves extremely high-precision chemistry and engineering and "putting each nano-particle in the right place," said Gao Huan, the chief technology officer of CATL's electric car business.
The advances have meant automakers can use smaller batteries, freeing up space in cars' interiors, or they can keep the battery the same size and achieve greater range.
Much of the extra space is going into larger back seats with more legroom.
"We're going to put more focus on the backseat -- we want to make it more appealing," said Wang Tan, the general manager of design at XPeng Motors, a Chinese electric car manufacturer.
Manufacturers of electric vehicles used to put a priority on keeping cars as light as possible, because weight is what mostly matters for how far a car can go before needing a recharge. But more powerful batteries now allow electric vehicles to be taller and heavier.
Bigger front ends create a luxurious appearance that taps into many buyers' admiration of sport utility vehicles, said Kris Tomasson, vice president of design at Nio.
"A higher front has that prestige," he said.
Chinese automakers are also embracing designs with more edges, like a blue-green Denza Z9GT sedan displayed at the show by BYD. They are shifting away from lightweight but costly aluminum and building cars with a higher proportion of slightly heavier but cheaper steel alloys.
Aluminum body panels need to be more curved and do not allow for the sharper lines possible with a return to steel, said Stefan Sielaff, Geely's vice president of global design. The effect is to make the cars more visually striking as automotive fashions shift away from the rounded shapes on previous electric cars.
Customers overseas as well as in China are getting pickier. Many are buying plug-in hybrids instead of cars powered only by batteries, although the markets for both are still growing in China.
Not all the electric cars at the Beijing show are bigger and roomier. Xiaomi, a Chinese producer of inexpensive smartphones, displayed its first electric car, the SU7 sports sedan. The tech company has made a move into the car market that Apple has mulled for many years without undertaking.
The SU7 looks almost identical from the outside to a Porsche Taycan electric car. But it costs less than a fifth of a Taycan, which ranges in China from $ 140,000 to $ 275,000.
Lei Jun, the chief executive of Xiaomi, was followed by a crowd of admirers as he walked around the auto show.
He exuded confidence in a speech at the SU7 introduction while still expressing worry about one rival. "Except Tesla, there seems to be hardly anyone better than us," he said.
Chinese auto executives consistently express a mixture of respect and fear of Tesla, an automaker that did not introduce any new cars at the show. Last week, Tesla announced a 9 percent fall in sales and a 55 percent drop in profits in the first quarter of this year, and plans to lay off more than a tenth of its worldwide employees, or 14,000 people.
Long-established Western automakers, by contrast, lag in autonomous driving and are struggling to catch up in electric cars.
General Motors and Ford Motor have lost much of their market share in China over the past five years. Ford introduced the most-talked-about car at the Beijing auto show in 2020, the Mustang Mach-E electric car. But administrative problems led to more than a year of production delays, and public interest evaporated.
Ford decided this year to emphasize very different Mustangs, equipped with hulking five-liter V-8 gasoline engines and four exhaust pipes.
Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chrysler China who is now an electric car industry consultant in Shanghai, said Tesla had emerged as the sole strong global contender from the United States in the electric vehicle market.
"If they ever died, the whole E.V. market dies with it in the United States," he said.
Established companies in Europe also face formidable challenges. China's electric car exports to Europe are climbing, prompting a European Union investigation into whether they are unfairly subsidized.
Ralf Brandstätter, the chief executive of Volkswagen China, called for Chinese manufacturers to buy car parts in Europe and assemble them there using European workers.
"Then they have to handle a European labor force, European enterprises, and they have to compete in the same environment as we are competing," he said. China has used steep tariffs and other measures to require that multinationals make cars in China for the Chinese market.
Chinese E.V.s are going next to the United States.
Geely is exporting its Polestar 2 to the United States from China, and paying a 27.5 percent tariff to do so. It is also beginning to export its new Polestar 3, before a planned shift of production to an assembly line being completed this summer in South Carolina.

On Tour in Europe, Xi Offers an Alternative To a U.S. World Order: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Chinese leader has carefully chosen three countries -- France, Serbia and Hungary -- that to varying degrees embrace Beijing's push for a new global order.
On his first visit to Europe in five years, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, appears intent on seizing opportunities to loosen the continent's bonds with the United States and forge a world freed of American dominance.
The Chinese leader has chosen three countries to visit -- France, Serbia and Hungary -- that all, to a greater or lesser degree, look askance at America's postwar ordering of the world, see China as a necessary counterweight and are eager to bolster economic ties.
At a time of tensions with much of Europe -- over China's "no limits" embrace of Russia despite the war in Ukraine, its surveillance state and its apparent espionage activities that led to the recent arrest in Germany of four people -- Mr. Xi, who arrived in France on Sunday, wants to demonstrate China's growing influence on the continent and pursue a pragmatic rapprochement.
For Europe, the visit will test its delicate balancing act between China and the United States and will no doubt be seen in Washington as a none-too-subtle effort by Mr. Xi to divide Western allies. Chinese-French relations "have established a model for the international community of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation between countries with different social systems," Mr. Xi said in a statement issued soon after he arrived in Paris.
He has timed his arrival at his second stop, Serbia, to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the deadly NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during the Kosovo war. That mistaken strike on May 7, 1999, for which the White House apologized, killed three Chinese journalists and ignited furious protests around the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
"For Xi, being in Belgrade is a very economical way to ask if the United States is really serious about international law," said Janka Oertel, the director of the Asia program at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, "and to say, how about NATO overreach as a problem for other countries?"
The Chinese government has continued to commemorate the Belgrade bombing, using it as an occasion to denounce what it sees as Western hypocrisy and bullying.
"The United States always views itself as the leader -- or hegemon -- of the world, so China is a competitor or adversary that is challenging its hegemony," said Tu Xinquan, the dean of a trade institute at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. "The European Union does not have a hegemonic mind-set."
The official doctrine of the 27-member European Union defines China as "a partner for cooperation, an economic competitor and a systemic rival." If that seems a mouthful, and a perhaps contradictory one, it is because the continent is torn between how to balance economic opportunity in China with national security risk, cybersecurity risk and economic risk to various industries.
In March, China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, told reporters that Europe's formula was unworkable. "It's like driving to a crossing and finding the red, yellow and green lights all on at the same time," he said. "How can one drive on?"
Now, Mr. Xi would like to ease the lights toward green.
To that end, Mr. Xi's first and most important stop will be in France, whose president, Emmanuel Macron, has often made the Gaullist point that Europe "must never be a vassal of the United States," as he did last month at a speech at the Sorbonne. The French leader insists that the survival of the European Union depends on "strategic autonomy" and developing the military resilience to become a "Europe power." He rejects the notion of "equidistance" between China and the United States -- France is one of America's oldest allies -- but wants to keep his options open.
All of this is music to Mr. Xi's ears.
"Macron is trying to bring a third way in the current global chaos," said Philippe Le Corre, a prominent French expert on relations with China. "He is trying to walk a fine line between the two main superpowers."
Just over a year ago, Mr. Macron was lavishly entertained during a visit to China that ended with a Sino-French declaration of a "global strategic partnership." The French leader echoed the Chinese lexicon of a "multipolar" world, freed of "blocs" and the "Cold War mentality."
Now, in anticipation of Mr. Xi's visit, China has praised France as a great power and expressed hopes that their ties "will always be at the forefront of China's relations with Western countries," in the words of Lu Shaye, China's ambassador to France, in People's Daily.
Mr. Macron, who recently warned that "our Europe is mortal" and will be saved only if it can become "sovereign," will host a state dinner for Mr. Xi on Monday in Paris before, in a personal touch, ushering him to a favorite childhood haunt in the Pyrenees.
The chemistry between the two men appears to lie essentially in a shared view that the postwar order is moribund and must be replaced by a new architecture that takes account of shifting power. That Mr. Xi is almost certainly the most repressive and authoritarian leader in recent Chinese history, and that China's military threats to Taiwan have intensified, has not come between the two leaders.
In the past six months, Mr. Macron has visited both India and Brazil in a push to place France at a fulcrum between the BRICS group of developing countries, which includes China, and Western powers. At a time of growing tension between the "Global South" and Western powers, he sees France as a bridge.
From France, Mr. Xi will move on to the warm embrace of Serbia, where China is the second largest trading partner, and Hungary, where its prime minister, Viktor Orban, has backed enormous Chinese investment and used his country's position as a European Union member to dilute criticism of China. Both countries bridle at American power.
Beyond these two friends of China, there are, however, serious European differences with Beijing, whose economy was roughly the same size, measured in dollars, as the European Union's when Mr. Xi last visited in 2019. China's economy is now some 15 percent bigger.
Last fall, the European Union opened an investigation into whether electric vehicles made in China benefited from unfair subsidies, with a decision expected by this summer. That has caused tensions with Beijing and with Germany, whose presence in the Chinese auto market dwarfs that of other European countries. China accounts for at least half of Volkswagen's annual profits.
German manufacturers, with plants in China, fear that any imposition of European tariffs could affect its own exports from China, as well as cause tit-for-tat retaliation.
The European Union Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, will join the talks in Paris with Mr. Xi. Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, whose relations with Mr. Macron have been strained, dined with the French president in Paris this past week. All of this is clearly part of an attempt to forge a united European front.
That, however, is always elusive.
Anger toward Russia in Europe runs highest in frontline states with Russia, like Poland and the Baltic States. They are perhaps the most fiercely attached to the alliance with the United States that Mr. Macron wants to offset by building a sovereign Europe. They are also the most wary of China, which has never condemned Russia's war in Ukraine.
Mr. Macron, like Mr. Scholz during a visit to China last month, believes that Chinese leverage in bringing an end to the war in Ukraine is critical. Only Beijing, in the French analysis, can bring real pressure to bear on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who will be sworn in for a fifth term during Mr. Xi's European visit.
The issue, as it was last year during Mr. Macron's visit to Beijing, is that China has shown little or no inclination to do so. Indeed, Mr. Xi is scheduled to host Mr. Putin in China later this month.
"It's hard to imagine another discussion on Ukraine," François Godement, a special adviser and resident senior fellow at the Institut Montaigne in Paris, said of the talks between Mr. Macron and Mr. Xi. "Those dice have been rolled."
Still, there is little doubt that Mr. Macron will try again to enlist Mr. Xi's support ahead of a Ukraine peace conference in Switzerland in mid-June.
At a deeper level, Mr. Macron appears certain to try to use Mr. Xi's visit to advance an agenda that guarantees Europe's relevance in the coming decades. He is wary of a United States that may re-elect former President Donald J. Trump in November, with unpredictable consequences.
Mr. Wang, the Chinese foreign minister, has said, "As long as China and Europe join hands, bloc confrontation will not occur, the world will not fall apart, and a new Cold War will not take place."
For all of the fundamental differences in governance between China's one-party state and Western liberal democracy, the leaders of the three European countries Mr. Xi has chosen to visit appear to embrace that Chinese statement.

Have Faith. No Religious Agenda Here.: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: Some communities with religious origins now offer spiritual programming as just one of many enticements, like the bingo nights of yesteryear.
Before Helen Leddy moved to Shell Point Retirement Community in Fort Myers, Fla., last year, she got the lowdown on the place from her best friend, Judy Burget.
Ms. Leddy, 86, wasn't interested in leaving her condo if it meant adopting one part of the culture Shell Point emphasized on its website: "If you go online, you see they're built around religion," she said. As a Unitarian Universalist who grew up Jewish, Ms. Leddy was concerned that the denomination that founded Shell Point, the evangelical Christian and Missionary Alliance, might promote values that did not match hers, and that her new neighbors might proselytize. Ms. Burget, who has lived at Shell Point for six years, told her that wasn't going to happen.
Faith-based communities like Shell Point, which was established in 1968, generally don't insist that residents subscribe to the religion that shaped the communities, according to Katie Smith Sloan, the president and chief executive of LeadingAge, an association of nonprofit providers of aging services. Instead, residents have come to expect different kinds of benefits, and the religious aspect, which was once a meaningful calling card, is now often seen as just another effective marketing tool, like on-site beauty salons or golf pro shops.
Like other continuing-care retirement communities -- developments where people over age 55 can live independently and then move to higher levels of caregiving when needed -- Shell Point encourages residents to find their mid- or late-life groove in any number of ways. Here, a meandering pedestrian may be honked off the road by a golf cart driver hurrying to the woodworking shop, a photography or pottery class, a personal training session or a show at the 44,000-square-foot arts center.
Ms. Leddy, who recently attended a pizza party in her building, said that gatherings at Shell Point "generally start with a blessing, and maybe there's a blessing at the end." Otherwise, acquaintances toss off the occasional "God bless."
About 56 of the 200 largest continuing-care communities in the United States are faith-based, according to Ziegler, a financial company that specializes in senior living. A majority are sponsored by Christian or Jewish organizations, and most faith-based communities are nonprofits. They are competing for a customer base that is not only graying, but attending church services in declining numbers.
That has led to what amounts to fancy footwork among some of the market's major players, said Eloise Tweeten, the founder of Tweeten Eldercare Advisors, a company that matches families with retirement communities in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Faith-based communities "are doing a bit of a dance," said Ms. Tweeten, who has been advising older people for 17 years. Her father chose to move into a Lutheran-based community in Madison, Wis., in the early 2000s; today, a similar community might call itself Lutheran-inspired. "They don't want to limit the population that moves in, so they have to walk this line," she said, adding that "to sustain growth, they're focusing not so much on religion as philosophy" -- like pacifism or progressivism.
That is evident at Enso Village, a new community in Healdsburg, Calif., that several of Ms. Tweeten's clients toured recently. The community, which will hold a ribbon-cutting in June, is a collaboration between Kendal, an East Coast retirement community operator founded by Quakers, and San Francisco Zen Center, an organization of Zen practice and retreat centers that has public programs and provides housing to some practitioners.
Susan O'Connell, 76, started dreaming up Enso in 2006, when she was a resident at the Zen Center. She lives at Enso now. "I didn't want to age in the ways that I saw were available, so I tried to create something," Ms. O'Connell said. "And I found out that a lot of people had my same ideas."
The Zen Center formed a partnership with Kendal after the two organizations assessed where Quaker and Zen values merge. "Quakers sit in silence and, as they say, wait for the still voice within to arise," Ms. O'Connell explained. "Of course, in Zen, we meditate."
Openness and ethical conduct are shared values, too, she added. But like other faith-based communities, Enso is open to everyone. Quaker, Jewish and agnostic residents have welcomed Sufis and Christians to the community, which has an on-site garden and teaching kitchen, a meditation hall and organized volunteer outings. Regardless of religion, "we're all seekers," Ms. O'Connell said.
They are not all baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, but the values associated with that generation seep into retirement communities, Ms. Tweeten says. She recalled that a client who recently toured Spring Lake Village, a Santa Rosa, Calif., community with Episcopalian roots, was sniffing around for cars with bumper stickers that might signal conservative values. "He wasn't going to move there if he saw signs of people not being politically liberal," she said. At Enso, Ms. O'Connell noted, marketing materials have included images of peace signs and a vintage Volkswagen bus.
HumanGood, a nonprofit that runs 19 faith-based continuing-care retirement communities across the country, was founded by Baptists and Presbyterians in the 1950s and still identifies as faith-based. But its director of spirituality, Sharell Shippen, said it would be a mistake to think of HumanGood as a Christian community. "The way we see spiritual service has evolved," she said.
At Rydal Park, the company's campus in Jenkintown, Pa., a majority of residents are Jewish. A rabbi is on site on Friday evenings for Shabbat, but there is also a priest for Catholic Mass on Sundays. A HumanGood campus in California held a Wiccan service at a resident's request. And the spiritual needs of agnostic and atheist residents -- a presence in all HumanGood continuing-care communities -- are not overlooked, either. "If spirituality for you is a nature walk, we'll walk alongside you," Ms. Shippen said.
Choosing not to participate in HumanGood's spirituality programs is also an option. "You can engage or disengage," Ms. Shippen said. As at Shell Point and Enso, there is still plenty to do.
The variety of leisure opportunities and amenities often translates into hefty entrance fees and contracts that can seriously dent a grandchild's inheritance. According to the nonprofit National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care, the average upfront entrance fee is about $ 450,000. And that's followed by a monthly maintenance or service fee of several thousand dollars. Faith-based communities are not necessarily cheaper. Though some acquired their land from a religious foundation, not many get funding from the church that shaped them, said Ms. Smith Sloan, of LeadingAge.
Residents have to qualify financially before they can move into a continuing-care community, and then pay high entrance and monthly fees, but if the community is a nonprofit, they may not have to worry about being kicked out if eventually they can't pay their bills. Dee Pekruhn, LeadingAge's director of life plan communities services and policy, said that if residents "outlive their resources," the communities "often have an affiliated foundation established to pick up those costs."
Bob Dawson, 74, and his wife, Gretchen, toured several communities in Florida before choosing Plymouth Harbor, an interfaith community on Sarasota Bay, in 2018. Its website once trumpeted "the dream of the Reverend Dr. John Whitney MacNeil," the Congregational minister who founded the community in 1966, but those references were recently removed. "I felt that we didn't need that passage," said Plymouth Harbor's president and chief executive, Jeff Weatherhead, adding that "while it was his dream, it took much more than that one man's dream."
The Dawsons paid more attention to the financial viability of Plymouth Harbor and the community's friendliness and amenities when they were planning to move. "We plan to live here the rest of our lives, so we needed to make sure that in return for our money, it will be able to take care of us," Mr. Dawson said. He is not particularly religious, but it's OK with him if his neighbors are. Mostly, they don't talk about it.
"Do we feel constricted or constrained or directed by a religious agenda here?" he said. "No, not at all."

Full text: Modern cars are internet-connected and have hundreds of sensors. Lawmakers and regulators have concerns about what's happening with all that data.
In the American imagination, car keys and a driver's license have long represented freedom, autonomy and privacy. But modern cars, which have hundreds of sensors, cameras and internet connectivity, are now potential spying machines acting in ways drivers do not completely understand.
That has lawmakers and regulators concerned.
On Tuesday, Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts sent a letter to Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, urging the agency to investigate automakers for sharing drivers' location information with the police. The senators, both Democrats, say this sharing can "seriously threaten Americans' privacy" by revealing their visits to protests, health clinics, places of worship, support groups or other sensitive places.
"As far-right politicians escalate their war on women, I'm especially concerned about cars revealing people who cross state lines to obtain an abortion," Senator Wyden said in a statement.
Government attention to the car industry is intensifying, experts say, because of the increased technological sophistication of modern cars.
Investigators for the Government Accountability Office recently went car shopping, undercover, to see whether salespeople were overselling autonomous driving abilities. In a March report, the agency concluded that consumers don't fully understand crash avoidance technologies and driver support systems, the improper use of which "can compromise their safety benefits and even pose a risk on the road."
The Federal Communications Commission and California lawmakers want to prevent mobile car apps from being used for stalking and harassment. The F.C.C. has proposed regulating automakers under the Safe Connections Act -- aimed, originally, at phone carriers -- while California is likely to pass a law that would accomplish the same thing, requiring car companies to cut off abusers' remote access to victims' cars.
"No survivor of domestic violence and abuse should have to choose between giving up their car and allowing themselves to be stalked and harmed by those who can access its connectivity and data," Jessica Rosenworcel, who leads the F.C.C., said in a statement.
Privacy regulators have opened investigations. California's privacy regulator has been looking into data use from connected cars for nearly a year, while the F.T.C. already appears to be acting on a letter Senator Markey sent in February, urging the agency to investigate automakers' privacy practices.
Last month, the F.T.C. solicited reports from drivers who objected to how data from their cars had been used. An investigator from the agency reached out to a man named in a New York Times article whose insurance premium increased after General Motors provided data about his driving behavior to the insurance industry. ("Since FTC investigations are nonpublic, we generally don't comment on whether we are investigating a particular matter," said a spokesperson for the agency.)
"To my mind, there has been far too little oversight into automakers' privacy policies, so the more watchdogs, the better," Senator Wyden said.
The most recent letter to the F.T.C. reveals the findings of a yearlong query of 14 automakers that Senator Wyden's office said had jointly received more than 1,400 police requests for location information over the past two years.
Only five of the automakers -- G.M., Honda, Ford, Tesla and Stellantis -- required the police to get a warrant before turning over a car's current or historical whereabouts, with Ford recently enacting that requirement. Tesla is the only automaker that tells customers about such requests, according to the letter.
"In contrast, Toyota, Nissan, Subaru, Volkswagen, BMW, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz and Kia all confirmed that they will disclose location data to U.S. government agencies in response to subpoenas, which do not require a judge's approval," the senators wrote to Ms. Khan. They said this violated a commitment the automakers made in a set of privacy principles they submitted to the F.T.C. a decade ago about how they would protect drivers' sensitive data.
"This is a complex issue; automakers are committed to protecting sensitive vehicle location information," said Brian Weiss, a spokesman for the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association. "Vehicle location information is only provided to law enforcement under specific and limited circumstances, such as when the automaker is provided a warrant or court order or in situations where there is an imminent threat of serious bodily harm or death to an individual."
Automakers generally retain a car's location information for years -- as long as 15 years in the case of Hyundai. Of the 45 location data requests that Hyundai received in the past two years from the police, slightly more than half involved stolen vehicles, the company's spokesman, Ira Gabriel, said.
"There's a renewed focus on cars, and the data practices associated with them," said Andrew Crawford, policy counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology. He attributed this to increased consumer awareness about the components in modern cars and the fact that car data "may be going to folks that they did not contemplate, did not know about and did not want."
At the same time, however, some regulators are pushing automakers to put more technology into cars to improve safety on the roads, which may require even more data collection.
The National Transportation Safety Board has recommended in-car systems in all new vehicles that would tell drivers to slow down when they exceed the speed limit. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has taken steps to require impairment-detection systems in all new vehicles that would prevent a car from operating when the driver had been drinking or using drugs.
When it comes to car safety, the conversation has changed from improving seatbelts to installing more cameras and sensors, said Adonne Washington, a lawyer at the Future of Privacy Forum who wrote a recent report on the privacy implications of proposed safety systems.
For instance, "a mandate for alcohol detection technology in vehicles creates a whole different category of information," she said.
W. James Denvil, a partner at Hogan Lovells who has represented automakers, said the increased scrutiny from regulators was expected.
Vehicles offer "extraordinary benefits," he said. New technologies can enhance safety and the driving experience, while data from cars can be used to improve transportation infrastructure.
"We've got innovative technologies and old regulations," Mr. Denvil said. "There's going to be some surprises and some bumps in the road."

Noncompete Agreements Harm Workers and Society: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Federal Trade Commission used two very different rationales to get to its near-total ban this week on noncompete agreements. One of them is a no-brainer. The other is provocative but not completely obvious. I guess I'd call it a brainer.
As you might have read, the F.T.C. commissioners on Tuesday voted 3 to 2 on a final rule against noncompete clauses in employment contracts, which limit the ability of an employee to quit and immediately go work for a rival. The commission determined that they are an "unfair method of competition." The rule takes effect 120 days after its publication in the Federal Register, unless a court blocks it before then.
The easy prong of the ban for the F.T.C. to justify is the one that applies to nurses, hairdressers, truck drivers -- actually, every kind of worker except for senior executives. For 99 percent of the American work force, the F.T.C. said, requiring workers to sign noncompete agreements as a condition of employment is "coercive and exploitative conduct." The agency's 570-page ruling cites articles in The Times and The Wall Street Journal in which workers came forward to say, in the F.T.C.'s words, that noncompete agreements "derailed their careers, destroyed their finances and upended their lives." I agree. I wrote a piece in 2021 titled, "Why Are Fast Food Workers Signing Noncompete Agreements?"
But the "coercive and exploitative" rationale doesn't work for senior executives, who aren't so easy to coerce or exploit. They're more likely to have lawyers look over contract offers. They typically have some power in the employment negotiation and know how to use it. Many won't sign a noncompete agreement unless they get something in return, such as a sweetened pay package.
The F.T.C. defined senior executives as people earning more than $ 151,164 per year who are in a "policy-making position" and estimated that fewer than 1 percent of workers meet the description. Under the rule, existing noncompetes for senior executives can remain in force but most new ones are banned. The rule doesn't apply to clauses that are related to the sale of a business.
For noncompetes involving senior executives, the F.T.C. fell back on another argument, which is that the agreements are "restrictive and exclusionary conduct" that harms competition in product, service and labor markets. (The F.T.C. says that this second argument also applies to other workers, but for them I think it's overshadowed by the "coercive and exploitative" argument.)
This is a bit subtle. It requires you to think of the employer and the senior executive as being in cahoots rather than fighting each other. Together they cook up a noncompete that rewards the executive for agreeing to deprive other potential employers of her or his talents and depriving the customers of those other companies of potentially better products and services. In economists' terms, noncompete signatories are maximizing their bilateral surplus at the expense of others.
The logic is that the company that can't hire the executive might have better growth prospects, so holding it back is bad for society as a whole. Or, after leaving the old employer, the executive has to be (wastefully) inactive for six months or so to wait out what finance people call the garden leave. Or the new employer has to pay a large sum to buy out the noncompete clause -- again, socially wasteful.
"There can be sizable gains from restricting these contracts," Liyan Shi of Carnegie Mellon's Tepper School of Business wrote in a 2023 article in the journal Econometrica.
As I said, this is an interesting and even persuasive argument. But it's not simple to make.
"If this becomes the approach," Sean Heather, the senior vice president for international regulatory affairs and antitrust at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, asked me, will any contract that doesn't take into account the interests of third parties be "no longer viable"?
Charles Tharp, a professor of the practice at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, said that while banning the noncompete might benefit a future employer, it harms the current employer, so there's no net benefit; it's a wash.
But two other economists I contacted disagreed with Tharp and Heather. Evan Penniman Starr, an associate professor at the University of Maryland's Smith School of Business who is an expert on noncompete agreements, wrote to me that governments shouldn't always put third parties first, but shouldn't ignore them either, citing smoking bans to protect third parties from secondhand smoke. As for Tharp's point, he wrote, "If match quality is higher at the subsequent firm, it is not a wash. It's an efficient move that would destroy value if it wasn't made."
Sandeep Vaheesan, the legal director of the Open Markets Institute, emailed me that companies could still retain senior executives through higher pay packages and fixed-term contracts. Noncompetes are a "stick," he wrote. "Public policy should encourage employers to use carrots instead. The F.T.C. noncompete ban does exactly that."
Vaheesan also sided with the F.T.C.'s argument that companies have other ways to protect themselves when a key employee leaves, such as trade secret protection and agreements that prohibit people from soliciting customers of the companies they used to work for.
There's precedent for taking into account the interests of third parties, Starr told me. He cited an American Bar Association model rule on professional conduct that forbids restricting attorneys from working elsewhere not only because it harms the attorney but also because it "limits the freedom of clients to choose a lawyer."
The strongest evidence against noncompete agreements is that Silicon Valley has thrived even though -- or maybe even partly because -- the state of California has long banned noncompete agreements in most circumstances, under a law passed in 1872. The prohibition does not seem to have discouraged companies from sharing valuable inside information with employees who might leave. And it has enabled the germination of ideas as people flit from company to company like pollinating honeybees.
"Noncompetes are a pain in the neck for us," Dr. Stephen DeCherney, who is the chair of New York-based Helios Clinical Research, told me. "Overall I won't be sorry to see them go."
Still, this is going to be messy for a while. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the F.T.C. to block the rule, arguing that the agency doesn't have the power to issue such a ban and that even if it did, a categorical ban isn't lawful. Eugene Scalia, who was President Donald Trump's secretary of labor for a year and a half, also filed a lawsuit, this one on behalf of Ryan L.L.C., a tax services firm in Texas whose chief executive, Brint Ryan, is a Republican donor who has advised Trump.
Even if the F.T.C. wins on the legality of its rule, enforcing it is going to be tricky. Let's say a company gets rid of its noncompete clause, but it imposes a nondisclosure agreement that's so broad and strict that it has the same functional effect of preventing someone from taking a job elsewhere. According to the F.T.C., "such a term is a noncompete clause under the final rule."
Arguing over what's the same functional effect is going to keep a lot of lawyers busy. Same for nonsolicitation agreements and trade secret protection. "'You can't work for a competitor for a year' is a pretty clear rule; 'you can't use our secrets at a competitor' will mean more lawsuits," Matt Levine, a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion, wrote Wednesday.
I admire the F.T.C. for looking at the entire economic landscape in evaluating the pros and cons of noncompete agreements, not just the interests of the employer and employee. It's a bold step, though.
The Readers Write
You wrote that most right-to-work laws were passed in the 1940s and 1950s, when Southern states were solidly Democratic. True, but in the '60s after the passage of the Civil Rights Act the Southern Democrats were wholly absorbed by the Republican Party. Right-to-work is an anti-union strategy implemented by the same power elite that discouraged workers in this most recent vote. Their failure is significant. When Southerners start thinking for themselves, I view that as a hopeful development.

I'm a 47-year union member enjoying my retirement with an old-fashioned, union-negotiated pension and lifetime medical coverage. As those Volkswagen workers told you, to a certain degree, it doesn't matter who the president is when it comes to what union members are paid. But it does matter to all employees who the president appoints to critical agencies such as the National Labor Relations Board, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and many more. Those agencies have real day-to-day impact on workers' lives and futures.

Concerning your newsletter on Donald Trump's economic agenda: He is clearly advocating an isolationist strategy. One does not have to look far to see that isolationism is a dead-end street. Is there anything to love about North Korea's economy? How about Brexit?

Daimler Truck Deal Averts Strike in North Carolina: [National Desk]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers reached an agreement involving workers who make Freightliner trucks and Thomas Built buses. The deal comes as the union seeks to expand in Southern states.
The United Automobile Workers reached an 11th-hour deal on Friday with Daimler Truck in North Carolina that gave workers 25 percent raises over the next four years and averted a strike that would have begun Saturday.
The union had said it was ready to walk out if it could not agree on a new contract covering 7,300 Daimler employees. The previous contract expired on Friday. The German company has four factories in North Carolina, where it builds Freightliner and Western Star trucks, and Thomas Built buses. The union also represents workers at parts distribution centers in Atlanta and Memphis.
The deal, which includes profit sharing, automatic cost-of-living increases and equalizes pay among workers at the North Carolina factories, marks a victory for the U.A.W. as it tries to expand its power in Southern states where unions have long been weak.
"When that deadline came closer, the company suddenly became ready to talk," Shawn Fain, the U.A.W.'s leader, said late Friday as he announced the agreement, which will give workers raises of at least 16 percent the first year after they ratify the contract.
Daimler Trucks said in a statement that it hoped U.A.W. members would approve the tentative contracts, "for the mutual benefit of all parties."
A walkout would have had national political repercussions. North Carolina is a political battleground state that has a Democratic governor, but President Biden narrowly lost the state in 2020. Mr. Biden had indicated that he could step in aggressively to support the Daimler workers, possibly putting him at odds with the state's more pro-business Democrats just months before Election Day.
The U.A.W. has been making inroads in the South. It scored a significant victory this month when workers at Volkswagen's factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., voted to be represented by the union. Workers at a Mercedes-Benz factory in Alabama will vote on whether to unionize in mid-May.
Workers at Daimler Truck, which split from Mercedes-Benz in 2021, have been represented by the U.A.W. for several decades. The union has adopted a more assertive stance after winning the biggest pay increases in decades for workers at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the owner of Jeep, Chrysler and Ram after strikes at the three companies last year.
The gains for workers at Daimler could add momentum to the U.A.W.'s drive to organize U.S. auto factories, including at companies like Toyota and Tesla.
Workers in North Carolina said they have been struggling to make ends meet while Daimler racked up big profits. The company, based in Stuttgart, reported net profit last year of 4 billion euros, or $ 4.25 billion, a 44 percent increase from a year earlier. Sales in the United States, Canada and Mexico generated more than half the profit.
The union points out that Thomas Built, whose yellow school buses are a common sight, has benefited from millions of dollars in federal subsidies for electric buses. Thomas Built workers have earned less than counterparts at other factories, but the deal will give them pay increases to make up the deficit.
"Workers who make trucks and workers who make buses will get equal pay for equal work," Mr. Fain said.
The agreement also includes provisions aimed at preserving jobs in North Carolina. Workers had sought more job security after the company moved some production to Mexico.

Can Biden Revive the Fortunes of American Workers?: [Op-Ed]

Full text: Last week, employees at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., voted by almost three to one to join the United Automobile Workers. By the numbers, this wasn't a big deal: It involved only a few thousand workers in an economy that employs almost 160 million people. But it was an important symbolic victory for a labor movement that even in its heyday never made significant inroads in the South.
And it's not silly to imagine that historians will someday look back at the Chattanooga vote as a milestone on the road back to the more or less middle-class society America used to be.
Of course, we were never truly egalitarian. Even during the era of widely shared prosperity that followed World War II, many Americans, particularly people of color, were poor, and a few were very wealthy. But in terms of income and wealth we were a far less unequal nation than we are now. You can quantify this arc using statistical measures like the Gini coefficient or the ratio of top to bottom incomes. As someone who grew up in that era, I can also attest that America used to feel like a place in which most people lived in more or less the same material universe. It definitely doesn't feel that way now.
The thing is, that relatively equal society didn't evolve gradually. As Claudia Goldin -- who received the Nobel Prize in economics last year -- and Robert Margo showed in a famous 1992 paper titled "The Great Compression," the relatively equal wage structure of the postwar era emerged quite suddenly in the 1940s. Wartime wage and price controls were an equalizing force, but the new equality persisted for decades after those controls were removed.
And the most likely explanation for the sudden but persistent move toward relative equality was something else that was sudden but persistent: the rise of labor unions, which by the late 1940s represented more than 30 percent of American workers, and remained powerful until the 1980s. Strong unions were a force for equality because they were a counterweight to both the market power of big business and the political power of big money. And the decline of unions, which still represented around a quarter of workers in 1980 but then fell off a cliff, was probably a major factor in the emergence of the new Gilded Age we live in now.
Why did unions decline? It's tempting to assume that their diminishment was inevitable in the face of global competition and the falling share of manufacturing, their traditional stronghold, in employment. But other advanced economies are still strongly unionized -- in Denmark and Sweden, for example, about two-thirds of workers are union members.
So what happened in America? The most plausible explanation is that beginning in the 1970s, employers became very aggressive in fighting unionization efforts and were empowered to do so by a political climate, especially after the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan, in which Republicans were hostile to organized labor while Democrats were at best weakly in support.
Some existing unions -- most famously the air traffic controllers -- were broken. More important, unionization didn't spread as America increasingly became a service economy. There was and is no fundamental economic reason giant employers like Walmart or Amazon couldn't be mostly unionized. But they became giants in an era when employers were effectively free to pull out all the stops in blocking and, in some cases, persecuting union organizers.
Which brings us to the current moment, which may be an inflection point.
Right now there are two forces bolstering workers' bargaining position. One is a tight labor market: We've just experienced the longest stretch of unemployment below 4 percent since the 1960s. This tight labor market is probably the main reason we've seen an "unexpected compression" of wages in recent years, with earnings rising much faster at the bottom than at the top.
The other is a shift in the political climate. President Biden, who joined a U.A.W. picket line in Michigan last September, is arguably the most pro-labor president since Harry Truman. This involves more than gestures. On Tuesday, for example, the Federal Trade Commission issued a ban on most noncompete clauses, which prevent a company's employees from taking jobs with rival businesses; such clauses currently cover, roughly, an astonishing 30 million workers and have been a major force reducing labor market competition.
There's a reason, then, that Biden has been getting early and enthusiastic endorsements from major unions, including the U.A.W. in January and, this week, the Building Trades Unions, which represents about three million workers in the United States and Canada.
But has American labor really turned a corner? Unfortunately, it's easy to see how recent progress could be reversed. For one thing, that tight labor market might not persist. So far, the Biden economy has shrugged off all those confident predictions of recession, but that won't always be the case.
And Biden could, of course, lose in November -- and although Donald Trump portrays himself as a populist, his record shows that he's anti-union.
So we won't know for a while whether things are actually looking up for American workers.

Full text: The Japanese automaker, which has been slow to sell electric vehicles, said it would invest $ 11 billion to make batteries and cars in Ontario.
Honda Motor on Thursday said it and several suppliers would invest $ 11 billion to build batteries and electric cars in Ontario, a significant commitment from a company that has been slow to embrace the technology.
Like Toyota and other Japanese carmakers, Honda has emphasized hybrid vehicles, in which gasoline engines are augmented by electric motors, rather than cars powered solely by batteries. The Honda Prologue, a sport-utility vehicle made in Mexico, is the company's only fully electric vehicle on sale in the United States.
But the investment adjacent to the company's factory in Alliston, Ontario, near Toronto, is a shift in direction, raising the possibility that Honda and other Japanese carmakers could use their manufacturing expertise to push down the cost of electric vehicles and make them affordable to more people.
"This is a very big day for the region, for the province and for the country," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at an announcement event in Alliston, where Honda manufactures the Civic sedan and CR-V S.U.V. The investment, which will create 1,000 new jobs, is the largest by an automaker in Canadian history, he said.
The company is also retooling its flagship factory in Marysville, Ohio, near Columbus, to produce electric vehicles in 2025. Along with LG Energy Solution, a Korean company, Honda is investing $ 4.4 billion in a new battery factory in Jeffersonville, Ohio.
The additional investment in Canada is a sign that Honda expects the technology to become more popular, despite a recent slowdown in sales. The factory in Ontario will be able to produce as many as 240,000 electric vehicles a year when it begins operations in 2028, Honda said. By 2040, Honda plans for all its vehicles to be electric, a firmer commitment than other Japanese carmakers have made.
Toyota, which has faced criticism from environmental groups for its focus on hybrids rather than fully electric vehicles, said Thursday it would expand a factory in Princeton, Ind., to produce a large electric S.U.V.
The company, the world's largest automaker, will spend $ 1.4 billion on the Indiana project and create as many as 340 new jobs, the company said. Toyota has previously announced that it will begin producing batteries next year at a $ 13.9 billion plant in North Carolina.
Canadian leaders have been wooing carmakers with financial incentives that roughly match the tax breaks the United States offers to auto and battery companies under the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's signature climate law. Canada's federal and provincial governments want the country to become a major player in the electric vehicle supply chain. Vehicles made in Canada can qualify for $ 7,500 U.S. federal tax credits, which are available only to cars made in North America.
Volkswagen said last year it would invest up to $ 5 billion to construct a battery factory in Thomas, Ontario. Northvolt, a Swedish battery company, announced plans last year for a $ 5 billion battery factory near Montreal.
Honda will benefit from up to $ 1.8 billion in tax credits available to companies that invest in electric vehicle projects, Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian finance minister, said Thursday at the event. Ontario is expected to provide additional financial support.
Canada also has reserves of lithium and other materials needed to make batteries, and generates a lot of its electricity from nuclear and hydroelectric plants, which allows carmakers to advertise that their vehicles are made with energy that releases no greenhouse gas emissions.
"As we aim to conduct our business with zero environmental impact, Canada is very attractive," Toshihiro Mibe, the chief executive of Honda, said Thursday in Alliston.
Honda will also work with partners to convert raw materials into battery components, he said. By retaining control over the supply chain, a strategy known as vertical integration, companies like Honda hope to cut costs and make electric vehicles more affordable. BYD, a Chinese automaker, has undercut Tesla and other rivals on price by controlling mines, raw material processing and battery manufacturing.
However, recent declines in the price of lithium have raised questions about whether mining the metal in Canada will be competitive with lower-cost operations in Latin America or Australia.
Political leaders justify spending taxpayer money to attract companies like Honda because car factories also generate thousands of jobs at suppliers. One example is Asahi Kasei, a Japanese company that said on Wednesday that it would spend $ 1.3 billion on a factory to produce components for batteries in Ontario.
Honda will be the plant's main customer, Asahi Kasei said, but it will also sell to others. The supplier said it expected to also receive financial support from Canada and Ontario.

China Has a Massive Auto Factory Glut: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Manufacturers like BYD, Tesla and Li Auto are cutting prices to move their electric cars. For gasoline-powered vehicles, the surplus of factories is even worse.
On the outskirts of Chongqing, western China's largest city, sits a huge symbol of the country's glut of car factories. It's a complex of gray buildings, nearly a square mile in size. The thousands of employees who used to work there have moved on. Its crimson loading docks are closed.
The facility, a former assembly plant and engine factory, had been a joint venture of a Chinese company and Hyundai, the South Korean giant. The complex opened in 2017 with robots and other equipment to make gasoline-powered cars. Hyundai sold the campus late last year for a fraction of the $ 1.1 billion it took to build and equip it. Unmown grass at the site has already grown knee high.
"It was all highly automated, but now, it is desolate," said Zhou Zhehui, 24, who works for a rival Chinese automaker, Chang'an, and whose apartment looks down on the former Hyundai complex.
China has more than 100 factories with the capacity to build close to 40 million internal combustion engine cars a year. That is roughly twice as many as people in China want to buy, and sales of these cars are dropping fast as electric vehicles become more popular.
Last month, for the first time, sales of battery-electric and plug-in gasoline-electric hybrid cars together surpassed those of gasoline-powered cars in China's 35 largest cities.
Dozens of gasoline-powered vehicle factories are barely running or have already been mothballed.
The country's auto industry is near the start of an E.V. transition that is expected to last years and eventually claim many of those factories. How China manages that long change will influence its future economic growth, since the auto sector is so big and could transform its work force.
The stakes are great for the rest of the world, too.
China, the world's largest car market, became the largest exporter last year, having passed Japan and Germany. China's auto sales abroad are exploding.
Three-quarters of China's exported cars are gasoline-powered models that the domestic market no longer needs, said Bill Russo, an electric car consultant in Shanghai. Those exports threaten to flatten producers elsewhere.
At the same time, China's electric vehicle companies are still investing heavily in new factories. BYD and other automakers are expected to introduce more electric models at the opening of the Beijing auto show on Thursday.
Electric car sales in China are still growing. But the pace of growth has halved since last summer, as consumer spending has faltered in China because of a housing market crisis.
"There is a slowdown trend, especially for pure electric vehicles," said Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.
China also has overcapacity in electric vehicle manufacturing, although less than for gasoline-powered cars. Price cutting for electric vehicles is common. Li Auto, a fast-growing Chinese manufacturer, reduced its prices on Monday. Tesla did the same a day earlier, and on Tuesday reported a large decline in profits during the first three months of this year. BYD, the industry leader in China, made price cuts in February. Volkswagen and General Motors have also lowered E.V. prices in China this year.
Automakers with factories close to China's coast are exporting gasoline-powered cars. But many of the endangered factories are in cities deep inside the country, like Chongqing, where high transport costs to the coast make it too expensive to export.
Almost all of China's electric cars are assembled at newly built factories, which qualify for subsidies from municipal governments and state-directed banks. It's cheaper for automakers to build new factories than to convert existing ones. The result has been enormous overcapacity.
"The Chinese auto industry is experiencing a revolution," said John Zeng, the director of Asia forecasting at GlobalData Automotive. "The old internal combustion capacity is dying."
Sales of gasoline-powered cars plummeted to 17.7 million last year from 28.3 million in 2017, the year that Hyundai opened its Chongqing complex. That drop is equivalent to the entire European Union car market last year, or all of the United States' annual car and light truck production.
Hyundai's sales in China have plunged 69 percent since 2017. The company put the factory up for sale last summer, but no other automaker wanted it. Hyundai ended up selling the land, the buildings and much of the equipment back to a municipal development company in Chongqing for just $ 224 million, or 20 cents on the dollar.
The municipal company said this year, while seeking insurance on the site, that it did not have a new tenant.
Other multinational automakers have reduced output in China. Ford Motor has three factories in Chongqing that have been running at a tiny fraction of their capacity for the past five years.
Hyundai is one of the very few automakers, mostly foreign, that have halted production entirely at some locations, although the company still has three factories in China.
"There doesn't seem to be a concerted effort to shut down excess capacity, but more of a shift from foreign owned to Chinese owned," said Michael Dunne, a former president of General Motors Indonesia.
The longstanding benchmark is that car factories should run at 80 percent of capacity, or more, to be efficient and make money. But with new electric car factories opening and few older factories closing, capacity utilization across the entire industry fell to 65 percent in the first three months of this year from 75 percent last year and 80 percent or more before the Covid-19 pandemic, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics.
Without a big burst of exports last year, the industry would have operated even further below full capacity.
Chinese manufacturers, many of them partly or entirely owned by city governments, have been reluctant to reduce output and cut jobs. Chang'an, a state-owned carmaker, has a factory just a 20-minute walk down pink-bougainvillea-lined lanes from the former Hyundai complex. The factory's many acres of parking were completely full of unsold cars on Sunday.
Cities that are particularly dependent on gasoline-powered car production, like Chongqing, face a jobs dilemma. Assembling electric vehicles requires considerably fewer workers than making gasoline-powered cars, because E.V.s have much fewer components.
Workers with strong technical backgrounds, particularly in robotics, can easily and quickly find jobs if they're laid off, autoworkers in Chongqing said in interviews. But semiskilled workers -- including those who are older and have not taken training courses to develop their abilities -- are now finding it more difficult to obtain work.
Mr. Zhou said that when he applied for his job at Chang'an, "it was a fierce competition."
Still, it is extremely hard to find unemployed former Hyundai workers in Chongqing these days, even in the neighborhood of the former factory.
Most factory workers in China are migrants who grew up in rural areas and have few connections to the communities where gasoline-powered cars have been built. So they can easily move to other cities or industries when they lose jobs.
Yet a tinge of gloom hangs over the car industry in Chongqing, as demand slows and less skilled workers have fewer opportunities to earn overtime pay. Hyundai's signage is still visible in many places at its former factory, but a large shadow on the front gate shows where an optimistic slogan used to hang: "New Thinking, New Possibilities."

3 Germans Are Accused Of Passing Data to China: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sensitive naval data and a high-powered laser were obtained for China by three German citizens, according to prosecutors.
Three German citizens who are believed to have gathered sensitive naval data and obtained a high-powered laser on behalf of the Chinese security services were arrested on Monday, prosecutors said, underscoring the fragile nature of the relationship between the two countries.
A man identified as Thomas R., in keeping with German privacy rules, acted as an "agent" for the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and engaged two others -- a married couple identified as Herwig and Ina F. -- who ran an engineering company in Düsseldorf, the authorities said.
The arrests come at an awkward time for the German government: Chancellor Olaf Scholz recently spent three days in China as the countries signed several bilateral trade agreements, but Germany is also vigilant to the threat posed by China.
"We are aware of the considerable danger posed by Chinese espionage to business, industry and science," said Nancy Faeser, the German minister of the interior. "We are looking very closely at these risks and threats and have issued clear warnings and raised awareness so that protective measures are increased everywhere," she added.
Separately, the British authorities said in a statement on Monday that two men had been charged with violating the Official Secrets Act after allegedly sharing information with China that could be "useful to an enemy."
London's Metropolitan Police named the men as Christopher Berry, 32, from Witney, Oxfordshire, and Christopher Cash, 29, from London. Mr. Cash, a parliamentary researcher with links to the governing Conservative Party, was arrested last year on suspicion of working for the Chinese government.
"This has been an extremely complex investigation into what are very serious allegations," the police statement said, adding that the two men had been bailed to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday. Officials have not indicated that the German and British cases are connected.
The threat to Germany was made clear last week, when Volkswagen confirmed that Chinese hackers in a separate incident had stolen an estimated 19,000 sensitive documents from the automaker over a period of four years, starting in 2010. Volkswagen is one of the biggest German companies.
Roughly 97 billion euros, or about $ 103 billion, of German products were sold in China last year, making it Germany's fourth biggest export market and one that is especially important for the powerful auto sector.
Experts are increasingly warning of China's aggressive trade practices. Last year, the German government released a national strategy paper focusing on China, calling the trading partner a "systemic rival."
The arrests came as the police searched the homes and workplaces of the three suspects in Düsseldorf and in Bad Homburg, in the western part of the country.
According to the authorities, Herwig and Ina F. used their company, which had previously worked on projects in China, to establish a formal research partnership with an unidentified German research university.
Under the guise of working for a legitimate business partner, which the authorities said was a front company for China's Ministry of State Security, the couple then commissioned a study looking at the state of modern developments of certain machine parts which are crucial in developing high-powered ship motors, such as those used in navy ships.
The couple also used their company to buy a high-powered dual-use laser, which they exported to China without the required export permit.
"Anyone who works for foreign intelligence services in Germany and illegally exports potentially militarily useful material must expect a harsh response from our constitutional state," Marco Buschmann, Germany's minister of justice, said after the arrests.
There was no public comment from the Chinese authorities.
When the three suspects were arrested, they had been working on new research projects that would have benefited the Chinese Navy, the federal prosecutor said. The group had been working for China since at least June 2022, it added.

How Aid May Change Momentum in Ukraine: [briefing]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: How an aid package from the U.S. could affect the war.
You have probably read that the war in Ukraine is a stalemate. But conditions have changed in recent months -- in Russia's favor. It has captured more territory, and it seems likely to launch a larger offensive later this spring or summer. In the meantime, Ukraine's ability to fight back has deteriorated since the U.S. largely stopped sending aid in December.
The $ 60 billion in Ukraine aid that the House passed over the weekend has the potential to change the situation yet again. The Senate is likely to pass the bill in the coming days, and President Biden has signaled that he will sign it.
In today's newsletter, I'll explain how the aid package could affect the war.
Ukraine's needs
American funds will help Ukraine restock two things that have played pivotal roles in the war: artillery shells and antiaircraft munitions.
The war has often revolved around artillery, which are large guns that armies use to fire explosive shells and hit targets from a great distance. Both sides have used artillery to kill troops and destroy tanks and bunkers from miles away, weakening the enemy before an attack. Artillery has also stopped advancing armies.
In recent months, though, Ukraine has started to run out of artillery shells. Russian forces have fired five to 10 times as many shells as Ukraine. "That's just not sustainable," my colleague Eric Schmitt, who covers national security, told me. "Ukraine would eventually have to give up territory and pull back."
Ukraine has also relied on antiaircraft weapons, such as U.S.-made Patriot missiles, that can shoot down planes and missiles. The threat of these weapons has kept Russia from unleashing the full might of its air force, because it fears that Ukraine would destroy its expensive planes. Russia has instead resorted to long-range missiles, and Ukraine has shot down many of them.
But Ukraine had started to run out of those munitions, too. Last week, President Volodymyr Zelensky blamed Ukraine's short supplies for its inability to stop a Russian missile barrage that killed at least 17 people north of Kyiv. "This would not have happened if Ukraine had received enough air defense equipment," Zelensky said.
The new artillery and anti-air munitions will start to arrive in Ukraine just days after the bill becomes law. The $ 60 billion will pay for several months' worth of weapons.
Some of the aid will also go for training. That support will help address another Ukrainian shortage -- in personnel -- by allowing the military to prepare newer recruits for the front lines more quickly. It will also help teach Ukraine's forces how to use some of the advanced weapons they are receiving from Western allies, including Abrams tanks and F-16 jets.
What comes next
Once the aid starts arriving, Ukraine is likely to put it to work on the eastern front, where Russia has recently taken the city of Avdiivka. It could halt Russia's recent progress and prevent much larger advances. Some analysts have worried that an undersupplied Ukraine would struggle to defend the countryside around Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, after Kyiv, and its remaining territory along the Black Sea coastline.
"With more aid, Ukraine will probably be able to solidify its defenses and keep its most important cities," said my colleague Julian Barnes, who covers intelligence and national security.
If all goes well, Ukraine could launch an offensive campaign in 2025, perhaps to retake territory in the country's east and southeast. One important goal: to drive a wedge between Russia's holdings in the eastern region of the Donbas and the southern peninsula of Crimea.
Ukraine's official goal is to retake all of the Donbas and Crimea. Many experts are skeptical that Ukraine can do that, especially after last year's disappointing counteroffensive. And some critics of the aid package argue that it won't even allow Ukraine to stop Russia's advance. Senator J.D. Vance, an Ohio Republican, says that U.S. manufacturing can't currently keep pace with Russian weapons production. The war simply matters more to Russia than the West, and Russia is dedicating more resources to it, these critics have argued.
Still, most experts believe the additional aid will make a meaningful difference. They worry that an easier Russian victory could encourage it to invade other countries, or encourage China to invade Taiwan, by undermining confidence in the U.S. and its allies.
The most realistic scenario for Ukraine is probably not a return to the prewar borders. The nation would be smaller, but it could retain most of its territory, then integrate itself economically and strategically with Europe. That's a lot better than outright defeat.

U.A.W. Gets New Toehold In the South: [News Analysis]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Some experts say the outcome at a plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., may be organized labor's most significant advance in decades. But the road could get rockier.
By voting to join the United Automobile Workers, Volkswagen workers in Tennessee have given the union something it has never had: a factory-wide foothold at a major foreign automaker in the South.
The result, in an election that ended on Friday, will enable the union to bargain for better wages and benefits. Now the question is what difference it will make beyond the Volkswagen plant.
Labor experts said success at VW might position the union to replicate its showing at other auto manufacturers throughout the South, the least unionized region of the country. Some argued that the win could help set off a rise in union membership at other companies that exceeds the uptick of the past few years, when unions won elections at Starbucks and Amazon locations.
"It's a big vote, symbolically and substantively," said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist who studies labor at Washington University in St. Louis.
The next test for the U.A.W. will come in a vote in mid-May at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama.
In addition, at least 30 percent of workers have signed cards authorizing the U.A.W. to represent them at a Hyundai plant in Alabama and a Toyota plant in Missouri, according to the union. That is the minimum needed to force an election, though the union has yet to petition for one in either location.
"People only take action when they believe there is an alternative to the status quo that has a plausible chance of winning," said Barry Eidlin, a sociologist at McGill University in Montreal.
Still, it's unclear how far the campaign may spread beyond German manufacturers. Volkswagen and Mercedes have been relatively friendly to unions outside the United States, and a recent German law could prompt financial penalties against companies that crack down on union organizing.
Compared with previous elections in Chattanooga, Volkswagen's pushback against the union was mild this time, according to workers. The company presented reasons it believed a union was unnecessary, including pay that is above average for the Chattanooga area, but said it left the decision to the workers.
Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at the research firm AutoForecast Solutions, predicted that most Japanese and South Korean manufacturers with plants in the South would be more difficult targets for the U.A.W. because they have worked hard to develop a close relationship with workers or have butted heads with unions in their home country, or both.
The Chattanooga vote could also lead to a broader political battle over unionization within the region. Business and political leaders in the South say a greater union presence could threaten their states' economic advantages and slow down job creation.
"If we become less competitive, why not do it in Detroit?" said Gerald McCormick, a Republican who was the Tennessee House majority leader when the U.A.W. first prompted a union vote at the Volkswagen plant in 2014.
Six Republican governors highlighted those concerns in a statement on Tuesday, which said that the union campaign was "driven by misinformation and scare tactics." Opposition from state and local politicians helped defeat the union in a vote at a Nissan plant in Mississippi in 2017 and in elections at VW in Chattanooga in 2014 and 2019.
The U.A.W.'s political support for Democrats -- the union endorsed President Biden's re-election in January -- could also be a vulnerability in such a fight. Isaac Meadows, a worker at the Volkswagen plant, said in an interview in February that the endorsement had led some co-workers to have second thoughts about the union, but that he had advised them that "the political landscape changes every four to eight years and doesn't directly affect us."
Even so, a change in presidential administrations could bring a more skeptical National Labor Relations Board, which presides over union elections and enforces labor law and could make it more difficult for the union to win at other plants.
Worker advocates and union organizers acknowledged that the win in Chattanooga could trigger a strong response. "You have to imagine the backlash," said Erica Smiley, executive director of Jobs With Justice, which helps workers seeking to unionize and bargain collectively. "My hope is that enough people understand both within the U.A.W. and within the union world writ large that you have to defend the union election."
Organizers also conceded that any momentum generated by the union victory in Chattanooga could be muted until workers there win a contract that brings concrete gains, a process that can take years.
It has been two years since Amazon workers at a Staten Island warehouse became the first to win a union election at the company in the United States, and they have yet to begin bargaining as the company challenges the victory. The lack of progress toward a contract appears to have complicated organizing efforts at other Amazon sites.
But the Volkswagen employees in Chattanooga have advantages that the Amazon workers lack. Unlike the Amazon Labor Union, their union is well established and can invest millions of dollars in staff and legal work to help bargain a contract. And Volkswagen appears more willing than Amazon to bargain, partly because of its labor ties in Germany.
"If workers in Chattanooga get a great contract, a big raise, better health benefits, and then the same thing at Mercedes, there will be a lot more good opportunities to win good contracts in short order," said Madeline Janis, co-executive director of Jobs to Move America, a group that seeks to create good jobs in clean technology industries.
Ms. Janis, whose group is involved in unionizing factory workers in the South, said the momentum could travel beyond the auto industry to other manufacturers because employees at different companies in the region often know one another and discuss these issues. "Their brothers and sisters and spouses are working at other plants," she said. "It will be all over social media."
And some experts said that a rise in unionization at factories could spread to other types of jobs. "The enthusiasm is contagious across sectors," said David Pryzbylski, a lawyer at Barnes & Thornburg who represents employers. "People look at it and say, 'Hey, I think there's something here. Maybe I should be interested in it, too."'
Several workers echoed the point, saying they had drawn encouragement from labor actions in other industries over the past few years. Successful campaigns in Hollywood and at companies like Starbucks and Apple "have been a major boon for us," said Emma Geiger, a worker at Sega of America who helped unionize the video game maker last year. "Especially in the perception of unions on the whole as not something to be feared, but to be embraced."
Overall, nearly 70 percent of Americans say they support unions, according to Gallup, up from about 50 percent a decade and a half ago. After dropping for several years, the number of union members increased by nearly 280,000 in 2022 and by about half that amount last year, though the percentage of workers in unions dropped slightly because even more people entered the work force. Filings for union elections were up 35 percent in the six months ending in March compared with the same period one year earlier, according to the National Labor Relations Board.
During the mid-1930s, union membership grew by several hundred thousand for three straight years, then jumped by roughly three million in 1937, most of it after the U.A.W. organized General Motors.
Another expansion on this scale is unlikely given changes in the economy, including the shift away from manufacturing as a source of jobs. But Michael Lotito, a lawyer at Littler Mendelson, which represents employers, said the past few years had produced "a lot of kindling" that could make it easier for a fire of sorts to spread.
Citing workers' frustrations over the pandemic and return-to-office policies, which they have amplified on social media, he said that "from a management perspective, it's of concern."

Workers in Tennessee Vote to Join the U.A.W.: [National Desk]

Full text: The Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga is set to become the first unionized auto factory in the South not owned by one of Detroit's Big Three.
In a landmark victory for organized labor, workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee have voted overwhelmingly to join the United Automobile Workers union, becoming the first nonunion auto plant in a Southern state to do so.
The company said in a statement late Friday that the union had won 2,628 votes, with 985 opposed, in a three-day election. Two earlier bids by the U.A.W. to organize the Chattanooga factory over the last 10 years were narrowly defeated.
The outcome is a breakthrough for the labor movement in a region where anti-union sentiment has been strong for decades. And it comes six months after the U.A.W. won record wage gains and improved benefits in negotiations with the Detroit automakers.
The U.A.W. has for more than 80 years represented workers employed by General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the producer of Chrysler, Jeep, Ram and Dodge vehicles, and has organized some heavy-truck and bus factories in the South.
But the union had failed in previous attempts to organize any of the two dozen automobile factories owned by other companies across an area stretching from South Carolina to Texas and as far north as Ohio and Indiana.
With the victory in Chattanooga, the U.A.W. will turn its focus to other Southern plants. A vote will take place in mid-May at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Ala., near Tuscaloosa. The U.A.W. is hoping to organize a half-dozen or more plants over the next two years.
"Tonight you all together have taken a giant, historic step," Shawn Fain, the president of the U.A.W., said at a celebratory gathering in Chattanooga. "Tonight we celebrate this historic moment in our nation's and our union's history. Let's get to it and go to work and win more for the working class of this nation."
A string of victories for the U.A.W. could have profound effects for Southern auto workers and the broader auto industry. Nonunion auto workers typically earn significantly lower wages than those in U.A.W.-represented plants, and collective bargaining could bring them substantial increases in pay, benefits and job security.
"Volkswagen workers will have a chance for better pay and working conditions under a collective bargaining agreement," said Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. "They'll have a lot of job protections under a union contract that they don't have now."
At G.M., Ford and Stellantis, any layoffs have to be planned with advance notice to the union, and workers get supplemented unemployment benefits. Nonunion plants don't have to take such measures.
A large U.A.W. presence in the South would also upset an automotive landscape in which U.A.W. contracts have left G.M., Ford and Stellantis with higher labor costs than nonunion rivals like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Tesla and Hyundai.
"This is a watershed moment for the industry," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the U.A.W. for more than three decades. "It sets an example that would resonate across the industry, and across other industries where there's a large presence of nonunion workers."
The U.A.W.'s success in the negotiations with the Big Three in the fall set off a surge in interest among Southern autoworkers in organizing their own plants, the union said, and prompted the U.A.W. to kick off a $ 40 million effort to support them.
Volkswagen workers who voted in favor of U.A.W. representation said they hoped the union would help them win higher wages and more paid time off. The Chattanooga factory currently pays a top wage of about $ 35 an hour, compared with the top wage of more than $ 40 an hour that G.M., Ford and Stellantis now pay U.A.W. workers.
The U.A.W. contracts also provide health care coverage that is almost entirely paid by the companies, substantial profit-sharing bonuses, cost-of-living adjustments to insulate workers from inflation and generous retirement programs.
Among those voting for the U.A.W. in Chattanooga was Tony Akridge, 48, who is in his second year at the VW plant, working on motors and transmissions on the night shift. His $ 23 hourly wage exceeded what he earned in previous jobs, he said, but he voted for the U.A.W. in hopes that the union could help improve workers' living standards.
"It gives us a better opportunity," Mr. Akridge said. "They pay us OK, but it's not good enough for the things they need done. Noting the rising cost of living, he added that the union "will get better benefits toward that, making life just a little bit more easy."
Others are counting on U.A.W. representation to bring more paid time off. Most VW workers must either take unpaid time off when the plant shuts down in the summer and around the holidays, or use paid time off to cover those periods. If they do, many are left with only a few days to cover any sick days or family leave the rest of the year, workers said.
"We're forced to use our P.T.O. a lot instead of using it on our own terms sometimes," said Craig Jackson, 56, who voted for the union.
At the Detroit automakers, U.A.W. workers get up to five weeks of vacation and 19 paid holidays, and are allowed two weeks for parental leave.
Workers who opposed the union at VW said they were unsure what gains the U.A.W. could bring them.
"You really don't have any kind of guarantee with them," said Darrell Belcher, 54, who has worked on the assembly floor for 13 years and voted against the U.A.W. in the two previous elections at the plant. "I'm not saying we won't gain anything, but we are probably going to lose something just to gain it."
As the voting was about to start, the governors of Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas -- all Republicans -- issued a statement on Tuesday saying unionizing would jeopardize auto jobs in their states.
"We want to keep good-paying jobs and continue to grow the American auto manufacturing sector here," the governors said. "A successful unionization drive will stop this growth in its tracks, to the detriment of American workers."
But even some VW workers who opposed the U.A.W. said they did not think union representation would endanger the Chattanooga plant. "I do not feel that the plant will leave Chattanooga or the South," said Cody Rose, 34, a 13-year veteran of the plant who works in body shop production. "Volkswagen has too much invested in this area."
The Chattanooga plant opened in 2011, and employs 5,500 people, of whom about 4,300 were eligible to vote in the union election. The plant produces the VW Atlas, a large sport utility vehicle, and an electric vehicle, the ID.4. It is Volkswagen's only plant in the United States, and was the only VW plant in the world that was not unionized.
The U.A.W. had some advantages in winning support at Volkswagen. Its effort had the support of IG Metall, the powerful union that represents autoworkers in Germany. German companies also have a strong tradition of giving workers a voice. Under German law, worker representatives must hold half the seats on a company's supervisory board, the equivalent of a board of directors.
The U.A.W. can now turn its attention to the Mercedes plant in Alabama, which employs about 6,100 people. The union tried to organize that plant once before, but the effort died out before coming to a vote.

Google Fires 28 Workers
For Israeli Contract Sit-In
Google fired 28 employees on Wednesday after dozens of employees participated in sit-ins at the company's New York and Sunnyvale, Calif., offices to protest the company's cloud computing contract with the Israeli government.
A day earlier, nine employees were arrested on charges of trespassing at the two offices.
"Physically impeding other employees' work and preventing them from accessing our facilities is a clear violation of our policies, and completely unacceptable behavior," a Google spokeswoman said in a statement.
Years before the dismissals, tensions had been simmering between the company's management and some activist employees over Project Nimbus, a $ 1.2 billion Google and Amazon deal to supply the Israeli government with cloud services, such as artificial intelligence. Some Google employees have expressed concern that the company was aiding Israel's military.
That discord had deepened since the war in Gaza began in October. Google recently fired an employee who disrupted an Israeli technology conference in New York. And the company is even planning to make changes to a corporate forum because employees were bickering about the conflict.
Google said it would continue to investigate the Tuesday protests. In Sunnyvale, employees refused to leave the office of Thomas Kurian, the chief executive of Google Cloud.
Google employees affiliated with the group that organized the sit-ins, called No Tech for Apartheid, said in a statement that the firings were "a flagrant act of retaliation."
"Google workers have the right to peacefully protest about terms and conditions of our labor," the employees said. They added that some of the employees Google fired had not participated in the sit-ins.

Alabama Auto Workers
To Vote on Unionizing
Thousands of workers at a big Mercedes-Benz factory near Tuscaloosa, Alabama, will vote next month on whether they want to be represented by the United Auto Workers union.
The National Labor Relations Board said Thursday that the vote will take place from May 13 to May 17 at the facilities in Vance and Woodstock, Ala. Votes will be counted by the agency on May 17.
The vote will be the second in the union's drive to organize 150,000 workers at more than a dozen nonunion auto manufacturing plants largely in Southern states. About 4,300 workers at Volkswagen's factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., are voting on union representation this week, with the vote tally to be announced on Friday.
The organizing effort comes after the union won big pay raises after workers struck Detroit's three automakers last fall.
The Mercedes facilities had about 6,100 employees as of the end of 2023. More than 5,000 are calling for the union vote, the union has said.
Earlier this week the governors of six Southern states, including Alabama and Tennessee, put out a statement saying that workers will put their jobs in jeopardy if they vote for a union.

Voting Tests Union's Push At VW Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers hopes contract gains at the Big Three carmakers will provide momentum in a broad effort to organize nonunion plants.
Last fall the United Automobile Workers union won big pay increases from the Detroit automakers, and the impact rippled quickly through the nonunion auto plants scattered across the South.
Afterward, Toyota, Honda, Volkswagen, Nissan, Hyundai and Tesla raised wages for their own hourly workers in the United States, none of whom are unionized. On production lines in Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and elsewhere, those pay increases have been referred to as the "U.A.W. bump."
Now 4,300 workers at Volkswagen's plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., will test whether the union can achieve an even greater bump. On Wednesday, they began voting on whether to join the U.A.W., and the prospects of a union victory appear high. About 70 percent of the workers pledged to vote yes before the union asked for a vote, according to the U.A.W.
"I think our chances are excellent," said Kelcey Smith, 48, who has worked in the VW plant's paint department for a year and is a member of a committee working to build support for the U.A.W. "The energy is high. I think we are going to nail it."
Volkswagen has presented reasons it believes a union is not needed at the plant, including pay that is above average for the Chattanooga region. But it has also said it encourages all workers to vote in the election, which is to conclude on Friday, and decide for themselves. "No one will lose their job for voting for or against the union," a company spokesman said.
The stakes go beyond the Tennessee plant, Volkswagen's only U.S. factory. A victory there would add fuel to the U.A.W.'s push to extend its presence to the more than two dozen nonunion auto plants in the United States, mostly clustered in Southern states where union resistance has been strong historically, and where right-to-work laws make it hard for unions to organize workers.
The U.A.W.'s chances beyond the Volkswagen factory are unclear. Japanese and South Korean automakers have demonstrated more forceful opposition to the U.A.W. than the German companies. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has spoken out against the U.A.W. on several occasions over the last few years.
And on Tuesday, the Republican governors of six states -- Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas -- denounced the U.A.W. drive, saying in a statement that they were "highly concerned about the unionization campaign driven by misinformation and scare tactics that the U.A.W. has brought into our states."
"We have worked tirelessly on behalf of our constituents to bring good-paying jobs to our states," the governors declared. "These jobs have become part of the fabric of the automotive manufacturing industry. Unionization would certainly put our states' jobs in jeopardy."
The vote at VW will be followed by another election -- as yet unscheduled -- at a Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Ala., where the U.A.W. says a majority of workers have signed up to back the union.
The U.A.W. says victories at VW, Mercedes and other plants would bring increased wages, richer benefits and higher living standards for tens of thousands of workers, many of them in the nation's poorer counties.
Widespread unionizing in the Southern plants would also help level a playing field that for nearly half a century has been tilted against the three unionized Detroit manufacturers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler. In operating nonunion factories, foreign-owned companies have a significant labor-cost advantage over their U.S.-based rivals.
"It would be a revolution for the U.A.W. and for the auto industry," said Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who has followed the U.A.W. for more than three decades. "It would break the glass ceiling for unions in the South, and would mean more purchasing power for working-class people in that region."
The U.A.W. has organized several heavy-truck and bus plants in the South, but for decades has tried and failed to do the same at automobile factories, which are typically larger.
The VW election is the union's third try at the plant. Workers rejected U.A.W. representation by a vote of 712 to 626 in 2014, and by an even narrower margin, 833 to 776, in 2019. Opposition from Republican elected officials in Tennessee was vociferous in those campaigns.
In the last 10 years, the U.A.W. also lost in a 2017 vote at a Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., and an organizing drive at the Mercedes plant fizzled without an election.
In those efforts, the U.A.W. was hampered by a dubious track record and a questionable reputation. Over nearly 30 years, the Detroit automakers closed dozens of plants, eliminating tens of thousands of hourly jobs, despite the U.A.W.'s objections. Some industry executives have blamed high union wages, in part, for pushing G.M. and Chrysler into bankruptcy in 2009. In addition, the union was racked by corruption scandals that resulted in prison sentences for two former presidents and about a dozen other senior U.A.W. officials.
In the past two years, however, the U.A.W. has undergone a transformation. Financial reforms and transparency measures overseen by a federal monitor have helped root out corruption. A feisty president, Shawn Fain, was chosen in the union's first direct election by the membership. In the contract negotiations last year with G.M., Ford and Stellantis, Mr. Fain used a new approach, choosing all three companies as strike targets but shutting down only selected plants, which put pressure on the companies without crippling them or damaging the broader U.S. economy.
After six weeks, the union had contracts raising the top wage 25 percent, to more than $ 40 an hour. Pay for workers lower on the wage scale will rise to the top wage over three years instead of eight. Some will see their pay double. A worker putting in 40 hours a week at the top wage will earn about $ 83,000 a year. In recent years, profit-sharing bonuses have added about $ 9,000 to $ 14,000.
On top of that, the new contracts provide wage adjustments if inflation pushes the cost of living higher, improved pensions and retirement benefits, and increased paid time off. U.A.W. workers have also long had company-paid health care with no deductibles or co-payments.
Hourly wages at the nonunion auto plants used to start under $ 20 and top out around $ 32. The "U.A.W. bump" lifted the range to roughly $ 22 to $ 35. Volkswagen said its workers typically earned about $ 60,000 a year. (The annual mean wage for all occupations in the Chattanooga area was $ 54,480 in May, according to the U.S. Labor Department.)
Seizing on momentum from the Big Three negotiations, Mr. Fain said, the union will spend $ 40 million through 2026 to support organizing at plants owned by Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda, Volvo and Tesla, as well as others owned by the electric vehicle start-ups Rivian and Lucid Motors.
VW workers who support the U.A.W. say their wages are pretty good for Tennessee but point 300 miles north to Louisville, Ky., where Ford pays many workers more than $ 40 an hour to make the Expedition sport utility vehicle, which competes with the VW Atlas made in Chattanooga.
"If Ford can pay that much, why can't Volkswagen pay us the same?" said Isaac Meadows, 40, a father of six who has worked at the VW plant for 14 months. "We have more worth than they're paying us."
There are concerns beyond the hourly wage. Workers must use paid time off if they want to be paid during two periods when the plant shuts down around the year-end holidays and in summer.
Once he covers the shutdowns with vacation days, Mr. Meadows said, he is left with about 16 hours of paid time off to cover any family events or sick days for the rest of the year. "I miss my kids' dances, sporting events, family gatherings," he said. "I miss a lot because I've got to work."

Dr. Martens Expects Drop In Its Wholesale Revenue
Shares in bootmaker Dr. Martens plunged more than 30 percent Tuesday after forecast wholesale revenue in the U.S., its largest market, would decline by double-digits compared with last year.
Trading in Dr. Martens stock was temporarily halted on the London Stock Exchange early Tuesday, according to FactSet.
The decline could translate into a sizable hit to profits, with the company pointing to a base projected impact of 20 million pounds ( $ 24.9 million) on pretax earnings year-over-year.
Beyond weakening revenue, Dr. Martens anticipates other hefty expenses related to the company's employee retention plans as well as single-digit inflation in its cost base.
Dr. Martens also announced a leadership shake-up on Tuesday. After six years at the helm of the company, Kenny Wilson will step down as chief. Ije Nwokorie, Dr. Martens' chief brand officer, will take his place. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Southern Governors PushAgainst Vote for U.A.W.
On the eve of a vote on union representation at Volkswagen's Tennessee factory, the state's governor, Bill Lee, right, and other Southern governors are telling workers that voting for a union would put jobs in jeopardy.
About 4,300 workers at VW's plant in Chattanooga will start voting Wednesday on representation by the United Automobile Workers union.
"We are seeing in the fallout of the Detroit Three strike with those automakers rethinking investments and cutting jobs," the governors said in a statement Tuesday. "Putting businesses in our states in that position is the last thing we want to do."
The Govs. Kay Ivey of Alabama, Brian Kemp of Georgia, Tate Reeves of Mississippi, Henry McMaster of South Carolina and Greg Abbott of Texas also signed on to the statement.
The U.A.W. declined to comment. ASSOCIATED PRESS

After Losing Year, Adidas Raises Outlook for Profit
The German sportswear giant Adidas on Tuesday raised its 2024 profit outlook after what it said was a better than expected first quarter. In an unscheduled announcement, the company said it now expects full-year operating profit of about 700 million euros ( $ 744 million), up from the 500 million euros previously forecast.
The upbeat comments about 2024 come a month after Adidas posted its first annual loss in more than three decades.
Frankfurt-listed shares in the company, which is scheduled to publish final first-quarter results on April 30, were up 3.5 percent.
Adidas said quarterly operating profit reached 336 million euros, up from 60 million a year earlier, when it was hit by the breakup with Kanye West and the discontinuation of its Yeezy business.
Adidas further said it sold another 150 million euros worth of Yeezy products in the quarter, for an operating profit of around 50 million euros. REUTERS

Why Berlin Can't Afford To Break Up With Beijing: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: China remains one of the most important markets for Germany's export-driven economy, prompting a three-day visit by the German chancellor, who has stressed the importance of open markets.
When Germany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, took office in 2021, he pledged that his government would shift his country's relationship with China away from one of economic dependence. Three years later, talk of scaling back reliance on China has been replaced with calls for equal access to China's market for foreign firms.
That strategy puts the Germans at odds with many of their closest allies, including the United States and other European countries, which would like to see China scale back its recent surge of exports in the green energy sector, including electric vehicles. The U.S. Treasury secretary, Janet L. Yellen, has talked about imposing trade restrictions on China.
The chief executives of several leading multinational companies based in Germany joined Mr. Scholz on his three-day tour of China, which included a meeting with Xi Jinping, China's top leader, in Beijing on Tuesday. All of the company leaders oversee large operations in China that they are eager not only to maintain, but in many cases to expand.
That leaves Mr. Scholz facing the delicate act of balancing the export-oriented needs of his domestic economy with pressure from allies to leverage his country's position to make demands on the Chinese.
How deep is the relationship between Germany and China?
German companies invested 10.4 billion euros, or $ 11 billion, in China last year and, unlike their counterparts in Japan and the United States, they have showed little sign of waning.
Some analysts see this as proof of German strength in its position to push its agenda with Chinese leaders.
"Germany plays an exceptionally special role for China in the development of its economy and also in foreign trade relations," said Max J. Zenglein, chief economist at the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin. Electronics and electronic technology, along with machines and chemicals, remain important exports from Germany to China.
"As countries such as the U.S.A. and Japan are positioning themselves much more sharply in relation to China, Germany has an important function when it comes to access to technology and capital," he said. "Germany is definitely in a position of strength here."
How are German companies faring in China?
About 5,000 German companies are active in China. But in a recent survey of 150 members of the German Chamber of Commerce in Greater China, two-thirds said they felt they faced unfair competition in the country.
German companies believe their products offer superior quality, innovation and technical leadership compared with those made by their Chinese competitors. But increasingly limited access to government officials and regulators have the Germans concerned they will lose out on business that is key to their global success.
Mr. Scholz highlighted the role that German companies have played in helping China to grow its economy, in remarks released by the chancellor's office ahead of his meeting with Mr. Xi on Tuesday.
"In the past two days, together with a business delegation, I have visited Chongqing and Shanghai and been impressed with how German companies contribute to growth, innovation and sustainability in China," Mr. Scholz said.
What about fears of Chinese goods flooding Germany?
Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, expressed concerns last week that Europe remained the last market that was fully open to China. Last fall, the European Union opened an investigation into whether electric vehicles made in China benefited from unfair subsidies, with a decision expected by this summer. She cited Brazil, Turkey and the United States as countries that were pursuing steps that could lead to trade restrictions on Chinese products.
Among the executives traveling with Mr. Scholz were the heads of BMW and Mercedes-Benz -- Volkswagen's chief executive pulled out at the last minute, citing a conflict. All three of Germany's main automakers are heavily invested in China and appear intent on remaining competitive in the market.
"China is the largest automobile market in the world. We are a leading luxury auto maker and we have grown strongly in China and have a strong presence," Ola Källenius, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, said in comments to German public broadcaster ARD. "Withdrawing from such a large market is not an option, on the contrary, we are expanding our position here."
Representatives of the German auto industry point out that thousands of jobs in Germany depend on the revenue generated in the Chinese market. German auto makers increasingly rely on teams in China for research and development in fields such as automated driving that are not as advanced in Europe.
During the trip, ministers from both countries signed an agreement to work toward the standardization of autonomous driving technology.
"Our guiding principle should always be free trade and competition" Oliver Zipse, chairman of BMW said, naming Japan, Korea and other countries who sell their cars in Europe. "We do not feel threatened by Chinese automakers."

Tesla Plans To Lay Off Over 10% Of Workers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Along with the departure of two senior executives, the cuts added to signs of turmoil at the electric car company.
Signs of turmoil at Tesla multiplied on Monday after the electric car company told employees it would lay off more than 10 percent of the work force to cut costs and two senior executives resigned.
The job cuts, amounting to about 14,000 people, come as the company faces increasing competition and declining sales. The management changes and layoffs are a reminder of the unpredictability of Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, at a critical time for the company.
Mr. Musk has not outlined a plan to reverse a decline in car sales, and he appears focused on long-shot ventures such as a self-driving taxi, rather than new models that would help Tesla compete with cars being introduced by established carmakers and new rivals from China.
"As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, it is extremely important to look at every aspect of the company for cost reductions and increasing productivity," Mr. Musk told employees in a Monday morning email, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times.
"There is nothing I hate more, but it must be done," he wrote.
Hours after that email, Drew Baglino, a senior vice president who has played a big role in the company's rise from start-up to dominant electric car maker, said he had resigned.
"I made the difficult decision to move on from Tesla after 18 years yesterday," Mr. Baglino said in a post on X, the social media site. Mr. Baglino is one of only three managers besides Mr. Musk listed as a top executive on the company's website. His longevity was unusual at a company known for high management turnover.
Mr. Baglino may have been blamed for some of Tesla's recent troubles, said Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, an investment firm. "Someone has to take the fall for the sharp deceleration in deliveries growth, near record inventories, and declining margins and it wasn't going to be Elon," Mr. Black said on X.
Tesla also appeared to be losing an executive key to winning regulatory approval for self-driving technology. Rohan Patel, a former aide to President Barack Obama who was Tesla's head of policy and business development, tacitly confirmed reports that he was leaving. In a post on X, Mr. Patel thanked his co-workers and Mr. Musk for "the past eight years at Tesla."
"My plans are to be a recess monitor for my second grade daughter, practice my violin, go to a bunch of bucket list sporting events and take my very patient wife on some long intended travel," Mr. Patel said.
Investors often welcome job cuts because they can lead to higher profits. But that was not the case Monday, with Tesla shares ending the day down more than 5 percent.
Tesla regularly culls its work force to remove employees whose performance managers consider weak, but the numbers are typically smaller. "This is something Elon and Tesla have consistently done throughout his career," said Scott Acheychek, chief executive of REX Shares, which offers funds investors use to bet on or against Tesla's stock. "Ten percent is pretty big," Mr. Acheychek added.
Mr. Musk's email to employees was earlier reported by Electrek, an online news site, and Handelsblatt, a German business newspaper.
Mr. Musk did not indicate where the cuts would be made. Many of Tesla's workers are based at four large car factories in Fremont, Calif., Austin, Texas, and Shanghai and near Berlin. Tesla also has a factory in Buffalo that produces charging equipment and a factory near Reno, Nev., that makes batteries.
The layoffs may help the United Automobile Workers union's efforts to organize Tesla employees in the United States. The company's workers may be more open to the union if they believe that representation would give them greater job security. Workers at a Volkswagen factory in Tennessee will vote this week on joining the U.A.W., and Mercedes-Benz workers in Alabama will vote next month.
Mr. Musk's many other ventures, and his penchant for making polarizing political statements, have raised questions about his focus on managing Tesla. Wall Street is increasingly concerned about the company: Tesla's share price has lost about one-third of its value this year.
Many investors had expressed hope that Tesla would revive flagging sales by introducing a car that would sell for about $ 25,000 as early as next year, increasing the number of people who could afford the company's cars and responding to competition from Chinese companies that are already selling electric cars for as little as half that price tag.
Mr. Musk cast doubt on those plans by announcing this month that Tesla would unveil a Robotaxi in August. The self-driving taxi is seen as a long shot, in part because even the most advanced systems available today sometimes make glaring mistakes. In addition, federal and state regulators will have to sign off before Tesla can put such taxis on the road.
This month, Tesla reported a decline in sales that caught investors off guard. The company said it delivered 387,000 cars worldwide in the first quarter, down 8.5 percent from the year before. It was the first time Tesla's quarterly sales had fallen on a year over year basis since the start of the pandemic in 2020.
The company slashed prices significantly over the course of 2023 to increase demand, which has reduced the profit Tesla makes on each car. Last week, Tesla reduced the price of its most advanced driver-assistance software to $ 99 a month from $ 199. But price cuts appear to be losing their effectiveness. Tesla will announce its financial results for the first quarter on April 23.
Rivals like BYD of China, BMW of Germany, and Kia and Hyundai Motor of South Korea reported increases in electric vehicle sales for the same period, suggesting that slower overall demand for battery-powered models was not the only explanation for Tesla's problems.
Established companies are closing the gap with Tesla on battery technology, and have been building new assembly lines to achieve the cost savings made possible by mass production. Honda plans to begin producing electric vehicles at a factory in Marysville, Ohio, next year.
Hyundai will begin producing electric cars at a new factory in Georgia in October, José Muñoz, the president and global chief operating officer of Hyundai Motor, said in an interview last month. Hyundai will also begin allowing customers to buy cars on Amazon, an answer to Tesla's practice of selling cars online.
Mr. Muñoz said that customers had been willing to pay more for Hyundai electric cars than they would for comparable Teslas. "At the beginning, Tesla was premium," he said. "Now we're premium."

Full text: The vehicle that Simpson fled in as 95 million Americans watched on television is on display at the Alcatraz East Crime Museum in Pigeon Forge, Tenn.
Tyler Starrett was on vacation with his family in Pigeon Forge, about 35 miles from Knoxville in eastern Tennessee, when they learned on Thursday that O.J. Simpson had died.
So they changed plans. They had heard that one of the key artifacts of the Simpson case happened to be on display nearby at the Alcatraz East Crime Museum: the 1993 white Ford Bronco that Simpson fled from the police in, just days after the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson, his former wife, and Ronald L. Goldman. They could not resist.
"If the Bronco is here in Pigeon Forge, why don't we go see it?" Starrett, 23, said.
Starrett is too young to have been among the 95 million television viewers who watched the low-speed chase unfold on June 17, 1994, when a swarm of police cars followed the white Bronco over some 60 miles of Southern California freeways, with Simpson holding a gun to his head in the back seat. But he was among those who visited the museum to see the vehicle in person on Thursday, as a three-minute clip of the police chase played on loop in the background.
Pigeon Forge, best known for Dollywood, Dolly Parton's theme park, is at first glance not an obvious home for such a relic. But in recent years, this town has increasingly become a place for attractions and museums dedicated to the offbeat and believe-it-or-not interests of an American tourist -- including the Alcatraz East Crime Museum, which is housed in a prisonlike building designed to be a cross between the Tennessee State Prison just outside Nashville and the original Alcatraz, in San Francisco Bay.
Inside the museum, the white Bronco is one of several notorious vehicles.
It sits alongside the 1968 Volkswagen Beetle that was owned by the serial killer Ted Bundy, the 1933 Essex-Terraplane used by the bank robber John Dillinger and the so-called death car from the 1967 movie "Bonnie and Clyde," riddled with bullet holes. (A Pigeon Forge snow globe featuring the museum, the Bronco and the Beetle can be purchased for $ 10.99 in the gift shop.)
"There are events in history that will always stick in people's minds, and I think the O.J. chase is one of those for a large number of people," said Ally Pennington, the artifacts and projects manager for the museum.
The chase, captured by news helicopters and broadcast live on television, gripped the nation. Networks interrupted Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals and prime-time shows, and brought star news anchors back to their newsrooms to narrate the scene.
Simpson, a former football star, eventually surrendered at his Los Angeles home. He was later acquitted of both sets of murder charges after an equally high-profile criminal trial, but was found liable for their deaths in a civil suit several years later.
The Bronco is among the most popular and most prominent exhibits at the privately owned museum, which opened in 2016 after a similar crime museum closed in Washington. The vehicle belonged to Al Cowlings, Simpson's friend and former teammate, who was driving it about 40 miles per hour as Simpson fled the police.
The car was previously featured on a 2017 episode of the reality television show "Pawn Stars," on which Mike Gilbert, a former agent for Simpson, said he purchased the car in part to keep it from potentially being used by a tour company. He unsuccessfully sought more than $ 1 million for it on the show.
The museum declined to say who allowed for the display of the car, citing privacy concerns.
"Different generations have different responses to it, because obviously people who watched the chase live and who were around for that respond differently," Pennington said. She added, "Most people are just shocked to see it because it is the white Bronco from the O.J. chase and it's such an iconic moment in history."
Never far from the museum's mind, Pennington said, are the victims of the crimes featured in the exhibits, or the pain experienced by those who survive them. She said that while Simpson's death might change aspects of a temporary display recognizing the 30th anniversary of the tragedy, it planned to focus on the victims.
On Thursday, the museum had taped a label acknowledging Simpson's death on a plexiglass case next to the Bronco that displays a set of his golf clubs. At least two visitors learned of his death from the sign.
"It was pretty wild -- you'd have people arguing about it, you know, at Waffle House," David Hardigree, who was visiting from Northern Kentucky, recalled of the Simpson trial, and the debates over whether he was guilty or not.
But his visit on Thursday, he said, was just "ironic timing."

At One German Plant, All In on Electric: [Correction]

Full text: Zwickau, a city in Germany's east, may not be as famous as Detroit, but its economy has revolved around internal combustion engines since August Horch established Audi here at the beginning of the 20th century.
So when Volkswagen announced in 2018 that it would convert its Zwickau factory, the largest private employer in the area, to manufacture nothing but electric vehicles, it was a big deal.
"A lot of people were skeptical," said Michael Fuchs, who has worked at the factory for more than a quarter century. They wondered, "What's going to happen?" he said.
Volkswagen shut down assembly lines churning out its popular Golf hatchbacks and converted the factory, which has its own exit on the autobahn, to make six electric models. The remodeled plant can produce a car a minute, shipping them out by train.
It was a rare case of a major car plant's switching completely from internal combustion to battery power, making Zwickau a case study for a big question confronting the auto industry.
Electric vehicles have far fewer parts than gasoline cars -- no radiators, exhaust pipes, fuel tanks, fan belts or complicated gearboxes. As a result, many autoworkers, executives and politicians have hypothesized that such cars would require fewer workers, leading to mass unemployment in factory towns and cities worldwide.
Zwickau, where more than 10,000 people work for Volkswagen and tens of thousands more for suppliers, appears to have avoided those dire consequences. Employment hasn't fallen off a cliff, and suppliers of combustion vehicle parts haven't been forced into bankruptcy en masse. Its experience offers some hopeful lessons for other places that depend on the auto industry.
Yet people in Zwickau, with its immaculate but sleepy downtown, are still uneasy.
While Zwickau's experience suggests that conversion to electric vehicles will not itself lead to economic misery, this and other new technologies are shaking up the industry in ways that could still be very painful for established companies and their workers.
One big change already visible in Germany and the rest of Europe is the fast growth of young Chinese electric carmakers like BYD and SAIC, which are increasingly luring customers away from established rivals like Volkswagen, the world's second-largest automaker after Toyota.
"The question is: How much will mobility change overall?" said Thomas Knabel, who leads the Zwickau local of IG Metall, the union that represents Volkswagen workers. "In the future, will Volkswagen still be present?"
The best-selling electric car in Europe is Tesla's Model Y sport utility vehicle, built at a factory around 145 miles north of Zwickau near Berlin. Last year, Volkswagen sold fewer than half as many of its equivalent S.U.V., the ID.4, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.
Disappointing sales have prompted Volkswagen to cut a shift on one of its two assembly lines in Zwickau, where the company makes the ID.4, the ID.5, two Audi models and two small electric cars. The decision illustrated the downside of going all-in on electric vehicles. Other established carmakers have hedged their bets, producing electric vehicles and fuel-burning cars in the same factories, allowing them to adjust to fluctuating sales.
"It's a much more ambitious project than anything I know about in North America," said Ian Greer, a research professor at Cornell University who has studied the region around Zwickau. "VW has taken a much bigger risk."
With the factory operating below capacity, some people in Zwickau wonder whether Volkswagen's electric vehicles are appealing enough.
Max Jankowsky, president of the regional Chamber of Commerce, said he was disappointed that he hadn't seen any Volkswagens during a recent trip to Dubai. "It was just Teslas, Teslas, Teslas," said Mr. Jankowsky, who is also the president of a company that makes cast iron parts for Volkswagen suppliers and other manufacturers.
Volkswagen's executives say they expect sales to pick up this year as it begins selling new models, including a station wagon and a van, targeting market segments that Tesla does not play in.
"We are aware of our current challenges and are tackling them rigorously," Oliver Blume, the Volkswagen chief executive, said last month in a statement.
In the short term, at least, the pain to the local economy caused by the Zwickau factory's conversion was surprisingly mild, local officials, business leaders and worker representatives say.
Increased demand for workers to manufacture electronic components largely compensated for job losses from production lines that made parts for combustion cars, according to a study by AMZ Saxony, a suppliers' group.
"All in all," said Dirk Vogel, chief executive of AMZ, "not that much happened."
Volkswagen, local businesses and officials coordinated an effort to prepare workers and businesses, blunting the impact.
The carmaker expanded its training institute in Zwickau to teach employees about electric vehicle technology. To generate enthusiasm, Volkswagen allowed workers to borrow battery-powered cars for a few days. The West Saxon University of Applied Sciences in Zwickau, a state college that already had a strong focus on the auto industry, expanded courses related to electric vehicle technology.
Suppliers developed new components for electric vehicles to replace products in danger of becoming obsolete. Eberspächer, a German supplier that has a factory 60 miles east of Zwickau, near Dresden, began offering temperature-control systems for electric vehicles in addition to emission systems for conventional cars.
A few suppliers have suffered. GKN Driveline, which makes drive shafts not needed in most electric cars, is closing a factory in Zwickau and shifting production to Hungary. But GKN did not supply Volkswagen, and the closure appears to be a reaction to broader trends in the industry and German labor costs. GKN did not reply to requests for comment.
New technology has also created jobs, including 175 at FDTech, based in the nearby city, Chemnitz. The firm, partly owned by Volkswagen, is one of five companies in the area developing autonomous driving technology.
Zwickau benefits from some unique good fortune. Many local suppliers make seats, dashboards, painting equipment or other products that electric vehicles need just as much as gasoline cars.
Because of a shortage of electricians, engineers and other skilled workers, the unemployment rate in the state of Saxony, which includes Zwickau, has increased only modestly. It was 6.6 percent in March amid an overall economic slowdown, up from 6.3 percent a year earlier.
"There will be suppliers that disappear," said Karsten Schulze, the managing director of FDTech. "But the skilled workers will be immediately sought after elsewhere."
Volkswagen workers had some control because German law requires them to be consulted on changes that affect working conditions. The IG Metall union extracted a promise from the company not to lay off any full-time employees in Zwickau until 2030 at the earliest. The guarantee does not apply to temporary workers, however, and the company let 270 of them go after their contracts expired.
In the United States, unions are relatively strong in the Midwest and East, but most automobile factories in the South are not unionized. The United Automobile Workers is trying to change that. But even if the union is successful, U.S. companies will have no obligation to consult workers about changes that will affect their jobs, or to retrain them for new jobs. And there is no guarantee that new jobs making batteries, for example, will pay as well as jobs in factories where cars are assembled.
Residents note with pride that Zwickau has survived many upheavals. After Germany's defeat in World War II, Soviet occupiers confiscated Audi's manufacturing equipment. The carmaker moved to Bavaria and was later acquired by Volkswagen.
The Communist government that ruled East Germany converted the Zwickau factory to produce no-frills Trabant vehicles. The cars spewed blue exhaust and had a body made of plastic because of steel shortages. They could not compete with Western cars after the reunification of Germany in 1991. Thousands of Trabant workers lost their jobs. By the end of the 1990s, unemployment in the region exceeded 20 percent.
Volkswagen acquired the Zwickau factory after reunification and gradually expanded it into one of the company's biggest production sites. The conversion to electric cars was momentous enough that Angela Merkel, the German chancellor at the time, attended a dedication ceremony in 2019, when the first battery-powered model rolled off the assembly line.
Not everyone in Zwickau is a fan of electric cars. The far-right Alternative for Deutschland party, which has 11 of 48 seats in the Zwickau City Council, has complained that Germans are being forced to buy electric vehicles, echoing comments from former President Donald J. Trump and other Republicans.
The national government, led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, angered many in Zwickau when it abruptly slashed subsidies for electric vehicles last year to deal with a budget crisis. Sales of electric vehicles in Germany slumped 14 percent during the first three months of the year, though they still accounted for 12 percent of new cars.
Still, few people in Zwickau are pushing for Volkswagen to go back to building gasoline cars.
"With a transition to a new technology, the question is always: Are you the first or the last?" said Constance Arndt, the lord mayor of Zwickau. "I think it's always better to be first."

Full text: She wrote about politics and the patriarchy as a left-wing writer, then alienated her compatriots with exposés critical of the Black Panthers and the environmental movement.
Kate Coleman, an iconoclastic Bay Area journalist who began her career as a left-wing radical, writing about the patriarchy, politics and polyamory, then made enemies among her erstwhile comrades when her reporting cast a harsh light on the Black Panthers and the environmental movement, died on Tuesday in Oakland, Calif. She was 81.
Carol Pogash, a close friend, said her death, in a memory-care facility, was caused by complications of dementia.
For decades Ms. Coleman operated at the center of a fervid community of journalists and activists in and around Berkeley. Like her, most of them had attended the University of California in the 1960s, helping to define the campus as a hotbed of political and social activism.
Her subsequent writing career, most of it as a freelancer for anti-establishment publications like Ramparts and The Berkeley Barb as well as national outlets like Newsweek and The Los Angeles Times, tracked the transit of the American left through its many phases, from early idealism through violent extremism to late-stage disenchantment.
Like Eve Babitz and Joan Didion, she positioned herself as a young female writer who was both immersed in the moment and able to stand outside it, casting a gimlet eye on the ironies and excesses of America's "left coast."
As an undergraduate at Berkeley, Ms. Coleman was an early participant in the university's Free Speech Movement and was among the hundreds of students arrested in December 1964 for occupying Sproul Hall, a campus administration building.
After graduating in 1965, she spent three years at Newsweek, in its New York headquarters, where she was among the few young women allowed to write occasionally for the magazine. (A few years after she left, in 1968, a group of female employees successfully challenged Newsweek's discriminatory policies.)
Ms. Coleman succeeded at Newsweek by offering something different: Where most of the staff came from buttoned-up East Coast colleges, she arrived bearing news from the free-spirited West.
"She was the resident hippie, the resident Berkeley radical, and she was proud of it," Harriet Huber, who worked with Ms. Coleman at Newsweek, said in a phone interview.
Returning to the Bay Area, Ms. Coleman established herself as a freelance writer and radio producer. Among other gigs, she wrote a column for The Berkeley Barb, a scrappy magazine that was required reading among the region's counterculture.
She used the column to cover a gamut of topics that occupied the minds of the young and hip in the late 1960s and early '70s: Watergate, second-wave feminism, free love, radical politics, venereal disease.
She wrote in a casual tone, tinged with but not drenched in the hippie vernacular of the time -- profanity, but not too much; a single "ain't" in a column of otherwise Strunkian grammatical precision.
She was also willing to go further than most reporters. In 1969, Ms. Coleman was at a racetrack east of San Francisco covering the Altamont Speedway Free Festival, where members of the Hells Angels biker gang were hired as security (and where one of the bikers stabbed a man to death). While backstage waiting for the Rolling Stones to come on, she saw a biker beating a concertgoer. When she intervened, he grabbed her and slammed her repeatedly into a Volkswagen van.
For a 1971 article on prostitution for Ramparts, she not only embedded herself in a brothel on Manhattan's Upper East Side but also turned a trick herself.
"You couldn't be in Kate's presence without being impressed by her brashness," Steve Wasserman, the publisher of Heyday Books in Berkeley, said by phone. "But it would also get her in trouble with her dogmatic comrades."
In 1977, the Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit newsroom, commissioned Ms. Coleman and another reporter, Paul Avery, to examine the unsolved murder of Betty Van Patter, a former bookkeeper for the Black Panthers.
After nine months of reporting, their 1978 article, "The Party's Over," published in New Times magazine, concluded that the Panther leadership, in particular Huey P. Newton, one of the party's founders, had most likely ordered Ms. Van Patter's killing because she was about to reveal corruption within the organization.
Ms. Coleman received death threats and went into hiding for several months. She bought a handgun and bars for her windows -- then submitted them as expenses.
She made a new set of antagonists in 2005 with her book "The Secret Wars of Judi Bari: A Car Bomb, the Fight for the Redwoods, and the End of Earth First!"
Judi Bari, until her death from cancer in 1997, had been one of the most revered figures in the radical wing of the environmental movement. But in Ms. Coleman's telling, she was a "tyrannical diva," paranoid and obsessed with her own martyrdom.
The book drew protests from Ms. Bari's defenders, some of whom would interrupt Ms. Coleman during stops on her book tour. At least one store canceled her appearance. "Is the Biographer of Activist Judi Bari a Tool of the Right -- or Just a Skeptical Liberal?" asked a headline in The San Francisco Chronicle.
"Why not focus her energies on problems of the right?" the author of the article, Edward Guthmann, wrote.
Ms. Coleman responded: "The right has too many problems for me to even begin to start covering. I don't want to research that. It's not what I knew intimately. It's what I know from afar."
Kate Ann Coleman was born on Dec. 7, 1942, in Rutherford, N.J. Her father, Robert, was an engineer for a machine-tools company. Her mother, Lilian (Anson) Coleman, went blind after surgery when Kate was 3 and was largely confined to their home.
Ms. Coleman leaves no immediate survivors.
Kate's parents divorced when she was 10. Soon after, she moved with her mother and her older sister, Susan, to Encino, Calif., to be near her mother's wealthy brother.
Her political awakening came in early 1960, soon after she arrived at Berkeley. The House Committee on Un-American Activities had come to San Francisco for a field hearing into allegations of Communist subversion in the Bay Area. Hundreds showed up in protest, which ended with the police turning fire hoses on the crowd without warning.
Ms. Coleman joined Slate, a progressive campus political party, and eventually the Free Speech Movement, which was led in part by Mario Savio. She graduated in 1965 with a degree in English literature.
Her writing was not entirely political. Like most freelance journalists, she wrote whatever came her way: celebrity profiles, personal essays, restaurant reviews, even accounts of her rather active sex life, which she discussed in terms too explicit for a family newspaper.
For a time she also worked once a week as a host at Chez Panisse, the famed Berkeley restaurant founded by Alice Waters.
And she was a later-life convert to open-water swimming, mostly in the San Francisco Bay. She routinely won races in her age group, and once a year she swam from Alcatraz, in the middle of the bay, to San Francisco.
She would dive in wearing just a swimsuit. Wet suits, she said, were for wimps.

Rwanda's Twin 30th Anniversaries Tell Tale of Progress and Repression: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Blood coursed through the streets of Rwanda's capital, Kigali, in April 1994 as machete-wielding militiamen began a campaign of genocide that killed as many as 800,000 people, one of the great horrors of the late 20th century.
Thirty years later, Kigali is the envy of Africa. Smooth streets curl past gleaming towers that hold banks, luxury hotels and tech startups. There is a Volkswagen car plant and an mRNA vaccine facility. A 10,000-seat arena hosts Africa's biggest basketball league and concerts by stars like Kendrick Lamar, the American rapper, who performed there in December.
Tourists fly in to visit Rwanda's famed gorillas. Government officials from other African countries arrive for lessons in good governance. The electricity is reliable. Traffic cops do not solicit bribes. Violence is rare.
The architect of this stunning transformation, President Paul Kagame, achieved it with harsh methods that would normally attract international condemnation. Opponents are jailed, free speech is curtailed and critics often die in murky circumstances, even those living in the West. Mr. Kagame's soldiers have been accused of massacre and plunder in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo.
For decades, Western leaders have looked past Mr. Kagame's abuses. Some have expressed guilt for their failure to halt the genocide, when Hutu extremists massacred people mostly from Mr. Kagame's Tutsi ethnic group. Rwanda's tragic history makes it an "immensely special case," Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, once said.
Mr. Kagame will commemorate the 30th anniversary of the genocide on Sunday, when he is expected to lay wreaths at mass graves, light a flame of remembrance and deliver a solemn speech that may well reinforce his message of exceptionalism. "Never again," he often says.
But the anniversary is also a sharp reminder that Mr. Kagame, 66, has been in power for just as long. He won the last presidential election with 99 percent of votes. The outcome of the next one, scheduled for July, is in little doubt. Under Rwanda's Constitution, he could rule for another decade.
The milepost has given new ammunition to critics who say that Mr. Kagame's repressive tactics, previously seen as necessary -- even by critics -- to stabilize Rwanda after the genocide, increasingly appear to be a way for him to entrench his iron rule.
Questions are also growing about where he is leading his country. Although he claims to have effectively banished ethnicity from Rwanda, critics -- including diplomats, former government officials and many other Rwandans -- say he presides over a system that is shaped by unspoken ethnic cleavages that make the prospect of genuine reconciliation seem as distant as ever.
A spokeswoman for Rwanda's government did not respond to questions for this article. The authorities declined accreditation to me to enter the country. A second Times reporter has been allowed in.
Ethnic Tutsis dominate the top echelons of Mr. Kagame's government, while the Hutus who make up 85 percent of the population remain excluded from true power, critics say. It is a sign that ethnic division, despite surface appearances, is still very much a factor in the way Rwanda is ruled.
"The Kagame regime is creating the very conditions that cause political violence in our country," Victoire Ingabire Umuhoza, his most prominent political opponent, said by phone from Kigali. "Lack of democracy, absence of rule of law, social and political exclusion -- it's the same problems we had before."
Ms. Ingabire, a Hutu, returned to Rwanda from exile in 2010 to run against Mr. Kagame for president. She was arrested, barred from taking part in the election and later imprisoned on charges of conspiracy and terrorism. Released in 2018, when Mr. Kagame pardoned her, Ms. Ingabire cannot travel abroad and is barred from standing in the election in July.
"I agree with those who say Rwanda needed a strongman ruler after the genocide, to bring order in our country, " she said. "But today, after 30 years, we need strong institutions more than we need strong men."
Mr. Kagame burst into power in July 1994, sweeping into Kigali at the head of a Tutsi-dominated rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, which ousted the Hutu extremists who orchestrated the genocide. Randy Strash, a worker with the aid agency World Vision, arrived a few weeks later to find a "ghost town."
"No gas stations, no stores, no communications," he recalled. "Abandoned vehicles by the side of the road, riddled with bullets. At night, the sound of gunshots and hand grenades. It was something else."
Mr. Strash set up his tent across the street from a camp where Mr. Kagame was quartered. Hutu fighters attacked the camp several times, trying to kill Mr. Kagame, Mr. Strash said. But it was not until a decade later, at an event at the University of Washington, that he met the Rwandan leader in person.
"Very polite and reasonable in his responses," Mr. Strash recalled. "Clear, thoughtful and thought-provoking."
Historical documents released by Human Rights Watch this week show how much U.S. leaders knew about the slaughter as it unfolded. Writing to President Bill Clinton on May 16, 1994, the researcher Alison Des Forges urged him "to protect these defenseless civilians from murderous militia."
Since coming to power, Mr. Kagame has had a reputation for spending aid wisely and promoting forward-looking economic policies. Although former aides have accused him of manipulating official statistics to exaggerate progress, Rwanda's trajectory is impressive: Average life expectancy rose to 66 years from 40 years between 1994 and 2021, the United Nations says.
One of Mr. Kagame's first acts was to publicly erase the dangerous divisions that had fueled the genocide. He banned the terms Hutu and Tutsi from identity cards and effectively criminalized public discussion of ethnicity. "We are all Rwandan" became the national motto.
But in reality, ethnicity continued to suffuse nearly every aspect of life, reinforced by Mr. Kagame's policies. "Everyone knows who is who," said Joseph Sebarenzi, a Tutsi who served as the president of Rwanda's Parliament until 2000, when he fled into exile.
A survey published last year by Filip Reyntjens, a Belgian professor and outspoken Kagame critic, found that 82 percent of 199 top government positions were held by ethnic Tutsi -- and nearly 100 percent in Mr. Kagame's office. American diplomats reached a similar conclusion in 2008, after conducting their own survey of Rwanda's power structure.
Mr. Kagame "must begin to share authority with Hutus to a much greater degree" if his country were to surmount the divides of the genocide, the U.S. Embassy wrote in a cable that was later published by WikiLeaks.
Critics accuse Mr. Kagame of using the memory of the events of 1994 to suppress the Hutu majority.
Official commemorations mention "the genocide of the Tutsi" but play down or ignore the tens of thousands of moderate Hutus who were also killed, often trying to save their Tutsi neighbors.
A perception of selective justice rubs salt into those wounds. Mr. Kagame's troops killed 25,000 to 45,000 people, mostly Hutu civilians, from April to August 1994, according to disputed U.N. findings. Yet fewer than 40 of his officers have been tried for those crimes, according to Human Rights Watch.
The Hutu killings are incomparable in scale or nature to the genocide. But Mr. Kagame's lopsided approach to dealing with those events is hampering Rwandans' ability to reconcile and move on, critics say.
"Anyone not familiar with Rwanda might think that everything is fine," Mr. Sebarenzi said. "People work together, they go to church together, they do business together. That is good. But under the carpet, those ethnic divisions are still there."
Although Mr. Kagame has appointed Hutus to senior positions in government since 1994, including prime minister and defense minister, those appointees have little real power, said Omar Khalfan, a former official with Rwanda's national intelligence service who fled into exile in the United States in 2015.
Tutsi loyalists are planted in the offices of senior Hutus to keep an eye on them, said Mr. Khalfan, a Tutsi. "The regime doesn't want to speak about ethnicity because it raises the issue of power-sharing," he said. "And they don't want that."
In the West, Mr. Kagame is a firm favorite at gatherings of the global elite such as the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he met with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in January. But at home, those who publicly challenge him risk arrest, torture or death.
A decade ago, Kizito Mihigo, a charismatic gospel singer, was among Rwanda's most popular artists. A Tutsi who lost his parents in the genocide, Mr. Mihigo often sang at genocide commemorations and was said to be close to Mr. Kagame's wife, Jeannette.
But on the 20th anniversary, Mr. Mihigo released a song that in coded lyrics called on Rwandans to show empathy for both Tutsi and Hutu victims -- effectively, a call for greater reconciliation.
Mr. Kagame was furious. A presidential aide said he "didn't like my song, and that I should ask him for forgiveness," Mr. Mihigo recalled in 2016. If the singer refused to comply, he added, "they said I'd be dead."
Mr. Mihigo apologized but was convicted on treason charges and imprisoned. Released four years later, he found he was blacklisted as a singer. In 2020, he was arrested again as he tried to slip across the border to Burundi and, four days later, found dead in a police station.
The government said Mr. Mihigo had taken his life, but few believed it. "He was a very strong Christian who believed in God," said Ms. Ingabire, the opposition politician, who came to know Mr. Mihigo in prison. "I can't believe this is true."
Mr. Kagame's reach extends across the globe. Rights groups have documented dozens of cases of Rwandan exiles being intimidated, attacked or assassinated by presumed agents of the state in at least a dozen countries, including Canada, Australia and South Africa.
Mr. Khalfan, the former intelligence officer, said he was approached at home in Ohio in 2019 by a man he identified as an undercover Rwandan agent. The man tried to lure him to Dubai -- a similar ruse to the one that caused Paul Rusesabagina, a Hutu hotelier whose story featured in the movie "Hotel Rwanda," to be tricked into returning to the country in 2020.
Mr. Rusesabagina was released from prison last year, after years of U.S. pressure. The episode only underscored how little real resistance Mr. Kagame faces at home. But a more immediate worry lies across the border, in eastern Congo.
There, the United States and the United Nations have publicly accused Rwanda of sending troops and missiles in support of M23, a notorious rebel group that swept across the territory in recent months, causing widespread displacement and suffering. The M23 has long been seen as a Rwandan proxy force in Congo, where Mr. Kagame's troops have been accused of plundering rare minerals and massacring civilians. Rwanda denies the charges.
The crisis has cooled Mr. Kagame's relations with the United States, his largest foreign donor, American officials say. Senior Biden administration officials traveled to Rwanda, Congo and, more discreetly, Tanzania in recent months in an effort to prevent the crisis from spiraling into a regional war. In August, the United States imposed sanctions on a senior Rwandan military commander for his role in backing the M23.
U.S. officials described tense, sometimes confrontational meetings between Mr. Kagame and senior American officials, including the U.S.A.I.D. administrator, Samantha Power, over Rwanda's role in eastern Congo.
Mr. Kagame has often denied that Rwandan troops are in Congo, but he appeared to tacitly admit the opposite in a recent interview with Jeune Afrique magazine.
In justifying their presence, he fell back on familiar logic: that he was acting to prevent a second genocide, this time against the ethnic Tutsi population in eastern Congo.

Mercedes Plant Is Calling For Vote to Join U.A.W.
A majority of workers at a Mercedes-Benz plant located near Tuscaloosa, Ala., are calling for a vote to join the United Auto Workers union, which is on a push to sign up nonunion plants across the country.
According to a Friday announcement from the U.A.W., the workers have filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board for the vote.
Their call for a union election arrives just weeks after workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., set a date to vote for U.A.W. representation.
The Mercedes plant in Vance, Ala., had a total of about 6,100 employees as of the end of 2023. More than 5,000 are calling for the union vote, U.A.W. said Friday.
"We are voting for safer jobs at Mercedes," Moesha Chandler, an assembly team member at Mercedes, said in a statement shared in union's announcement. "When you're still in your 20s and your body is breaking down, that's not right. By winning our union, we'll have the power to make the work safer and more sustainable."
No date for the plant's union vote has been set yet, but the U.A.W. said that the Mercedes workers hope to vote by early May.
In response to the petition, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International said it "fully respects our Team Members' choice," on whether to unionize. ASSOCIATED PRESS

J.&J., in $ 13 Billion Deal, Adds to MedTech Business
Johnson & Johnson is pumping more money into heart care with a roughly $ 13 billion deal for Shockwave Medical, which specializes in technology that helps open clogged arteries.
J.&J., a health care giant, said on Friday that it would spend $ 335 in cash for each share of Shockwave. The total deal value includes cash acquired. The deal has already been approved by the boards of directors from both companies.
Founded in 2009, Shockwave focuses on intravascular lithotripsy technology that uses sonic pressure waves to crack calcium lesions in arteries and restore blood flow. It's similar to a technique used to break up kidney stones. The sound wave emitters are placed inside angioplasty catheters to reach the calcified areas of the artery.
Shockwave's technology is used to treat coronary artery and peripheral artery disease. The company's revenue jumped 49 percent last year to $ 730 million.
J.&J. Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk told analysts on Friday that the market for this technology was still "in the early days of scaling up." He has said that he sees room for more growth both in and outside the United States, and the company expects annual sales to reach at least $ 1 billion.
J.&J. will use cash on hand and debt to pay for the deal. Financing costs will dilute the company's adjusted earnings by 10 cents per share this year and 17 cents in 2025, Mr. Wolk said.
The deal comes more than a year after J.&.J. said that it would spend $ 16 billion to buy another cardiovascular technology company, Abiomed. Both acquisitions are expected to bolster J.&.J.'s MedTech or medical device division. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Ford Throttles Back on Electric Vehicles: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The automaker said it would delay new battery-powered models and shift its focus to hybrid cars, sales of which are rising fast.
Ford Motor on Thursday delayed the production of at least two new electric cars and said it would pivot to making more hybrids. Its decision was the latest sign that large automakers have been forced to rethink their strategy for electric vehicles because sales for those models are slowing.
The shift by Ford and automakers like General Motors and Mercedes-Benz, which have also pushed back their electric car plans, has been prompted largely by the companies' difficulties in making and selling enough electric cars and doing so profitably.
Sales of such vehicles are still growing, but the pace has slowed sharply in recent months as automakers have tapped out many of the early adopters who were willing to spend more than $ 50,000 on a new battery-powered car. Because they are still learning how to make the cars and their batteries at lower cost, the companies have not been able to bring out more affordable models.
"Many companies rushed in too fast with E.V.s that were too expensive and there was not as much of a market for them as they thought," Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for transportation and mobility at the research firm Guidehouse Insights, said. "That's made it a lot tougher to sell those vehicles."
Some consumers are also reluctant to buy electric models because they can't charge the vehicles at home or are worried that there won't be enough public chargers available when they want to travel more than a couple of hundred miles.
Many car buyers interested in electric vehicles appear to be choosing hybrid cars, which can cost just a few hundred dollars more than comparable gasoline-only models and in some cases offer much better fuel economy. Those cars are also easier for consumers to get used to because they don't have to be plugged in and are fueled like conventional models.
Andy Goodrich, a retired software engineer in Ann Arbor, Mich., was considering buying a Tesla Model 3 or a Rivian sport-utility vehicle, but had concerns about finding charging stations. Ultimately, he chose a Toyota RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid, which can go about 40 miles on electric power alone before switching to a gasoline engine.
"I do most of my driving locally, so I can go a week or more without using any gas," Mr. Goodrich, 72, said. "I charge in my garage overnight and I'm all set for the day. If I have to go to Grand Rapids or something, then the gas engine gets me there."
Ford said on Thursday that it hoped to offer a hybrid version of every model it sold by the end of the decade. It already makes hybrid versions of two pickups -- the Maverick and the F-150 -- and its Escape crossover.
The company said it was now planning to start making a large electric S.U.V. at its plant in Oakville, Ontario, in 2027, two years later than it had planned. A plant that Ford is building in Tennessee will start making an electric pickup truck in 2026, a year later than originally scheduled.
"We are committed to scaling a profitable E.V. business, using capital wisely and bringing to market the right gas, hybrid and fully electric vehicles at the right time," Ford's chief executive, Jim Farley, said in a statement.
Ford has set up a small team in Irvine, Calif. -- far from the company's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. -- to develop components that can be used to produce lower-cost electric vehicles. That group is led by a former Tesla executive, Alan Clarke.
"We're also adjusting our capital, switching more focus onto smaller E.V. products," Mr. Farley said in a conference call in February. Ford's electric vehicle business lost $ 4.7 billion before interest and taxes in 2023. By contrast, the division that makes gasoline and hybrid vehicles for consumers made a $ 7.5 billion profit.
The slowdown in sales is also hurting the leading maker of electric models in the United States, Tesla. This week it reported an unexpected 8.5 percent decrease in sales of its electric cars in the first three months of the year.
On Wednesday, Ford said its sales of electric vehicles had grown 86 percent in the quarter, to 20,223 vehicles, but the total was well below the level the company once hoped to reach and came after it cut some prices.
The company sold more than 7,700 F-150 Lightning pickups, its flagship electric model, in the three months. As recently as last summer, Ford hoped to be able to produce some 150,000 Lightnings trucks a year. The company recently reduced Lightning production to one shift per day from two.
Two years ago, Ford, G.M., Volkswagen and other automakers were planning to introduce dozens of new electric cars and trucks, expecting consumers to make a rapid transition to electric vehicles from gasoline-powered vehicles.
But starting in the second half of 2023, the growth in electric sales decreased significantly, forcing manufacturers to scale back their ambitions. Ford and G.M. have also slowed work on factories that are supposed to supply battery packs for their new electric models.

Ford Motor Co. on Thursday delayed the production of at least two new electric cars and said it would pivot to making more hybrids. Its decision was the latest sign that large automakers have been forced to rethink their strategy for electric vehicles because sales for those models are slowing.
The shift by Ford and automakers such as General Motors and Mercedes-Benz, which have also pushed back their electric car plans, has been prompted largely by the companies’ difficulties in making and selling enough electric cars and doing so profitably.
Sales of such vehicles are still growing but the pace has slowed sharply in recent months as automakers have tapped out many of the early adopters who were willing to spend more than $50,000 on a new battery-powered car. Because they are still learning how to make the cars and their batteries at lower cost, the companies have not been able to bring out more affordable models.
“Many companies rushed in too fast with EVs that were too expensive and there was not as much of a market for them as they thought,” said Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for transportation and mobility at the research firm Guidehouse Insights. “That’s made it a lot tougher to sell those vehicles.”
Some consumers are also reluctant to buy electric models because they can’t charge the vehicles at home or are worried that there won’t be enough public chargers available when they want to travel more than a couple hundred miles.
Many car buyers interested in electric vehicles appear to be choosing hybrid cars, which can cost just a few hundred dollars more than comparable gasoline-only models and in some cases offer much better fuel economy. Those cars are also easier for consumers to get used to because they don’t have to be plugged in and are fueled like conventional models.
Andy Goodrich, a retired software engineer in Ann Arbor, Michigan, was considering buying a Tesla Model 3 or a Rivian sport utility vehicle, but he had concerns about finding charging stations. Ultimately, he chose a Toyota RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid, which can go about 40 miles on electric power alone before switching to a gasoline engine.
“I do most of my driving locally, so I can go a week or more without using any gas,” Goodrich, 72, said. “I charge in my garage overnight and I’m all set for the day. If I have to go to Grand Rapids or something, then the gas engine gets me there.”
Ford said Thursday that it hoped to offer a hybrid version of every model it sold by the end of the decade. It already makes hybrid versions of two pickups — the Maverick and the F-150 — and its Escape crossover.
The company said it was now planning to start making a large electric SUV at its plant in Oakville, Ontario, in 2027, two years later than it had planned. A plant that Ford is building in Tennessee will start making an electric pickup truck in 2026, a year later than originally scheduled.
“We are committed to scaling a profitable EV business, using capital wisely and bringing to market the right gas, hybrid and fully electric vehicles at the right time,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a statement.
Ford has set up a small team in Irvine, California — far from the company’s headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan — to develop components that can be used to produce lower-cost electric vehicles. That group is led by a former Tesla executive, Alan Clarke.
“We’re also adjusting our capital, switching more focus onto smaller EV products,” Farley said in a conference call in February. Ford’s electric vehicle business lost $4.7 billion before interest and taxes in 2023. By contrast, the division that makes gasoline and hybrid vehicles for consumers made a $7.5 billion profit.
The slowdown in sales is also hurting the leading maker of electric models in the United States, Tesla. This week it reported an unexpected 8.5% decrease in sales of its electric cars in the first three months of the year.

Tesla's Grip On Market Is in Doubt As Sales Slip: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales of the company's electric cars dropped in the first three months of the year, even as other automakers sold more battery-powered vehicles.
Tesla appeared to be losing command of the market it effectively created after it reported a stunning drop in quarterly sales on Tuesday, raising fresh questions about Elon Musk's leadership of the company.
The sales decline caught investors off guard as rivals like BYD of China and Kia and Hyundai of South Korea reported increases in electric vehicle sales, suggesting that slower overall demand for battery-powered models was not the only explanation for Tesla's problems.
Tesla pioneered the market for electric vehicles with its Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle, which proved that battery-powered cars could be appealing, practical and profitable. The cars revolutionized the auto industry and forced established carmakers to develop their own electric models.
But the market is evolving in ways that may not favor Tesla. In contrast to the early adopters who fueled Tesla's rise, mainstream buyers may be put off by the vehicles' unconventional design, including minimalist interiors and lack of buttons and switches. Almost all functions in Tesla vehicles are controlled from a large screen on the dashboard.
The system "makes it thoroughly distracting to adjust almost anything within the vehicle while motoring down the road," Consumer Reports wrote in a review on Tuesday of a new version of the Model 3.
Tesla, which sells cars online and does not have many showrooms, is often the target of complaints about poor service. That may provide an advantage to established carmakers, like Ford Motor and General Motors, that have extensive dealer networks and are ramping up production of electric vehicles.
Tesla seems at a loss to respond to those challenges. It has been slow to follow up its initial success with new models, and Mr. Musk appears disengaged. He did not react Tuesday to the sales figures on X, the social media platform that he owns and posts on prolifically. Instead, he threw barbs at Walt Disney Company executives whom he accuses of being "woke." Such remarks have made him a hero to conservatives but may be pushing liberals, who are more likely to buy electric cars, away from Tesla.
Tesla said it delivered 387,000 cars worldwide in the first quarter, down 8.5 percent from 423,000 in the same period last year. This was the first time Tesla's quarterly sales have fallen on a year over year basis since a modest drop at the start of the pandemic in 2020. The sales figures were also significantly lower than the estimates of Wall Street analysts who had expected a modest increase.
"Tesla can't stand still," Ben Rose, president of Battle Road Research, said in an email. "Chinese E.V.s are already gaining a foothold in Europe, and it is unclear how long they will be forbidden from entering the U.S."
More affordable cars would help Tesla appeal to a broader spectrum of buyers, Mr. Rose said.
To be sure, some of the sales decline may have reflected production problems beyond the company's control, including a fire at a Tesla factory near Berlin that was the result of an arson attack.
And the company's cars still have many fans. While panning the Model 3's controls, Consumer Reports said the latest version provided a better ride than its predecessor and had improved handling.
But investors are clearly alarmed. Tesla's shares have fallen more than 30 percent this year -- including a 5 percent drop on Tuesday -- because of concern that the company has lost momentum.
In China, Tesla faces BYD and dozens of other rivals with ambitions to expand worldwide. In Europe, established carmakers like Volkswagen and BMW have introduced more compelling battery-powered models. And in the United States, sales of electric cars are not growing as fast as they were a year ago, and many buyers are opting instead for hybrid models that pair a gasoline engine with batteries and electric motors.
Tesla rivals have continued to report sales increases. BYD said on Tuesday that it sold about 300,000 electric vehicles, up 13 percent from a year earlier. The company also sold 324,000 plug-in hybrid vehicles in the first quarter, up 15 percent.
BYD and other Chinese automakers have introduced new models rapidly, often undercutting Tesla on price. Those companies are also increasingly exporting cars to Europe, Southeast Asia and Latin America.
Kia, based in South Korea, said Tuesday that its sales of electric vehicles in the United States more than doubled in the first three months of the year compared with a year earlier after it introduced a new large sport utility vehicle, the EV9. Kia's sister company, Hyundai, said it sold more than 10,000 electric vehicles in the first quarter in the United States, up 75 percent.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker, doesn't sell many fully electric vehicles. But the company said U.S. sales of electrified vehicles, a category largely made up of hybrids, under the Toyota and Lexus brands was up 74 percent in the first quarter.
Tesla pioneered mass-market electric cars, but its lineup is aging. The company's only new model since 2020 is the Cybertruck, a futuristic pickup that went on sale in limited numbers last year. The least expensive version that Tesla says it can deliver this year starts at around $ 80,000, which makes it unaffordable to most car buyers.
Rivian, whose R1 pickup competes with the Cybertruck, said its sales, including of the truck and its two other models, rose 70 percent in the quarter, to 13,600 vehicles.
Tesla is working on an electric car that would cost around $ 25,000, but the model is not expected to go on sale in large numbers until 2026. In the meantime, Tesla remains dependent on the Model Y and the Model 3 for most of its sales.
The company has repeatedly cut prices, but analysts say the strategy has lowered its profits without doing enough to stimulate sales. The company has recently modestly raised the prices of some cars in the United States and China. The Model Y starts at nearly $ 45,000 before federal and state tax breaks, after an increase of $ 1,000 announced this week.
The quarterly sales figure shows Tesla managers "they need a real sales strategy and can't rely on cutting price alone," Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, an investment firm, posted on X.
Mr. Musk, Tesla's chief executive, has not given a clear indication of how the company plans to regain momentum. At the same time, his polarizing statements and endorsement of right-wing conspiracy theories have alienated many of the left-leaning customers who are most likely to buy electric cars.
Raphaelle Cassens, a Los Angeles resident, gave up her leased Tesla Model Y last year and replaced it with a leased electric BMW i4. Mr. Musk was one reason she switched, she said.
"Honestly, I don't like him as an individual at all," said Ms. Cassens, who is a registered Democrat but described herself as nonpartisan. She also said she received poor service from the company. "The attitude from the company definitely reflects the owner," Ms. Cassens added.
At least one other large automaker is also struggling with electric vehicle sales. G.M. reported on Tuesday that its U.S. sales for the first quarter fell 1.5 percent, in large part because deliveries of battery-powered cars were down by about a fifth to around 16,000 vehicles.
The drop in battery-powered vehicle sales was the result of a sharp decline in sales of the Chevrolet Bolt, which G.M. stopped making at the end of 2023. Sales of other electric models that use G.M.'s newest battery technology rose but not enough to make up for the loss of the Bolt, which was one of the most affordable electric cars in the United States.

Auto Executives Call for New Measures in E.V. Wars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The latest proposal comes from Luca de Meo, the C.E.O. of Renault Group, who is pushing for an Airbus-inspired alliance that would help European automakers fend off competition from cheaper Chinese-made electric vehicles.
An auto C.E.O.'s plan to fend off China
Tesla is scheduled to announce first-quarter delivery data this week, a key update as investors grow increasingly rattled about Chinese rivals -- especially the Warren Buffett-backed BYD -- gaining ground in the electric vehicle race.
Tesla's stock is down nearly 30 percent this year, with short sellers circling.
Politicians and auto executives on both sides of the Atlantic are calling for more protectionist measures. After Tesla lost its crown to BYD as the world's biggest E.V. maker, Elon Musk signaled that trade barriers may be needed. Otherwise, the Tesla C.E.O. said, Chinese E.V. makers "will pretty much demolish most other companies in the world."
Luca de Meo, Renault Group's C.E.O., is pushing for a more radical approach, Vivienne Walt reports for DealBook. His answer to the China threat: an E.V. alliance modeled on Airbus, the heavily state-supported planemaker.
"The prosperity of Europe is at stake," he wrote recently in a 19-page open letter designed to get politicians' attention ahead of June's E.U. parliamentary elections. The continent's auto sector employs 13 million people and generates 8 percent of the bloc's G.D.P.
Here's what de Meo has in mind: European auto giants would join forces on battery and semiconductor production and on research and development in an effort to bring down E.V. manufacturing costs and better compete against their non-European rivals. "If they're competing as they are, they are weaker in front of China," Felipe Munoz, senior analyst for JATO Dynamics, an auto consulting firm, told DealBook. "Their E. V.s are still very expensive. They have problems with battery production."
Airbus is one of Europe's great successes, having overtaken Boeing as the world's largest commercial planemaker. (Both companies have accused the other of receiving unfair competitive advantages, culminating in a W.T.O. ruling that each of them had received preferential subsidies.)
Chinese companies have an operating edge. Labor is cheaper in Shenzhen than in Detroit or Berlin. They have built operational efficiencies and get hefty government support. And China controls the bulk of global raw materials for E.V. batteries, like lithium, which the West is frantically scrambling to source. "Chinese E.V. makers have a structural cost advantage of 25 percent," Patrick Hummel, a UBS auto analyst, told DealBook.
Trade barriers are unlikely to slow China's growth. "Any tariff increase will have an impact, but it won't deter them from arriving," Munoz said. "This will be a war between tariffs on one side, and subsidies on the other."
An Airbus-type venture may face headwinds. Executives at Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz last month said they didn't want to see an auto trade war. Both companies have strong businesses in China, and have tried to distance themselves from a European Commission investigation into whether China is giving its domestic carmakers market-distorting subsidies. "We stand for free trade," said Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen's C.F.O.
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
A $ 20-per-hour minimum wage for fast-food workers begins today in California. The law, which has been vigorously opposed by the industry, applies to most of the sector's workers in the state, and requires that employers also offer paid overtime and family leave. Under Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, California has championed some of the nation's most generous workers' rights provisions, with all health care employees set to receive a $ 25 minimum wage by 2028.
The Senate reportedly plans to amend the House's TikTok bill. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington, the Democratic chair of the Commerce Committee, is expected to push for changes to a proposal that could ban the app in the U.S., The Wall Street Journal reports. This could include giving ByteDance more time to divest TikTok, or broadening the bill to address other social media platforms. Meanwhile, the former Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin's bid to buy TikTok is meeting increased skepticism.
Nippon Steel vows to press ahead with a $ 14 billion deal to buy U.S. Steel. Tadashi Imai, Nippon's new president, said the Japanese company would negotiate with U.S. Steel's union workers to win their support. The acquisition has become a hot election issue, with President Biden signaling that U.S. Steel should be domestically owned ahead of a summit with the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, on April 10.
Debate grows over rebuilding the Baltimore bridge
Workers have removed the first section of the mangled Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, a step toward reopening the shipping channel. The question now turns to who should pay to rebuild the vital transport span with President Biden set to visit the city this week.
Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, yesterday urged Congress to authorize the needed money, emphasizing that the bridge collapse could have an impact on the wider economy. With cost estimates of at least $ 2 billion, not everyone in Washington is on board, however.
"Your district could be next, and this has historically been bipartisan," Buttigieg told CBS News's "Face the Nation." Biden said last week that the federal government would pay "the entire cost" of rebuilding -- the Transportation Department has secured a $ 60 million "down payment," but that's not enough to complete the work.
But there's bipartisan hesitation. Representative Dan Meuser, a Pennsylvania Republican, called Biden's funding pledge "outrageous" and "a knee-jerk spend reaction."
Other lawmakers want to see the companies involved in the crash (and their insurers) pay at least part of the cost. "I don't think it has to be federal taxpayer money," John Garamendi, a Democrat from California and a senior member of the House Transportation Committee, told Bloomberg last week. "Let's first go to the insurance side of it, and then we'll see what's left over."
The industry is bracing for a hefty tab. John Neal, the C.E.O of Lloyd's of London, called the disaster "one of the biggest marine losses in history." Morningstar analysts, meanwhile, estimate that it could cost insurers as much as $ 4 billion.
The collision puts the spotlight on maritime safety and size. Larry Hogan, the former Republican governor of Maryland who is running for U.S. Senate, courted mega-ships during his term in office, from 2015 to 2023, according to Lever News. That's despite a report from Allianz, the insurer, that flagged "risk management concerns" posed by the giant vessels.
The supersized ship that crashed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge was loaded with about 4,700 40-foot shipping containers, an increasingly common sight amid a global shipping boom. In contrast, ships that sailed at the time the bridge was built in 1977 held about half that.
An A.I. warning label
A big worry about artificial intelligence involves tech companies using huge amounts of public data -- including names, phone numbers and addresses -- to train their A.I. models.
A recent Commerce Department report on improving A.I. accountability offered a suggestion on how to demystify the technology. It included an image that is familiar to most of us: a nutrition label -- but for data, not food.
The idea would be for tech companies to use the label to inform businesses and consumers about how they are using their data for A.I. Such labels could "present the most important information about a model in a relatively brief, standardized, and comparable form," the report said.
The week ahead
Jobs, inflation data, and a mega proxy fight looms. Here's what to watch for this week.
Wednesday: Eurozone Consumer Price Index data is scheduled for release. The markets are pricing in a June interest-rate cut if inflation can remain in check.
Elsewhere, Levi Strauss, whose jeans make a prominent appearance in Beyoncé's latest album, reports earnings. Disney holds its annual shareholders meeting, where its fight against the activist investor Nelson Peltz is expected to come to a head.
Thursday: Donald Trump faces a deadline in his civil fraud case: post a $ 175 million bond, or risk the New York attorney general seizing assets.
Friday: It's jobs day. Economists polled by Bloomberg have forecast that employers added at least 200,000 jobs in March. They also expect a slight slowdown in wage gains.
Market quiz, crypto edition
Bitcoin was trading around $ 69,500 this morning after a rally that saw the cryptocurrency soar 67 percent in the first quarter. Much of the surge came after the S.E.C. approved the creation of new exchange-traded funds in January, making it easier for investors to buy and sell the token.
Which of the following performed even better in the first quarter?
A) The Nasdaq Composite
B) Japan's Nikkei
C) Cocoa futures
D) Brent crude
The answer: C, cocoa futures, which have more than doubled this year following exceptionally poor cocoa bean harvests in West Africa.

Emissions Rule Targets Trucks: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The latest in a string of ambitious climate regulations aims to clean up the heaviest polluters on the road. But truckers are worried.
The Biden administration on Friday announced a regulation designed to turbocharge sales of electric or other zero-emission heavy vehicles, from school buses to cement mixers, as part of its multifront attack on global warming.
The Environmental Protection Agency projects the new rule could mean that 25 percent of new long-haul trucks, the heaviest on the road, and 40 percent of medium-size trucks, like box trucks and landscaping vehicles, could be nonpolluting by 2032. Today, fewer than 2 percent of new heavy trucks sold in the United States fit that bill.
The regulation would apply to more than 100 types of vehicles including tractor-trailers, ambulances, R.V.s, garbage trucks and moving vans.
The rule does not mandate the sales of electric trucks or any other type of zero or low-emission truck. Rather, it increasingly limits the amount of pollution allowed from trucks across a manufacturer's product line over time, starting in model year 2027. It would be up to the manufacturer to decide how to comply. Options could include using technologies like hybrids or hydrogen fuel cells or sharply increasing the fuel efficiency of the conventional trucks.
The truck regulation follows another rule made final last week that is designed to ensure that the majority of new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the United States are all-electric or hybrids by 2032, up from just 7.6 percent last year.
Together, the car and truck rules are intended to slash carbon dioxide pollution from transportation, the nation's largest source of the fossil fuel emissions that are driving climate change and that helped to make 2023 the hottest year in recorded history. Electric vehicles are central to President Biden's strategy to confront global warming, which calls for cutting the nation's emissions in half by the end of this decade.
"Today E.P.A. is taking another giant step forward to protect future generations from climate change," said Michael S. Regan, the administrator of the agency.
Mr. Regan noted that heavy trucks are vital to moving goods throughout the country but that the pollution they generate does not just fuel climate change, it also worsens air quality in many communities. New limits on truck tailpipe emissions, combined with other regulations, means "we're tackling both of the public health challenges head on," Mr. Regan said.
The agency said that the transition to cleaner trucks would help reduce emissions of soot and other pollutants that affect about 72 million people who live near freight truck routes in the United States. Studies have shown that those affected are disproportionately low-income and people of color.
"Exposure to traffic-related pollution is a serious health hazard to those living in communities with heavy truck traffic," Harold Wimmer, president and chief executive of the American Lung Association, said in a statement. Air pollution has been linked to a range of health effects, including poor birth outcomes and chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as premature death.
The truck tailpipe limits are expected to prevent about a billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2055, equivalent to the annual emissions from burning the gasoline carried by more than 13 million tanker trucks, according to the E.P.A. The agency estimates that by 2055, it will provide $ 13 billion in average annual net benefits to society related to public health, the climate and fuel savings for truck owners and operators.
All-electric passenger vehicles, while still just a small slice of the American automobile market, are no longer a niche product. As prices of E.V.s have dropped and made some models competitive with conventional cars, a record 1.2 million electric passenger vehicles rolled off dealers' lots last year.
The same can't be said for electric trucks, and widespread adoption seems far down the road. Today, electric trucks can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, two or three times the sticker price of a diesel truck, although prices may drop as production expands, and owners may enjoy fuel savings and lower maintenance costs. An electric truck requires a big, heavy battery that reduces the amount of cargo the vehicle can haul. Electric trucks also require extremely powerful chargers. Utilities may need to upgrade distribution lines, transformers and other equipment to deliver the energy needed to refuel several trucks simultaneously.
While there are nearly 200,000 public chargers for electric passenger vehicles, there are just 5,000 charging stations in the United States that are capable of serving heavy trucks, according to the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association, which represents companies that build and make equipment for heavy-duty trucks. Of those, there are only nine public fast charging stations that are capable of serving heavy trucks, according to the Energy Department. The rest are privately owned in warehouses and depots. The truck makers association estimates that a mix of a million public and private chargers would be needed to serve the number of electric trucks envisioned by the truck regulation.
"If the infrastructures are not there, customers simply will not be able to operate zero emission vehicles," said Jed Mandel, president of the association. His organization includes the nation's three largest truck manufacturers -- Daimler Truck, which owns Freightliner; Volvo Trucks; and Traton, a unit of Volkswagen that owns Navistar. Those companies pushed hard for the E.P.A. to relax some requirements in the final version of the regulation.
The agency did make some concessions. It relaxed the pace at which truck manufacturers must comply with the rule in its early years, ramping it up sharply only after 2030.
On Wednesday, the manufacturers offered a muted response to the rule. John Mies, a spokesman for Volvo Group North America, said in a statement that his company was "completely aligned with E.P.A.'s objective of speeding the transition to zero-emission vehicles." He said the final regulation was "more realistic than what was originally proposed."
But customers won't buy the vehicles unless they are confident they can be easily charged, something that the Biden administration cannot guarantee, Mr. Mies said.
"This is an ambitious goal, and there will be challenges across our industry to reach it," said Jon Mills, a spokesman for Cummins, an Indiana-based company that makes conventional truck engines and has started manufacturing electric versions. He said that Cummins was "uniquely positioned" to develop and make a broad range of technologies.
But truckers are fearful. "This administration seems dead set on regulating every local mom-and-pop business out of existence with its flurry of unworkable environmental mandates," said Todd Spencer, president of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers' Association, which represents truck drivers.
Mike Nichols, a trucker based in Chippewa Falls, Wis., who owns an eighteen-wheeler in which he hauls rice, sugar and grain, said he would never buy an all-electric truck, even with the help of generous government subsidies. "They can't haul as heavily," he said. "They can't do as much work."
Mr. Nichols is skeptical that enough charging stations will be built to support long haul truckers. And he said that while he spends about $ 50,000 a year on diesel fuel, he imagines that the cost of electricity needed to charge a heavy-duty electric vehicle battery could in some cases equal or even surpass that.
"Their ambitions may be laudable, but they haven't thought this through," he said of the new rule.
Former President Donald J. Trump, who is running to retake the White House, has repeatedly attacked Mr. Biden's policies designed to accelerate a transition to all-electric passenger vehicles. His campaign did not respond to a request for a comment on the truck regulation.
But Republicans on Capitol Hill said they would introduce legislation to try to delete the new rule. Senators Pete Ricketts of Nebraska and Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Representatives John James of Michigan and Russ Fulcher of Idaho said in a statement: "Biden's E.V. mandates are delusional. American consumers and workers will pay the price for his administration's attempt to get rid of internal-combustion engines."
Experts say that tighter tailpipe limits for trucks are achievable. "This is going to deploy more electric trucks on the road, but it's also going to deploy more fuel-efficient conventional diesel trucks," said Ray Minjares, the director of heavy duty vehicle programs at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization which works closely with the E.P.A. on developing policy. "It's not intended to to electrify all heavy-duty trucks."
The rule is intended to force the greatest transformation of short-haul vehicles, such as school and city buses, garbage trucks and moving vans -- vehicles that travel fewer than 250 miles a day and return to the same spot each night where they could recharge, said Mr. Minjares. At least two-thirds of heavy truck journeys are less than 250 miles, well within the range of electric trucks available today, according to Calstart, a nonprofit group whose members work in industry as well as government.
"It has felt out of reach to move goods around in a way that polluted less, but now for the first time there are solutions that are within reach," said Albert Gore III, director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association and the son of Al Gore, the former vice president and Nobel-winning climate activist. "It's a highly solvable problem."
California and 10 other states have already enacted regulations that are even more ambitious than the E.P.A. rule. Those states are requiring that half of all new heavy-duty vehicles sold must be all-electric by 2035.
And companies with truck fleets are starting to invest in electric models. Frito-Lay is operating 15 all-electric 18-wheel Semi trucks, made by Tesla, from a depot in Modesto, Calif., where they make daily trips delivering Doritos, Lays and other snacks to warehouses and then return each night to charge.
4 Gen Logistics, a trucking company based in Rialto, Calif., has 70 zero-emission trucks manufactured by Volvo Trucks, Kenworth, BYD and Nikola. "Some of these trucks are driving just 50 miles a day," said David Thornburg, a contractor who helped 4 Gen set up the zero-emission fleet.
The company, which hauls containers from the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to warehouses elsewhere in Southern California, intends to phase out its 20 remaining diesel trucks next year. The electric trucks typically charge overnight at 4 Gen depots.
Mr. Thornburg noted, though, that installing chargers is expensive and time-consuming. "Some of that equipment has a one-year lead time," he said. "It's not something you can just pull off the shelf."
Companies may be eligible for federal subsidies. The 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law provides $ 7.5 billion for electric charging infrastructure, including charging stations for heavy-duty trucks, and $ 5.6 billion to help fund zero and low-emission buses. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act provides $ 1 billion for electric trucks, including tax credits of up to $ 40,000 for companies that buy them, as well as subsidies for charging infrastructure. Earlier this month, the Energy Department and the Transportation Department announced a strategy to prioritize construction of heavy-duty electric truck chargers in designated "zero-emission freight corridors."
That government help is essential, especially for smaller firms, Mr. Thornburg said. "These are $ 10 million sites," Mr. Thornburg said. "It's very difficult to put that capital down without assistance from others."
"If you're a trucking company, it's hard enough to stay afloat," he said.

Frito-Lay is operating 15 all-electric 18-wheel Semi trucks, made by Tesla, from a depot in Modesto, California, where they make daily trips delivering Doritos, Lays and other snacks to warehouses and then return each night to charge.
4 Gen Logistics, a trucking company based in Rialto, California, has 70 zero-emission trucks manufactured by Volvo Trucks, Kenworth, BYD and Nikola. “Some of these trucks are driving just 50 miles a day,” said David Thornburg, a contractor who helped 4 Gen set up the zero-emission fleet.
The company, which hauls containers from the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to warehouses elsewhere in Southern California, intends to phase out its 20 remaining diesel trucks next year. The electric trucks typically charge overnight at 4 Gen depots.
Thornburg noted, though, that installing chargers is expensive and time-consuming. “Some of that equipment has a one-year lead time,” he said. “It’s not something you can just pull off the shelf.”
Companies may be eligible for federal subsidies. The 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law provides $7.5 billion for electric charging infrastructure, including charging stations for heavy-duty trucks, and $5.6 billion to help fund zero and low-emission buses. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act provides $1 billion for electric trucks, including tax credits of up to $40,000 for companies that buy them, as well as subsidies for charging infrastructure. This month, the Energy Department and the Transportation Department announced a strategy to prioritize construction of heavy-duty electric truck chargers in designated “zero-emission freight corridors.”
That government help is essential, especially for smaller firms, Thornburg said. “These are $10 million sites,” he said. “It’s very difficult to put that capital down without assistance from others.”
“If you’re a trucking company, it’s hard enough to stay afloat,” he said.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Tesla and China built a symbiotic relationship, with credits, workers and parts that made Mr. Musk ultrarich. Now, his reliance on the country may give Beijing leverage.
When Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas in Shanghai in 2020, he went off script and started dancing. Peeling off his jacket, he flung it across the stage in a partial striptease.
Mr. Musk had reason to celebrate. A few years earlier, with Tesla on the brink of failure, he had bet on China, which offered cheap parts and capable workers -- and which needed Tesla as an anchor to jump-start its fledgling electric vehicle industry.
For Chinese leaders, the prize was a Tesla factory on domestic soil. Mr. Musk would build one in Shanghai that would become a flagship, accounting for over half of Tesla's global deliveries and the bulk of its profits.
Mr. Musk initially seemed to have the upper hand in the relationship, securing concessions from China that were rarely offered to foreign businesspeople. But in a stark shift, Tesla is now increasingly in trouble and losing its edge over Chinese competitors in the very market he helped create. Tesla's China pivot has also tethered Mr. Musk to Beijing in a way that is drawing scrutiny from U.S. policymakers.
Interviews with former Tesla employees, diplomats and policymakers reveal how Mr. Musk built an unusually symbiotic relationship with Beijing, profiting from the Chinese government's largess even as he reaped subsidies in the United States.
As Mr. Musk explored building the factory in Shanghai, Chinese leaders agreed to a crucial policy change on national emissions regulations, following lobbying by Tesla that was not previously reported. That change directly benefited Tesla, bringing in an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars in profits as China production took off, The New York Times found.
Mr. Musk also gained unusual access to senior leaders. He worked closely with a top Shanghai official who is now the premier, Li Qiang. The Shanghai factory went up at lightning speed and without a local partner, a first for a foreign auto company in China.
Mr. Musk, who has insinuated that American workers are lazy, got employees accustomed to long hours, without the strong protections that have led U.S. and European regulators to scrutinize Tesla and unions to target it for organizing. After a Tesla worker in Shanghai was crushed to death last year, a report citing safety gaps was taken offline.
And he got the emissions policy. Modeled after a California program that has been a boon for Tesla, the policy awards automakers credits for making clean cars. To lobby for the regulatory change, Tesla teamed up with California environmentalists, who were trying to clean up China's soupy skies.
China helped make Tesla the most valuable car company in the world. But Tesla's success there also forced homegrown brands to innovate. China is now churning out cheap but well-made electric cars, as the Chinese leader Xi Jinping aims to transform the country into an "automotive power." Chinese automakers like BYD and SAIC are pushing into Europe, threatening established carmakers like Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis. Detroit is also scrambling to keep pace.
"There's Before Tesla and After Tesla," said Michael Dunne, an auto consultant and a former General Motors executive in Asia, about the company's effect on Chinese industry. "Tesla was the rainmaker."
'Kind of Pro-China'
Mr. Musk is now treading a fine line. He has sounded the alarm about Chinese rivals, even as he remains reliant on the Chinese market and supply chain and repeats Beijing's geopolitical talking points.
He warned in January that unless the Chinese auto brands were blocked by trade barriers, they would "pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world." Earlier this month, Tesla's share price plunged following lagging China sales, causing him to lose the title of richest man in the world.
The company is so ensconced in China that Mr. Musk cannot easily extricate himself, should he ever want to. Teslas cost significantly less to make in Shanghai than elsewhere, a key saving when the company is in a price war with its competitors.
On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are studying his ties to China and how he balances Tesla with his other endeavors. SpaceX, another company he owns, has lucrative Pentagon contracts and boasts near total control of the world's satellite internet through its Starlink network. He also owns the social media platform X, which China has used for disinformation campaigns.
"Elon Musk has deep financial exposure to China -- including his plant in Shanghai," said Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee.
It's not clear whether Beijing has sought to exert leverage over Mr. Musk, but leaders have levers they could pull. Last year, several Chinese localities banned Teslas from sensitive areas, prompting the automaker to emphasize that all Chinese data is held locally. And in February, after the Commerce Department announced an investigation into data retention by Chinese electric vehicles, the Global Times, a Communist Party newspaper, warned that Chinese consumers could retaliate against Tesla.
Mr. Musk has taken China's side in several international disputes. He has made China's case for why it should control Taiwan, the self-governed island democracy that has resisted Beijing's claims. (Taiwan is now building an alternative to Starlink, in part because of concerns about Mr. Musk's ties.)
Mr. Musk has reportedly argued that there are two sides to repression in Xinjiang, home to the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs. In 2021, as other companies were pulling back from Xinjiang, Tesla unveiled a charging line ending there, which it called the Tesla Silk Road, after the historic route that has been revived by Mr. Xi in a campaign for global influence. The company has a similar charging line to Tibet.
Tesla, SpaceX and Mr. Musk did not reply to a detailed list of questions and findings. At The New York Times's DealBook Summit on Nov. 29, Mr. Musk said that "every car company" relies in part on the Chinese market. He also dismissed concerns surrounding SpaceX and Starlink, saying they did not operate in China and that his companies should not be conflated.
But in an online conversation with two members of Congress in July, he was more direct. He acknowledged having "some vested interests" in China, and described himself as "kind of pro-China."
Tesla's First Big Win in China
In California, Tesla has enjoyed strong regulatory support. Since 2008, when it unveiled its first car, the company has earned cash under the state's emissions mandate by selling credits to automakers that could not meet pollution targets. Those credits were worth $ 3.71 billion by late 2023, according to Gov. Gavin Newsom's office.
Mr. Musk has downplayed Tesla's reliance on government help, but Alberto Ayala, a former emissions regulator for California, said that the policy helped Tesla survive when it was struggling. "That is what kept the company afloat."
Another former state regulator, Craig Segall, said that Tesla lobbied extensively on the emissions regulations, seeking to skew them in a way that enriched Tesla.
In China, the company aimed to recreate California's lucrative policy.
As California built ties with China, several groups were championing an emissions mandate as a cure for its pollution. Among the policy's enthusiasts was then-Gov. Jerry Brown, who saw electric vehicles as a potential area of cooperation. Environmentalists were on board as well.
In 2014, as Mr. Musk talked about setting up a factory in China, Tesla joined the groups in pushing for a change.
Grace Tao, a Tesla lobbyist, met with people at the Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation, an environmental nonprofit based in Los Angeles and Beijing. The group, also known as iCET, had approached Tesla. They talked about working together on an emissions mandate in the country, according to notes taken by the nonprofit and shared with The Times.
"They needed that to be successful in China," Feng An, iCET's executive director, said about Tesla. But Chinese officials were initially skeptical, he added, because the policy would effectively require traditional automakers to subsidize E.V. companies like Tesla.
His group helped plan meetings with Ken Morgan, then a U.S.-based Tesla lobbyist, according to event materials and emails obtained by The Times. In 2015, Mr. Morgan met with officials in three Chinese cities, touting how California's emissions mandate had helped spur E.V. production. (Ms. Tao and Mr. Morgan, who recently left Tesla, did not respond to questions.)
Local officials were keen to persuade Tesla to build a factory in their cities. That interest could "potentially be leveraged" to promote a mandate, Maya Ben Dror, who worked for iCET at the time, wrote in an email to Mr. Morgan.
Dr. An said he took two groups of Chinese city officials to visit Tesla's office in California, adding that neither Tesla nor Mr. Musk gave iCET any money. He and Ms. Ben Dror saw the emissions scheme as sound environmental policy.
The priorities of the environmentalists and Chinese officials often differed. In the West, clean transportation was seen as a "tree-hugging kind of issue, while in China it was from the start seen as an industrial issue," said Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who studied the emissions policy discussions.
But as an innovative green business, Tesla checked both boxes.
In 2015, at a clean transportation conference in California, Chinese central government officials listened as a Tesla lobbyist laid out the reasons that Beijing should adopt an emissions mandate, said Yunshi Wang, an energy economist who organized the session.
"Obviously Tesla was all in," said Dr. Wang, director of the University of California-Davis's China Center for Energy and Transportation.
The emissions mandate eventually appealed to the officials, too. The existing government subsidy system was rife with fraud. The mandate was more efficient and would save the government money.
In 2017, China adopted the policy.
It was Tesla's first big win there.
Tesla's Factory Goes Up at Record Speed
Mr. Musk did not want to share ownership of Tesla's factory with a Chinese company, as was required at the time. So in 2018 officials revoked the rule for all foreign electric car companies. The change was Tesla's second big win.
Soon after, Shanghai beat out other cities competing for Tesla's factory. Mr. Li, then Shanghai's top leader, became a key ally. He had visited Tesla in California, on a trip that also included a meeting with Governor Brown, Mr. Xi and others about climate cooperation.
Mr. Musk proposed constructing the factory in two years, state media reported. Mr. Li countered that they could do it in one -- a goal that his government met.
"This was even faster than China speed," said Tu Le, who heads the consultancy Sino Auto Insights, adding that Mr. Li's help was key: "How quickly things happened points to his tacit approval of everything."
Government officials used "very creative yet cautious approaches" to bend policy to Tesla's wishes, Ms. Tao told Yicai Global, a Chinese media outlet, adding that she was "deeply impressed."
At least twice, Mr. Musk and his team were allowed to drive Teslas into Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party leadership's walled compound in Beijing.
Under Mr. Li's watch, state-run banks offered Tesla over 11 billion yuan ( $ 1.5 billion) in low-interest loans. The deal was so generous that Huang Yonghe, a senior official with a government-owned auto industry group, recalled one government minister balking at it.
"He said the Shanghai leaders were unbelievable -- giving away the entire investment without Tesla having to spend a penny," Mr. Huang said in an interview.
But Mr. Huang said the deal made sense for the banks.
He had long been impressed by Tesla, at one point importing a car and disassembling it to study how it worked. Like Mr. Li, he had visited the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif., which had struck him as chaotic but promising.
China could improve on it, he thought, yielding an efficient foreign factory that would serve as a "catfish," an aggressive creature that makes other fish swim faster.
Tesla also created a market for Chinese suppliers, saying recently that 95 percent of components used in the Shanghai factory are locally sourced.
One key supplier is a once-obscure battery company. In the United States, Tesla had a partnership with Panasonic, but in China it switched to mainly using batteries from CATL, which built a factory near Tesla's. Today, buoyed in part by Tesla's business, CATL is the world's largest battery maker.
Another supplier, LK Group, developed enormous casting machines that can make an entire section of a car with Tesla's help. The company's founder, Liu Siong Song, told The Times in 2021 that LK planned to supply the machines to six Chinese companies.
That year, he said that he hoped the technology would "help our country's automotive industry become bigger and stronger," linking it to Mr. Xi's "Chinese dream" of national resurgence.
Long Hours at Tesla's Shanghai Plant
Before the Shanghai plant opened, Fremont was Mr. Musk's principal factory. He sometimes slept on the factory floor to model the intensity he expected of his employees.
In China, workers were accustomed to long workweeks, a fact that Mr. Musk saw as an advantage.
The Shanghai plant's schedule involves an unusual weekly change in shifts. According to two former employees, workers there pull four straight twelve-hour day shifts, followed by two days of rest, before switching to four twelve-hour night shifts. (Fremont employees typically work seven twelve-hour shifts over two weeks.)
As the coronavirus pandemic spread in 2020, the Fremont factory was shuttered for nearly two months.
But the Shanghai plant closed for only about two weeks, helping Tesla turn a profit for the first time and causing Mr. Musk's wealth to surge.
China has also offered Mr. Musk an escape from California's strict labor protections.
During Shanghai's 2022 lockdown, some Tesla workers slept on the factory floor. They were paid extra to continue working, but Tesla demanded six twelve-hour shifts in a row, the two workers said. (Employees who chose not to work were also paid, but less than their normal salary.)
Chinese workers "won't even leave the factory," Mr. Musk said at the time, speaking generally, adding, "whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all."
In Fremont, accidents have set off regulatory investigations. But in Shanghai, when the Tesla worker was crushed to death by machinery last year, a report published by city authorities citing safety gaps was taken down shortly after it went online.
The Shanghai government bureau that released the report did not respond to faxed questions.
'May There Be Prosperity for All'
China's vision of Tesla being a catfish for local electric vehicle brands has proved prescient. BYD, a top Chinese rival, overtook Tesla in worldwide sales late last year.
But China's electric vehicle push has prompted anxiety in Europe. "When we decided to shift from thermic engines to E.V.s, we were late vis-à-vis China -- I would say between five and seven years late," said Bruno Le Maire, France's finance minister.
In September the European Union started an inquiry into whether Chinese policies give electric vehicle brands there an unfair edge. Although Tesla is not technically under investigation, it could face tariffs on cars exported from China.
In the United States, the Biden administration pushed through the Inflation Reduction Act in an attempt to compete. The White House is now considering raising tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, which are already at 25 percent.
California officials reject the idea that Tesla's rise in China has been bad for the state. "It's not really a zero-sum game," said David Hochschild, chair of the California Energy Commission, who said he saw "robust growth" ahead in E.V.s for both sides.
But Shanghai has replaced Fremont as Tesla's global export hub, sending more than 175,000 cars to Europe from China last year, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.
And while the Chinese emissions program brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in credits for Tesla, according to the market analysis company CRU Group, the price of credits is dropping because Chinese companies are manufacturing more electric cars.
"We have reached the tipping point," said Lei Xing, an independent auto analyst focused on China.
Despite rising competition, Mr. Musk remains strong in the country.
In October 2022, Mr. Li, the former Shanghai leader, was promoted to the country's No. 2 spot. Mr. Musk is also building a battery factory in Shanghai, which a state-owned research firm said last year would use CATL cells. When Mr. Musk traveled to China last May, the battery maker's chairman welcomed him with a 16-course banquet. At his side for at least part of the trip was Ms. Tao, the lobbyist, who had risen to the post of vice president at Tesla. (CATL did not respond to questions.)
Even the plant Tesla is building in Nuevo León, Mexico, will use Chinese suppliers, several of whom the state governor has said will set up factories nearby.
Late last year, Mr. Musk attended an exclusive reception for Mr. Xi in San Francisco.
On Weibo, a Chinese social platform, Mr. Musk posted a photo of him shaking hands with the Chinese leader. "May there be prosperity for all," he wrote.

When Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas in Shanghai in 2020, he went off script and started dancing. Peeling off his jacket, he flung it across the stage in a partial striptease.

(Tao and Morgan, who recently left Tesla, did not respond to questions.)
Local officials were keen to persuade Tesla to build a factory in their cities. That interest could “potentially be leveraged” to promote a mandate, Maya Ben Dror, who worked for iCET at the time, wrote in an email to Morgan.
An said he took two groups of Chinese city officials to visit Tesla’s office in California, adding that neither Tesla nor Musk gave iCET any money. He and Ben Dror saw the emissions scheme as sound environmental policy.
The priorities of the environmentalists and Chinese officials often differed. In the West, clean transportation was seen as a “tree-hugging kind of issue, while in China it was from the start seen as an industrial issue,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who studied the emissions policy discussions.
But as an innovative green business, Tesla checked both boxes.
In 2015, at a clean transportation conference in California, Chinese central government officials listened as a Tesla lobbyist laid out the reasons that Beijing should adopt an emissions mandate, said Yunshi Wang, an energy economist who organized the session.
“Obviously Tesla was all in,” said Wang, director of the University of California, Davis’ China Center for Energy and Transportation.
The emissions mandate eventually appealed to the officials, too. The existing government subsidy system was rife with fraud. The mandate was more efficient and would save the government money.
In 2017, China adopted the policy.
It was Tesla’s first big win there.
Tesla’s Factory Goes Up at Record Speed
Musk did not want to share ownership of Tesla’s factory with a Chinese company, as was required at the time. So in 2018 officials revoked the rule for all foreign electric car companies. The change was Tesla’s second big win.
Soon after, Shanghai beat out other cities competing for Tesla’s factory. Li, then Shanghai’s top leader, became a key ally. He had visited Tesla in California, on a trip that also included a meeting with Brown, Xi and others about climate cooperation.
Musk proposed constructing the factory in two years, state media reported. Li countered that they could do it in one — a goal that his government met.
“This was even faster than China speed,” said Tu Le, who heads the consultancy Sino Auto Insights, adding that Li’s help was key: “How quickly things happened points to his tacit approval of everything.”
Government officials used “very creative yet cautious approaches” to bend policy to Tesla’s wishes, Tao told Yicai Global, a Chinese media outlet, adding that she was “deeply impressed.”
At least twice, Musk and his team were allowed to drive Teslas into Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party leadership’s walled compound in Beijing.
Under Li’s watch, state-run banks offered Tesla over 11 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) in low-interest loans. The deal was so generous that Huang Yonghe, a senior official with a government-owned auto industry group, recalled one government minister balking at it.
“He said the Shanghai leaders were unbelievable — giving away the entire investment without Tesla having to spend a penny,” Huang said in an interview.
But Huang said the deal made sense for the banks.
He had long been impressed by Tesla, at one point importing a car and disassembling it to study how it worked. Like Li, he had visited the Tesla factory in Fremont, California, which had struck him as chaotic but promising.
China could improve on it, he thought, yielding an efficient foreign factory that would serve as a “catfish,” an aggressive creature that makes other fish swim faster.
Tesla also created a market for Chinese suppliers, saying recently that 95% of components used in the Shanghai factory are locally sourced.
One key supplier is a once-obscure battery company. In the United States, Tesla had a partnership with Panasonic, but in China it switched to mainly using batteries from CATL, which built a factory near Tesla’s. Today, buoyed in part by Tesla’s business, CATL is the world’s largest battery maker.
Another supplier, LK Group, developed enormous casting machines that can make an entire section of a car with Tesla’s help. The company’s founder, Liu Siong Song, told the Times in 2021 that LK planned to supply the machines to six Chinese companies.
That year, he said that he hoped the technology would “help our country’s automotive industry become bigger and stronger,” linking it to Xi’s “Chinese dream” of national resurgence.
Long Hours at Tesla’s Shanghai Plant
Before the Shanghai plant opened, Fremont was Musk’s principal factory. He sometimes slept on the factory floor to model the intensity he expected of his employees.
In China, workers were accustomed to long workweeks, a fact that Musk saw as an advantage.
The Shanghai plant’s schedule involves an unusual weekly change in shifts. According to two former employees, workers there pull four straight 12-hour day shifts, followed by two days of rest, before switching to four 12-hour night shifts. (Fremont employees typically work seven 12-hour shifts over two weeks.)
As the coronavirus pandemic spread in 2020, the Fremont factory was shuttered for nearly two months.
But the Shanghai plant closed for only about two weeks, helping Tesla turn a profit for the first time and causing Musk’s wealth to surge.
China has also offered Musk an escape from California’s strict labor protections.
During Shanghai’s 2022 lockdown, some Tesla workers slept on the factory floor. They were paid extra to continue working, but Tesla demanded six 12-hour shifts in a row, the two workers said. (Employees who chose not to work were also paid, but less than their normal salary.)
Chinese workers “won’t even leave the factory,” Musk said at the time, speaking generally, adding, “whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all.”
In Fremont, accidents have set off regulatory investigations. But in Shanghai, when the Tesla worker was crushed to death by machinery last year, a report published by city authorities citing safety gaps was taken down shortly after it went online.
The Shanghai government bureau that released the report did not respond to faxed questions.
‘May There Be Prosperity for All’
China’s vision of Tesla being a catfish for local electric vehicle brands has proved prescient. BYD, a top Chinese rival, overtook Tesla in worldwide sales late last year.
But China’s electric vehicle push has prompted anxiety in Europe. “When we decided to shift from thermic engines to EVs, we were late vis-à-vis China — I would say between five and seven years late,” said Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister.
In September the European Union started an inquiry into whether Chinese policies give electric vehicle brands there an unfair edge. Although Tesla is not technically under investigation, it could face tariffs on cars exported from China.
In the United States, the Biden administration pushed through the Inflation Reduction Act in an attempt to compete. The White House is now considering raising tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, which are already at 25%.
California officials reject the idea that Tesla’s rise in China has been bad for the state. “It’s not really a zero-sum game,” said David Hochschild, chair of the California Energy Commission, who said he saw “robust growth” ahead in EVs for both sides.
But Shanghai has replaced Fremont as Tesla’s global export hub, sending more than 175,000 cars to Europe from China last year, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.
And while the Chinese emissions program brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in credits for Tesla, according to the market analysis company CRU Group, the price of credits is dropping because Chinese companies are manufacturing more electric cars.
“We have reached the tipping point,” said Lei Xing, an independent auto analyst focused on China.
Despite rising competition, Musk remains strong in the country.
In October 2022, Li, the former Shanghai leader, was promoted to the country’s No. 2 spot. Musk is also building a battery factory in Shanghai, which a state-owned research firm said last year would use CATL cells. When Musk traveled to China last May, the battery maker’s chair welcomed him with a 16-course banquet. At his side for at least part of the trip was Tao, the lobbyist, who had risen to the post of vice president at Tesla. (CATL did not respond to questions.)
Even the plant Tesla is building in Nuevo León, Mexico, will use Chinese suppliers, several of whom the state governor has said will set up factories nearby.
Late last year, Musk attended an exclusive reception for Xi in San Francisco.
On Weibo, a Chinese social platform, Musk posted a photo of him shaking hands with the Chinese leader. “May there be prosperity for all,” he wrote.

Full text: As the share price plunges, investors wonder whether the company, led by Elon Musk, can withstand intensifying competition.
Elon Musk appeared to be in a defiant mood Wednesday when he stood before employees at Tesla's factory near Berlin a week after an arsonist set fire to a high-voltage power pylon and brought production to a standstill.
"They can't stop us," Mr. Musk, the company's chief executive, told workers in a giant tent beside the plant.
But there are proliferating signs that Tesla may not be as unstoppable as it once seemed. The company's car sales are no longer growing at a torrid pace. Chinese automakers and established brands like BMW and Volkswagen are flooding the market with electric cars. And Tesla has been slow to respond with new models.
Mr. Musk's many outside ventures, and his penchant for making polarizing political statements and attacking people he disagrees with, have raised questions about how focused he remains on managing Tesla. Wall Street is increasingly concerned about the company: Tesla's share price has lost one-third of its value this year even as major stock indexes have hit record highs.
"A bet on Tesla has always been a bet on Mr. Musk," said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School who focuses on corporate law, governance and finance.
In an interview with the former television anchor Don Lemon that streamed online on Monday, Mr. Musk brushed off the drop in the company's share price as part of the cycle.
"The stocks go up and down, but what really matters is are we making and delivering great products," Mr. Musk said.
The weeklong production stop at Tesla's factory in Grünheide, its second this year, was only a temporary setback. But the decline in the share price indicates that investors are reassessing Tesla's long-term prospects and are no longer certain that the company -- still worth more than any other carmaker -- will one day dominate the industry.
Mr. Musk can take much of the credit for goading other automakers to focus on electric cars, proving that they could be practical, profitable and fun. Tesla's Model Y sport utility vehicle was the best-selling car of any kind in the world last year.
But Tesla has not added a mass-market vehicle to its lineup since the Model Y went on sale in 2020. Chinese automakers like BYD, SAIC and Geely Auto are bringing out dozens of new models. Analysts said Tesla's Cybertruck, a futuristic pickup that went on sale in limited numbers last year, would probably appeal to a relatively narrow set of buyers given its high price and unconventional design. And while Tesla is working on an electric car that would cost around $ 25,000, it is not expected to go on sale in large numbers until 2026.
"I'm a little surprised at this point there hasn't been the next thing," said Michael Lenox, a professor of business administration at the University of Virginia who studies industries undergoing technological upheaval.
Tesla has repeatedly adjusted prices in response to demand, cutting them to boost sales and then sometimes raising them again. While the cuts have helped make electric cars more affordable, analysts say the strategy has eroded the company's profits without doing much to increase revenue. The cuts have also sharply lowered the resale value of Tesla cars, because no one pays more for a used car than a new one.
The strategy trains potential buyers "to wait for a deal," Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, said on X. Mr. Black, who has more than 400,000 followers on X, which Mr. Musk owns, has long been a Tesla optimist, but the fund recently sold some of its shares in the company.
Tesla faces particularly intense competition in China, the world's largest car market, where more than one-third of new car sales are electric. BYD surpassed Tesla in global electric vehicle sales in the last three months of 2023 with a broad array of sedans, sport utility vehicles and cheap subcompacts. Its Seagull model sells for less than $ 12,000 in China.
Even after Tesla's price cuts, the Model 3 sedans and the Model Y S.U.V.s made at a factory in Shanghai are far more expensive than many Chinese models. European and Chinese automakers are also introducing new electric vehicles at a dizzying rate. More than 150 will go on sale by the end of the year, according to HSBC.
At the same time, Tesla is not well positioned to compete in the luxury market because its cars don't offer as many amenities as cars made by the likes of BMW or Mercedes-Benz, said John Helveston, an assistant professor of engineering management at George Washington University who has studied Chinese car-buying habits.
"In China, there are so many great options that Tesla just falls in the middle," Mr. Helveston said. "It's an overpriced car for the luxury you get out of it."
Tesla has not told investors how it will regain ground in China, which generates the bulk of its sales. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
"What will they pull out of their toolbox other than price cuts to keep them in the mix in 2024?" asked Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a research firm. "The price-cut tool has lost its effectiveness."
Mr. Musk's disdain for the established way of doing things, as well as his love of big engineering challenges, has made it difficult for Tesla to bring out new products quickly, Mr. Helveston said. The Cybertruck is an example. It is made of stainless steel, which resists rust better than conventional steel but is notoriously difficult to work with. The truck arrived two years behind schedule and took up resources that could have been used for products with broader appeal.
"Tesla could be doing far better than it is if they had been less aggressive in trying to do everything new and used half the knowledge out there that works," Mr. Helveston said.
But doing new things excites Mr. Musk, who chuckled with glee when telling Mr. Lemon about the revamped version of the company's Roadster sports car, which he said Tesla planned to bring out at the end of the year. The vehicle will combine technology from Tesla and his rocket company, SpaceX, "to create something that's not really a car," he said.
In Europe, the Model Y was the best-selling electric car last year. But Volkswagen and its Audi, Skoda and SEAT brands together sold more electric vehicles than Tesla on the continent, according to Schmidt Automotive Research. Sales of the Model Y fell at the end of the year after Germany and other countries cut subsidies.
Tesla could also suffer from restrictions that the European Union is considering imposing on Chinese imports. All Model 3 sedans sold in Europe and the right-hand-drive Model Y for Britain are imported from Shanghai. Tesla accounts for one of every four Chinese-made cars imported by Europe, according to Schmidt.
"This would narrow what has been impressive, but nonetheless narrowing, profit margins and make a more even playing field for European automakers that have been manufacturing locally," said Matthias Schmidt, founder of the research firm. He noted that France had taken protectionist policies a step further by restricting government subsidies for purchases of electric vehicles to those produced in the European Union. Italy has indicated it may do the same.
Mr. Musk is also a source of uncertainty. In January a Delaware judge struck down his pay package, worth more than $ 50 billion, saying Tesla's board of directors used a flawed process in negotiating his compensation. In response, Mr. Musk threatened to move Tesla's corporate registration from Delaware to Texas.
Tesla's board has not unveiled a new pay package for him. Mr. Musk, who oversees SpaceX and several other businesses in addition to Tesla and X, has threatened to pursue unspecified new ventures outside Tesla unless he is given control over 25 percent of the company. He currently owns about 13 percent.
"You now have a grumpy C.E.O.," said Mr. Talley of Columbia Law School. "What does that portend for the ability of Tesla to command Mr. Musk's attention? Is it possible he would just disengage from the company?"
Mr. Musk's whistle-stop visit to Grünheide appeared timed to show employees in Germany, some of whom had voiced concern about their safety after the arson, that he remains committed to the company and the factory. The plant is producing around 300,000 cars per year, but aims to expand that to as many as one million.
Asked by reporters whether he intended to stick to that plan, Mr. Musk responded, "Yes, absolutely."

Volkswagen Workers Plan Vote on Joining U.A.W.
Workers at Volkswagen's factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., will vote next month on whether they want to be represented by the United Auto Workers union.
The National Labor Relations Board said Monday that the election will take place from April 17 to 19 at the plant, in the first test of the union's effort to organize nonunion automobile factories across the nation.
Workers at the 3.8 million square foot factory with more than 4,000 production workers filed paperwork March 18 seeking the election.
The U.A.W. announced its organizing campaign last fall after it won strong contracts with Detroit automakers. The U.A.W. said it would simultaneously target more than a dozen nonunion auto plants including those run by Tesla, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, Honda, and others. Associated Press

Nissan Aims to Expand Stable of Electric Vehicles
Nissan will expand its electric vehicle lineup, develop more powerful batteries and cut production costs, while speeding up the process, in what the Japanese auto maker's chief called "The Arc" pathway to higher sales by 2030.
"The auto industry is now being forced to reshape its values so we can say continuous change is the new normal," Makoto Uchida, Nissan's chief executive said on Monday in outlining an ambitious business plan. "Nissan must change. We cannot succeed if we continue along the same path."
Costs will come down for electric models so they'll be about the same as gasoline models by fiscal 2030, while global sales will grow by a million vehicles during that period, he added.
Last year, Nissan Motor Co. sold nearly 3.4 million vehicles around the world, up about 5 percent from the previous year.
The company is planning 30 new models over the next three years, 16 of them E.V.s. Nissan plans to launch 34 E.V. models from fiscal 2024 through fiscal 2030. Associated Press
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Ericsson to Lay Off 1,200 Over Lagging 5G Sales
Ericsson said on Monday that it would lay off about 1,200 employees in Sweden as part of cost-cutting measures announced this year as customers reduce their spending on 5G gear.
After cutting thousands of staff last year, telecoms equipment suppliers like Ericsson and Finland's Nokia are expecting 2024 to remain challenging as 5G equipment sales slow in North America and are also expected to ease from record levels in India.
Ericsson told Reuters in January it could look at further cost cuts this year including layoffs.
Citing ongoing negotiations with unions, the company declined to give a figure for how much it could save by cutting staff.
The company said it would continue with initiatives to increase operational efficiency during 2024. Reuters

Range of Issues On E.V.s Stokes Partisan Battle: [National Desk]

Full text: The electric vehicle, a breakthrough achievement in automotive technology, has driven into this year's presidential election, inflaming partisan fights that have come to define much of American culture.
One reason is that President Biden has made electric vehicles central to his strategy to combat climate change. This week, his administration announced the most ambitious climate regulation in the nation's history: a measure designed to accelerate a transition toward electric vehicles and away from the gasoline-powered cars that are a major cause of global warming.
The political war over electric vehicles has been fueled by an incendiary mix of issues: technological change, the future of the oil and gas industry, concerns about competition from China and the American love of motorized muscle. And in the rural reaches of America, where few public charging stations exist, the notion of an all-electric future feels fanciful -- another element to the urban-rural divide that underlies the nation's polarization.
Mr. Biden's opponent, former President Donald J. Trump, has for months escalated attacks on electric vehicles broadly and the new regulation in particular, falsely calling the rule a ban on gasoline-powered cars and claiming electric cars will "kill" America's auto industry. He has called them an "assassination" of jobs. He has declared that the Biden administration "ordered a hit job on Michigan manufacturing" by encouraging the sales of electric cars.
Within minutes of this week's announcement of the new rule, similar talking points -- albeit not as violent -- flooded the Republican ecosystem.
"The Biden administration is deciding for Americans which kind of cars they are allowed to buy, rent and drive," said Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment Committee, in remarks that were echoed across the Capitol and on Fox News. A Fox News headline falsely claimed "Biden mandates production of electric vehicles."
In many ways, Mr. Biden's new rules on auto pollution combine elements that conservatives love to hate: government regulations and the notion that Democrats want to force Americans to give up comforts in the name of the environment.
Over the years, Mr. Trump has sharpened Republican opposition to environmental rules by attacking everything from non-aerosol hair spray to low-flow toilets. He has bashed energy-efficient dishwashers, LED lightbulbs and falsely claimed that wind turbines cause cancer.
In pitching his E.V. policies to Americans, Mr. Biden has sought to present himself as a "car guy," talking about his upbringing as the son of a car dealer and test driving a Ford-150 electric pickup truck to pronounce "This sucker's quick!" He was the first president to join auto workers on the picket line.
Still, policy analysts say that Mr. Trump's attacks on the government's efforts to clean up cars are likely to resonate with voters.
"When you get into personal vehicles, you're touching a huge portion of the United States," said Barry Rabe, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. "The majority of Americans have little or no familiarity with E.V.s. When you get into the question of what you drive, how you drive, how reliable it is and what it signifies about your identity -- that's where the culture wars come in."
Especially potent is the false claim that the new rule is a "ban" on conventional cars, analysts said.
The E.P.A. regulation is not a ban. Rather, it requires carmakers to meet tough new average emissions limits across their entire product line, starting in model year 2027 and ramping up through 2032. Automakers could comply with the emissions caps by selling a mix of gasoline-burning cars, hybrids, E.V.s or other types of vehicles, such as cars powered by hydrogen.
The E.P.A. estimates that compliance with the rule would mean that by 2032, about 56 percent of new passenger vehicles sold would be electric and another 16 percent would be hybrids. Car companies that exceed the new restrictions could face substantial penalties. The new standards would not apply to the used car market.
Cars and other forms of transportation are, together, the largest single source of carbon emissions generated by the United States, pollution that is driving climate change and that helped to make 2023 the hottest year in recorded history.
The new limits on tailpipe emissions would avoid more than seven billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions over the next 30 years, according to the E.P.A. That's the equivalent of removing a year's worth of all the greenhouse gases generated by the United States, the country that has historically pumped the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
It would also provide nearly $ 100 billion in annual net benefits to society, according to the agency, including $ 13 billion annually in public health benefits like avoided hospitalizations and fewer premature deaths thanks to improved air quality.
And it would save the average American driver about $ 6,000 in reduced fuel and maintenance over the life of a vehicle, the E.P.A. estimated.
The country's major car companies have grudgingly accepted the new regulations, after winning some concessions from the administration, in the form of a more gradual compliance schedule that pushes back the most stringent requirements until after 2030.
"The future is electric," said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents 42 car companies that produce nearly all the new vehicles sold in the United States, in a statement this week. He said the rules "are mindful of the importance of choice to drivers and preserve their ability to choose the vehicle that's right for them."
But other industries that will be affected by the rule have launched attacks -- particularly oil and gas companies that see the rise of electric vehicles as an existential threat.
The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a lobbying organization, has begun what it says is a "seven figure" campaign of advertising, phone calls and text messages against what it calls "Biden's E.P.A. car ban" in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada and Arizona, as well as in Ohio, Montana and the Washington, D.C., market.
Also fighting the rule are more than 4,000 of the country's 18,000 car dealerships, which wrote to Mr. Biden urging him to "tap the brakes" on the rule. Auto dealers -- business owners rooted in communities who directly interact with motorists as they choose what to drive -- could be particularly persuasive to voters, analysts said.
"It's really surprising that it just got rammed down our throats," said Duane Wilkes, chief financial officer of the Berge Auto Group in Arizona, which owns six dealerships in Phoenix and Tucson that sell vehicles made by Toyota, Lexus, Ford, Volkswagen and Mazda.
"What we sell isn't determined by us, it's determined by the customer, what they really want to buy," Mr. Wilkes said. "And the E.V.s are just sitting on the lots."
In the Phoenix metro area, electric vehicles represented 11.6 percent of new car registrations last year. "It's trying to get votes," said Mr. Wilkes, who described himself as an independent voter. "It won't get mine. They want to enforce a change I don't think a typical American is ready for."
He added, "We have skin in the game and this is a direct shot to our profitability and maybe even our existence in some cases."
And yet, electric vehicles are the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry. Sales of electric vehicles, trucks and S.U.V.s hit a record last year, reaching 1.2 million for the first time, bringing the share of electric vehicles in the United States vehicle market to 8.5 percent of new auto registrations. While growth is slowing, this year is expected to set another record, analysts have said.
But the boom is not happening everywhere. In California, which leads the nation in terms of the number of charging stations, 40 percent of new cars registered in San Jose last year were electric. But in Detroit, the country's automobile capital, they accounted for only 3 percent and even less in Buffalo and Bismark, N.D.
Michael McKenna, a Republican strategist and energy lobbyist who worked in the Trump White House, said Republican polling has found attacking electric vehicle mandates to be an "amazing" issue for the party. He called Mr. Biden's regulation a "shadow ban" on gas-powered vehicles. "If you make something unavailable it's the same as banning it," he said.
"It's a solid second tier issue, with a special salience in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Ohio for obvious reasons," Mr. McKenna said, referring to swing states that Mr. Biden is hoping to win. "Are people going to vote on it? Probably it's not going to be their main driver. But is it going to be a secondary confirmation thing? Yes."
Stefan Hankin, a Democratic strategist and founder of Lincoln Park Strategies, who has warned the party about "pushing voters too hard" on electric vehicles, said he believes the car rule will help Mr. Biden.
"It's not a ban, and that's encouraging," Mr. Hankin said, adding that the rule "sends a signal to environmentally-minded voters and younger voters, which the Biden campaign is definitely interested in."
A 2023 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found half of American adults, and 70 percent of Republicans and those who lean Republican, said they were not likely to consider purchasing an electric vehicle as their next car. In the same poll, 56 percent of Democrats and those who lean Democratic said they would consider buying an E.V.
Mike Murphy, a veteran Republican operative, saw the same partisan split in a November poll conducted by the EV Politics Project, an advocacy group he founded.
"It's a tribal issue," said Mr. Murphy, who has worked for Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and other moderate Republicans. Mr. Murphy, a fan of electric vehicles, founded the EV Politics Project to try to get Republicans to stop bashing them -- a lonely struggle.
"If you can't crack the Republican problem there is no way you can get to these targets," Mr. Murphy said, referring to the E.P.A.'s emission goals. "They are going to run out of Democrats."
Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, which accounts for half of electric vehicle sales in the United States, has aligned himself with many hard-right views, leading analysts to wonder whether he could change conservative attitudes about the cars. "He could soften up the Republican opposition if he chose to," Mr. Murphy said. But there is little evidence that is happening.
Republicans and Mr. Trump have argued electric vehicles help China, America's economic rival, because minerals critical to battery manufacturing like graphite and manganese often originate in China.
Mr. Trump's opposition to electric vehicles has created a dilemma for political leaders in several Republican-led states where new electric vehicle and battery plants are being built, thanks to federal incentives overseen by the Biden administration.
Henry McMaster, the Republican governor of South Carolina, was asked about that quandary during a ceremony in February to mark the construction of a $ 2 billion plant to manufacture electric pickups and off-road vehicles under the Scout brand. The factory is expected to create as many as 4,000 jobs.
Gov. McMaster insisted that Mr. Trump is not against electric vehicles.
"What President Trump is opposed to, as most people are, are mandates -- federal mandates," Gov. McMaster told reporters. "We do understand electric vehicles are a part of the future of South Carolina. We're following the market."
The political and social messages that consumers absorb about E.V.s could significantly shape the success of the new regulation, said Stephanie Brinley, an analyst for the Auto Intelligence service at S & P Global Mobility. That's because the rule depends so heavily on whether motorists buy the cleaner cars.
"That is part of the wild card about consumers," said Ms. Brinley. "It's an emotional thing. It's reflective of the either/or mentality that dominates social media. It could have an impact on how fast or how slow this transition goes."

The electric vehicle, a breakthrough achievement in automotive technology, has driven into this year’s presidential election, inflaming partisan fights that have come to define much of American culture.
One reason is that President Joe Biden has made electric vehicles central to his strategy to combat climate change. This week, his administration announced the most ambitious climate regulation in the nation’s history: a measure designed to accelerate a transition toward electric vehicles and away from the gasoline-powered cars that are a major cause of global warming.
The political war over electric vehicles has been fueled by an incendiary mix of issues: technological change, the future of the oil and gas industry, concerns about competition from China and the American love of motorized muscle. And in the rural reaches of America, where few public charging stations exist, the notion of an all-electric future feels fanciful — another element to the urban-rural divide that underlies the nation’s polarization.
Biden’s opponent, former President Donald Trump, has for months escalated attacks on electric vehicles broadly and the new regulation in particular, falsely calling the rule a ban on gasoline-powered cars and claiming electric cars will “kill” America’s auto industry. He has called them an “assassination” of jobs. He has declared that the Biden administration “ordered a hit job on Michigan manufacturing” by encouraging the sales of electric cars.
Within minutes of this week’s announcement of the new rule, similar talking points — albeit not as violent — flooded the Republican ecosystem.
“The Biden administration is deciding for Americans which kind of cars they are allowed to buy, rent and drive,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment Committee, in remarks that were echoed across the Capitol and on Fox News. A Fox News headline falsely claimed “Biden mandates production of electric vehicles.”
In many ways, Biden’s new rules on auto pollution combine elements that conservatives love to hate: government regulations and the notion that Democrats want to force Americans to give up comforts in the name of the environment.
Over the years, Trump has sharpened Republican opposition to environmental rules by attacking everything from non-aerosol hair spray to low-flow toilets. He has bashed energy-efficient dishwashers and LED light bulbs, and falsely claimed that wind turbines cause cancer.
In pitching his EV policies to Americans, Biden has sought to present himself as a “car guy,” talking about his upbringing as the son of a car dealer and test driving a Ford F-150 electric pickup truck to pronounce “This sucker’s quick!” He was the first president to join autoworkers on the picket line.
Still, policy analysts say that Trump’s attacks on the government’s efforts to clean up cars are likely to resonate with voters.
“When you get into personal vehicles, you’re touching a huge portion of the United States,” said Barry Rabe, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. “The majority of Americans have little or no familiarity with EVs. When you get into the question of what you drive, how you drive, how reliable it is and what it signifies about your identity — that’s where the culture wars come in.”
Especially potent is the false claim that the new rule is a “ban” on conventional cars, analysts said.
The EPA regulation is not a ban. Rather, it requires carmakers to meet tough new average emissions limits across their entire product line, starting in model year 2027 and ramping up through 2032. Automakers could comply with the emissions caps by selling a mix of gasoline-burning cars, hybrids, EVs or other types of vehicles, such as cars powered by hydrogen.
The EPA estimates that compliance with the rule would mean that by 2032, about 56% of new passenger vehicles sold would be electric and another 16% would be hybrids. Car companies that exceed the new restrictions could face substantial penalties. The new standards would not apply to the used car market.
Cars and other forms of transportation are, together, the largest single source of carbon emissions generated by the United States, pollution that is driving climate change and that helped to make 2023 the hottest year in recorded history.
The new limits on tailpipe emissions would avoid more than 7 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions over the next 30 years, according to the EPA. That’s the equivalent of removing a year’s worth of all the greenhouse gases generated by the United States, the country that has historically pumped the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
It would also provide nearly $100 billion in annual net benefits to society, according to the agency, including $13 billion annually in public health benefits like avoided hospitalizations and fewer premature deaths thanks to improved air quality.
And it would save the average American driver about $6,000 in reduced fuel and maintenance over the life of a vehicle, the EPA estimated.
The country’s major car companies have grudgingly accepted the new regulations, after winning some concessions from the administration, in the form of a more gradual compliance schedule that pushes back the most stringent requirements until after 2030.
“The future is electric,” said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents 42 car companies that produce nearly all the new vehicles sold in the United States, in a statement this week. He said the rules “are mindful of the importance of choice to drivers and preserve their ability to choose the vehicle that’s right for them.”

New Clean Air Rules Will Still Propel Manufacturers to Sell More Electric Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: New Biden administration auto rules are less forceful than an earlier proposal but will still add to market pressure for cheaper electric vehicles.
Even if clean air rules announced on Wednesday in Washington are less forceful than some environmentalists would have liked, they should still have a powerful effect on the kinds of cars appearing in showrooms over the next several years, experts said.
The rules will amplify market forces pushing the industry toward battery power, giving automakers a strong incentive to sell a broader, more affordable variety of electric cars -- not just the expensive sport utility vehicles that have dominated sales so far.
"It probably means more models and lower prices," said Craig Segall, former deputy executive officer of the California Air Resources Board, an agency that played a key role in promoting electric vehicles in that state. "The way you win," he said, referring to carmakers, "is making sure you have an E.V. in each segment."
Despite talk of a slowdown, sales of electric vehicles are growing much faster than sales of vehicles that run on fossil fuels. Prices of electric vehicles have dropped significantly and are likely to fall further as carmakers get better at making them and the cost of batteries and raw materials plummets.
The Environmental Protection Agency rules announced Wednesday "certainly don't slow down the pace at which our members are scaling up production," said Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association. The association's members include Tesla and other electric carmakers, as well as battery manufacturers, charging companies and suppliers.
The Inflation Reduction Act, passed by Democrats in 2022, led to a boom in investment in battery factories and electric vehicle plants. Since then, companies have announced investments of more than $ 110 billion in battery factories and electric vehicle assembly plants, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. These are long-term financial commitments that companies are likely to stick to regardless of what the federal government does.
Within a few years, electric cars that can drive more than 300 miles on a charge are likely to cost less than gasoline vehicles even before accounting for fuel savings. Electricity is usually much cheaper than gasoline. That will give more car buyers strong economic reasons to go electric.
The average price of a new electric vehicle has fallen substantially. It was $ 52,314 in February, according to Kelley Blue Book, still about $ 5,000 more than the average for all vehicles. But electric vehicle prices plummeted 13 percent in February from a year earlier, and more than $ 2,500 just from January. The cost of used battery-powered vehicles has dropped much more than that.
Prices will to continue to fall steeply because batteries, the most important and expensive component, are becoming much cheaper, analysts say. The average cost of a battery pack is on track to plunge more than 40 percent by 2030 compared with 2022, according to estimates by the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization.
Electric vehicles "are getting closer to parity with gas cars," said Katherine García, a transportation expert at the Sierra Club. "We are going to see that sooner than originally forecast."
During the early years of the E.P.A. rules announced on Wednesday, automakers will face somewhat less pressure to cut emissions than under an earlier agency proposal. The E.P.A. doesn't dictate to automakers how they meet the standards. They can also reduce emissions by improving the efficiency of gasoline engines or by selling more hybrid cars that augment gasoline engines with batteries and electric motors.
Plug-in hybrids, which can travel short distances on battery power alone and are growing in popularity, could proliferate during the next few years. They will account for as much as 9 percent of new car sales by 2030, according to E.P.A. estimates, compared with about 2 percent last year.
But automakers will get the most credit for all-electric cars that have no tailpipe emissions. They will account for 44 percent of new cars by 2030, according to the E.P.A.
Longer term, most automakers acknowledge that they need to sell appealing electric vehicles to survive.
"E.V.s are clearly the future and what consumers are going to be wanting and what's going to be cheapest to produce," said Stephanie Searle, chief program officer at the International Council on Clean Transportation. "Automakers need to be investing in that to keep up."
Tesla has already shaken the car market and has become the world's most valuable automaker. New competitors from China are looming, as Beijing tries to take advantage of the technological shift to become a major auto exporter.
Tariffs and other restrictions have limited Chinese exports to the United States so far. But automakers like BYD, which sells an electric car in China for less than $ 12,000, could find a way in by producing in Mexico or even building factories in the United States.
For automakers, the emergence of Chinese rivals is a powerful motivator. It evokes unpleasant memories of the way Toyota, Honda and other Japanese automakers broke the dominance of Ford Motor, General Motors and Chrysler in the 1970s with inexpensive, fuel-efficient cars. Tesla, Ford and Volkswagen are among the major automakers working on low-cost electric vehicles that are clearly inspired by the threat from China.
Experience has shown that technology often moves faster than regulations require. Under E.P.A. rules that took effect in 2017, electric vehicles were expected to account for 3 percent of new car sales by 2025. But battery-powered cars are already at about 8 percent of the U.S. new car market.
In California, which has long had the strictest pollution limits, electric cars made up 25 percent of new cars sold last year. And under rules passed in 2022, the state will phase out cars that burn fossil fuels by 2035.
"California has more than its share of E.V.s because we asked for it," said Mr. Segall, the former state official, who is now vice president of Evergreen, an activist group.
Another 12 states, including New York and New Jersey, model their rules on California's and won't be affected much by E.P.A. regulations because their rules are already stricter. The federal rules will have the most impact on states like Texas, Florida and Connecticut that don't follow California.
The rules will also put pressure on carmakers like Toyota and Stellantis, the owner of Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep, which have been slow to sell fully electric vehicles.
The E.P.A. rules are among numerous Biden administration policies intended to promote electric vehicles. Tax credits of up to $ 7,500 are available for vehicles that are manufactured in the United States, Canada or Mexico and meet other requirements designed to promote a domestic supply chain. The number of vehicles that qualify is small, but is expected to grow as carmakers like Hyundai make more vehicles in the United States.
The government is also subsidizing construction of fast-charging stations, which along with investments by carmakers like Mercedes-Benz and charging companies like Electrify America will soon remove a major sticking point for many car buyers.
Surveys show that many people are interested in electric cars but are worried about finding a place to charge on road trips. If governments and companies follow through on all the plans they have announced, according to a study published this month by the International Council on Clean Transportation, by 2030 there will be more than enough fast chargers.

INTERNATIONAL
An article on Wednesday about Republicans in Congress blocking aid to help stabilize Haiti amid unrest there misstated the position of Representative Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, Democrat of Florida. Ms. Cherfilus-McCormick has consistently backed the mission, she did not sign the letter by Democrats to the secretary of state urging a withdrawal of support for a military intervention there.
NATIONAL
An article on Wednesday about a lawsuit over New York City's property tax system misstated the vote totals in the Court of Appeals decision. It was 4-3, not 5-4.
BUSINESS
An article on Tuesday about Volkswagen employees' third attempt at unionizing in Tennessee referred incorrectly to a provision for worker representation on Volkswagen's supervisory board, the equivalent of a board of directors. Under German law, half the seats are reserved for worker representatives, but they are not necessarily union members.
SPORTS
A picture caption with an article on Sunday about the former Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden misstated his record in 1985. He was 24-4, not 24-9.
WEATHER
A chart in the Weather Report on Saturday and Sunday showing reservoir levels for the New York City water supply misstated the previous day's levels. The reservoirs were filled to nearly 100 percent of capacity, not 10 percent.
ARTS
A television review on Wednesday about the "Masters of the Air" misstated who developed the show. John Orloff developed it, it was not created by Orloff and John Shiban.
An article on Tuesday about the shift in management on the reality television show "Below Deck" misquoted Fraser Olender, the chief stew of "Below Deck." He said, "I also feel like Kerry this season. ... Lee has a no B.S. attitude, which I love with him," not "I feel like Kerry this season, as opposed to Lee, has a no B.S. attitude, which I love with him."
OBITUARIES
An obituary on Tuesday about Thomas P. Stafford, an astronaut who commanded the American capsule that linked up with a Soviet spaceship in 1975, misstated the timing of the launch of an earlier NASA space mission, Gemini 7, in December 1965. It occurred 11 days before the launch of a companion mission, Gemini 6, which was piloted by Mr. Stafford, not "a few hours" before that launch. The obituary also misstated the names that were given to the lunar module and the space capsule on NASA's Apollo 10 mission in 1969. The capsule, drawing from the "Peanuts" cartoon strip, was called Charlie Brown, not Snoopy, and the lunar module, with Mr. Stafford and another astronaut aboard, was called Snoopy, not Charlie Brown.
An obituary on Monday about the Muslim scholar Marnia Lazreg referred incorrectly to Mostaganem, Algeria, where she was born. It is west of Algiers, not east.

VW Workers Request Vote To Unionize in Tennessee: [Correction]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers said a "supermajority" of the 4,000 eligible workers at a Volkswagen factory had signed cards backing the union.
Volkswagen employees in Tennessee who are hoping to join the United Automobile Workers asked a federal agency on Monday to hold an election, a key step toward the union's longtime goal of organizing nonunion factories across the South.
The union said Volkswagen workers had filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board asking for a unionization vote after a "supermajority" of the 4,000 eligible workers at the plant had signed cards supporting the U.A.W.
It did not specify how many workers had signed cards, but it previously advised workers to get the support of more than 70 percent of hourly workers and establish a robust organizing committee before seeking an election. A simple majority vote is needed to win representation.
"Today, we are one step closer to making a good job at Volkswagen into a great career," Isaac Meadows, an assembly worker at the plant, said in a statement issued by the union.
An election at the factory would be the first test of the U.A.W.'s strength after the union staged a wave of strikes in the fall against the three Detroit automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis -- and winning record wage increases -- with encouragement from the Biden administration.
In a statement on Monday, Volkswagen said it would "fully support" an election giving every employee a chance to vote on union representation. "We respect our workers' right to a democratic process and to determine who should represent their interests," the company said.
Later Monday, President Biden issued a statement congratulating the Volkswagen workers for filing for the union election.
The U.A.W. has been hoping to use momentum from its bargaining with the Detroit-based manufacturers to organize nonunion plants in Southern states that pay significantly lower wages than union factories. The U.A.W. says it plans to spend $ 40 million over the next three years on its campaign.
Chattanooga workers have voted on U.A.W. representation twice before, and slim majorities rejected unionization each time. In a 2014 vote, the union had no opposition from Volkswagen management, but there was vocal resistance from state Republican leaders, who suggested that unionizing would jeopardize expansion and job growth at the plant. A second narrow loss came in 2019.
Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the U.A.W. was in a strong position to gain a majority this time.
"Now they have a lot more support from legislators, the public and the president," he said. "They can say, 'We can help you get better wages and benefits, and we proved we could do that with the Big Three."'
Over the last 40 years, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai and other foreign-owned automakers have built more than two dozen auto plants across the South and the lower Midwest, drawn by right-to-work laws that make it harder for unions to organize workers.
They also often chose to build factories in rural areas where prevailing wages are significantly lower than in Michigan and other Northern states.
In addition to the Volkswagen effort, union campaigns are underway at a Mercedes-Benz plant and a Hyundai factory, both in Alabama. The union says more than half of the Mercedes workers and more than 30 percent of the Hyundai workers have signed cards supporting U.A.W. membership.
Volkswagen workers said they wanted to join the U.A.W. to push for higher wages, more time off and improved safety measures. The Chattanooga factory opened in 2011 and makes the Atlas full-size sport utility vehicle and the ID.4 electric vehicle. It is the world's only Volkswagen plant without union representation.
"VW has partnered with unionized work forces around the world to make their plants safe and successful," Victor Vaughn, a logistics worker, said in the union statement. "That's why we're voting for a voice at Volkswagen here in Chattanooga."
The U.A.W. is likely to have support in the election from the powerful German labor union, IG Metall. Under German law, worker representatives occupy half of the seats on Volkswagen's supervisory board, the equivalent of an American board of directors.
The U.A.W. has sought for years to organize these nonunion auto plants without success, but unions have had a resurgence in recent years in organizing efforts and contract showdowns.
G.M., Ford and Stellantis agreed in the fall to roughly 25 percent wage increases for workers making the top U.A.W. wage, and even larger raises for workers farther down on the pay scale.
Within a few years, almost all of the 146,000 U.A.W. workers at the Detroit companies will earn more than $ 40 an hour -- the equivalent of about $ 83,000 a year for those working 40 hours a week.
The Volkswagen plant announced an 11 percent pay increase shortly after the strikes at the Big Three, bringing the top hourly wage for production workers to $ 32.40.
Nonunion auto plants generally start new workers at less than $ 20 an hour and pay a top wage under $ 30 an hour.

Volkswagen employees in Tennessee who are hoping to join the United Auto Workers asked a federal agency Monday to hold an election, a key step toward the union’s longtime goal of organizing nonunion factories across the South.
The union said Volkswagen workers had filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board asking for a unionization vote after a “supermajority” of the 4,000 eligible workers at the plant had signed cards supporting the UAW.

Len Sirowitz, 91, Whose Bold and Offbeat Ads Captured an Era, Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: An award-winning agency art director, he brought a striking visual touch to campaigns for the Volkswagen Beetle, Sara Lee and Sony in the 1960s as well as to the antiwar and antinuclear movements.
Len Sirowitz, an award-winning advertising art director whose creative work in the 1960s included memorable print ads for the Volkswagen Beetle -- like one declaring, "Ugly is only skin-deep" -- and a campaign for Mobil in which a car was dropped off a 10-story building to make a point about the perils of speeding, died on March 4 at his home in Manhattan. He was 91.
His daughter, Laura Sirowitz, confirmed the death.
Mr. Sirowitz joined the influential Doyle Dane Bernbach advertising agency, known as DDB, in 1959, at 27, and spent the next 11 years at the firm conceiving the look of ads for numerous accounts with wit and passion.
"It was quite early in my career that I began to realize that my message needed to not only be bold and daring, but it must stem from the truth ... and touch people's emotions," he told Dave Dye, who runs the advertising blog From the Loft, in 2015.
Volkswagen was perhaps Mr. Sirowitz's most important account, and the homely Beetle, nicknamed the "Bug," was his and copywriter Robert Levenson's automotive muse. Their collaborations for the German car maker included the ad "Will We Ever Kill the Bug?" in which they positioned a Beetle turned on its roof, like a dead bug. The answer to the question: "Never." (Though, after a few shots of the car, its roof collapsed.)
The pair also devised an ad that showed a motley Beetle constructed of green and beige fenders, a blue hood and a turquoise door, which were cobbled together from models between 1958 and 1964. The ad stressed the ease with which owners could find parts.
For Sara Lee, Mr. Sirowitz and Mr. Levenson created a TV commercial in which people dealt with annoyances like haircuts and traffic jams, then consoled themselves with a piece of the company's cake, introducing a soon-to-be enduring jingle: "Everybody doesn't like something / But nobody doesn't like Sara Lee."
For Mobil's public service newspaper and TV ads about highway safety, Mr. Sirowitz illustrated how crashing at 60 miles per hour would have the same impact as a car dropping from 10 stories. "And it will get you to exactly the same place -- the morgue," the narrator said.
Another TV ad for Mobil showed a couple canoodling in a car as the man drives against the blinding lights of oncoming traffic, eventually leading to a crash. A narrator says: "We at Mobil sell gasoline and oil. We're in favor of driving and love, but not at the same time."
And for the Better Vision Institute, an association of lens and frame manufacturers, Mr. Sirowitz produced dozens of promotions that ran in Life magazine persuading people to have their eyes examined more often. One particularly dramatic ad ran in all-black with copy by Leon Meadows reading, "This is how yellow daisies in a green pasture against a blue sky look to many Americans."
Bob Isherwood, a former worldwide creative director of Saatchi & Saatchi, called Mr. Sirowitz a "hero art director" for his flow of fresh ideas and different approaches.
"It was just an idea that he put on the page," he said in a phone interview. "When you see ads like that you think, 'Oh, God, I wish I had done that."'
Leonard Sirowitz was born on June 25, 1932, in Brooklyn. His father, Abraham Sirowitz, immigrated from Ukraine in 1905 and held various jobs, including taxi driver and jewelry polisher. His mother, Sadie (Schoenwetter) Sirowitz, ran the home.
Mr. Sirowitz's passion for drawing led to studies at the Art Students League of New York in Manhattan at age 12 and, two years later, his acceptance to the High School of Music and Art (now the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts). There, he met his future wife, Myrna Florman, a music student known as Mickey, when he was 17 and she was 14.
Mr. Sirowitz graduated in 1953 from the Pratt Institute, where he earned a bachelor's degree in advertising. He spent the next two years in the Army, mostly at Fort Dix in New Jersey, and he married Miss Florman during his service in January 1955. She survives him, along with his daughter; a son, Michael; and one grandson.
After his Army discharge, Mr. Sirowitz worked at the L.W. Frohlich pharmaceutical ad agency as well as Grey Advertising, CBS and Channel 13, the public TV station in New York.
In addition to working for DDB's commercial clients like Sony, where Mr. Sirowitz created a whimsical campaign based on the portability of its four-inch-wide TV, he also took on political causes as a volunteer.
A full-page newspaper ad in 1965 for the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy showed a cockroach against a white background with the headline: "The Winner of World War III."
Another ad in 1968, for the Coalition for a Democratic Alternative, carried, in giant letters, the headline "For what?" Below it, text by Dave Reider, a copywriter, described the hopelessness of the Vietnam War, demanded that President Lyndon B. Johnson step down and argued for Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota to be the Democratic nominee for president.
Mr. Sirowitz was DDB's senior vice president and associate creative director when he left in 1970 to form his own agency, Harper Rosenfeld Sirowitz as co-chairman and co-creative director. (It was renamed numerous times over the years.) By then he had been voted art director of the year for 1968 and 1970 in national polls by Ad Weekly. He was inducted into the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame in 1985.
His agency's clients included Swissair, McDonald's, Smith Corona and Royal Caribbean Cruises. Still, in 1995, the firm closed after losing several accounts, and Mr. Sirowitz joined the agency Ryan Drossman & Partners as vice chairman.
He soon retired and returned to the Art Students League, where he drew large-format, charcoal nude portraits four days a week until the start of the pandemic.
"I strive for bold, dramatic interpretations of the model's pose, drawn with spontaneous sweeping lines, and most importantly it should be part of a strong, well-designed composition," he told the institution's magazine, Lines from the League, in its 2012-13 issue.
His composition style came through clearly in his ad campaigns, including one in 1991 for America West Airlines, in which he cast the improvisational comedian Jonathan Winters -- looking tough and wearing camouflage -- in a parody of Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who had recently commanded U.S. troops in the Gulf War.
The ad declared, "Announcing Air Superiority for Civilians," and offered airfares discounted by up to 40 percent.
The campaign, however, was rebuked by the organization Veterans of Foreign Wars for being in poor taste, and America West soon after filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
"To me, great advertising should make your palms sweat," Mr. Sirowitz told The Associated Press. "America West is the smallest of the major airlines. We wanted to do to the kind of advertising that would put them on the map in one fell swoop."

Ira von Fürstenberg, Princess, Actress, Artist and Globetrotter, Dies at 83: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: With her aristocratic lineage, high-profile husbands and famous friends, she embodied a chic life of luxury as an international social figure.
Ira von Fürstenberg, who came as close as one can get to having it all as an Italian-born princess descended from Charlemagne, an heiress to the Fiat fortune, a Vogue model, a big-screen ingénue and a globe-trotting bon vivant, died on Feb. 19 at her home in Rome. She was 83.
Her son, Hubertus von Hohenlohe, said she died after breaking ribs and perforating her lungs in a domestic accident.
Blending the gilded privilege of the old-world European aristocracy with the élan of the midcentury film and fashion peerage, Ms. von Fürstenberg seemingly defined the term "jet setter," bouncing between homes in Rome, London, Paris and Madrid and on Lake Geneva.
"My only real home is on airplanes," she said. "I spend so much time going from country to country that my children suspect that I'm really a flight attendant."
She shared a surname with the renowned fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg, who married the princess's fashion designer brother, Egon, in 1969. "When I first met Egon, she was the famous sister," Diane told Women's Wear Daily last month. "She had gotten married in Venice and was a movie star."
The princess flaunted both noble lineage and seemingly inexhaustible wealth from her mother, Clara, who was a granddaughter of Giovanni Agnelli, who founded Fiat, and a sister of Gianni Agnelli, the dashing Fiat chief.
Her home in Paris was even fitted with solid gold bath taps, because, as she once put it, "everybody has to see something beautiful in the morning in order to have a good day."
Even so, Ms. von Fürstenberg was anything but content to settle into a life of pampered indolence.
In her many careers, she posed for fashion shoots with luminary photographers like Irving Penn and Helmut Newton; walked the runway wearing a Mondrian dress by Yves Saint Laurent; appeared in films with the actors Peter Lawford and Donald Pleasence; served as an executive for Valentino; and later became an artist herself, exhibiting in museums decorative objects fashioned from bronze, rock crystal and semiprecious stones.
Fame came early to Ms. von Fürstenberg. At 15, she made headlines on both sides of the Atlantic when she married the Spanish-born prince and playboy Alfonso Hohenlohe-Langenburg, affectionately known as the King of Clubs for his work founding the Marbella Club, a haven for stars and socialites, on Spain's Costa del Sol.
Because of her young age she needed a special dispensation from Pope Pius XII to marry the prince, who was 31, yet there was little, if any, sniff of scandal. In fact, she appeared on the cover of Life on Oct. 17, 1955, for what the magazine deemed "the wedding of the year."
"All the elements of a medieval romance were present for the wedding -- the tapestried palaces, the tiaraed ladies, the gifts of costly silver and priceless jewels," the magazine reported.
Accompanying photos showed the princess in a lace bridal gown, laughing joyously alongside the neatly mustached groom as they led a flotilla of more than 100 decorated gondolas through the canals of Venice. The celebration lasted more than two weeks, luring 400 European aristocrats.
Their union yielded glittering parties around the world and mingling among the fashion and art elite, including Salvador Dalí -- who asked the newly wedded princess to pose nude, a request that she and her husband quickly rejected. They had two sons, Christoph, who died in Thailand in 2006, and Hubertus, a former Olympic skier for Mexico.
But the good times would not last. In 1960, the couple drew considerably less fawning press when the princess, with her marriage foundering, took up with Francisco Pignatari, known as Baby, a Brazilian industrialist and notorious playboy.
An article in Life that year, headlined "A Princess's Pretty Pickle," reported that Ms. von Fürstenberg was "living modestly in a 17-room hotel suite in Mexico City," where her husband controlled the Volkswagen franchise for the country.
The prince would not go quietly. At 4 a.m. one day, the article continued, police officers banged on the princess's door to search the suite. (She suspected that the raid had been orchestrated by her husband to sully her name and help him in his custody fight.) To the rescue came Mr. Pignatari, more than 20 years her senior, who was staying a floor above her. He was briefly jailed on charges of adultery, but the charges were quickly dropped for lack of evidence.
As she and Prince Hohenlohe-Langenburg spiraled toward divorce, he at one point absconded with their boys, dressing them in wigs to disguise them as girls. The princess countered with a handsome reward to find them.
However chivalrous Mr. Pignatari's intentions during the hotel raid, their love did not last, either. The couple married in Reno, Nev., in 1961 and divorced three years later.
"She had got caught up in a man's world as half a child," her son Hubertus, who survives her, later said.
Virginia Carolina Theresa Pancrazia Galinda von und zu Fürstenberg was born on April 17, 1940, in Rome. Her father, Prince Tassilo Fürstenberg, traced his lineage to the German House of Fürstenberg; her mother was descended from scions of Italian industry.
During World War II, the family ducked hostilities by moving to Lausanne, Switzerland, before later settling in Venice. Educated at boarding schools in Switzerland and England, the princess was making public appearances by 13, serving as a swimwear model for a family friend, the Italian designer Emilio Pucci. Two years later, the photographer Cecil Beaton captured a portrait of her with flowers in her hair.
After the turmoil of her marriages, Ms. von Fürstenberg met the film producer Dino De Laurentiis on a flight in 1966. Mr. De Laurentiis was intrigued by her potential as an actress and soon had her under contract.
The next year, she co-starred in "Dead Run," an espionage thriller starring Mr. Lawford, and in the Italian spy spoof "Matchless," starring Patrick O'Neal and Mr. Pleasence.
Not all critics were charmed by her performance. Howard Thompson wrote in The New York Times, "A real, sure-enough member of royalty from the society columns, Princess Ira Fürstenberg, plays a bland, casually clad femme fatale."
Undeterred, she went on to make more than two dozen screen appearances into the early 1980s, although she later said that she wished she had been seen as more than a tawny-eyed temptress. "Directors only look at my navel, and producers only look at my name," she once said.
Her best opportunity at a breakout role, in "Brother Sun, Sister Moon," Franco Zeffirelli's 1972 epic about St. Francis of Assisi, was snipped from the film's final cut.
Still, she said in a 2019 interview with Sotheby's, she had no regrets about her years in film.
"I may not have been that successful," she said, "but I had a great time with my wonderful partners, and stories of that time are so many that I cannot remember."
Near the end of her life, Ms. von Fürstenberg looked back with similar fondness toward her time in fashion, mingling with friends like the fashion editor Diana Vreeland and the designer Karl Lagerfeld, who often stayed with her in her Swiss villa.
With her closets full of designer clothes, she never stopped presenting herself in a manner befitting a princess.
As she recalled in a 2019 interview with Vogue: "My father used to say, 'One must cover oneself."'

Ira von Fürstenberg, who came as close as one can get to having it all as an Italian-born princess descended from Charlemagne, an heiress to the Fiat fortune, a Vogue model, a big-screen ingénue and a globe-trotting bon vivant, died Feb. 19 at her home in Rome. She was 83.
Her son, Hubertus von Hohenlohe, said she died after breaking ribs and perforating her lungs in a domestic accident.
Blending the gilded privilege of the old-world European aristocracy with the élan of the midcentury film and fashion peerage, von Fürstenberg seemingly defined the term “jet setter,” bouncing between homes in Rome, London, Paris and Madrid and on Lake Geneva.
“My only real home is on airplanes,” she said. “I spend so much time going from country to country that my children suspect that I’m really a flight attendant.”
She shared a surname with the renowned fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg, who married the princess’s fashion designer brother, Egon, in 1969. “When I first met Egon, she was the famous sister,” Diane told Women’s Wear Daily last month. “She had gotten married in Venice and was a movie star.”
The princess flaunted both noble lineage and seemingly inexhaustible wealth from her mother, Clara, who was a granddaughter of Giovanni Agnelli, who founded Fiat, and a sister of Gianni Agnelli, the dashing Fiat chief.
Her home in Paris was even fitted with solid gold bath taps, because, as she once put it, “everybody has to see something beautiful in the morning in order to have a good day.”
Even so, von Fürstenberg was anything but content to settle into a life of pampered indolence.
In her many careers, she posed for fashion shoots with luminary photographers like Irving Penn and Helmut Newton; walked the runway wearing a Mondrian dress by Yves Saint Laurent; appeared in films with actors Peter Lawford and Donald Pleasence; served as an executive for Valentino; and later became an artist herself, exhibiting in museums decorative objects fashioned from bronze, rock crystal and semiprecious stones.
Fame came early to von Fürstenberg. At 15, she made headlines on both sides of the Atlantic when she married Spanish-born prince and playboy Alfonso Hohenlohe-Langenburg, affectionately known as the King of Clubs for his work founding the Marbella Club, a haven for stars and socialites, on Spain’s Costa del Sol.

A Hybrid-First Strategy Is Paying Off for Toyota: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Toyota, the world's largest automaker, has been criticized for selling few electric vehicles, but its decision to focus on hybrids is paying off financially.
In today's high-tech, high-stakes auto industry, fortunes can change quickly, and there's no better example of that right now than Toyota Motor.
Not long ago, it looked as if Toyota had fallen dangerously behind in electric vehicles. Tesla, the electric car pioneer, has grown rapidly and become the world's most valuable automaker. Seeing Tesla's success, other companies, such as General Motors and Ford Motor, concluded that large numbers of consumers were poised to switch to battery-powered cars and trucks and began investing tens of billions of dollars to catch up.
Toyota, however, was more deliberate -- or lethargic, its critics would say. It has introduced just two fully electric models in the United States so far, betting that its gas-electric hybrids and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which it has become known for, would remain popular and were sufficient to address climate change for now.
Amid all the enthusiasm for electric vehicles in the last few years, it seemed Toyota just didn't get it.
"I was shocked when I first heard about Toyota's strategy because I could see what Tesla was doing," said Earl Stewart, a Toyota dealer in Lake Park, Fla., who also enjoys driving his Tesla Model S.
But in the last six months, sales of electric vehicles have slowed, and American car buyers looking to cut their fuel bill and tailpipe emissions have been flocking to hybrids. Now Toyota's sales are booming, and the company is reporting huge profits.
"It's not the first time Toyota has proved me wrong, and it won't be the last, either," Mr. Stewart said.
Toyota's sudden strength is a reminder of how profoundly the auto industry is changing. Developing technologies like electric vehicles, advanced microchips and software are turning what was once a steady, slow-moving sector into a dynamic industry in which even fast-moving and well-run manufacturers can be knocked off course.
Toyota, a Japanese company, is the world's largest automaker; it sold more than 11 million vehicles in 2023, more than six times as many as Tesla. The company climbed the ranks of the industry slowly over a half century, first exporting small cars to the United States, then building factories across the South and Midwest, adding a luxury brand and expanding into the segments dominated by its Michigan-based rivals, like full-size pickup trucks.
A few times along the way, Toyota has bucked the industry's conventional wisdom. The introduction of its upscale Lexus brand, in 1989, seemed like a risky bet until it zoomed ahead of BMW and Mercedes-Benz in sales. Twenty-one years ago, Toyota introduced the Prius, a small car with a compact gasoline engine and an electric motor powered by a battery.
The combination allows the Prius to go 50 or more miles on a gallon of gas, and a plug-in hybrid model can make short trips without using any gasoline. Other automakers dismissed the car as a curiosity, but the Prius was a hit, and before long G.M., Ford and others developed their own hybrids.
Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, scorns hybrids, saying it makes no sense to have two propulsion systems under the hood. Consumers don't seem to care. Toyota offers more than two dozen hybrid or plug-in hybrid models, and they make up almost 30 percent of its sales, much higher than at most other automakers. Last year in the U.S. market, Toyota sold 2.2 million vehicles -- more than every automaker except G.M.
In January and February, Toyota's U.S. sales rose 20 percent, powered by an 83 percent rise in sales of its hybrids and plug-in models.
"We're not saying E.V.s are not a good solution to carbon emissions," said Jack Hollis, executive vice president of Toyota's North American arm. "They are. They're just not the only solution, and a lot of our customers have been telling us they want choice -- hybrids, plug-ins, and E.V.s."
The strategy is paying off. In the nine-month period starting last April, Toyota made $ 27 billion in profit, roughly double its earnings from the same period a year earlier. By comparison, Tesla's $ 15 billion profit in 2023 was about 19 percent higher than its 2022 figure.
Investors have taken notice. The stock market now values Tesla at less than half its peak market capitalization of $ 1.2 trillion in November 2021 in large part because its sales are growing more slowly and the profit it makes on each car has been falling. Over the same period, Toyota's valuation has risen by roughly a third, to about $ 400 billion.
Mike Ramsey, an analyst at the research firm Gartner, said Toyota's hybrid strategy is strong and based on long-term logic, but shifts in technology or the market could undermine the company's future performance and standing.
"Toyota seems to swing between dullard and genius, depending on the current state of thinking about technology," he said. "But no matter what, they still seem to sell more cars and trucks than anyone else."
One big market where Toyota is struggling is China, the world's largest car market. A lot of Chinese car buyers are opting for electric vehicles, helping domestic automakers like BYD gain market share from Toyota, Volkswagen and other foreign manufacturers.
Toyota has other problems, too. The company's Daihatsu subsidiary, which makes small cars, temporarily stopped all production in Japan in December after revealing that it had cheated on safety tests.
For now, however, Toyota's deliberate pace seems to be working overall and several other large automakers have moved closer to the company's path.
Mercedes-Benz, which had been hoping to phase out internal combustion models by 2030, said last month that it had pushed that goal back by at least five years. Ford has lowered production targets for electric vehicles and is slowing construction on plants that are supposed to produce batteries for electric vehicles.
G.M., which had stopped selling hybrids in the United States to focus on electric vehicles, has delayed the introduction of a few battery-powered models. It is also now planning to reintroduce hybrid and plug-in hybrid models, which dealers had pushed for.
"Deploying plug-in technology in strategic segments will deliver some of the environmental benefits of E.V.s as the nation continues to build its charging infrastructure," G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in February.
Electric vehicles have so far failed to win over many car buyers because they are generally more expensive than combustion or hybrid models even after taking into account government incentives. The challenges of charging electric vehicles, worries about range and their performance in cold weather have also caused some people to hesitate.
Hybrids don't face many of those issues. Some hybrids cost only a few hundred dollars more than similar gasoline cars -- a premium that owners can quickly recoup in fuel savings. In addition, regular hybrids never have to be plugged in.
Plug-in hybrid models, some of which can travel on just electricity for more than 40 miles and have a gasoline engine for longer trips, have much smaller batteries than electric vehicles and can be recharged relatively quickly. But these vehicles, which make up a small part of the market, may not be as beneficial financially or environmentally when driven long distances on just gasoline.
Toyota has plans to significantly increase hybrid production and sales. A hybrid version of its Tacoma pickup is rolling out. A redesigned Camry sedan, due this spring, will be available only as a hybrid.
The company will offer a range of electric vehicles, too, said Mr. Hollis, the Toyota executive. About 30 models will arrive by 2026, when Toyota hopes its U.S. electric vehicle sales will have risen to about 1.5 million vehicles a year. Last year it sold about 15,000.
In Florida, new Toyotas that arrive at Mr. Stewart's dealership in South Florida barely hit the lot before they are sold. At the beginning of March, he had only about 150 vehicles in inventory, down from the 500 he used to carry before the pandemic.
That hasn't deterred customers who have become accustomed to waiting months after ordering vehicles. At one point last year, he had 1,300 vehicles on order, and customers for all of them.
"I've been selling Toyotas since 1975, and business is better than ever," he said. "People are lining up to buy from me."

The strategy is paying off. In the nine-month period starting last April, Toyota made $27 billion in profit, roughly double its earnings from the same period a year earlier. By comparison, Tesla’s $15 billion profit in 2023 was about 19% higher than its 2022 figure.
Investors have taken notice. The stock market now values Tesla at less than half its peak market capitalization of $1.2 trillion in November 2021 in large part because its sales are growing more slowly and the profit it makes on each car has been falling. Over the same period, Toyota’s valuation has risen by roughly a third, to about $400 billion.
Mike Ramsey, an analyst at the research firm Gartner, said Toyota’s hybrid strategy is strong and based on long-term logic, but shifts in technology or the market could undermine the company’s future performance and standing.
“Toyota seems to swing between dullard and genius, depending on the current state of thinking about technology,” he said. “But no matter what, they still seem to sell more cars and trucks than anyone else.”
One big market where Toyota is struggling is China, the world’s largest car market. A lot of Chinese car buyers are opting for electric vehicles, helping domestic automakers such as BYD gain market share from Toyota, Volkswagen and other foreign manufacturers.
Toyota has other problems, too. The company’s Daihatsu subsidiary, which makes small cars, temporarily stopped all production in Japan in December after revealing that it had cheated on safety tests.
For now, however, Toyota’s deliberate pace seems to be working overall and several other large automakers have moved closer to the company’s path.
Mercedes-Benz, which had been hoping to phase out internal combustion models by 2030, said last month that it had pushed that goal back by at least five years. Ford has lowered production targets for electric vehicles and is slowing construction on plants that are supposed to produce batteries for electric vehicles.
GM, which had stopped selling hybrids in the United States to focus on electric vehicles, has delayed the introduction of a few battery-powered models. It is also now planning to reintroduce hybrid and plug-in hybrid models, which dealers had pushed for.
“Deploying plug-in technology in strategic segments will deliver some of the environmental benefits of EVs as the nation continues to build its charging infrastructure,” GM CEO Mary Barra said in February.
Electric vehicles have so far failed to win over many car buyers because they are generally more expensive than combustion or hybrid models even after taking into account government incentives. The challenges of charging electric vehicles, worries about range and their performance in cold weather have also caused some people to hesitate.
Hybrids don’t face many of those issues. Some hybrids cost only a few hundred dollars more than similar gasoline cars — a premium that owners can quickly recoup in fuel savings. In addition, regular hybrids never have to be plugged in.
Plug-in hybrid models, some of which can travel on just electricity for more than 40 miles and have a gasoline engine for longer trips, have much smaller batteries than electric vehicles and can be recharged relatively quickly. But these vehicles, which make up a small part of the market, may not be as beneficial financially or environmentally when driven long distances on just gasoline.
Toyota has plans to significantly increase hybrid production and sales. A hybrid version of its Tacoma pickup is rolling out. A redesigned Camry sedan, due this spring, will be available only as a hybrid.
The company will offer a range of electric vehicles, too, said Hollis, the Toyota executive. About 30 models will arrive by 2026, when Toyota hopes its U.S. electric vehicle sales will have risen to about 1.5 million vehicles a year. Last year it sold about 15,000.
In Florida, new Toyotas that arrive at Stewart’s dealership in South Florida barely hit the lot before they are sold. At the beginning of March, he had only about 150 vehicles in inventory, down from the 500 he used to carry before the pandemic.
That hasn’t deterred customers who have become accustomed to waiting months after ordering vehicles. At one point last year, he had 1,300 vehicles on order, and customers for all of them.
“I’ve been selling Toyotas since 1975, and business is better than ever,” he said. “People are lining up to buy from me.”

Full text: Police believe the blaze at a high-voltage power pylon had been deliberately set, amid turmoil over the automaker's plans to expand its assembly plant near Berlin.
Tesla was forced to halt production at its assembly plant outside Berlin early Tuesday after someone set fire to a nearby high-voltage pylon, causing a blaze that cut off electricity to the factory and surrounding region, the police said.
The police in Brandenburg, the state where the plant is, said they responded to the early-morning fire at a high-voltage power mast in a field near Tesla's plant. The fire did not damage the building, but it caused power to be cut at the plant and across the wider region, home to some 60,000 people.
Tesla did not respond to requests for comment, but a spokeswoman for the U.S. automaker confirmed to German media that production had been halted and all employees evacuated. Some 12,500 people work at the plant, according to Tesla, but not all of them would have been present at the time the power went down.
By early afternoon, power throughout most of the region had been restored, the local electricity provider Edis said. Only Tesla and a nearby warehouse remained offline, it said. Handelsblatt, the German newspaper, citing an internal letter from leaders at the factory to Tesla employees, said it would remain offline until the end of the week.
Hours after the fire was discovered, a group calling itself Vulkangruppe and linking itself to the antifascist movement published an open letter on a site widely used by left-wing activists, claiming responsibility for the attack.
"Switch off for Tesla," the letter read. "A Tesla is a status symbol, statement and propaganda at the same time: for contempt for humanity, boundless destruction through 'progress' and an imperial, patriarchal way of life."
Authorities said investigators from the state Office of Criminal Investigation had started an inquiry. "If the initial findings are confirmed, this is a perfidious attack on our electricity infrastructure," said Michael Stübgen, Brandenburg's interior minister and top security official. "This will have consequences."
Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, said on X, the social media site he owns, that the attackers were "either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth" or "puppets of those who don't have good environmental goals."
He added that "stopping production of electric vehicles, rather than fossil fuel vehicles, ist extrem dumm," using the German phrase for "extremely dumb."
Since last week, several dozen protesters have camped out in cabins and platforms built in the trees of a forested area adjacent to the plant that Tesla would like to raze in order to build a rail yard, warehouses and educational facilities. Groups involved with the forest protest distanced themselves from the attack.
The incident was the latest headache for the automaker in Europe. For months, Tesla has been locked in a standoff with unions in Sweden that has impeded its ability to service and deliver vehicles in the country. In Germany, environmental and local citizen groups concerned about the pollution and potential damage to drinking water have kept up regular protests against Tesla since it opened the plant two years ago.
A group of far-left activists acting under the same name as the group claiming responsibility for Tuesday's fire was also behind an attack in 2021 that cut off power to the construction site for the Tesla factory. That same year, security officials in Brandenburg named the group as having carried out several arson attacks in greater Berlin.
Last month, 65 percent of eligible voters in Grünheide, the community that surrounds the factory, cast ballots opposing Tesla's expansion plans. The vote was nonbinding, but local officials said they would honor it by heading back to the drawing board to try to find an acceptable solution.
Environmental protesters have said they fear that the state and local governments, which worked to lure Tesla to the site in 2022 and celebrated the economic benefits it has brought to the region, will override citizens' wishes.
Tesla's assembly plant in Grünheide is the company's only one in Europe. It has the capacity to build around 500,000 cars a year, but the company would like to double that, to one million cars per year -- more than the 800,000 produced by Volkswagen at its long-established plant in Wolfsburg.
Tesla's shares have come under pressure, losing about a quarter of their value this year as electric-vehicle sales have slowed. Sales in China, a crucial market for Tesla, dropped sharply last month, leading to the latest sell-off in the company's stock.

South Plants Next Target For U.A.W.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A looming union election at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga could determine the trajectory of union organizing at more than a dozen auto factories.
When Shawn Fain, the United Automobile Workers president, unveiled the deal that ended six weeks of strikes at Ford Motor in the fall, he framed it as part of a longer campaign. Next, he declared, would be the task of organizing nonunion plants across the country.
"One of our biggest goals coming out of this historic contract victory is to organize like we've never organized before," he said at the time. "When we return to the bargaining table in 2028, it won't just be with the Big Three. It will be the Big Five or Big Six."
Four months later, the first test of that strategy has come into focus, and it features a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn.
According to the union, more than half of over 4,000 eligible workers have signed cards indicating support for a union. Workers say they have done so because they want higher pay, more paid time off and more generous health benefits -- and because the recent strikes at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis persuaded them that a union can help win these concessions.
"The Big Three, they had their big campaign, and their big strike and vote, and new contracts -- we paid attention to that very closely," said Yolanda Peoples, who has worked at the Volkswagen plant for nearly 13 years.
The Volkswagen plant announced an 11 percent pay increase shortly after the strikes at the Big Three. The raise brought the top hourly wage for production workers to $ 32.40, but the comparable wage for the Detroit automakers will exceed $ 40 by the end of the new contracts. (Volkswagen said the wage adjustment was part of a yearly review.)
Unions need a simple majority of votes to win, but the U.A.W. says it won't file for an election at the Chattanooga plant until 70 percent of the plant's workers have signed cards and workers have built an extensive organizing committee, which union officials expect in the next month.
The caution reflects the U.A.W.'s experience in the South, where past campaigns fell short.
But the stakes may be even higher this time given the union's investment in organizing several plants at once -- including a Mercedes-Benz factory in Alabama, where more than 50 percent of workers have signed cards, and a Hyundai plant in Alabama, where the union has cards from more than 30 percent of workers.
Last week, the union said it was also allocating $ 40 million to organizing auto and battery workers through 2026 -- far exceeding its previous budget for such efforts, according to Jonah Furman, a union spokesman -- and suggested that time was of the essence.
"In the next few years, the electric vehicle battery industry is slated to add tens of thousands of jobs across the country, and new standards are being set as the industry comes online," the union said in its funding announcement.
If the union wins in Chattanooga, said Joshua Murray, a sociologist at Vanderbilt University who has studied the auto industry's response to unionization, it may quickly replicate the victory at other plants, as it did during an organizing wave in the 1930s.
"A lot of time the failure to unionize is not that workers are against being in a union -- it's that they're not convinced they can win," Dr. Murray said. "Showing they can win is a big deal for getting workers who weren't gung-ho about it to be gung-ho."
A loss in Chattanooga, Dr. Murray said, could sap employees' confidence and encourage management at other automakers to resist.
Other analysts, like Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at the research firm AutoForecast Solutions, predicted that Tesla would be a particular challenge. "The head of Tesla is Elon Musk, and he's going to fight against change," Mr. Fiorani said.
The union appears to be benefiting from a resurgence of interest in organizing after a lull during the presidency of Donald J. Trump and the start of the pandemic. Last year, unions won more than 1,225 elections -- the most in at least a decade, according to the National Labor Relations Board. They lost about 500.
Polling shows that younger workers are especially supportive, and they appear to be helping to fuel the recent auto industry organizing. "We're letting them know, 'You're making a nice pay rate compared to your age, but this can be better,"' said Ronald Terry, a worker involved in the organizing at the Hyundai plant in Alabama.
Younger workers at the Volkswagen plant also express frustration at the paid time off they accrue: 12 or 13 days during their first two years of employment, several of which they must use during plant shutdowns if they want to be paid.
Asked about the complaints, a Volkswagen spokesman said that the company understood that time off was a significant issue and that it had recently announced an increase in unpaid time off for emergencies.
The company said last month that its Chattanooga wages had increased at nearly twice the rate of inflation since 2013, and that the average production worker would make more than $ 60,000 this year before bonuses or overtime and pay less than $ 2,000 in premiums to cover more than 80 percent of health care costs.
The union sought a vote in Chattanooga in 2014 and faced no opposition from the company, whose worldwide plants are mostly unionized. But the effort failed amid pressure from state Republican leaders, who suggested that a union would jeopardize the plant's expansion.
With workers complaining of understaffing, high injury rates and last-minute overtime, the U.A.W. tried again in 2019. But pleas from Tennessee's governor and the plant's original chief executive, who said he had returned to his former position to address workers' concerns, appeared to defuse support. The union narrowly lost.
This time, the union appears determined to minimize the effect of such pushback.
The union wants to recruit a volunteer leader for every line on every shift at the plant -- more than 125 altogether, according to the union's tally. That way, organizers say, the volunteers can quickly respond to rumors or company talking points that co-workers encounter.
"If you don't have someone continuing that conversation, we have seen some of that backsliding in a few smaller areas," said Isaac Meadows, a worker involved in the organizing.
He attributed the backsliding to the influence of outside groups and chatter from workers' friends and relatives that a union would discourage employers from locating in Tennessee.
Gerald McCormick, a Republican who as the state's House majority leader opposed the union during the 2014 vote, said Republicans might worry that the union would support left-wing causes in Tennessee if it got a foothold there.
"They don't want to do them any favors," he said, referring to the state's Republican leadership, which he predicted would oppose the union campaign again.
As in 2019, the employer's response may be crucial. The Volkswagen brand appears to be roughly holding its own in the United States, and somewhat ahead in the transition to electric vehicles.
More than 11 percent of Volkswagen's U.S. sales last year came from E.V.s -- specifically the ID.4, a compact sport utility vehicle built in Chattanooga. That figure was higher than the overall 9.4 percent share for plug-in vehicles in the U.S. market, according to BloombergNEF, an energy research firm.
A Volkswagen official said during a tour of the plant that about one-third of its output this year would probably be ID.4s, and that the share could double within a decade.
If that happens, the plant may be relatively well positioned to absorb higher labor costs. Corey Cantor, an electric vehicle analyst at BloombergNEF, said continued battery innovation, along with efficiencies from larger-scale battery production, could offset the cost increases associated with unionization.
But a union presence could complicate the ramp-up in electric vehicle production, Mr. Fiorani of AutoForecast Solutions said, if the union resists the decline in workers per car that may accompany the shift. He noted that companies that made their own batteries might be able to reallocate those workers rather than lay them off, however.
Pablo Di Si, the chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, said in a statement that the plant had already added jobs in battery pack assembly and battery engineering.
Meeting with reporters last month, a Volkswagen official said that the company would stay neutral during an election campaign, but that "neutral doesn't mean silent -- it means impartial to what employees decide."
The official added that the company would correct misinformation, which it accuses the union of spreading, about pay and working conditions in the plant. (Companies reaching neutrality agreements with unions typically do not intervene this way.)
Mr. Meadows, the union supporter, said managers had communicated skepticism in sometimes subtle ways, like removing union fliers from lunch tables.
"Somebody put out a couple of business cards for a lawn service company, and we had some material on the same table," Mr. Meadows recalled. "Our materials disappeared, and the others did not."
Volkswagen said the cleanliness of the tables was governed by "clear policies."

Dell Shares Surge 25%, Hitting a Record High
Dell Technologies shares surged 25 percent to hit a record high on Friday, after an upbeat annual forecast that indicated the tech equipment maker was benefiting from the AI boom.
The stock climbed to $ 118.8, and was set to add $ 17.7 billion to the company's market value and on track to register its best intra-day performance.
The surge provides further evidence that rising AI adoption is driving gains across enterprise technology vendors, and adds to the frenzy on Wall Street following Nvidia's stunning rally.
"We have positioned ourselves well in AI," COO Jeff Clarke said on Thursday, noting that more customers were demanding PCs and servers with AI capabilities.
Orders for the company's AI-optimized servers jumped 40% sequentially in the fourth quarter, Clarke said. At least nine brokerages raised their price targets on Dell after the results.

Lobster Fishing Industry Saw a Dip in Catch
America's lobster fishing business dipped in catch while grappling with challenges including a changing ocean environment and new rules designed to protect rare whales.
The lobster industry, based mostly in Maine, has had an unprecedented decade in terms of the volume and value of the lobsters brought to the docks. But members of the industry have also said they face existential threats from proposed rules intended to protect the North Atlantic right whale and climate change that is influencing where lobsters can be trapped.
Maine fishermen's catch in 2023 fell more than 5% from the year that preceded it, and the total of 93.7 million pounds of lobsters caught was the lowest figure since 2009, according to data released Friday by the Maine Department of Marine Resources.

Volkswagen Predicts Growth Will Slow in 2024
Volkswagen forecast on Friday that sales growth would slow in 2024, joining competitors in warning of a weaker economic outlook, rising competition and higher costs.
Europe's top carmaker, whose brands include Audi, VW and Lamborghini, expects sales to grow by up to 5% in 2024, after a 15.5% increase last year to 322.3 billion euros ( $ 349 billion).
That growth suggests 2024 sales of up to 338 billion euros, higher than the 316 billion analyst estimate compiled by LSEG.
Volkswagen's Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz sees a "muted economic outlook and intense competition" in 2024, although the carmaker remains confident for the year as a whole, pointing to new product launches.
European carmakers have come under pressure from U.S. rival Tesla as well as Chinese competitors at a time when global momentum for electric vehicles is fading in the face of waning sales growth and declining government backing. REUTERS

Wrong Turns Doom Efforts On Apple Car: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Internal disagreements over the direction of the Apple car led the effort to sputter for years before it was canceled this week.
For the last decade, many Apple employees working on the company's secretive car project, internally code-named Titan, had a less flattering name for it: the Titanic disaster. They knew the project was likely to fail.
Throughout its existence, the car effort was scrapped and rebooted several times, shedding hundreds of workers along the way. As a result of dueling views among leaders about what an Apple car should be, it began as an electric vehicle that would compete against Tesla and morphed into a self-driving car to rival Google's Waymo.
By the time of its death -- Tuesday, when executives announced internally that the project was being killed and that many members of the team were being reassigned to work on artificial intelligence -- Apple had burned more than $ 10 billion on the project and the car had reverted to its beginnings as an electric vehicle with driving-assistance features rivaling Tesla's, according to a half dozen people who worked on the project over the past decade.
The car project's demise was a testament to the way Apple has struggled to develop new products in the years since Steve Jobs's death in 2011. The effort had four different leaders and conducted multiple rounds of layoffs. But it festered and ultimately fizzled in large part because developing the software and algorithms for a car with autonomous driving features proved too difficult.
Apple declined to comment.
"When it started, it was aligning the stars on something Apple alone could hit a home run on," said Bryant Walker Smith, an associate professor at the schools of law and engineering at the University of South Carolina, who spoke to Apple briefly about its project in 2015. "A decade later, the stars have realigned to make this a lot of risk and not a lot of gain."
When Apple launched its car project in 2014, it was among a stampede of investors, executives, engineers and companies chasing the idea of a self-driving car. After Google began testing prototypes on public roads in California, voices across Silicon Valley insisted that autonomous vehicles would soon be commonplace. Apple didn't want to be left behind.
At the time, the company was dealing with questions from its top engineers about its next project, according to three people familiar with the project's origins. It had just finished the Apple Watch, and many engineers were restless to begin work on something new. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, approved the project in part to prevent an exodus of engineers to Tesla.
Apple also needed to find new ways to expand its business. The company was anticipating that sales of iPhones would slow in the coming years. Cars were part of a $ 2 trillion transportation industry that could help Apple, which by then was a nearly $ 200 billion business.
Despite having a vote of confidence from Apple's chief executive, members of the team knew they were working against harsh realities, according to the six employees familiar with the project. If it ever came to market, an Apple car was likely to cost at least $ 100,000 and still generate razor-thin profit compared with smartphones and earbuds. It would also arrive years after Tesla had dominated the market.
The company held some discussions with Elon Musk about acquiring Tesla, according to two people familiar with the talks. But ultimately, it decided that building its own car made more sense than buying and integrating another business.
Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
From its inception, the project was troubled by differing views on what it should be, the people familiar with it said. Steve Zadesky, who initially led the effort, wanted to build an electric vehicle that competed with Tesla. Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer, wanted to pursue a self-driving car, which members of the software team said could be done.
Apple, which by then had $ 155 billion in cash, spent lavishly to hire hundreds of people with experience in machine learning, a type of A.I. technology, and other capabilities crucial to making a self-driving car. The influx of people made the project among the first that Apple had developed with so many outsiders new to the company's culture.
The car team, composed of more than 2,000 employees by this year, included engineers who had worked for NASA and developed racecars for Porsche.
The group developed an array of new technologies, including a windshield that could display turn-by-turn directions and a sunroof that would feature special polymer to reduce heat from the sun.
To bolster morale and guidance, star executives like Mr. Ive and the head of Mac engineering, Bob Mansfield, got involved. The company acquired several start-ups to join the car team. In 2021, to steer the project toward success, Apple put Kevin Lynch, the executive behind its popular Apple Watch, in charge of the car.
Mr. Ive and his team of designers drew concepts for a car that would look like a European minivan such as the Fiat Multipla 600, which has a half-dozen windows and a curving roof. It had no steering wheel and would be controlled using Apple's virtual assistant, Siri.
One day, in the fall of 2015, Mr. Ive and Mr. Cook met at the project's headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., for a demonstration of how the car might work. The two men sank into the seats of a cabinlike interior. Outside, a voice actor read from a script of what Siri would say as the men zoomed down the road in the imaginary car. Mr. Ive asked Siri what restaurant they passed and the actor read an answer, said two people familiar with the demonstration.
But by 2016, it was clear that the car effort was in trouble. Mr. Zadesky left Apple, and his successor, Mr. Mansfield, told the team working on the project that they would be shifting their focus from building a car to building self-driving car software, said three people familiar with the shift.
Apple secured permits from California to begin test-driving Lexus sport utility vehicles outfitted with sensors and computers. It held discussions with car makers such as BMW, Nissan and Mercedes-Benz before striking a deal with Volkswagen to provide Transporter vans for self-driving shuttles on Apple's campus.
Two more leaders took over the car effort in the years that followed. Doug Field, a former Tesla executive, laid off more than 200 employees on the project as he leaned into efforts to build its self-driving system. Then Mr. Lynch, who succeeded him in recent years, reversed the company's plans and went back to its original idea of making an electric vehicle.
Mr. Mansfield and Mr. Field didn't respond to requests for comment.
At the start of this year, Apple's leadership decided that it was a better use of the company's time to work on generative A.I. rather than the car, the company told employees in an internal meeting on Tuesday. The company said some members of the Project Titan team would be reassigned to work on artificial intelligence.
In interviews on Wednesday with The New York Times, people who worked on the project praised the decision to shutter it, saying the technology behind generative A.I. could be invaluable to the future of the company's all-important iPhone business.
Apple's dead car project will be survived by its underlying technologies. The company plans to take what it has learned about artificial intelligence and automation and apply it to other technologies that are being researched, including A.I.-powered AirPods with cameras, robot assistants and augmented reality, according to three people briefed on the projects.
Though the engineers working on automation software will get to work on artificial intelligence projects, others on the car team have been told they will need to apply for different roles at the company.

SAN FRANCISCO — For the past decade, many Apple employees working on the company’s secretive car project, internally code-named Titan, had a less flattering name for it: the Titanic disaster. They knew the project was likely to fail.
Throughout its existence, the car effort was scrapped and rebooted several times, shedding hundreds of workers along the way. As a result of dueling views among leaders about what an Apple car should be, it began as an electric vehicle that would compete against Tesla and morphed into a self-driving car to rival Google’s Waymo.
By the time of its death — Tuesday, when executives announced internally that the project was being killed and that many members of the team were being reassigned to work on artificial intelligence — Apple had burned more than $10 billion on the project and the car had reverted to its beginnings as an electric vehicle with driving-assistance features rivaling Tesla’s, according to a half-dozen people who worked on the project over the past decade.
The car project’s demise was a testament to the way Apple has struggled to develop new products in the years since Steve Jobs’ death in 2011. The effort had four different leaders and conducted multiple rounds of layoffs. But it festered and ultimately fizzled in large part because developing the software and algorithms for a car with autonomous driving features proved too difficult.
Apple declined to comment.
“When it started, it was aligning the stars on something Apple alone could hit a home run on,” said Bryant Walker Smith, an associate professor at the schools of law and engineering at the University of South Carolina, who spoke to Apple briefly about its project in 2015. “A decade later, the stars have realigned to make this a lot of risk and not a lot of gain.”
When Apple launched its car project in 2014, it was among a stampede of investors, executives, engineers and companies chasing the idea of a self-driving car. After Google began testing prototypes on public roads in California, voices across Silicon Valley insisted that autonomous vehicles would soon be commonplace. Apple didn’t want to be left behind.
At the time, the company was dealing with questions from its top engineers about its next project, according to three people familiar with the project’s origins. It had just finished the Apple Watch, and many engineers were restless to begin work on something new. Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO, approved the project in part to prevent an exodus of engineers to Tesla.
Apple also needed to find new ways to expand its business. The company was anticipating that sales of iPhones would slow in the coming years. Cars were part of a $2 trillion transportation industry that could help Apple, which by then was a nearly $200 billion business.
Despite having a vote of confidence from Apple’s CEO, members of the team knew they were working against harsh realities, according to the six employees familiar with the project. If it ever came to market, an Apple car was likely to cost at least $100,000 and still generate razor-thin profit compared with smartphones and earbuds. It would also arrive years after Tesla had dominated the market.
The company held some discussions with Elon Musk about acquiring Tesla, according to two people familiar with the talks. But ultimately, it decided that building its own car made more sense than buying and integrating another business.
Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
From its inception, the project was troubled by differing views on what it should be, the people familiar with it said.

VW Pushing E.V.s to Lift Sales in U.S.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: It and other foreign automakers are trying to exploit upheaval caused by new technology to gain market share from their dominant rivals.
Probably only Americans of a certain age remember when the Volkswagen Beetle was the best-selling imported car in the United States and the hippest ride to a Grateful Dead concert was a Volkswagen Microbus.
Volkswagen is trying to tap some of that nostalgia in its latest push to regain the status and sales it enjoyed in the United States during the Beetle's and Microbus's heydays in the 1960s. But this time it hopes its top models will be electric.
The German carmaker is second only to Toyota globally but is a niche player in the United States. Part of its plan to revive its fortunes here is to lean on a new electric model that resembles the Microbus, the ID.Buzz, and to revive the Scout brand with a line of electric pickups and sport utility vehicles.
Last week, as giant earth movers kicked up clouds of dust, Volkswagen executives and local officials gathered near Columbia, S.C., to inaugurate the site of a factory that will build vehicles bearing the Scout badge for the first time since 1980.
Volkswagen is one of several foreign automakers that see electric cars and the upheaval they are causing as a way to challenge the dominant players in the United States. Volkswagen, which also owns Audi, Porsche, Bentley and Lamborghini, is aiming to at least double its market share in the United States by the end of the decade from a meager 4 percent now.
"This market is turning electric, and everybody's starting from scratch," Arno Antlitz, the chief financial officer of Volkswagen, said in an interview. "This is our unique opportunity to grow."
Electric vehicles have already shaken the industry rankings, emboldening Volkswagen and other foreign automakers. Battery-powered S.U.V.s and sedans helped Hyundai Motor and its sister brand Kia overtake Stellantis, the maker of Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler and Ram, as the fourth-largest carmaker by sales in the United States last year.
"Electric vehicles are helping our brand to be seen as a technology leader," said José Muñoz, chief operating officer of Hyundai. They also attract a better-educated, more affluent customer than has been the case for the South Korean company's gasoline vehicles, he said in an interview.
The list of companies that dominate electric car sales looks a lot different from the top rankings for overall U.S. sales, hinting at a future when a different group of companies rule.
The top five companies in the United States for all engine types are General Motors, Toyota, Ford Motor, Hyundai and Stellantis. In electric cars, Tesla is No. 1 by a wide margin, followed by Hyundai, G.M., Ford and Volkswagen. Toyota is a minor player in electric cars.
"Just because you've been around for 120 years doesn't mean you're going to have anything in this new market," said Steven Center, the chief operating officer of Kia America.
Volvo Cars is another company hoping to take advantage of the changes wrought by electric vehicles. The Swedish carmaker, which is majority owned by Geely Holding Group of China, reported a 26 percent increase in U.S. sales last year.
Much of that growth came from hybrids that have a gasoline engine and can travel shorter distances on batteries. But Mike Cottone, president of Volvo Car for the United States and Canada, said he saw hybrids as a pathway to fully electric vehicles.
Later this year, Volvo will begin selling a Chinese-made, all-electric compact S.U.V., the EX30, which will start at $ 35,000. The company will also begin delivering the EX90, a seven-seat S.U.V. that is made in South Carolina and will start around $ 80,000.
Especially for luxury car buyers, Mr. Cottone said, "there's a lot of room for growth in the E.V. segment over the next few years."
Volkswagen has tried and failed since the 1970s to become a bigger presence in the United States, and analysts are skeptical that this time will be different. "I've seen Volkswagen set these goals before," said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Cox Automotive.
The established carmakers will not be pushovers. G.M. and Ford are also investing heavily in electric vehicles, while Toyota has said it will start producing a large electric S.U.V. in Kentucky next year.
Ms. Krebs pointed out that auto sales in the U.S. were growing slowly, making the fight for market share largely a zero-sum game. "There's this little bit of growth that everybody is going after," she said.
Volkswagen's last big push in the United States ended in scandal. In the early 2000s, the company tried to sell Americans on cars with "clean diesel" engines. It advertised the fuel, which was used in European passenger cars much more than in American cars, as more environmentally friendly than gasoline.
But the campaign collapsed in 2015 when U.S. regulators discovered that Volkswagen had used software in the vehicles to cheat on emissions tests. In reality, the cars polluted as much as long-haul trucks.
The scandal had one benefit for Volkswagen. It prompted the company to invest early in electric vehicle technology and build cars that were designed from the ground up to run on batteries, rather than make awkward modifications to gasoline models. In Europe, Volkswagen's various electric brands together outsell Tesla, according to Schmidt Automotive Research.
The person responsible for doubling Volkswagen sales in the United States is Pablo Di Si, president of Volkswagen Group of America. Mr. Di Si, originally from Argentina, said he planned to use the same strategy he deployed while overseeing the company's operations in Brazil, where Volkswagen's market share rose to more than 16 percent from 9 percent.
"You look at the segments that you think are going to be successful 10 years from now," Mr. Di Si said in an interview. "What are your gaps in the product portfolio? And then you start adding products for those particular markets."
In the United States, he said, that is likely to include gasoline cars and hybrids as well as all-electric vehicles. Volkswagen plans to import the ID.7, an electric sedan, and the ID.Buzz. Mr. Di Si hinted that there might also be a new electric vehicle that references the design of the Beetle. The last version of that car sold in the United States was the 2019 Beetle.
Volkswagen is building a $ 5 billion factory in Ontario to supply batteries to its factories in Chattanooga, Tenn., and Puebla, Mexico, which together will produce at least 80 percent of the company's cars sold in North America. That will help buyers of cars from its Volkswagen, Audi and other brands qualify for federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 per car.
Scout will fill a major gap in Volkswagen's portfolio: pickups, among the most popular vehicles in the United States. By reviving Scout, which was one of the first passenger vehicles that could navigate rough dirt tracks as well as city streets, Volkswagen hopes to attract buyers who typically buy off-road-capable vehicles from U.S. brands like Chevrolet, Ford and Jeep.
The South Carolina factory will underscore the made-in-America vibe when the first Scouts go on sale in late 2026. Volkswagen inherited the Scout brand when the company's truck subsidiary, Traton, acquired Navistar, a U.S. company previously known as International Harvester, in 2021.
The new Scouts may borrow some parts used in other Volkswagen vehicles, company executives said, but the design will be distinct from existing vehicles like the electric ID.4 S.U.V. made in Chattanooga. Scout plans to reveal prototypes this year.
A stronger presence in the United States is "a strategic necessity," Scott Keogh, the chief executive of Volkswagen's Scout Motors division, said in South Carolina last week.
Outside the United States, Volkswagen is a behemoth, with a 26 percent share of the European market and 15 percent in China. But the company is under severe pressure in China, where sales of electric vehicles have been growing fast, allowing BYD and other Chinese carmakers to gain market share from foreign automakers. Volkswagen needs growth in the United States to compensate.
Volkswagen "wants to have a strong global footprint," Mr. Keogh said, "not have an isolated footprint, where it's only sitting strong in one region."

Volkswagen is building a $5 billion factory in Ontario to supply batteries to its factories in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Puebla, Mexico, which together will produce at least 80% of the company’s cars sold in North America. That will help buyers of cars from its Volkswagen, Audi and other brands qualify for federal tax credits of up to $7,500 per car.
Scout will fill a major gap in Volkswagen’s portfolio: pickups, among the most popular vehicles in the U.S. By reviving Scout, which was one of the first passenger vehicles that could navigate rough dirt tracks as well as city streets, Volkswagen hopes to attract buyers who typically buy off-road-capable vehicles from U.S. brands such as Chevrolet, Ford and Jeep.
The South Carolina factory will underscore the made-in-America vibe when the first Scouts go on sale in late 2026. Volkswagen inherited the Scout brand when the company’s truck subsidiary, Traton, acquired Navistar, a U.S. company previously known as International Harvester, in 2021.
The new Scouts may borrow some parts used in other Volkswagen vehicles, company executives said, but the design will be distinct from existing vehicles such as the electric ID.4 SUV made in Chattanooga. Scout plans to reveal prototypes this year.
A stronger presence in the United States is “a strategic necessity,” Scott Keogh, CEO of Volkswagen’s Scout Motors division, said in South Carolina recently.
Outside the U.S., Volkswagen is a behemoth, with a 26% share of the European market and 15% in China. But the company is under severe pressure in China, where sales of electric vehicles have been growing fast, allowing BYD and other Chinese carmakers to gain market share from foreign automakers. Volkswagen needs growth in the U.S. to compensate.
Volkswagen “wants to have a strong global footprint,” Keogh said, “not have an isolated footprint, where it’s only sitting strong in one region.”

What You Get When You Cross an R.V. With a Sailboat: [Real Estate Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Instead of rolling down roads, their motorboat floats down rivers -- and it's as cozy as a woodland cabin. Think of it as a floating R.V.
Victoria Sass, an interior designer in Minneapolis, had long dreamed of owning an R.V. so she and her family could hit the open road with their living quarters attached.
"I grew up in Santa Cruz, California, with a Volkswagen van," said Ms. Sass, 40, who had fond memories of traveling with her family in their mobile vacation home. She wanted her husband, Torben Rytt, and their three children, Duncan, 3, Irene, 8, and Walter, 13, to enjoy the same experience.
Mr. Rytt, who grew up outside Copenhagen, had other ideas: He wanted a sailboat.
"I'm from a boating family," said Mr. Rytt, 45, a consultant for Nordic technology companies. "My parents met at a boat show, and we've owned boats since I was an infant. Every summer, we'd go sailing for five or six weeks."
Mr. Rytt had no interest in an R.V.; Ms. Sass had no interest in a sailboat.
So Mr. Rytt offered a compromise: What if they bought a motorboat with a large cabin that held a kitchen, bathroom and sleeping quarters?
Think of it as an R.V. that just happens to float down rivers, he suggested, instead of rolling along roads.
Ms. Sass, who runs the design firm Prospect Refuge Studio, liked the idea, as long as she could customize the interior to make it as cozy as a woodland cabin.
It didn't take long for Mr. Rytt to find their project boat: a 44-foot-long vessel from 1983 in nearby Red Wing, Minn., with a tiny kitchen, bathroom, bedroom and bunk room that needed some maintenance and love.
They bought it for $ 100,000 at the end of 2020 and moved it to their planned docking spot on the St. Croix River. The following spring, Mr. Rytt began taking lessons to learn how to pilot the boat, and they began their work to transform it.
They had the exterior of the boat repainted, changing it from maroon to sky-blue and white. They replaced the worn black awnings with new blue ones. Below deck, they tore out the grungy carpet, and Mr. Rytt spent an entire summer installing a new teak parquet floor. (There was existing teak wall paneling and cabinetry that they liked, so they cleaned and oiled the wood to refresh it.)
The more they worked, the more they realized that in such a compact space there was a reason for everything.
"Every picture and mirror on the wall was actually an access panel to something mechanical," Ms. Sass said. "So if you replace something, it has to be replaced with something of the exact same size, which can be frustrating. It's like every piece of trim is interconnected. Even the wallpaper is integral to the boat."
Nevertheless, she was adamant about replacing the art on the walls. She was more flexible in the bathroom, where she kept the existing wallcovering, but recruited Kelsi Sharp, a graphic designer and sign painter, to give it tidy maroon-and-blue stripes.
For the kitchen, she worked with Kristen Falkirk to produce handmade black and mint-green ceramic tiles to resurface the counter and backsplash, giving the space a little wabi-sabi appeal.
For lighting, Ms. Sass mixed Danish nautical lights with a few designer favorites, including Rotonde X ceiling lamps with fabric shades from Roman and Williams Guild, which she mounted in the living room.
To furnish the boat, she mixed upscale pieces with budget finds, blasting everything with color and pattern. In the living room, she covered an Ikea sectional sleeper sofa with blankets from OddBird, piling on patterned pillows from Caravane, Goodee and St. Frank. For the floor, she bought a cushy wool rug from Beni Rugs.
"It's super shaggy, which is totally impractical for a boat," she said. "But I just think it's fun."
Because they were limited to working on the boat only in warmer months, it took three years to complete the overhaul, at a cost of about $ 250,000. They rechristened their vessel Freya, a play on the name of the Norse goddess Freyja that they hope is easier for non-Scandinavians to pronounce.
Now they use the boat not only on weekends, but also for multiweek voyages on the Mississippi River, traveling between river towns. It's not quite the same as seeing sights from an R.V., but the whole family has fallen in love with life on the water. "Some days we just anchor out in the river, to get away from it all," Ms. Sass said.
She no longer yearns for an R.V., and Mr. Rytt has abandoned all thoughts of a sailboat.
"The funny thing is that I actually prefer this over a sailboat," he said. "It's one of those things I don't think I can ever get enough of. I could spend an infinite amount of time on this boat."

Businesses Reconsider Their Xinjiang Ties: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Volkswagen and BASF, two German giants, are reassessing their activities in the region, where the Chinese government has cracked down on Muslim minorities.
Volkswagen Group is reviewing the future of its joint venture in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China and another German industrial giant is starting to sell its stakes there following new international scrutiny of forced labor using predominantly Muslim ethnic groups.
Volkswagen said last week that it was in discussions with one of its main joint venture partners in China, the state-owned Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, in the wake of allegations of human rights violations at their joint venture in Xinjiang.
The companies are examining "the future direction of the J.V.'s business activities in Xinjiang," VW said, adding that "various scenarios are currently being examined intensively."
BASF of Germany, the world's largest chemical company, disclosed on Feb. 9 that it began moving late last year to divest its stakes in two manufacturing joint ventures in Xinjiang.
BASF said that while its audits had not found human rights violations at either operation, "recently published reports related to the joint venture partner contain serious allegations that indicate activities inconsistent with BASF's values."
The Chinese government has strongly opposed any move by multinational corporations to distance themselves from commercial activity in Xinjiang, a sparsely populated region four times the size of California.
In a written reply to a question about Volkswagen and BASF, the foreign ministry on Sunday called allegations about forced labor in Xinjiang "a lie of the century concocted by anti-China forces to discredit China" and to cut off China's economy from foreign markets. The ministry added, "We hope that the enterprises concerned will respect the facts, recognize right and wrong and cherish the opportunity to invest and develop in Xinjiang."
VW and BASF, which have had extensive investments and sales in China for decades, are among the companies increasingly caught between Beijing on one side and Western governments, shareholders and human rights groups on the other. The scrutiny on German companies is particularly sharp now as European governments grapple with how to become less reliant on China.
Pressure on multinationals has increased in the past few months as American customs officials have gained experience in investigating whether imports from China violate the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act of 2021. The law bars the import of any goods from China that were made with forced labor, particularly goods made with forced labor in Xinjiang. Uyghurs, who are predominantly Muslim, are the largest ethnic group there, making up 45 percent of the population according to a census in 2020.
Companies have found it increasingly difficult to figure out whether their suppliers and joint venture partners are using components or materials that are from northwestern China and may have been produced with forced labor. China does not allow independent supply chain audits in Xinjiang and has even detained employees of foreign due diligence companies who work in far less politically sensitive places like Beijing and Shanghai.
Volkswagen said that it had encountered delays in delivering some imported vehicles to dealers in the United States because of "a customs issue" at American ports. The company said that it needed to replace a small electronic component but did not say how many cars were affected.
VW did not say that the component was from Xinjiang but noted, "When we receive information on human rights risks or potential infringements, we strive to remedy them as quickly as possible."
Nathan Picarsic, a co-founder of Horizon Advisory, a supply chain geopolitics analysis firm in Washington, said that hundreds and possibly thousands of Audis and other Volkswagen Group vehicles, mostly equipped with four-cylinder engines, have been stopped at five American ports in recent weeks because they contain a component from Xinjiang that cannot easily be replaced. VW will try to deliver the cars by the end of March and is notifying customers of delays. The Financial Times first reported that the cars had been stopped at American ports.
Multinationals are also under pressure from shareholders. Union Investment, a big German asset management firm, had endorsed investments in Volkswagen last December after a report that found no forced labor. But the fund reversed course last week, saying the latest findings meant that investments in VW were incompatible with its corporate sustainability goals.
Stephan Weil, the governor of Lower Saxony state in Germany and a member of Volkswagen's board, called the latest findings "concerning."
China has engaged in an extensive crackdown in Xinjiang over the past decade to combat what it describes as extremism among mainly Muslim ethnic minorities there. The crackdown followed a series of attacks in 2014 by militants, including assaults on two train stations and a morning market that left a total of 71 dead and over 300 injured according to official reports.
Under China's leader, Xi Jinping, Xinjiang confined hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other Muslims in vast re-education camps, starting mainly in 2017. Xinjiang also embarked on a drive to allocate Uyghur villagers and laborers to jobs in factories. Chinese officials presented those transfer projects as an effort to lift Uyghurs out of poverty and absorb them in the economic mainstream. But the labor transfers have involved coercive pressure, quasi-military discipline and restrictions on movement, according to investigations by The New York Times, other news outlets and human rights researchers.
Adrian Zenz, director of China studies at Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, a nonprofit anti-communist group in Washington, found evidence in recent months of forced labor at a chemical company in Xinjiang that also has joint ventures with BASF. He then found evidence of forced labor at the Volkswagen joint venture.
He shared the BASF evidence first with Germany's Der Spiegel newsmagazine and the ZDF public-service television broadcaster. He shared the VW information first with the German newspaper Handelsblatt.
The VW information included a photo of Uyghur workers in military uniforms who had helped build a desert track in Xinjiang to test cars in extremely hot weather.
BASF and VW each said that they started setting up joint ventures in Xinjiang in 2013. That was when the Chinese government was encouraging investments in its impoverished far west but before it began its crackdown on ethnic minorities.
VW said its joint venture in Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi, had 650 employees before the pandemic and is now much smaller.
BASF said that one of its joint venture factories, in which it holds a majority stake, has about 40 employees and makes a key ingredient for spandex. The other factory, in which BASF holds a minority stake, has 80 employees who make a chemical with broader uses, from pharmaceuticals to plastics.
BASF said it had decided last year to dispose of its stakes in both factories after concluding that they did not fit its goals for addressing climate change. The factories, located in Korla, another large city in Xinjiang, use a lot of coal. But BASF said it would now speed up the process of pulling out of the ventures.
China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, asserted on Saturday that the government's policies in Xinjiang have improved the lives of Uyghurs by providing jobs. "The so-called forced labor is only a groundless accusation," Mr. Wang said during a question-and-answer session at the Munich Security Conference.
A further problem may lie ahead for VW and other automakers in China. Human Rights Watch issued a report on Feb. 1 asserting widespread use of forced labor by companies in Xinjiang that produce over 15 percent of China's raw aluminum. The group accused automakers of not wanting to know where their suppliers of many aluminum parts actually obtain the metal.
The United States already prohibits the entry of products made from Xinjiang aluminum because of concerns that it is manufactured with forced labor.
VW said that it investigates any misconduct by suppliers, adding, "Serious violations, such as forced labor, can lead to termination of the contract with the supplier if no remedial action is taken."

China's BYD Is Putting Tesla in Its Rearview: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: China's BYD was a battery manufacturer trying its hand at building cars when it showed off its newest model in 2007. American executives at the Guangzhou auto show gaped at the car's uneven purple paint job and the poor fit of its doors.
"They were the laughingstock of the industry," said Michael Dunne, a China auto industry analyst.
Nobody is laughing at BYD now.
The company passed Tesla in worldwide sales of fully electric cars late last year. BYD is building assembly lines in Brazil, Hungary, Thailand and Uzbekistan and preparing to do so in Indonesia and Mexico. It is rapidly expanding exports to Europe. And the company is on the cusp of passing Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi, as the market leader in China.
BYD's sales, over 80 percent of them in China, have grown by about a million cars in each of the past two years. The last automaker to accomplish that in even one year in the American market was General Motors -- and that was in 1946, after G.M. had suspended passenger car sales during the four preceding years because of World War II.
"BYD's growth is unlike anything the industry has seen in many decades," said Matt Anderson, curator of transportation at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich.
Based in Shenzhen, the hub of China's electronics industry, BYD has shown how Chinese carmakers can tap the country's dominance of electrical products. No company has benefited as much from China's embrace of battery-electric cars and plug-in gasoline-electric cars. These vehicles together make up 40 percent of China's car market, the world's largest, and are expected to be more than half next year. Like most Chinese automakers, BYD doesn't sell its cars in America because Trump-era tariffs remain in place, but BYD does sell buses in the United States.
BYD is leading China's export push in electric cars, and is rapidly building the world's largest car carrier ships to transport them. The first of the ships, the BYD Explorer No. 1, is on its maiden voyage from Shenzhen with 5,000 electric cars on board, and is expected to arrive in the Netherlands by Feb. 21.
With China's and BYD's success has come more scrutiny.
Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, warned about the strength of Chinese electric car exports in a company earnings call in January. "Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other companies in the world," he said.
The rapid gains by BYD and other Chinese automakers in Europe have prompted a European Union investigation of Chinese government subsidies and could result in tariffs. BYD's annual reports show a total of $ 2.6 billion in government assistance from 2008 through 2022. And that does not include other help, like making sure that taxi companies in BYD's hometown buy only BYD electric cars.
BYD declined to comment about subsidies. In a statement, the company said the BYD Explorer No. 1, its new ship, "signifies a significant milestone for BYD as it expands into international markets and contributes to the development of the global new-energy vehicle industry."
China has built enough factories to make more than twice as many cars as its market can buy. That has led to a price war in China, particularly between BYD and Tesla, with discounting that has inflicted heavy losses. One of BYD's newest models, the subcompact Seagull, starts at less than $ 11,000.
A real estate crisis and a falling stock market are now making Chinese consumers warier about buying a car at all. But BYD's low manufacturing costs have left it in a better position than most rivals to survive any long slowdown in sales and industry shakeout.
BYD's chairman, Wang Chuanfu, founded the company in 1995 to make batteries for Motorola and other consumer electronics companies. He had studied at Central South University in Changsha, an elite institution famed for battery chemistry research. But he dreamed of making cars.
In 2003, BYD bought a factory in Xi'an that was building gasoline-powered cars. But the company had trouble at the start, gaining an early reputation for building clunkers. In a visit to the factory in 2006, a large repair area at the end of the assembly line was clogged with newly built cars that already needed more work.
BYD's sales grew as the Chinese market soared. Warren E. Buffett bought a nearly 10 percent stake for $ 230 million in 2008, giving BYD not just a cash infusion but also global cachet. The same year, Mr. Wang promised to start exporting battery-electric cars to the United States within two years.
But electric cars at the time cost a lot to build and had limited range, and Mr. Wang had to scotch his plans to enter the American market. In an interview in 2011, he second-guessed his emphasis on battery-electric cars. Automakers should focus on gasoline-electric hybrids, he declared. He added, "There is still tremendous potential in the Chinese market for electric cars."
By 2012, car production in China had caught up with demand. Buyers became choosier. BYD's car sales and stock price plunged as multinationals offered more stylish models. Industry executives and analysts questioned whether BYD had a future.
But Mr. Wang proceeded to make two risky bets that paid off.
In 2016, he hired Wolfgang Egger, a prominent Audi designer, who in turn hired hundreds more car engineers with bold tastes. They completely redesigned BYD's models.
Mr. Wang also figured out how to replace the industry's standard chemicals in rechargeable lithium batteries -- nickel, cobalt and manganese -- with cheaper iron and phosphate. But early batteries made from the inexpensive chemical compounds ran out of juice quickly and had to be recharged after even short trips.
In 2020, BYD introduced its Blade batteries, which closed most of the so-called range gap with nickel-cobalt batteries at a fraction of what they cost.
Tesla began making and selling large numbers of cars in China the same year, and enthusiasm for electric cars swept the nation. BYD was ready with inexpensive battery chemistries and Mr. Egger's new designs.
Tesla also began using lithium iron phosphate batteries in less expensive models. BYD still sells mostly cheaper cars with lower range, while Tesla mostly sells costlier cars with more range.
The Swiss bank UBS found last year that a BYD Seal electric hatchback sedan cost 35 percent less to make than a slightly smaller Volkswagen ID.3 of similar quality made in Europe. The savings came only partly from the cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries.
BYD makes three-quarters of the Seal's parts. Like Tesla, BYD uses only a few electronic systems in each car. By contrast, VW outsources up to two-thirds of its components. BYD also has benefited from lower labor costs in China, although those have risen as factories compete to hire skilled workers.
BYD now has its own walled town in Shenzhen, a southeastern city next to Hong Kong. An airport-style monorail carries workers from 18-story company apartments to BYD's office towers and research labs.
Liu Qiangqiang, an engineer at the Shenzhen center, said the staff of his car development team had almost tripled since he joined the company from General Motors 15 months ago.
"The pace is fast," he said.
After dismissing autonomous driving a year ago, BYD swung into action when the consumer electronics companies Huawei and Xiaomi introduced cars with considerable autonomous driving abilities. Mr. Wang announced in January that BYD had 4,000 engineers working on assisted driving, a limited form of autonomous technology that works mainly on highways and large roads, and would invest $ 14 billion in the technology.
BYD has a lingering advantage over Tesla: Mr. Wang's decision by 2011 to develop plug-in hybrid cars, which account for nearly half of BYD's sales.
Li Jingyu, a salesman at a BYD dealership in Shenzhen, said many families bought a hybrid as their first car so they could drive at Lunar New Year back to their ancestral villages. Most villages in China now have chargers, Mr. Li said, but not enough for the throngs of visiting drivers at Lunar New Year, which started on Friday night.
"People are just worried," he said, "about the waiting time."

Full text: Here is how our critic saw the Super Bowl commercials from best to worst.
In the spirit of "Who actually watches the game?," here is our ranking of Sunday night's Super Bowl commercials, from best to worst.
Ground rules: Only ads shown on the national CBS broadcast during the game were eligible. Not included are some non-commercial (religious, political, social advocacy) spots and most movie trailers and promos for television and streaming broadcasts.
The Best of the Bunch
These are the ones we'll remember for at least a day or two.
BMW
Christopher Walken makes fun of people making fun of Christopher Walken, with a cameo performance by the Super Bowl halftime star Usher. As always, he walks the walk.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Mountain Dew
Aubrey Plaza flat-affects her way through life with the help of a carbonated citrus beverage. Plaza is reliably droll, and there's a late "Parks and Recreation" homage.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Squarespace
Aliens (a theme in this year's ads) come to earth and can't get our attention until they figure out how to get on the internet. It is handsomely directed by Martin Scorsese (working with the "Barbie" cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto), though it's not at all clear what's being advertised.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Lindt
A chocolate ball bops around the world to the tune of Perry Como's "Round and Round." Shiny, bouncy candy.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
'A Quiet Place: Day One'
Lupita Nyong'o faces an alien invasion in a prequel film to John Krasinski's "A Quiet Place." The clear winner among the movie trailers.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Google
A man with low vision records his life in sharp photographs using a new feature of the Google Pixel. Touching story with a predictable but effective big finish.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Dunkin'
A blustery Ben Affleck tries to impress an unimpressed Jennifer Lopez while an embarrassed Matt Damon and enthusiastic Tom Brady look on. Pleasant buzz of star power.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
E*Trade
A pair of lifelike babies play pickleball with a pair of obnoxious adults in need of schooling. One of the few ads whose humor has anything resembling a bite.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
poppi
Attractive young people in grainy, retro split-screen video try to convince us of the healthy nature of the sodas sold by this Austin, Texas-based beverage company. Visually fizzy.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
National Football League
A youngster imagines playing American football as he runs through a crowded Ghanaian market accompanied by N.F.L. players, then emerges into an N.F.L. international training program and encounters the former New York Giant Osi Umenyiora. Better ground game than the Chiefs or 49ers.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
BetMGM
Vince Vaughn explains that Tom Brady, and only Tom Brady, is not allowed to use the sports betting service because he has already won too much. Vaughn-to-Brady is a winning combination.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The Perfectly Fine
These get an A for effort and a B- for execution.
TurboTax
The "Abbott Elementary" star Quinta Brunson tells us (twice) to do our taxes. Brunson is so darn likable that it seems like a good idea.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
NYX Cosmetics
Cardi B raps about lip gloss; an accompanying comedy bit about men using Duck Plump to plump something other than their lips was available online but not shown on CBS. The timidity was disappointing but Cardi B is never not funny.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Apartments.com
Aliens come to earth and, naturally, need an apartment. Simple-minded but any scenario benefits from the presence of Jeff Goldblum.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Etsy
America realizes it needs to give France a gift in return for the Statue of Liberty, uses Etsy to send a giant cheese board. Sounds cute, and it is.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Kia
Dad of the year uses his Kia EV9 to light a pop-up ice rink so a young figure skater can perform for her ailing grandfather. (Or at least that's what it looks like.) High-horsepower tear-jerker.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Coors
The Coors Light train roars across the country to salvage an awkward big-game party. Forward momentum and an amusing five-second LL Cool J cameo.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Volkswagen
The American dream as lived by an immigrant named the Beetle, from 1949 to the present, set to "I Am ... I Said." Herbie goes to Ellis Island.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Doritos
A pair of abuelas named Dina and Mita go into avenger mode when a young guy grabs the last bag of Dinamita chips. Comic action with a brief appearance by Jenna Ortega.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Verizon
Beyoncé, with the help of Tony Hale (in "Veep" mode), tries to break the internet as a saxophonist, cyborg, Barbie, astronaut and Botus. Sorry, BeyHive, but self-referential does not equal super.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Microsoft
Everyday people contemplate the differences that the Copilot A.I. assistant could make in their lives. Evocative and (intentionally?) a little eerie.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
STōK Cold Brew
Anthony Hopkins lampoons his own gravitas to sell cold brew coffee as well as promote the Wrexham soccer club. Sir Anthony is in good form but his 2016 spot for TurboTax was funnier.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Inoffensive but Forgettable
They tried. Nobody got hurt.
T-Mobile
Zach Braff and Donald Faison of "Scrubs" join Jason Momoa for a "Flashdance"-inspired musical ode to cutting the cord. Lively, though is this something anyone still needs to be told? (The first T-Mobile spot, with celebrities doing goofy auditions, was more pedestrian.)
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Pluto TV
A farm grows human couch potatoes who are irrigated with constant streams of their favorite programming. This elaborately staged comic-dystopian scenario is awfully close for comfort.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
'IF'
Randall Park pretends to be John Krasinski in a promo, inspired by a similar gag in "The Office," for Krasinski's imaginary-friend film "IF." Park spars amusingly with Ryan Reynolds but yes, every movie trailer really is too long.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
State Farm
As the movie hero Agent State Farm, Arnold Schwarzenegger sends up his film persona and his actual accent. Schwarzenegger is charming but the joke runs thin faaaast.

Nerds
Candies joyfully dance before being popped into the mouth of the influencer Addison Rae. Nothing much to it, but watching a big gummy pirouette to "Flashdance ... What a Feeling" is just a little bit mesmerizing.

Budweiser
The Clydesdales come out of retirement to pull a wagon of beer through the snow. Artful nostalgia, though who thought "The Weight" was an appropriate anthem for beer delivery?

A sporty young woman runs through lovely mountain landscapes. The clothes won't make the rest of us look that good.
Dove
Young female athletes take pratfalls across a variety of sports in what turns out to be a public service announcement for body positivity. Engaging but not quite coherent.

Try Again
Had some talent involved but the result sailed wide right.
Booking.com
Tina Fey's former castmates from "30 Rock" play variations of her to demonstrate that you can be anyone you want on vacation. Funny people trapped in a moldy premise.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]

The rapper Ice Spice, hanging out at the club with PepsiCo.'s Starry, is ambushed by her ex, a generic lemon-lime soda. It's a blandly cute scenario with a twist of horror.

CeraVe
The fictitious outing of Michael Cera as the mastermind behind the similarly spelled cosmetics line continues in a sendup of dreamy, narcissistic designer-brand commercials. Could have used an exfoliator.

R.F.K. Jr. Apologizes to Family for Super PAC's TV Ad: [National Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Mr. Kennedy had faced blowback over a $ 7 million ad run by his super PAC that closely resembled a spot supporting his uncle, John F. Kennedy, in his 1960 bid for the White House.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. apologized on Sunday night after a well-funded super PAC backing his independent presidential campaign ran an ad during the Super Bowl that closely resembled a spot supporting John F. Kennedy, his uncle, during his 1960 bid for the White House.
The ad, which the super PAC's co-founder said cost $ 7 million, featured the same jingle and the same cheerful cartoons interspersed with candid photographs of the candidate, into which the younger Mr. Kennedy's face was superimposed.
Some of Mr. Kennedy's family members, many of whom have denounced him because of his promotion of unsubstantiated theories about vaccines and other matters, quickly criticized him over the ad.
Bobby Shriver, a nephew of John F. Kennedy, said on X: "My cousin's Super Bowl ad used our uncle's faces -- and my Mother's. She would be appalled by his deadly health care views. Respect for science, vaccines, & health care equity were in her DNA." His brother Mark Shriver wrote that he agreed.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself, who has invoked his storied political family and its legacy throughout his candidacy, soon responded.
"I'm so sorry if the Super Bowl advertisement caused anyone in my family pain," he wrote on X on Sunday night. "The ad was created and aired by the American Values Super PAC without any involvement or approval from my campaign. F.E.C. rules prohibit Super PACs from consulting with me or my staff. I love you all. God bless you."
Separately, the Democratic National Committee filed a complaint on Friday accusing him and the super PAC of illegal coordination.
Mr. Kennedy is running for president as an independent, having left the Democratic Party in October, arguing that the Democratic primary system was rigged against him. His candidacy has worried many Democrats who fear that Mr. Kennedy -- an environmental lawyer who has become a prominent purveyor of conspiracy theories -- could siphon votes away from President Biden.
The super PAC has heightened suspicions about Mr. Kennedy's base of support. A substantial portion of the PAC's funding, about $ 15 million, came from Timothy Mellon, a Republican who has also given $ 10 million to a super PAC backing former President Donald J. Trump.
"It's fitting that the first national ad promoting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s candidacy was bought and paid for by Donald Trump's largest donor this cycle," said Alex Floyd, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. "R.F.K. Jr. is nothing more than a Trump stalking horse in this race."
Super Bowl ads are often heavy on nostalgia. Commercials on Sunday night featured vintage Volkswagen footage, a "Scrubs" reunion, and Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in Boston.
But the Kennedy ad -- which took about 36 hours to produce, according to the super PAC's co-founder, Tony Lyons -- hit a different note. While John F. Kennedy was running in 1960 as a 43-year-old Democrat, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is 70 years old and running as an independent -- a self-described spoiler. (Despite Mr. Kennedy's age, the ad still portrays him as youthful and athletic, including a shot of him on skis.)
Mr. Kennedy has repeatedly faced blowback from his family over his views.
In July, the former president's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, posted a video calling Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s campaign "an embarrassment," saying he was "trading in on Camelot, celebrity conspiracy theories and conflict for personal gain and fame."
The Super Bowl ad received a mixed reception on the social media platform X. Ben Shapiro, a right-wing writer, called it "shockingly politically astute."
Robert Shrum, a longtime Democratic political consultant who worked with former Senator Edward M. Kennedy, wrote: "This RFK Jr. Super Bowl ad is a straight out plagiarism of JFK ad from 1960. What a fraud -- and to quote Lloyd Bentsen with a slight amendment: 'Bobby, you're no John Kennedy.' Instead you are a Trump ally."

How China Built BYD, Its Tesla Killer

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
SHENZHEN, China — China’s BYD was a battery manufacturer trying its hand at building cars when it showed off its newest model in 2007. American executives at the Guangzhou auto show gaped at the car’s uneven purple paint job and the poor fit of its doors.
“They were the laughingstock of the industry,” said Michael Dunne, a China auto industry analyst.
Nobody is laughing at BYD now.
The company passed Tesla in worldwide sales of fully electric cars late last year. BYD is building assembly lines in Brazil, Hungary, Thailand and Uzbekistan and preparing to do so in Indonesia and Mexico. It is rapidly expanding exports to Europe. And the company is on the cusp of passing Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi, as the market leader in China.
BYD’s sales, over 80% of them in China, have grown by about 1 million cars in each of the past two years. The last automaker to accomplish that in even one year in the American market was General Motors — and that was in 1946, after GM had suspended passenger car sales during the four preceding years because of World War II.
“BYD’s growth is unlike anything the industry has seen in many decades,” said Matt Anderson, curator of transportation at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.
Based in Shenzhen, the hub of China’s electronics industry, BYD has shown how Chinese carmakers can tap the country’s dominance of electrical products. No company has benefited as much from China’s embrace of battery-electric cars and plug-in gasoline-electric cars. These vehicles together make up 40% of China’s car market, the world’s largest, and are expected to be more than half next year. Like most Chinese automakers, BYD doesn’t sell its cars in America because Donald Trump-era tariffs remain in place, but BYD does sell buses in the United States.
BYD is leading China’s export push in electric cars, and is rapidly building the world’s largest car carrier ships to transport them. The first of the ships, the BYD Explorer No. 1, is on its maiden voyage from Shenzhen with 5,000 electric cars on board, and is expected to arrive in the Netherlands by Feb. 21.
With China’s and BYD’s success has come more scrutiny.
Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, warned about the strength of Chinese electric car exports in a company earnings call in January. “Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other companies in the world,” he said.
The rapid gains by BYD and other Chinese automakers in Europe have prompted a European Union investigation of Chinese government subsidies and could result in tariffs. BYD’s annual reports show a total of $2.6 billion in government assistance from 2008 through 2022. And that does not include other help, like making sure that taxi companies in BYD’s hometown buy only BYD electric cars.
BYD declined to comment about subsidies. In a statement, the company said the BYD Explorer No. 1, its new ship, “signifies a significant milestone for BYD as it expands into international markets and contributes to the development of the global new-energy vehicle industry.”
China has built enough factories to make more than twice as many cars as its market can buy. That has led to a price war in China, particularly between BYD and Tesla, with discounting that has inflicted heavy losses. One of BYD’s newest models, the subcompact Seagull, starts at less than $11,000.
A real estate crisis and a falling stock market are now making Chinese consumers warier about buying a car at all. But BYD’s low manufacturing costs have left it in a better position than most rivals to survive any long slowdown in sales and industry shakeout.
BYD’s chair, Wang Chuanfu, founded the company in 1995 to make batteries for Motorola and other consumer electronics companies. He had studied at Central South University in Changsha, an elite institution famed for battery chemistry research. But he dreamed of making cars.
In 2003, BYD bought a factory in Xi’an that was building gasoline-powered cars. But the company had trouble at the start, gaining an early reputation for building clunkers. In a visit to the factory in 2006, a large repair area at the end of the assembly line was clogged with newly built cars that already needed more work.
BYD’s sales grew as the Chinese market soared. Warren Buffett bought a nearly 10% stake for $230 million in 2008, giving BYD not just a cash infusion but also global cachet. The same year, Wang promised to start exporting battery-electric cars to the United States within two years.
But electric cars at the time cost a lot to build and had limited range, and Wang had to scotch his plans to enter the American market. In an interview in 2011, he second-guessed his emphasis on battery-electric cars. Automakers should focus on gasoline-electric hybrids, he declared. He added, “There is still tremendous potential in the Chinese market for electric cars.”
By 2012, car production in China had caught up with demand. Buyers became choosier. BYD’s car sales and stock price plunged as multinationals offered more stylish models. Industry executives and analysts questioned whether BYD had a future.
But Wang proceeded to make two risky bets that paid off.
In 2016, he hired Wolfgang Egger, a prominent Audi designer, who in turn hired hundreds more car engineers with bold tastes. They completely redesigned BYD’s models.
Wang also figured out how to replace the industry’s standard chemicals in rechargeable lithium batteries — nickel, cobalt and manganese — with cheaper iron and phosphate. But early batteries made from the inexpensive chemical compounds ran out of juice quickly and had to be recharged after even short trips.
In 2020, BYD introduced its Blade batteries, which closed most of the so-called range gap with nickel-cobalt batteries at a fraction of what they cost.
Tesla began making and selling large numbers of cars in China the same year, and enthusiasm for electric cars swept the nation. BYD was ready with inexpensive battery chemistries and Egger’s new designs.
Tesla also began using lithium iron phosphate batteries in less expensive models. BYD still sells mostly cheaper cars with lower range, while Tesla mostly sells costlier cars with more range.
The Swiss bank UBS found last year that a BYD Seal electric hatchback sedan cost 35% less to make than a slightly smaller Volkswagen ID.3 of similar quality made in Europe. The savings came only partly from the cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries.
BYD makes three-quarters of the Seal’s parts. Like Tesla, BYD uses only a few electronic systems in each car. By contrast, VW outsources up to two-thirds of its components. BYD also has benefited from lower labor costs in China, although those have risen as factories compete to hire skilled workers.
BYD now has its own walled town in Shenzhen, a southeastern city next to Hong Kong. An airport-style monorail carries workers from 18-story company apartments to BYD’s office towers and research labs.
Liu Qiangqiang, an engineer at the Shenzhen center, said the staff of his car development team had almost tripled since he joined the company from GMs 15 months ago.
“The pace is fast,” he said.
After dismissing autonomous driving a year ago, BYD swung into action when the consumer electronics companies Huawei and Xiaomi introduced cars with considerable autonomous driving abilities. Wang announced in January that BYD had 4,000 engineers working on assisted driving, a limited form of autonomous technology that works mainly on highways and large roads, and would invest $14 billion in the technology.
BYD has a lingering advantage over Tesla: Wang’s decision by 2011 to develop plug-in hybrid cars, which account for nearly half of BYD’s sales.
Li Jingyu, a salesperson at a BYD dealership in Shenzhen, said many families bought a hybrid as their first car so they could drive at Lunar New Year back to their ancestral villages. Most villages in China now have chargers, Li said, but not enough for the throngs of visiting drivers at Lunar New Year, which started Friday night.
“People are just worried,” he said, “about the waiting time.”

Full text: Hefei has led the country in making electric vehicles and other tech products, but it still has not escaped a nationwide housing crisis.
Ultramodern factories churn out electric cars and solar panels in Hefei, an industrial center in the heart of central China. Broad avenues link office towers and landscaped parks. Subway lines open at a brisk pace.
Yet at Hefei's market for construction materials, which fills 10 city blocks, local merchants are gloomy. Wu Junlin, a vendor of doors, has closed two of his three stores and laid off all but one of his dozen employees.
"I have been doing this for 20 years -- after all these years, this year is the worst," he said, sitting in his last store with no customers in sight.
Nowhere better showcases the opportunities and vulnerabilities of China's economy than Hefei.
Government-directed growth in industries like electric vehicles and solar panels has turned China into the world's export superpower, making Hefei a model for other Chinese cities. But a nationwide decline in real estate has devastated the finances of millions of families and small businesses -- including in Hefei.
Hefei and nearby towns have become an E.V. manufacturing hub, with overall car production nearly tripling since 2019 and now exceeding Michigan's. Hefei's industrial policies have been so successful in nurturing technology manufacturers that the country's central government has embraced tenets of what is known as the Hefei model.
Now so many cities are subsidizing electric vehicle factories that the industry faces severe overcapacity and heavy losses.
"Some localities and enterprises are still blindly launching and duplicating new energy vehicle projects -- these require our great attention, and effective measures should be taken to solve them," Xin Guobin, a vice minister at China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said at a news briefing last week.
The Hefei model consists of using government money to buy newly issued shares in manufacturers and start-ups that need cash. Officials also arrange loans with attractive interest rates from state-controlled banks to finance new factories.
Over two decades, Hefei has been transformed by the municipal government's bets on companies like BOE Technology Group, a flat-panel display manufacturer, and Nio, a maker of electric cars. When Nio nearly ran out of cash in 2020, the Hefei government injected $ 1 billion for a 24 percent stake and state-controlled lenders pumped in another $ 1.6 billion.
A provincial capital in a previously impoverished farming area, Hefei has leaped up the income rankings of Chinese cities. Local government cadres, urban economists and institutional investors visit Hefei to study its methods.
Hefei has an $ 86 billion municipal holding company that has put money into struggling but technologically advanced companies. The holding company, the fourth largest of its kind in China, buys company shares on the cheap when few other investors want them.
These companies sometimes recover, as BOE Technology and Nio did after Hefei's investments. The city then provides incentives for these companies' suppliers and customers to relocate to Hefei as well, said Li Bo, an assistant professor at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University.
"Hefei has a clear understanding of local industries -- the government-led investment fund is tailored to companies' needs," she said.
Hefei sits atop several industrial supply chains. A fifth of the world's liquid crystal displays for consumer electronics are made in Hefei. So are many Lenovo laptop and notebook computers. Hefei produces a tenth of China's home appliances. The city government has provided $ 2 billion of the $ 2.5 billion needed to build China's first factories for an advanced kind of computer memory chips.
Hefei's output of electric cars quadrupled last year, and that will soar further this year as Volkswagen ramps up production at a giant new factory. An electric car battery manufacturer partly owned by VW, the Gotion High-tech Company, has also built a factory in Hefei.
Other Chinese carmakers are following. BYD, which is vying with Tesla to be the world's largest maker of electric cars, has nearly completed a $ 5.6 billion factory complex with a planned capacity of 1.3 million cars a year.
Hefei owes much of its success to a top engineering university, in much the same way that Carnegie Mellon University has fostered the tech renaissance of Pittsburgh. Most of China's top universities are in Beijing or Shanghai. But leaders at the University of Science and Technology of China relocated the institution from Beijing during the chaos of Mao's Cultural Revolution, and it ended up in relatively tranquil Hefei in 1970.
In 2005, a new municipal leader in Hefei, Sun Jinlong, pioneered the city's focus on tech manufacturing. BOE Technology was mainly in Beijing then but struggling financially. The city persuaded the company to build factories in Hefei, offering more than $ 1 billion in investment and loans.
BOE Technology's later company statements show that from 2011 through 2016, it collected another $ 250 million in direct subsidies from the city. BOE Technology is now one of the world's largest makers of flat-panel displays.
Hefei had a powerful ally in promoting its success. Li Keqiang, China's second-highest official and premier until his retirement nearly a year ago, grew up in Hefei.
During a trip to the city in 2015, Mr. Li promoted his "Made in China 2025" plan. That plan called for replacing many imported advanced manufactured goods with Chinese production by 2025, using industrial policies that echoed Hefei's. Mr. Li died in October.
Hefei still faces challenges. Automakers have had trouble persuading executives and engineers to leave the glitter of Shanghai or Beijing for quieter lives in Hefei, despite the low cost of living. BOE Technology has kept its headquarters in Beijing.
But Hefei's biggest problem lies in housing.
Until China's housing crisis reached Hefei two years ago, construction and real estate development were slightly bigger than manufacturing in the city. Apartment buildings, office towers and hotels loom over small farms left from the city's recent agricultural past.
That dependence on construction is hurting Hefei now.
According to the China Index Academy, a property market data provider, the number of new apartments sold each month in Hefei has plummeted. By November, sales were down 45 percent from a year earlier.
The nosedive in sales is crippling the ability of debt-laden real estate developers to finance new projects. The total floor area of new projects last year plummeted 57 percent from 2022.
As developers run out of money, they buy fewer land leases from the government. Sales of these leases, the cornerstone of local government budgets in China, typically cover half of Hefei's municipal spending. Lease sales fell 38 percent in Hefei last year, imperiling government programs.
Small businesses say that the local government, previously a big customer, has stopped placing orders.
"The government is out of money -- emptied out," said Tao Yingcheng, the owner of a flooring business in Hefei.
Some local workers also complain that they lack the skills to compete for jobs. Companies like Nio and Volkswagen rely increasingly on robots and other automation tools, and hire graduates from the best universities elsewhere.
"The current employment environment is not very good," said Xu Mingyi, a Hefei resident who studied computer programming and still has not been able to find work in his field. He is working instead as a ride-hail driver. "These companies in Hefei need talents such that ordinary people hardly meet the requirements."

Heavy Truck Makers Push for Electric Vehicle Chargers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Daimler, Navistar and Volvo have been criticized for not selling many electric heavy trucks, but the companies say the country first needs many more chargers.
There are more than four million electric vehicles on American roads, but fewer than 1,000 of them are heavy-duty trucks. On Tuesday, the three largest truck makers announced a push to remedy that deficit by calling on governments and utilities to help them build many more places to charge big rigs.
Daimler Truck, which owns Freightliner; Navistar, which is controlled by Volkswagen; and Volvo Group North America have formed an association to push for chargers, improvements to the electricity grid and other measures they say are needed to promote battery- or hydrogen-powered trucks.
The new organization, Powering America's Commercial Transportation, will be based in Washington and also be open to suppliers, nonprofit organizations and other groups.
The companies' decision to work together underscores the degree to which the transition away from fossil fuels is dependent on government support and decisions made in Washington and state capitols. The Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed in 2022, provides $ 1 billion for electric trucks, including tax credits of up to $ 40,000 for companies that buy them, as well as subsidies for charging infrastructure.
But officials are just beginning to distribute the money, and the truck companies complain that they have gotten less attention from federal and state governments than makers of cars.
"There's a lot of funding that's available out there from the federal government," said Dawn Fenton, vice president of government relations and public affairs at Volvo Group North America, which owns Volvo Trucks and Mack Trucks. "There's been little so far focused on the heavy-duty charging infrastructure."
Only nine fast charging stations in the United States are capable of serving heavy trucks, according to data from the Department of Energy.
Transportation is the biggest source of greenhouse gases in the United States, and trucks, buses and vans account for 29 percent of vehicle emissions, according to Calstart, a nonprofit group whose members work in industry as well as government. Poorer communities tend to suffer the most from truck pollution because they are more likely to be near industrial zones or highways.
Eliminating those emissions is difficult. An electric truck requires a big, heavy battery that reduces how much stuff the vehicle can haul.
Zero-emissions trucks are also two or three times more expensive than diesel trucks, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, although prices are expected to drop as companies increase production.
The truck makers say they are committed to selling emission-free vehicles, but environmental groups have accused them of trying to block policies that would force the industry to move faster.
This month, the Sierra Club, along with 40 other advocacy groups, sent letters to the chief executives of Daimler Truck and Volvo Group accusing them of trying to stymie stricter emissions standards. In comments on proposed regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency, both truck makers have lobbied for a slower introduction of new standards.
In the letter to Volvo Group's chief executive, Martin Lundstedt, the group wrote, "Volvo Trucks U.S.A. must focus its efforts and resources on electrifying the transportation sector now, especially in the communities most impacted by truck emissions, instead of fighting policies needed to move the whole system faster." The groups sent a similar letter to Martin Daum, the chief executive of Daimler Truck.
(Volvo Group is not part of Volvo Car and Daimler Truck is separate from Mercedes-Benz.)
Truck makers face less competitive pressure than car companies. In the car business, Tesla has won over customers who previously drove cars made by Mercedes, General Motors and Volkswagen, forcing those companies to respond. The Tesla Model Y sport utility vehicle was the best-selling passenger car of any kind worldwide in 2023, according to JATO Dynamics, a market research firm.
No upstart truck maker has had comparable impact. Tesla has developed a long-haul electric truck called the Semi, but the company has not begun selling it in large numbers.
"We would have moved faster over the last five years if there was a zero emission truck company taking the lead," said Katherine García, director of a Sierra Club program that promotes clean transportation.
Nikola once aimed to be the Tesla of the truck industry, but it has struggled since its founder, Trevor Milton, was accused of defrauding investors by lying about the abilities of the company's technology. Mr. Milton was sentenced in December to four years in prison after a jury convicted him. He denies wrongdoing and is appealing. Nikola, under new management, shipped 79 vehicles in the first nine months of 2023, the most recent figures the company has disclosed.
The truck makers argue that they can't be expected to sell battery-powered trucks when there are hardly any places to charge them. Electric trucks require extremely powerful chargers and, as a result, bigger connections to the electrical grid than are readily available. Many utilities have to upgrade old distribution lines, transformers and other equipment to be able to deliver the energy needed to refuel multiple trucks simultaneously.
Brien Sheahan, head of government relations and regulatory affairs at Navistar, said one customer had ordered a fleet of electric trucks and installed 20 chargers at its depot. But, he said, "they couldn't get it energized by the utility."
Shortcomings in the electrical grid are "going to be a constraint on our ability to scale the industry," said Mr. Sheahan, a former chairman and chief executive of the Illinois Commerce Commission, which regulates electric utilities.
Ms. García of the Sierra Club said that, despite slow progress so far, she was optimistic. She noted that sales of electric delivery vans and other smaller trucks were growing quickly, in part because California and other states are compelling manufacturers to reduce emissions and providing incentives for truck buyers.
Delivery vans, like those used by Amazon, require less energy and typically drive relatively short routes. As a result, those vehicles can be charged overnight on less powerful chargers than those needed for heavy trucks.
"The market is really moving quickly," Ms. García said. "We're at the point where it is really going to accelerate."

Tesla Price Cuts Take Toll On Profits From Car Sales In Fierce E.V. Competition: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A tax benefit boosted quarterly earnings, but that masked a decline in earnings from carmaking caused by intensifying competition.
Tesla's profit from sales of electric cars slumped in the last three months of last year because of price cuts intended to thwart increasingly intense competition, the company said on Wednesday as it warned of a tough year ahead.
Profit in the fourth quarter nearly doubled to $ 7.9 billion, up from $ 3.7 billion a year earlier. But $ 5.9 billion of that profit came from a tax benefit. Without that one-time accounting effect, profit would have fallen.
Tesla has slashed prices for the two cars that make up the bulk of its sales -- the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y sport utility vehicle -- as automakers like BYD, in China, and General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and Volkswagen, in the United States and Europe, have begun selling more electric vehicles.
The price cuts have helped Tesla sell more cars and forced other carmakers to respond, helping to make electric vehicles more affordable. But the cuts have weighed on Tesla's profit. In 2022, Tesla was one of the most profitable carmakers in the world, but its margins from vehicle sales have fallen by almost one-third in the last year and are now comparable to those of other large rivals.
Because of the price cuts, sales revenue from cars last quarter rose just 1 percent from a year earlier, to $ 21.6 billion -- even though Tesla sold 1.8 million cars in 2023, a 35 percent increase from 2022. Tesla made up some of the difference by reducing manufacturing costs.
Tesla shares slumped about 6 percent in after-hours trading after the company said it expected sales growth to be "notably slower" in 2024 as it developed a budget-priced vehicle. Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, said during a conference call Wednesday that the vehicle, whose design is still a secret, might be available by late 2025.
"That will be a challenge," he cautioned, because of new technology being developed to manufacture the car at a lower cost.
At Wednesday's close, Tesla stock was 17 percent below where it started the year and down more than 25 percent from its 12-month high in July.
The carmaker faces an array of challenges this year, including economic uncertainty in all of its major markets and questions about the future role of Mr. Musk. He surprised investors this month when he said on X, the social media site he owns, that he wanted the Tesla board to raise his stake in the company to 25 percent, from 13 percent, effectively giving him shares worth more than $ 80 billion.
If he doesn't get his wish, Mr. Musk said, he will develop new artificial intelligence products "outside of Tesla." Tesla's board has not responded publicly.
Mr. Musk said Wednesday that he needed 25 percent to protect him from being ousted "by some sort of random shareholder advisory firm." He added, "There's a lot of activists that basically infiltrate those organizations and have, you know, strange ideas about what should be done."
Mr. Musk did not clarify how Tesla's board could grant him a stake worth $ 80 billion without diluting the value of Tesla shares.
The automaker commands more than half the electric vehicle market in the United States, and it has more models than any other manufacturer that qualify for $ 7,500 tax credits under rules that took effect Jan. 1. Plummeting prices for lithium, cobalt and other materials essential to battery production should help lower manufacturing costs.
Tesla has begun selling the Cybertruck, a pickup that is the company's first new model since the Model Y in 2020. But Tesla remains dependent on the Model 3 and Model Y for sales. BYD and Volkswagen, along with its Audi, Porsche and Skoda brands, offer larger selections of vehicles.
Tesla said Wednesday that the cost of ramping up production of the Cybertruck had weighed on profit, and that it would take longer than usual to produce the vehicle in large volumes because of a complex manufacturing process. The truck's body is made of stainless steel, which resists rust and is more durable than the steel used in most cars, but is also harder to shape and weld.
Slowing sales growth for electric vehicles is another challenge. Surveys show that many people are interested in electric vehicles but hesitant to buy because of high prices and concern about finding enough places to charge the cars.
In a setback, Hertz said this month that it would sell some of its fleet of Teslas because they were less profitable than expected, and because some customers struggled with the unfamiliar technology.
Election-year politics add another element of uncertainty for all electric vehicle makers. Former President Donald J. Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, has called electric vehicles a hoax, and his supporters have vowed to roll back Biden administration policies intended to promote the cars and encourage domestic manufacturing.
Senator John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming who has endorsed Mr. Trump, recently portrayed electric vehicles as a subsidy for rich liberals at the expense of "hardworking families in my home state."

Full text: Automakers like Ford, Kia and Toyota are offering more hybrid options to appeal to buyers who aren't ready for fully electric vehicles.
As Teslas and other electric vehicles dazzled car buyers with futuristic technology and dreams of a gasoline-free future, hybrid cars began to seem like yesterday's news. Sales of the Toyota Prius, the standard-bearer for hybrids, fell 85 percent over a decade.
Now, a slowdown in the growth of electric car sales has led General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen to walk back ambitious targets for those vehicles. And sales of hybrids are robust, underscoring what may be the enduring reality check of 2023: Many Americans are hugely receptive to electrification, but they're not ready for a fully electric car.
"Consumers want the same experience they've had" with a combustion engine car, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive. "And we are not there yet. Price is still the top barrier for most consumers."
Americans bought a record 1.2 million electric vehicles last year, a gain of about 46 percent and a 7.6 percent share of all new car sales, according to Cox. But hybrid sales rose even faster, up 65 percent to more than 1.2 million, lifting their market share to 8 percent from 5.5 percent, according to Edmunds. Throw in plug-in hybrids, and nearly one in 10 new cars pairs a gasoline engine with electric motors to save fuel and boost performance.
Analysts say stubbornly high electric car prices and worries about public charging are pushing some car shoppers to hybrids, including renters or urbanites who can't charge a battery-powered car at home. Hybrids deliver savings at the pump with no need to plug in for hours or plan trips around charging stops. Their batteries are much smaller and cost a lot less than the batteries in fully electric vehicles.
Buyers paid about $ 42,500 on average for hybrids in November, according to Edmunds, compared with $ 60,500 for electric vehicles and $ 47,500 for a conventional models. There is a smorgasbord of affordable hybrid models, many starting around $ 30,000 -- including a stylishly redesigned Prius that returns a model-record 57 miles per gallon. The electric vehicle market, by contrast, remains top-heavy with luxury offerings.
Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive, said mainstream consumers were fundamentally different from early adopters who flocked to electric vehicles with little encouragement or education from automakers.
"E.V.s continue to grow with spectacular numbers, but what's changing is that people buying them are not willing to pay a premium," Mr. Farley said in an interview. "Now we have to get costs under control and even -- surprise, surprise -- advertise."
Ford is trimming its planned production of the F-150 Lightning pickup truck and increasing output of the more-affordable F-150 Hybrid by 20 percent. The automaker plans to quadruple overall hybrid production in hopes of selling 100,000 this year. They include the red-hot Maverick compact pickup, whose 37-m.p.g. hybrid version has exceeded Ford's most optimistic sales forecasts.
So why doesn't Ford make all Mavericks hybrids? Mr. Farley said the company remained committed to offering a full range of powertrains, including electrified trucks that can double as mobile generators to power equipment, homes or even the electrical grid. Securing battery supplies also takes a long time, Mr. Farley said, sometimes longer than building a new assembly line.
"We didn't know a $ 30,000 truck would be this popular," he said of the Maverick. "Ford has struggled to make money on small cars since the beginning of time."
The hybrid resurgence is mainly benefiting Toyota, Honda and Hyundai Motor, including its Kia sister brand.
Those automakers account for roughly 90 percent of U.S. hybrid sales, followed by Ford. All continue to invest in the technology even as G.M., Volkswagen and other automakers vow to pivot entirely to electric vehicles.
Honda outdid itself in 2023, nearly tripling hybrid sales to 294,000 units. Hybrid versions of the Honda Accord sedan and the CR-V sport utility vehicle now account for more than half those models' sales. That Accord combines luxury-level comfort, quality and amenities with up to 44 m.p.g. in overall driving, for $ 33,290 to start.
En route to record U.S. sales in 2023, Hyundai, Kia and their Genesis luxury brand together sold more electric vehicles in the United States than any automaker save Tesla. Yet Hyundai Motor remains bullish on hybrids, even after the Biden administration proposed regulations that would require two-thirds of new cars to be fully electric by 2032.
"Anyone who wants to survive in this business is making these electric investments," said Steve Center, chief operating officer at Kia America. That includes Hyundai, which has committed to investing $ 12 billion in factories in Alabama and Georgia.
But Mr. Center added that an electric vehicle might not serve the needs of a "cowboy in Montana with a pickup truck." Hybrids can help reduce emissions from those kinds of vehicles faster, he said.
Mr. Center offered a bold prediction: As combustion engine cars fade into obsolescence, all remaining gasoline models will adopt electrification in hybrid form. Gasoline cars won't be able to compete without it, as consumers and regulators alike demand better fuel economy and reduced emissions.
"Everything should be hybrid to start with, because everyone can drive a hybrid, everywhere," he said.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker, seems to be treading that path. Within a few months, Toyota will offer nine hybrid-only models, including one from its Lexus luxury brand. The company sold more than 640,000 hybrids in America last year, 29 percent of its total U.S. sales; it sold about 15,000 fully electric vehicles.
David Christ, general manager of Toyota's North American division, said the automaker expects to crack 40 percent electrified sales in 2024. He echoed Mr. Center's view on the prospects for combustion engine cars.
"Over time, we're not opposed to going all-hybrid to make a faster step to a greener future," Mr. Christ said.
Toyota's faith in democratizing hybrid technology turned the company, once an environmental darling, into a whipping boy as it was widely accused of foot-dragging over electric vehicles. If Toyota is feeling vindicated, Mr. Christ won't admit it.
"A year ago, we were getting roasted in the media for not being an E.V. believer," he said. "We thought that was unfair, that we weren't in on electrification. We started it. We have eight million hybrids on the road today, and every one reduces greenhouse gas emissions."
But Mr. Christ added that the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles was not yet ready for many millions of battery-powered cars, which is why sales of such vehicles have slowed.
"At the end of the day, the consumer drives this industry, not the manufacturer," he said.
Toyota will plant its biggest flag yet in June. The redesigned 2025 Camry will be offered only as a hybrid. That may seem to be a major gamble for the nation's perennially best-selling sedan. Toyota sold about 290,000 Camrys last year, and just 35,000 were hybrids. If the new Camry can maintain its sales, Toyota will convert a few hundred thousand buyers to a roughly 50-m.p.g. hybrid in one swoop. If not, the Camry franchise will take a huge hit.
Yet Toyota isn't taking a shot in the dark. When Toyota switched the Sienna to an all-hybrid lineup for the 2021 model year, it immediately became America's best-selling minivan, up from fourth place.
But some auto experts said hybrids could do only so much.
Dave Cooke, senior vehicles analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said hybrids were a critical, affordable tool that allowed millions of drivers to use less gasoline but remained a transition technology. Long-term climate change goals still demand a shift to electric vehicles powered by a renewable energy grid, he said.
"In our comments to the E.P.A. and industry, it's 'Hey, put a hybrid on everything,"' Mr. Cooke said, referring to the Environmental Protection Agency. "But we still need stricter standards to ensure automakers face rules on what's technologically achievable."
Mr. Cooke noted that the fuel economy of the nation's fleet had held flat for years, in part because of the shift to pickups and S.U.V.s. Recent gains are entirely attributable to the rise of electric vehicles, with hybrids playing a negligible role.
Chris Harto, transportation and energy policy analyst for Consumer Reports, agreed with that assessment. "Hybrids buy some time, but E.V.s are where we need to go" to achieve climate goals, he said.
Yet Mr. Harto bemoans the popular narrative that pits hybrids and electric vehicles against each other.
"They're both taking market share from less efficient I.C.E. vehicles," Mr. Harto said, referring to internal combustion engines. "And there's a lot of market share to take."

Hertz Is Selling Some of Its EVs After a Price Cut: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The rental car company blamed the sharp drop in the value of electric vehicles and higher repair costs for its decision to sell 20,000 cars.
The rental car company Hertz will be selling about one-third of the electric vehicles in its fleet after they lost value more quickly than expected, the company said on Thursday. The drop in value is a blow to the company's efforts to replace gasoline vehicles with cars that do not produce tailpipe emissions.
The electric vehicles the company owned were also more likely to be involved in collisions, Hertz said, and they proved costly to repair. The company said it planned to buy more gasoline-powered vehicles to replace the 20,000 battery-powered cars it was selling.
"Certain of these E.V.s became uneconomical for us," Stephen Scherr, Hertz's chief executive, said in an interview on Thursday.
The company's decision to sell 20,000 vehicles, which Mr. Scherr blamed partly on "unprecedented" price cuts by Tesla that undercut the cars' resale value, provided fuel for opponents of Biden administration policies to promote the technology as a tool to address climate change and air pollution.
Senator John Barrasso, a Republican from Wyoming, seized on the announcement during a hearing on Thursday on the climate policies.
Hertz's decision showed that electric vehicles are costly and unpopular, Mr. Barrasso told the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. "The demand for electric cars is stagnating," he said, adding, "So much for the Biden economy."
Mr. Scherr implicitly put much of the blame on Tesla, which makes about half of all electric vehicles sold in the United States, for the rental car company's decision to sell its electric vehicles.
Tesla vehicles, which make up the largest share of Hertz's electric fleet, plunged in value after the carmaker, which Elon Musk runs, cut prices last year by about 30 percent. When the price of new vehicles is drastically lowered, it drives down the value of used cars because buyers can get the newer versions for less.
As a result, Hertz was forced to write down the value of its electric cars more quickly than it had expected, which weighed on profit, Mr. Scherr said.
Rental companies like Hertz estimate how much their cars will be worth when they eventually sell them, and that estimated decline in value is calculated as a cost. If the decline is more than expected, profit falls.
Mr. Scherr said Tesla was less willing than other carmakers to give Hertz volume discounts on replacement parts. "Tesla is new to the game," he said, suggesting that the electric car company's relative inexperience in serving rental car companies played a role in that decision.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Hertz's plan is at least a temporary reversal for the company, which in 2021 had announced it would buy 100,000 Teslas as part of a broader effort to electrify its rental fleet.
But the agreement did not set a deadline for Hertz to buy the cars, and the company has purchased only a fraction of that number. Hertz also offers electric vehicles by other manufacturers, including Kia, General Motors, Volkswagen and Polestar.
One potential reason the electric vehicles at Hertz were involved in more accidents, Mr. Scherr said, was that many people renting those cars did not have experience with the technology despite efforts by the company to educate customers. Electric cars accelerate more quickly than gasoline vehicles, and they are heavier. Demand for the vehicles was also less than the company had expected, Mr. Scherr continued.
Hertz's decision is likely to bolster the argument made by some conservatives, including former President Donald J. Trump, that electric vehicles have been overly hyped. "It will fuel the narrative on the negative side for E.V.s right now," said Jeremy Robb, senior director of economic and industry insights at Cox Automotive.
But Mr. Robb noted that electric vehicle sales in the United States totaled nearly 1.2 million last year, and were up 40 percent in the last three months of 2023 from the same period in 2022. "There is still a market for E.V.s," he said.
Hertz is not abandoning its plans to electrify its fleet or buy more Teslas, Mr. Scherr said. But, he said, the market needs to develop further.
"Tesla is among the best-selling cars in America," he said, "but it's not yet the best rental car." Mr. Scherr added: "Those two have not converged as quickly as many people, including ourselves, thought. But they will."

Peruvian Puzzler: The Case of the Doubtful Dinero: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Scientists recently analyzed a Peruvian 10-cent piece with an unexplained origin.
A decade ago, a funny money mystery fell into the hands of scientists and students at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru in Lima.
The university had been acquiring 19th- and 20th-century Peruvian coins from local dealers, and graduate students in the chemistry department were analyzing the pieces for their thesis work. But one coin, a 10-cent piece known as a dinero, stood out.
The dinero was marked "1899." The problem was that official records indicated no coins of that denomination were minted in Peru that year -- according to the people who made the money, the coin never existed.
Most international coin catalogs don't list 1899 dineros, said Luis Ortega, a chemist at the university. And in the rare cases that they do, there is often only a note of "counterfeit" with no further detail, Dr. Ortega said. "No one was able to provide more information about it."
Now Dr. Ortega and Fabiola Bravo Hualpa, a doctoral student, believe they have shed new light on the mystery of the coin that came from nowhere. In a paper published last year in the journal Heritage Science, they described how they subjected one of the two known 1899 dineros to a barrage of scientific analyses, illuminating its possible origins and the role it might have played during an unstable era of South American history.
To the naked eye, the 1899 coin resembles other dineros: It's silver in color and features the same coat of arms and seated woman that represents the goddess of liberty. And it's remarkably similar in size to other dineros minted around the turn of the 20th century -- about the dimensions of a U.S. dime.
But when Dr. Ortega and Ms. Bravo Hualpa bombarded the 1899 coin with X-rays and measured the light it re-emitted, they determined that the dinero was largely made of copper, zinc and nickel. This alloy is known as nickel silver. It's commonly used to make silverware and ornamental objects and has a silvery appearance, but it contains no silver. Genuine dineros produced by the Lima Mint, on the other hand, are roughly 90 percent silver.
Dr. Ortega and Ms. Bravo Hualpa also found that the 1899 dinero contained traces of iron, cobalt and lead. Those impurities imply that the coin was counterfeited long ago, not more recently, the researchers suggest. Such contaminants are characteristic of older alloys because of limitations in technology at the time. "The refining methods were not as good as they are now," Dr. Ortega said.
The presence of impurities, paired with the coin's worn faces, suggests that it was produced in the 19th or 20th centuries, the researchers concluded. But given that nickel silver wasn't widely used for coins or tokens in Peru at that time, it's likely that this coin was created abroad, the researchers suggest. Its producer might have therefore been wholly unaware that no dineros were officially minted in 1899.
"The counterfeiter probably didn't realize that that coin didn't exist," Dr. Ortega said.
He said that an influx of low-value coinage would have been welcomed in Peru at the dawn of the 20th century. The country's economy was reeling from the recent War of the Pacific, and the government was focusing on printing larger-denomination paper bank notes to pay off international loans; in 1899, the Lima Mint produced roughly one-tenth the number of silver coins it produced just five years earlier.
As a result, people in Peru were using coins from neighboring nations or even cutting their own country's coins in half to conduct small transactions. "Counterfeiters found a field of opportunity," Dr. Ortega said.
Dineros were low-denomination coins used by everyday people. Studying this coin, and the economic and political situation that prompted its creation, can therefore be illuminating. "If you want to study our society, you don't want to look at a Ferrari," said Laura Perucchetti, an archaeometallurgist at the British Museum in London, not involved in the research. "You want to look at a Volkswagen or a Ford."
Dr. Ortega is not finished studying counterfeit coins and their historical context. He plans to meet with a collector based in Lima who amassed an assortment of coins ostensibly minted from the 1830s through the 1960s. Another 1899 dinero has already surfaced in that collection, and he is on the lookout for more.
"There must be a few around," Dr. Ortega said.

Tesla Recalls Cars in China To Fix Self-Driving Systems: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The recall follows a similar move by the company in the United States to upgrade the cars' Autopilot feature.
The Chinese government announced on Friday that Tesla would recall practically all of the cars it has sold in the country to adjust their assisted-driving systems, less than a month after a similar recall in the United States.
To address the problems, Tesla will transmit updated computer software to its 1.6 million cars in China, the State Administration for Market Regulation said.
The updated software involves "adding additional automatic assisted steering control," the regulator said. It also said that Tesla would remind customers to pay attention to their driving and follow all regulations even if they use the so-called Autopilot capabilities.
Three weeks ago the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in Washington ordered a recall to make sure that drivers will remain attentive while using Autopilot.
While Tesla's autopilot system is designed for highway use, American regulators have been increasingly concerned that many drivers are using it on local roads, and are failing to keep their hands on the steering wheel.
China's regulator has in the past insisted that companies conduct the same recalls in China that they announce in other markets.
Tesla did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The recall marks a setback for Tesla as China has emerged as the world's largest and fastest-growing market for electric cars. More than a third of the cars sold last year in China were either battery-powered electric cars or plug-in hybrid gasoline-electric cars, up from only 5 percent three years earlier.
Tesla has shown itself as the only Western automaker that can compete with Chinese manufacturers in the global electric car sector.
Chinese electric car companies are rapidly increasing their share of the European market, prompting the European Union to begin investigating alleged Chinese government subsidies. General Motors and Ford in the United States have retrenched their ambitions in electric cars. And in China, longtime multinational leaders like Volkswagen have lost many of their customers to Chinese companies like BYD, Zhejiang Geely, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, Nio and Xiaopeng.
The mandatory software update ordered on Friday covers Model 3 and Model Y cars manufactured at Tesla's vast factory in Shanghai as well as imported Model S, Model X and Model 3 cars.
The Chinese regulator separately announced on Friday that Tesla would transmit updated computer software to 7,538 imported Model S and Model X electric cars to fix a programming difficulty that could cause door latches to unlock on the far side of the car from a collision.
For the door latch problem as well as the assisted-driving function, Tesla will offer free assistance to update the programming for any customers who find that their remote downloads are not working properly.

Prescient Environmental Posters Sound Alarm: [Correction]

Full text: Graphic artists have been helping call attention to climate change for decades, and a new exhibition charts the evolution of their pleas.
Last year was the warmest in recorded history. The graphic artists of the environmental movement tried to warn us. Their posters aimed to scare people straight with pictures of ecological ruin, or glorified nature, clean air and water, sunshine and verdure. Some offered earworm-y slogans and haunting visuals. Whatever their approach -- bright, witty, somber, blunt, even sexy -- they sought an image, a phrase, that could change enough minds to literally save the world.
Through Feb. 25, an exhibition at Poster House in Manhattan demonstrates these visual and rhetorical styles, and how they reflect the evolving movement's shifting strategies. There are 33 posters on view, along with dozens of postage stamps and a pair of socks by Vivienne Westwood.
Environmentalism began honing its voice in the 1970s, with roots in the counterculture and protests against the Vietnam War. Robert Rauschenberg designed the official poster for the first Earth Day, in 1970. In a deadpan appeal to patriotism, grim scenes of spoiled ecologies frame a bald eagle. The earliest work in the show, a call for clean water from 1961 by Hans Erni, features a ghastly skull in a drinking glass. The choice, the artists argued, was between peace and poison.
This is the environmental movement as a marketing problem. First, people must know about your product; then you must persuade them that they need it. Maybe a healthy planet seems like a self-evident good. "Give Earth a Chance," reads a 1970 poster by Milton Glaser; the big blue marble we all inhabit is drawn floating in a living room. As the Earth Days and global conclaves tick by on the posters, it starts to feel like consciousness-raising isn't enough. The posters' tones acidify. An austere illustration by Yen-chang Cheng & Hung-yu Chen from 2008 features a baby polar bear floating on its mother's corpse.
Flashes of optimism and calls to rally around children and animals characterize several examples from the 1980s, including a pro-tree poster by Eric Carle of "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" fame. In Rauschenberg's 1992 print for the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, an infant naps in a stroller. "I pledge to make the Earth a secure and hospitable home for present and future generations," it reads.
You also start to suspect counterforces at work -- what Vance Packard, a journalist critical of consumerism, called "hidden persuaders" in his 1957 book -- who could sell an anvil to someone drowning.
All the materials on view stem from sincere convictions -- or do they? On the back wall is a poster version of the famous "Crying Indian" TV spot, with a solitary tear spilling down the weathered cheek of Iron Eyes Cody. A wall label tells you something you may know -- that this "Native American" is actually an Italian American actor -- and something you may not: the Keep America Beautiful group behind the ad is a consortium of beverage companies.
This context puts the text in a different light. "People start pollution," the poster reads. "People can stop it." The campaign tried to shift the onus to litterbugs, and away from brands' disposable packaging. Likewise, the idea of a "carbon footprint," which makes individual consumers the problem rather than the fossil fuels they're sold, was pushed by spin doctors (the megafirm Ogilvy & Mather), hired by BP in 2004.
Gradually, environmentalist artists got wise. The show features examples of the so-called culture jamming mode developed by activists in the '90s. (Think Adbusters magazine or the Yes Men.)
A pitch-perfect parody of a Volkswagen ad by the British designer Barnbrook is one of several that were sneaked into Paris bus stops ahead of the COP21 climate conference. There is the usual car, and above it, Volkswagen's familiar font. But the text reads, "We're sorry that we got caught," a reference to the carmaker's emissions cheating scandal and a rebuke of its own sans-serif apology placed in newspapers just days earlier. The idea is less to draw hearts to green causes than to gird minds against greenwashing.
But ad firms are creative too. The most morally ambiguous poster is a 2017 spread showing a well-heeled woman posing with a megaphone on a luxury speedboat while, just behind her, a fishing vessel drags in a whale and bloodies the sea. "For those with environmental awareness," goes the copy. "And 72,000 dollars." A vicious sendup of greenwashed luxury? No, it's an ad, created by Ogilvy & Mather, for a hybrid electric Lexus.
Perhaps realizing they can't outspend corporate P.R., some contemporary poster makers forgo blue-skies thinking and bitter wit in order to tout specific policy. Gavin Snider's 2019 earth-toned design depicts a lively scene centered on the giant globe fountain built in Flushing Meadows Corona Park for the 1964 World's Fair. It states, simply: "The Green New Deal." In 2023, Jan Martijn Burger's poster urging divestment in fossil fuels took up the nostalgic style of W.P.A. printmakers. In the arc this show sketches, the mood of the environmental movement gradually drains of joy.

LOS ANGELES — What happened to fun? In the clinical white of the gallery, art can be forbidding, aggrieved, elite, academic. Shouldn’t it also, sometimes, be joyous?
The collaborators behind Luna Luna thought so. This was the amusement park staged in Hamburg, Germany, in 1987, where nearly 30 professional artists including Jean-Michel Basquiat, David Hockney and Salvador Dalí designed the rides. About 250,000 people attended that summer — families, children, students, hipsters seeking reprieve. But shoestring funding and a thwarted tour let the production sit, disassembled and forgotten in storage, for 35 years.
Now, at a staggering cost nearing nine figures, about half the attractions have been restored, beautifully, and arranged for the public in a new show in Los Angeles titled “Luna Luna: Forgotten Fantasy.”
Although I came expecting to spin until sick on Kenny Scharf’s airbrushed swing ride, Luna Luna is not participatory. You can walk among but not touch its rides, which are installed in a hangar, lined in black carpet, near the city’s downtown. Despite dramatic lighting, the presence of live clowns (beware) and the appropriately bubbly soundtrack by Philip Glass from the fair’s debut, this exhibition, with considerable didactics, is the kind of thing a museum might mount if it had the money. (Funding came privately, mostly from the production company of rapper Drake. Live Nation was enlisted for the remount.)
The sheer scale and volume of the rides allows certain very commercialized and very reproduced artists to impress in a new way. Keith Haring’s cartoon avatars, brought to candy-lacquered life as large seats on his merry-go-round, seem finally to have found their natural habitat. As for Basquiat, a pleasure craft is the most successful canvas for his deadpan: On a primed white Ferris wheel, his black glyphs adorning each gondola symbolize some aspect of chaos or Americana or slapstick, while his anatomical drawings covering the wheel’s buttresses poke fun at the bodily thrill of the whirl.
These dedicated vessels of fun seem truest to the free-for-all of their downtown New York scene. The Mudd Club, the New Museum, the Fun Gallery. Some of these installations also fulfill Pop’s ideal merger of leisure and art, as the boutiques Mr. Freedom and Big Biba did in London, or Haring’s Pop Shop in New York.
Behind velvet ropes, though, Roy Lichtenstein’s labyrinth, about the size of a mobile home, says little. Three walls of his typical stripe-matrix geometry conceal what appears to be a maze of glass panes — but distance makes it hard to say. At worst, some of these restagings give a whiff of what another parodist of the era, Weird Al Yankovic, calls “mandatory fun.”
André Heller, the Austrian impresario who organized the original Luna Luna, made it fairly international, a goofball biennale: His artists were also Czech, English, French, German, Spanish, Swiss, Russian. Before her death in 1979 at 94, Ukranian-born Sonia Delaunay, pioneer of nonobjective art since Wassily Kandinsky’s day, designed the fair’s triumphal archway. As you pass through it, gawking up at her bisected spheres and panes of color, you suddenly understand the dimensional origins of abstraction. It’s terrific.
Most pointedly, Luna, which was staged in West Germany, also represented the territory then known as East: Georg Baselitz, born in prewar Deutschbaselitz, contributed a pavilion that manipulated the shadows of its entrants, and Jörg Immendorff, from postwar Bleckede, built a shooting gallery. Neither are in the new show, but an excellent catalog from Phaidon documents the full fair in the lovely night-lit photography of Sabrina Sarnitz.
The unspoken specter is the wall — or walls — that from 1961 divided Berlin and Germany into the communist East and the democratic West, stanching the free movement of people (under pain of death) and, to some extent, ideas. Opened only months before Wim Wenders’ filmic masterpiece about partition (and circuses), “Wings of Desire,” was released in West Germany, Luna Luna seems to have conjured the internationalism that Germany craved for so long — and would soon get, in 1989.
If you really stop and think, rearing its head is a more distant political past. On view here is “Excrement Law Firm,” by Romanian-born food artist Daniel Spoerri, whose father was killed by Nazis. This mock-fascist facade, pushed up against a warehouse wall, with victory columns topped in huge sculptures of human effluent, originally led to the fair’s bathrooms.
Then there is the “Palace of the Winds,” an oversize stage marquee by Austrian political cartoonist Manfred Deix depicting adults, pants down, passing gas with force and glee. TV screens now play footage of the stage’s debut performance: a concert violinist and two bare-bottomed flatulists interpreting the “Blue Danube” waltz.
Scatology on this scale tries one’s definition of humor. (When the footage pans the crowd, Haring can be seen blinking coldly.) But it also conveys the devotion of European artists to the absurd, a quality their American counterparts somewhat lacked and maybe needed less.
The real party pooper (I’m sorry) is Joseph Beuys. Although he did not live to see the launch of Luna Luna, the German father of performance art contributed a short manifesto. Blown up in the present warehouse like a bus stop ad, this document asserts, citing Karl Marx, that “Money is not capital. Rather, ability is capital.”
Marx? At the fair? Oh, brother. But Beuys started it, so here goes:
In 1987 Luna Luna cost visitors 20 deutsche mark, the currency of West Germany. (Children visited for free on weekdays.) Today that would be about $22. By contrast, “Forgotten Fantasy” costs $38 on weekdays, $47 on weekends. (Children ages 3 to 13 are $20 always.) Family of 5 on a Saturday? With fees and tax, that starts at about $200.
But you will need a VIP “Moon” pass, at a cost of $85, if you want to engage with the three installations that allow it: You can roam Hockney’s wooden pavilion, with its two concentric rings of walls comprising brightly colored plywood pieces that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, and its bespoke classical soundtrack, or enter Dalí’s mirror dome (for your “immersive” photo op) or “get married” in Heller’s play chapel. In the name of journalism, my friend and I wed and can report that the fun lies in the couple-watching. (Non-VIP patrons, it should be noted, can marry for an additional $10.)
Bright blue lanyards signal the VIP purchase, and posted QR codes invite you to upgrade. That family of 5? Now $500.30. It divides the haves from the have-mores.
This exhibition was terribly complicated to pull off — acquisition, restoration, transportation, venue, rights. But by charging like this, by setting up tiered admission to the same show and by promoting it with photographs of the real thing, packed with children frolicking on these wild gazebos, “Forgotten Fantasy” cements the exclusions — of access, of taste — that Luna Luna sought to dismantle. Power is capital, yes. But if any act can be art, as Beuys fervently believed, so, too, must be the means of encounter.
I saw kids in Basquiat shirts and Haring hoodies. I saw art people in Balenciaga. I saw groups posing for selfies and enjoying themselves. I saw a question, too, and, sadly, an answer: Who is this really for? Not those who need it most.

U.S. Auto Sales Expected To Slow After Strong 2023: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Automakers sold more cars in 2023 than a year ago as supply chain chaos ended, but sales are now under pressure from higher interest rates.
After enjoying a strong rebound in sales in 2023, the auto industry appears headed for slower growth this year as consumers struggle with elevated interest rates and high prices for new cars and light trucks.
Edmunds, a market researcher, expects the industry to sell 15.7 million vehicles this year. That would amount to a modest increase from the 15.5 million sold last year, when sales jumped 12 percent.
"There's definitely pent-up demand out there, because people have been holding off purchases for a while," said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds. "But given the credit situation, we don't think the industry will see a ton of growth this year."
Since the coronavirus pandemic, automakers have struggled with shortages of critical parts that have prevented them from producing as many vehicles as consumers wanted to buy. In 2023, the shortages, especially for computer chips, finally eased, allowing production to return to more normal levels.
But over the past year, the Federal Reserve has significantly raised interest rates, which has pushed up costs considerably for car buyers.
For years, many people took advantage of zero-percent loans to buy vehicles, even as prices climbed. But such deals, offered by automakers to move inventory, have nearly disappeared in the wake of the Fed's rate hikes. In the fourth quarter of 2023, new-vehicle sales with zero-percent financing accounted for just 2.3 percent of all sales, according to Edmunds.
Monthly payments are at near-record highs. In the fourth quarter, the average monthly payment on new cars was $ 739, up from $ 717 in the same period a year ago.
Several automakers were hoping that a rapid rise in sales of new electric vehicles would drive the industry to gains into 2024 and 2025, but those cars and trucks haven't taken off quite as quickly as many analysts and executives had hoped.
In 2023, sales of battery-powered models in the United States topped one million vehicles for the first time, and Cox Automotive, another research firm, expects sales to reach 1.5 million this year. But General Motors, Ford Motor, Volkswagen and other manufacturers had been expecting an even faster ramp-up.
But consumers have balked at the high prices of many of the newest electric models. Many drivers are also reluctant to make the switch to battery power, because they are not sure they will be able to find enough places to quickly refuel. That has forced automakers to reset their plans.
G.M. had once forecast it would produce 400,000 electric vehicles by the middle of 2024 but now has given up that target, and it has delayed the production of some electric models.
Ford had been aiming to have enough factory capacity by the end of 2024 to make 600,000 battery-powered vehicles a year, but it recently lowered production plans for its electric F-150 Lightning and its electric sport-utility vehicle, the Mustang Mach-E.
On Wednesday, G.M. said that its sales of new vehicles in the United States jumped 14 percent last year. The company sold 2.6 million cars and light trucks in 2023, up from 2.3 million in 2022, when the chip shortage limited production.
G.M. sold about 76,000 electric vehicles, up from 39,000 in 2022. But most were Chevrolet Bolts, a model that the company recently stopped making. Only about 13,000 were vehicle based on newer battery technology that G.M. had been hoping would make its electric vehicles affordable to many more car buyers.
Sales for G.M. in the fourth quarter were relatively weak. They climbed just 0.3 percent from the same period a year earlier and were down 7 percent compared with the third quarter of 2023. The company said the sales of several important models were limited by a strike at some of its plants by the United Automobile Workers union.
Separately, Toyota Motor, the second largest seller of cars in the United States after G.M., said its 2023 sales rose 7 percent, to 2.2 million vehicles. The company's sales in the fourth quarter were 15.4 percent higher than in the same quarter a year ago and about 5 percent higher than in the third quarter.
Stellantis, the maker of Chrysler, Ram and Jeep vehicles, said that it sold 1.5 million cars and trucks in 2023, about 1 percent less than the year before. The company plans to introduce eight new electric vehicles this year, and it aims to have battery-powered models account for half of its North American sales by the end of the decade.
Honda, Hyundai and Kia also on Wednesday reported strong U.S. sales for 2023 And on Tuesday, Tesla, which dominates the electric car business in the United States, said it sold 1.8 million cars worldwide last year, up 38 percent from 2022.
Ford is expected to report its sales total on Thursday.

Tesla Sales Swing Back After Prices Are Slashed: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The leading U.S. electric-vehicle maker also drew buyers eager to take advantage of government incentives that will be harder to get in 2024.
Tesla sales jumped during the last three months of 2023 after the carmaker slashed prices and customers rushed to take advantage of tax breaks on electric vehicles -- provisions that will be harder to come by in 2024.
The company said on Tuesday that it sold 484,500 cars in the fourth quarter, up from 435,000 in the third quarter and 405,000 in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, Tesla sold 1.8 million vehicles. The gains put Tesla on track to sell more than two million cars in 2024, potentially overtaking established carmakers like Mercedes-Benz and Renault.
The rebound in sales during the fourth quarter should help calm investor concerns about whether Tesla can defend its dominance of the market for electric vehicles as it faces increased competition from traditional carmakers.
During the last year, Tesla has lost market share to rivals like General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and Volkswagen as they introduced more electric vehicles. Tesla accounts for half the electric cars sold in the United States. In 2022, Tesla accounted for two-thirds of the market.
Another electric vehicle maker, Rivian, said on Tuesday that it sold nearly 14,000 vehicles in the last three months of the year. That number was up substantially from a year earlier but down about 10 percent from the third quarter.
In China, the largest market for electric cars, Tesla faces intense competition from BYD and other Chinese automakers. BYD sold 526,000 fully electric cars worldwide in the fourth quarter, exceeding Tesla, a milestone that many auto analysts had been expecting given the Chinese company's rapid growth.
Chinese automakers have moved faster in offering a wide range of affordable electric models as the market has expanded beyond the affluent early adopters of technology. They are the core customers who have bought Teslas for as long as the company has been around.
"The customers who are buying E.V.s now are second adopters, who have fundamentally different needs," said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund focused on investing in sustainable transportation. "They care about tangible and immediately realizable decreases in total cost of ownership, and they care about convenience."
In Europe, Volkswagen and its Audi and Skoda divisions sell more electric vehicles than Tesla, although the Tesla Model Y is by far the best-selling model on the continent, according to data compiled by Schmidt Automotive Research.
In the United States, people interested in buying an electric car had a strong incentive to take delivery before the end of the year because of new rules intended to cut China out of the supply chain.
Tesla had warned on its website that the two least expensive versions of its Model 3 sedan would no longer qualify for $ 7,500 federal tax credits after Dec. 31. The cars have batteries made in China. Germany and some other European countries have also rolled back subsidies for electric vehicle buyers.
To maintain sales, Tesla cut prices, offering Model 3s on its website for well under $ 30,000 after factoring in the tax credits. By late December, the number of lower-priced cars listed on the website appeared to have dwindled, suggesting that the strategy had succeeded. But the price reductions cut into Tesla profits, which fell 44 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier.
Tesla said it would announce earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 on Jan. 24.
While fewer Teslas will qualify for federal tax credits in 2024, the company is in a better position than most of its competitors. The Performance version of the Model 3, which includes upgraded wheels and brakes, will remain eligible for the subsidy, as will all versions of the Model Y sport utility vehicle, according to a federal government website. Tesla makes batteries for those cars at a Nevada plant operated with Panasonic, allowing it to meet domestic manufacturing requirements.
That gives Tesla a significant advantage over competitors like Ford, which has said that its Mustang Mach-E sport utility vehicle will not qualify for the credit in the new year.
Ford and others rely on manufacturers in China for crucial components. Ford is building battery factories in the United States, but they will not begin producing until 2025.
General Motors has been building batteries at a new factory in Ohio, but has struggled to get the plant operating at full capacity. Initially only the Chevrolet Bolt will qualify for tax credits, G.M. said in December. The Cadillac Lyriq and electric Chevrolet Blazer will no longer be eligible.
G.M. has said it is adjusting its supply chain so that those and other vehicles, including electric versions of the Chevrolet Silverado pickup and Equinox sport utility vehicle, will become eligible early in the year.
Tesla and other carmakers may also benefit from lower interest rates in the new year. Investors are betting that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will start to ratchet down rates as inflation cools.

China's Auto Giant BYD Sells More Electric Cars And Hybrids Than Ever: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales by BYD, the country's dominant automaker, topped 3 million last year, including 1.6 million fully battery-powered cars. It's a sign of China's rapid growth in EVs.
The Chinese corporate giant BYD said Monday that it sold three million battery-powered cars in 2023, its most ever, capping a turbulent year for China's electric vehicle industry.
Even as sales surged, heavy competition and a sustained price war took a financial toll on many automakers.
But BYD last year sold 1.6 million fully electric vehicles and another 1.4 million hybrids, which are powered by both batteries and gasoline. Together that is a 62 percent increase over 2022. BYD is also making money, tripling its profit to $ 1.5 billion in the first half of last year.
All told, Chinese automakers are expected to have sold about 9.4 million electric vehicles and hybrids last year, an increase from 6.9 million in 2022, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The group said it expected sales in 2024 to rise again, to 11.5 million.
Already the world's largest automobile market, China is now also its fastest growing, racing ahead in the electric vehicle transition that is upending the global industry. China rules the supply chain for battery-powered cars -- from the mining and processing of cobalt and other minerals used in batteries, to the deployment of robots in factories that make cars and trucks. China's electric vehicle companies and their suppliers employ some 1.5 million people.
A big reason for China's early lead in electric vehicles was the government's heavy financial support for the industry's development. After financial incentives for consumers expired at the end of 2022, automakers slashed car prices to lure buyers. Many companies, including BYD, introduced another round of cuts this fall, intensifying the price war.
In November, BYD advertised discounts on five models of up to 18,000 renminbi ( $ 2,550). Another Chinese electric vehicle company, Ji Yue, a partnership of Geely and Baidu, slashed the price of all versions of its first model by RMB 30,000 ( $ 4,200) in November.
Last year's price cutting was started by Tesla, the American automaker that has a factory in Shanghai. In January 2023 it lowered prices in China for the second time in three months, and others followed.
Tesla is expected this week to report a big jump in its worldwide sales after slashing prices at the end of last year, and as customers took advantage of U.S. tax breaks. Founded in 2003, Tesla is on a path to sell about 1.8 million battery powered vehicles for the year, up from 1.3 million in 2022. It makes about half of all electric vehicles sold in the United States.
As Tesla and BYD rival for the spot as the world's most prolific maker of fully electric vehicles, both companies face increasing competition from legacy automakers that are spending billions of dollars to catch up.
"I think an industry shakeout is an inevitable trend," said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, which represents the country's domestic industry. "But it's still uncertain who will seize the future leading position in the long term."
As fast as China's electric vehicle sales are rising, companies are pouring money into factories and research, often fueled by loans from state-owned banks and assistance from municipalities. Nio, a top selling Chinese EV brand, said in November that it laid off 10 percent of its employees.
During the last year, Tesla has lost market share to rivals like General Motors, Hyundai, Ford Motor and Volkswagen as they introduced more electric vehicles.
BYD, which faces prohibitively high tariffs in the U.S. market, sells most of its cars in China but is expanding globally, particularly in Europe.
It announced in December that it would build an assembly plant in Hungary, its first production facility for battery-powered cars in Europe. In Germany, the seat of European auto making, it introduced three models of electric cars at the start of 2023. BYD has opened dealerships in Germany, Norway and Sweden.
As global competition for electric vehicles has gotten more intense, the political ramifications have been heightened. United States policymakers have made it harder for foreign companies to become partners with American companies.
And in Europe, lawmakers are investigating China's state subsidies, a step that could lead to tariffs imposed by the European Union.
Yet Europe's auto industry can't ignore China as a customer and business partner.
BMW, which has more than 30,000 employees in China, announced last spring that it would invest about $ 1.4 billion in battery assembly capacity at its factory in Shenyang in China's northeast.
Volkswagen, which counts China as its largest sales market, is moving more of its supply chain and manufacturing to China. The German giant is hiring thousands of Chinese engineers to design electric cars at its industrial complex in Hefei, a city in central China.

Suddenly Single, a Professor Took His $200,000 Budget to the Bronx: [Real Estate]

Full text: When Eric Carlson relocated from Dallas to New York City eight years ago, the best part was getting rid of his Volkswagen. "Ditching my car meant freedom, ironically," he said. But the transition to life in Manhattan -- moving into his partner's West Village apartment after a year and a half of long-distance dating, and then marrying him -- was a bumpy one.
There was "new everything," said Mr. Carlson, now 58, a communications professor at Bronx Community College. "New colleagues, new friends that I inherited that weren't really mine, new students," he said. And of course, "the subway," which he rode up to the Bronx and back every day.
But nothing prepared him for the jolt he got last Valentine's Day, when Mr. Carlson's husband asked for a divorce. In the scramble to find a new home, he realized that one silver lining was the chance to live closer to work and to escape the "performative-fancy" madness of the West Village. It had never felt like a good match for Mr. Carlson, a nature-loving hiker.
Leaving what he'd thought would be his forever relationship and embarking on a search for a new forever home, he knew only that he wanted to buy. "At my age, I didn't like the idea of my income going to someone that could raise my rent," he said.
He qualified for a bank loan program for buyers earning below $ 119,000, which made a mortgage more affordable. Hoping to stay under $ 200,000 for the purchase, he started looking farther uptown, but the apartments he could afford were "tiny."
So his agent, Gary Martin of Compass, took him to the northwest Bronx, around Riverdale and Spuyten Duyvil, less than 30 minutes to work on the Metro-North. The area had a serenity he couldn't find downtown, with its cacophony honking taxis, "people screaming because they almost got hit" and boozy brunchers.
"It's an up-and-coming, vibrant area," Mr. Martin said of the Bronx neighborhoods. "His budget in that area really gave him a lot more options." Among his options:
This 550-square-foot studio in a 12-story co-op building in Spuyten Duyvil had unobstructed Hudson River views from its balcony. It was recently renovated, with floor-to-ceiling windows, a Murphy bed and a tiny kitchen. There was an outdoor pool and a gym. While Mr. Carlson was considering it, the asking price dropped to $ 220,000 from $ 248,000. Monthly fees were $ 825.
This 500-square-foot one-bedroom in a 20-story co-op in Riverdale had a quirky layout, with a living area that wrapped around a sizable bedroom. There were nice river views. The complex was a long walk from the train station, but it had tennis and basketball courts, a pool, a big fitness center and other amenities. The asking price was $ 225,000, with monthly fees of about $ 900.
This 500-square-foot studio in a 25-story co-op in Spuyten Duyvil had high ceilings and treetop views. It had five closets, though they needed work, as did the kitchen and bathroom. The building, about 10 minutes from the train, had an outdoor pool and a doorman. List price was $ 169,000, with monthly fees of about $ 700.
He began his hunt with some concern about studios: "What are people going to think if I don't have a bedroom?" he thought.
But the one-bedroom with amenities in Riverdale was too expensive and too far from the Metro-North. Mr. Carlson started to see the advantages of a studio in price and beyond -- "less cleaning," he said.
He visited the renovated Spuyten Duyvil studio four times, but it wasn't the right fit.
In the Spuyten Duyvil alcove studio, he liked that the sleeping space was separate from the living area. And the windows faced lots of trees, giving it a bucolic vibe.
Mr. Carlson offered the asking price of $ 169,000. Mr. Martin said that this pocket of the Bronx is still largely "undiscovered," and they didn't have to worry much about bidding wars.
Mr. Carlson closed at the end of June. His monthly mortgage and co-op fees total about $ 1,450, including electric and Wi-Fi. "You can actually live in New York for under $ 200,000 in a nice community with a payment that's less than what you would do for rent," he said.
He moved with just a lawn chair and has been making the apartment his own since. Now fully furnished, it has new blinds, and Mr. Carlson upgraded the front closet and plans to do the same to the other four, and to reface the kitchen cabinets. "I knew it needed updates," he said. "But so do I."

Rusted or Mended With Love, Beetles Are Part of the Family: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: A northern community in Mexico City cannot give up on the famous 1960s hippie-favorite Volkswagen.
Rusted and stripped of their right seat, the cars parked in queues rounding street corners serve as the unofficial taxi in the hillside neighborhoods in Cuautepec in Mexico's capital. The curvy symbol of the 1960s hippie era is admired -- even decorated and named -- by residents who say the car represents their resilience and work ethic.
They can be spotted throughout Mexico City, but they swarm the vibrant streets in Cuautepec, where Beetles can be heard climbing steep hills past residents relaxing on their roofs and dogs standing guard on balconies.
One of the Cuautepec's many mechanics is usually just a couple blocks away. The smell of car exhaust fumes fills the streets as yellow, green, red and purple Beetles buzz by one another at intersections.
"It is not a standard car like any other," said Yolanda Ocampo, 45, as she admired her graying 1982 Beetle parked outside the pharmacy where she works. The brake pedal can be stiff, but owning the Beetle means "your car is tough."
"We love the Vochos so much," she added.
There are competing theories for the car's beloved nickname, "Vocho." Some say it is derived from the Spanish word for bug, "bicho," and combined the first two letters of Volkswagen. Others say it is just a shortened slang version of Volkswagen.
Though the German Classic Beetle was officially discontinued in 2003, the classic Beetle has long been a source of pride for Mexico, and specifically Cuautepec. Originally designed for Adolf Hitler in the 1930s, Volkswagen sold hundreds of thousands of Beetles in the 1960s as the car became an emblem of anti-establishment counterculture.
Eventually, Volkswagen stopped imports to the United States when it could not keep pace with crash test and emission standards. The company began to farm out production to other countries. In 1964, it opened a factory in Puebla, Mexico, where it produced Beetles until 2003, and continued to build the sleeker New Beetles until 2019, when Volkswagen ended the bug's reign entirely.
In Cuautepec, most of the cars on the road are still the classic models.
"The good ones are the old ones," said Eduardo Jiménez León, whose son gifted him a Beetle previously used as a taxi.
For residents like Mr. Jiménez León, 73, the Vocho's popularity is a matter of practicality. The Beetle's engine is in the back rather than the front, making it easier to drive up Cuautepec's steep hills. The cars marked with green and white paint are still used as unofficial taxis in the neighborhood. Many visitors who choose to take a gondola lift to the top of the city's northern hills elect to ride back down in a Vocho for a more retro transport.
"They say that it drives even just on the pure smell of gasoline," said Uriel Mondragón, a local mechanic who said 40 percent of his customers own a Beetle. "It is not like a new car. This car does not run out of gas."
For others, owning a Beetle is more about what the car represents.
In Cuautepec, the car has tied generations of families together, often passed down from parent to child.
"Our beloved Vocho has become part of the Mexican folklore thanks to its unique personality, quality, and reliability," Álea M. Lozada, a spokeswoman for Volkswagen in Mexico, said in a statement. "It is a honor to be the last plant in which this iconic model was assembled."
Each Beetle in the neighborhood has its own personality and name; owners post their car's moniker at the top of windshields or on its side. On a recent trip to Cuautepec, one Beetle was named Ashley. Miranda chugged along a couple blocks away. Another had "New York" spray-painted along its side.
Custom designs and decorations are also coveted in the Vocho community.
A taxi driver drove a Vocho with fake 100,000 dollar bills pasted on one side. Another had a Scooby-Doo doll installed on his trunk. Stars adorned the windshield of another Beetle.
Ms. Ocampo said she prefers driving her Beetle more than her brand-new SEAT Ibiza car, a supermini. For her, owning a Vocho is a way to push back on gender stereotypes that were prevalent in her home when she was growing up. She often heard men in Cuautepec questioning whether women could handle the Beetle.
"How is it possible for a woman to drive a Volkswagen because of the heavy steering wheel?" Ms. Ocampo recalled people asking. But now, "if there is a Volkswagen they are not astonished, right? So the truth is that I am proud to drive a Volkswagen."
But since the Beetle is no longer in production, it can be hard to find the right parts when repairs are needed.
As a result, the cars are often made up of mismatching colored parts. One Beetle might have a green hood, a blue passenger door and a yellow trunk -- signs of past repair jobs and an effort to match the vibrant houses in the neighborhood.
Beetlemania is not limited to the Vocholandia neighborhood.
Berenzain Amaya, a tattoo artist at Octattoo Studio in another part of Mexico City, says he has inked the car on at least 10 die-hard Vocho fans.
"It's hard to explain because if you're from another country and see this German car, it's kind of weird, but I think Mexico is a weird place," Mr. Amaya said. "There's a lot of things that aren't too common to see in other countries. This is part of the culture."
The cars have been a part of Mario Gamboa's family for decades. Along with his brother, Alejandro, Mr. Gamboa, 45, runs a repair shop in Mexico City, Grillos Racing, which predominantly serves owners of Beetles. But Mr. Gamboa and his brother also outfit the cars with more powerful engines and shiny, new exteriors for drag racing events in the city.
It was a family tradition started by their parents, who in their mid-60s still race Beetles.
The family owns 15 Beetles altogether. Mr. Gamboa himself owns seven. On a recent afternoon, the brothers said they were getting ready to show off at a car show for the best of the best Beetles.
He has been attached to the Beetle since he was a child.
"All the people in Mexico learn to drive in a Volkswagen," Mr. Gamboa said. "All the families have a Volkswagen. If you don't have a Volkswagen, then maybe your uncle or your cousin or your grandma does."

Full text: To the Editor:
Re "What Is Happening at the Columbia School of Social Work?," by Pamela Paul (column, Dec. 18):
I am outraged by Ms. Paul's column. I don't know what is happening at the Columbia School of Social Work, but if engagement around issues of social justice and racism were entering the curriculum only in recent years, it would be a very unusual social work school.
The equally renowned Smith College School for Social Work, from which I received an M.S.W. 32 years ago, identified itself as an "anti-racist institution" shortly after my cohort graduated, and a critical understanding of race and racism is central to everything that is taught (and hopefully learned) there. It's hard to imagine that Columbia is lagging far behind.
My experience has been that -- contrary to the stereotypes that abound in Ms. Paul's essay -- social workers at our best are compassionate, brave and radical, alert to the oppressive conditions that harm our clients and our communities and active in working to change those conditions.
The National Association of Social Workers' Code of Ethics identifies social justice as a core value of our profession and one of our fundamental ethical principles: "Social workers challenge social injustice. Social workers pursue social change, particularly with and on behalf of vulnerable and oppressed individuals and groups of people. These activities seek to promote sensitivity to and knowledge about oppression and cultural and ethnic diversity."
While Ms. Paul may be correct that many Columbia M.S.W. graduates eventually enter private practice, that is probably not the most effective way to repay school loans. That goal may be better served by working in the public or nonprofit sectors, where the employing agency may help repay the loans or the loans may eventually be forgiven.

To the Editor:
I graduated from Columbia's School of Social Work in 2010. Columbia had not yet devolved into the bastion of thoughtless ideology that it is today, but it was already on its way when I left there.
Since then, many in the field of psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, including some training institutes, have gone in the same direction, fracturing the focus on our common humanity into a million tiny, reactionary pieces.

To the Editor:
I graduated from the Columbia School of Social Work in 1966 and am still working today.
I was shocked and enormously saddened after reading Pamela Paul's description of what had formerly been my special place. I have always credited the Columbia School of Social Work with its emphasis on tolerance, empathy and inclusiveness as responsible for my long, rewarding career in which I have been able to understand and enhance the lives of people of all ages, races and backgrounds.
I am painfully aware that the current divisive atmosphere in the school will neither help students create meaningful, satisfying work nor improve the challenging world that we live in today.

To the Editor:
Pamela Paul expresses concerns about an ideological shift in social work education, suggesting that an increased focus on social justice might negatively affect mental health care provided by social workers.
As a social worker and an educator, I find it crucial to address these assertions. Not all social work graduates pursue mental health practice; many contribute to nonprofits, mutual aid groups and government agencies, all benefiting from a foundation in social justice and community awareness.
Ms. Paul oversimplifies the connection between school curriculum and direct clinical practice, overlooking state regulations and the extensive clinical training and supervision required for full licensure for social workers on that path.

Rooming Houses as a Solution to Homelessness
To the Editor:
Re "The Old New Way to Provide Cheap Housing," by Nicholas Kristof (column, Dec. 10):
I was pleased to read Mr. Kristof's column about the positive effect that single-room occupancy (S.R.O.) housing can have on communities struggling with increased homelessness. I agree that "there's no one answer to America's housing crisis" and that local governments have a role to play. Anyone who works in this space will tell you that the biggest impediment to getting housing for everyone is zoning.
Given today's housing and affordability crisis and the significant advances in privacy and security technology, a new, upgraded version of S.R.O.s called multi-tenant housing units (MTHU) offers all of the benefits for meeting today's housing challenges facing low-income residents without any of the security or privacy concerns of the past.
MTHUs have been adopted in Toronto. There are also forms of rooming houses in San Jose, Calif.; Houston; and the state of Massachusetts.
With proper regulations, MTHUs are one piece to solving the affordable-housing puzzle. Providing clean, safe and affordable housing for individuals earning as little as $ 18,000 annually is a good thing, and cities would be wise to take a look at this model.

To the Editor:
Nicholas Kristof hits on one of the perfectly viable solutions to homelessness. The boardinghouse or Airbnb model could go a long way toward putting roofs over people's heads. One needs only a room and a shared kitchen and bathroom to feel safe, warm and sheltered.
I know. I moved to Switzerland in 2020 and used Airbnbs and other types of room rentals for two years before finding my own apartment. These accommodations were not only perfectly suitable and affordable but also fun. I made friends of hosts and other residents and, really, sharing a stove and a bathroom is no hardship.
One of my hosts was a pastry guru, and coming into the kitchen to a fresh fruit pie with a "Help yourself, Sue" note on the counter was a perk I'll never forget. A boardinghouse needn't be forever; further affordable-housing models are needed for long-term solutions. But as a transition, it's a fantastic option.

My Family's Story
To the Editor:
I am a first-generation American. My mother fled Nazi Germany in 1936 with her mother, father and brother. My father fled in 1939, alone and very late in the terrors the Nazis were inflicting on German Jews.
My father had passed the German law bar and was taking postgraduate courses to enter the German diplomatic corps. When he fled to the U.S. his German law degree was useless. So he started sweeping floors in a factory and worked his way up to sorting bolts of cloth in the factory.
Eventually he was able to go back to college at night in the U.S., after marrying and having me as a toddler at home. He got his bachelor's degree in economics.
When I asked him why he didn't pursue a law degree here as he had in Germany, he said, "If I ever had to flee this country I didn't want to have another useless law degree."
I said, "Dad, you'd never have to flee the U.S.!"
And he replied, "That's what I thought in Germany."

Engine Maker Will Pay To Settle Emissions Case: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The company, Cummins, was accused of installing devices to defeat pollution controls on hundreds of thousands of trucks.
The United States and the state of California have reached an agreement in principle with the truck engine manufacturer Cummins on a $ 1.6 billion penalty to settle claims that the company violated the Clean Air Act by installing devices to defeat emissions controls on hundreds of thousands of engines, the Justice Department announced on Friday.
The penalty would be the largest ever under the Clean Air Act and the second largest ever environmental penalty in the United States.
Defeat devices are parts or software that bypass, defeat or render inoperative emissions controls like pollution sensors and onboard computers. They allow vehicles to pass emissions inspections while still emitting high levels of smog-causing pollutants such as nitrogen oxide, which is linked to asthma and other respiratory illnesses.
The Justice Department has accused the company of installing defeat devices on 630,000 model year 2013 to 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 pickup truck engines. The company is also alleged to have secretly installed auxiliary emission control devices on 330,000 model year 2019 to 2023 RAM 2500 and 3500 pickup truck engines.
"Violations of our environmental laws have a tangible impact. They inflict real harm on people in communities across the country," Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. "This historic agreement should make clear that the Justice Department will be aggressive in its efforts to hold accountable those who seek to profit at the expense of people's health and safety."
In a statement, Cummins said that it had "seen no evidence that anyone acted in bad faith and does not admit wrongdoing."
The company said it has "cooperated fully with the relevant regulators, already addressed many of the issues involved, and looks forward to obtaining certainty as it concludes this lengthy matter. Cummins conducted an extensive internal review and worked collaboratively with the regulators for more than four years."
Stellantis, the company that makes the trucks, has already recalled the model year 2019 trucks and has initiated a recall of the model year 2013 to 2018 trucks. The software in those trucks will be recalibrated to ensure that they are fully compliant with federal emissions law, said Jon Mills, a spokesman for Cummins.
Mr. Mills said that "next steps are unclear" on the model year 2020 through 2023, but that the company "continues to work collaboratively with regulators" to resolve the issue.
The Justice Department partnered with the Environmental Protection Agency in its investigation of the case.
The E.P.A. has ramped up its investigations of illegal emissions control software since the Volkswagen scandal of 2015, when the automaker was found to have illegally installed the devices in millions of diesel passenger cars worldwide. Volkswagen agreed to pay up to $ 14.7 billion in a consumer class-action settlement. The company also agreed to buy back about 430,000 of the approximately 11 million millions cars that carried the cheating software.
In 2020, another E.P.A. investigation found that individual owners and operators of more than half a million diesel pickup trucks had been illegally disabling the emissions control technology on their vehicles.
"E.P.A. is on the job because of what was learned through the Volkswagen scandal, and their oversight has increased significantly," said Luke Tonachel, an expert on clean vehicle policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group. "Our government needs to continue to be vigilant to ensure cheating doesn't continue."

He Steers A VW Golf And a Flock Of 85 Million: [Foreign Desk]

Author: Landler, Mark

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Serving as the spiritual leader of 85 million Anglicans in an increasingly secular world is just one of the challenges for Justin Welby. He also had a king to crown and immigration policy to condemn.
When the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Justin Welby, welcomed friends to sing Christmas carols at his London residence last week, his remarks ran, as they often do, to his coronation of King Charles III in May.
The vaulted chamber in which his guests were gathered, he told them, had been used to rehearse the ceremony twice a week over four months. Members of his staff were assigned to play Charles and other royals in a rotating cast. "I always played the archbishop," he said dryly.
Then he ran through the script a few times with the actual king. "We practiced putting it on and screwing it down," Archbishop Welby said later of the 17th-century St. Edward's Crown. "It's a wobbly old thing."
But on coronation day, before a hushed assembly of 2,300 and a worldwide television audience of hundreds of millions, the archbishop made one conspicuous error: He bent down after placing the crown to inspect whether it was sitting level on the sovereign's head, an unscripted move that made him look vaguely like a carpenter inspecting his work. "I got it right," he recalled. "I just didn't trust myself."
Such matter-of-factness is typical of Justin Portal Welby, a trim, affable 67-year-old clergyman who wears the trappings of his weighty post -- the archbishop of Canterbury also serves as the Primate of All England and spiritual leader of 85 million Anglicans worldwide -- with an almost gossamer lightness. The Church of England's looser formality means he is known as Mr. Welby, but his aides simply call him Justin.
It's not that the archbishop isn't high-minded. He reached for his iPad to share a quote from the midcentury American theologian and lawyer, William Stringfellow, about the "moral power of death" triumphing over earthly empires (translation: "don't kid yourself," Mr. Welby said). But he also cheerfully noted that he drives a seven-year-old Volkswagen Golf and confessed to getting a speeding ticket.
After a decade as archbishop, and with two years to go before he must retire, Mr. Welby relished his rendezvous with royal history. It was the highlight of a hectic year in which he also made waves by condemning the British government's policy of deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda as "morally unacceptable." As a peer in the House of Lords, he tried to amend an earlier version of the legislation so it would take a longer-term view of the problems of human trafficking and mass migration.
But he is keenly aware of the limits on what he can accomplish before he hands over to the next archbishop in 2026. A bitter, yearslong debate over how the Church of England should treat same-sex marriage will not be resolved during his term, he said in an interview at Lambeth Palace, his 14th-century residence in London.
Like the Roman Catholic Church under Pope Francis, the Church of England recently began allowing priests to bless same-sex couples. But it continues to debate a more formal recognition of these unions. Conservative clerics in Britain sent a letter to the church's governing House of Bishops, objecting to the blessings, while 10 Anglican archbishops from Africa and Latin America rejected Mr. Welby as their leader -- technically, he functions as a first among equals -- over similar objections.
Mr. Welby has tried to steer a middle course. "Every person matters equally," he said, "including L.G.B.T.Q.I.A.+ people." Yet he insisted that the debate over their unions cannot be forced. The dispute has been personally painful: Some of his oldest friends in the church have come out against his cautious moves toward recognition, while reformers complain he's dithering.
"It's a high-wire act for the Church of England because there is profound division and disagreement," Mr. Welby said. "We have to deal with this as a family dispute and not a political dispute. In other words, don't split."
"Everybody will probably feel at the moment, I'm going both too fast and too slowly," he acknowledged. "That's life."
It's a phrase the archbishop used more than once, and it suggests an equanimity honed over a lifetime of fateful twists and turns.
Born in London to a mother who worked as a personal secretary to Winston Churchill and a wayward, mysterious father who ran two failed campaigns for Parliament, Mr. Welby has described his childhood as "messy." His parents, both alcoholics, divorced when he was 3. His father was later engaged to the actress Vanessa Redgrave.
In 2016, Mr. Welby discovered through a D.N.A. test that his biological father was not Gavin Welby, but Sir Anthony Montague Browne, Churchill's private secretary, with whom his mother, Jane Williams, had a liaison before her first marriage. Mr. Welby's mother, who quit drinking many years ago, died last summer at 93.
Educated at Eton College, training ground of princes and prime ministers, Mr. Welby has said he first sensed a religious calling while a student at Cambridge University. He began attending Holy Trinity Brompton, a prominent evangelical Anglican congregation in Kensington.
"He found God in a classic Protestant evangelical experience," said Charles Moore, a former editor of The Daily Telegraph who was a year behind the future archbishop at Eton. "It fills you with a sense of urgency."
But Mr. Welby first embarked on a career more typical of his elite pedigree, as a finance executive at the French oil company Elf Aquitaine.
Living in Paris with his wife, Caroline, Mr. Welby earned a reputation for being a shrewd reader of the markets. He became the treasurer of a British firm, Enterprise Oil, and traveled to line up oil exploration deals. But the sense of a higher calling never left him, and by 1989, he resigned to join the priesthood.
His ascent in the church hierarchy was even swifter than his rise in the oil industry. After serving as a canon in Coventry Cathedral and dean of Liverpool, he was consecrated as the bishop of Durham in 2011. Barely a year later, he was appointed to succeed Rowan Williams as archbishop of Canterbury, the 105th holder of a post whose roots date back to 597.
Moving from oil to holy oil was less improbable than it might seem, Mr. Welby said. Both are built on the principle of taking big risks for even bigger rewards. "It's an industry where you drill 10, 20 wells for every time you actually find anything other than water, and pretty sandy water at that," he said.
The risk in the priesthood, Mr. Welby said, is that people will reject the Gospel of Jesus. (He declined to compare his success rate as a pastor to that of an oil prospector, saying that judgment should be left for posterity.) Still, he said his years in business had given him a sense of the ineluctable creep of secular society -- or, as he put it, "a really deep-set recognition of how irrelevant the church is to an awful lot of people in this country."
Mr. Welby has no magic remedy, but he stressed the in-the-trenches work of the parishes -- the "coal face" of the church, he called them -- to reach out to "those who are not often so easy to embrace."
Attendance at Sunday services fell between 20 percent and 25 percent during the coronavirus pandemic, and has yet to recover. Candidates for the priesthood dropped 14 percent in the last year, even though the church has been ordaining women for nearly three decades and allowed them to become bishops in 2014. That latter change, pushed through by Mr. Welby over deep-rooted resistance, is likely to be his most consequential legacy.
But that sort of boldness has also occasionally gotten him into trouble, especially running an ancient, highly decentralized institution like the Anglican Church. "He slightly shoots from the hip," said Mr. Moore, the fellow Etonian.
Cabinet ministers bridled at his criticism of their immigration policy. While the archbishop does not dispute that Britain should resist uncontrolled migration, he said it needed a more strategic policy. Putting asylum seekers on one-way flights to Rwanda, Mr. Welby said, was beneath a country with Britain's human-rights tradition, even if he expressed doubt any planes would ever take off.
"Frankly, it's a symbolic gesture," he said of the revised draft of the legislation, which recently moved from the House of Commons for review in the House of Lords. "This is essentially a performative bill."
For all his interest in the legislative process, the archbishop is still a dedicated servant of the monarchy. He bristles at criticism of one of his innovations for the coronation: a voluntary oath of homage to the king, sworn by the public, at home and in Westminster Abbey. Critics called it patronizing, but he said it was a democratizing gesture, since at previous coronations only the hereditary aristocracy had sworn allegiance.
"There isn't a guardsman behind you with a fixed bayonet in every household in the land," he said. "It's not a big deal. Just chill."
Mr. Welby brushed aside another report meant to illustrate his closeness to the royal family: that Charles once enlisted him to try to broker a deal with his estranged son, Prince Harry, so the Duke of Sussex could attend the coronation.
"I have no belief at all in my own powers of reconciliation," he said. "I have a profound belief in God's power of reconciliation."

China's Electric Car Giant BYD to Build in Hungary, Spooking European and U.S. Automakers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The announcement underscores the threat to European and U.S. automakers posed by Chinese electric-vehicle manufacturers.
BYD, China's electric-vehicle juggernaut, said Friday that it would build an assembly plant in Hungary, its first production facility for battery-powered cars in Europe and the latest sign of the company's ambitious plans to expand beyond Asia.
BYD is already the world's largest maker of electric vehicles, most of them sold in China, and has begun to open dealerships in Europe as it aims to expand sales globally. Last year, it sold 1.86 million battery-powered cars, including plug-in hybrids, which have both an electric motor and gas-powered engine. That topped Tesla, which sold 1.3 million electric cars in 2022.
The new production facility will be in Szeged, in southern Hungary, BYD said in a statement. The plant will create "thousands of local jobs" and promote "technological exchanges and innovations between China and Hungary." But there were no details about the size of the plant, how much money BYD would spend or when construction would begin.
"This is the first step towards serious competitive entry," said analysts at Bernstein, led by Daniel Roeska. They estimated that the plant would take two to three years to build and produce 200,000 cars annually, and said building cars locally would cut logistics and tariff costs. "More importantly it also brings local governments -- and local defenders -- onboard."
U.S. and European automakers, which have been rapidly spending billions to retool their plants to build more electric vehicles, are well aware of the threat posed by BYD, Nio and other Chinese car companies. China is the world's largest automobile market, and the domestic companies have taken advantage of government backing to make huge investments in technology.
In a show of their rising strength, seven Chinese makes were on display in September at the Munich auto show, where BYD unveiled a sleek new sedan and a sport utility vehicle to applause.
European lawmakers recently began an inquiry into whether Chinese automakers have received government subsidies, a step that could lead to tariffs imposed by the European Union.
"Europe is open for competition, not for a race to the bottom," said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. "We must defend ourselves against unfair practices."
European automakers are responding to the challenge. Volkswagen has invested heavily in China, where it was once the sales leader. And VW was reported by the German newspaper Handelsblatt to be in preliminary talks with Renault about building a low-cost electric vehicle.
Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, visited Shenzhen, the home of BYD, in October. According to the Shenzhen government website, he visited the BYD headquarters, saying, "Hungary welcomes Chinese-funded enterprises and has a strong willingness to cooperate with you." For years, Mr. Orban has looked toward countries like Russia and China for economic investment.
But another big Chinese project in Hungary, a $ 7.8 billion plant by CATL, the world's largest maker of electric car batteries, has not always gone smoothly. Worries about pollution, a drain on water supplies and an influx of Chinese and other foreign workers led to angry public hearings.

Full text: Purchases of popular models like the Tesla Model 3 and the Ford Mustang Mach-E may no longer entitle buyers to tax savings because the cars do not meet tougher sourcing requirements.
Efforts to fight global warming could suffer a setback next year when new rules reduce the number of electric cars that qualify for a federal tax credit.
The credits, up to $ 7,500 a vehicle, have helped make electric cars more affordable, bringing the cost of some models below $ 30,000. Next year, for the first time, dealers will be able to give buyers the credit when they purchase a car, rather than telling them to claim it on their tax returns.
But qualifying for the subsidy will become more difficult on Jan. 1 because of Biden administration rules intended to encourage automakers to manufacture vehicles and parts in North America, while bypassing China. Most automakers are still years away from breaking their dependence on China for batteries and essential materials like refined lithium.
The stricter rules, which stem from the Inflation Reduction Act, throw up another impediment to electric vehicles. Sales of such cars and trucks are already growing less briskly than a year ago because of high interest rates and drivers' anxiety about finding charging stations.
Electric vehicles are still the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry, and Americans have already bought more than one million this year. Sales will rise another 32 percent in 2024, according to BloombergNEF, compared to 47 percent in 2023. But Ford Motor, General Motors and Tesla have slowed investment as the pace of growth has cooled.
The list of fully electric vehicles that qualify for tax credits was already limited. Under rules that took effect this year, the credit was available only to cars manufactured in North America.
To collect the full credit, carmakers also must meet quotas on how much of their battery components and certain raw materials come from the United States or trade allies. Tesla, General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Rivian and Nissan are the only companies offering electric cars that qualify for the at least a partial credit. Some plug-in hybrid cars from Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Jeep and Lincoln also qualify for tax breaks.
New rules kicking in on Jan. 1 add another set of restrictions, disqualifying vehicles containing components made in China or made elsewhere by a firm under the control of the Chinese government.
"If it was already confusing for consumers, it gets even more confusing," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online marketplace.
Tesla, which accounts for half of all the electric vehicles sold in the United States, has warned on its website that the least expensive Model 3 sedan and a long-range version will no longer qualify after Dec. 31. The cars have a battery made in China. The existing credits lowered the price of the base Model 3 to around $ 30,000, on a par with similarly equipped gasoline cars like the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.
The stricter rules will also disqualify Ford's Mustang Mach-E, which has been eligible for half the credit and was the fourth-most-popular U.S. electric vehicle this year. Ford is still figuring out whether the F-150 Lighting, an electric pickup, will be eligible, a spokesman said.
The rules are complex and could still be modified by administration officials, leading to confusion among industry executives. In the worst case, only a handful of vehicles will qualify.
Volkswagen said it is "cautiously optimistic" that its ID.4 electric sport utility vehicle, made in Chattanooga, Tenn., will continue to get the credit.
General Motors said it is assessing whether its electric lineup, which includes the Chevrolet Bolt and an electric version of the Silverado pickup, will qualify. Nissan, whose electric Leaf is eligible for half of the $ 7,500 credit, did not respond to a request for comment. Rivian, whose electric pickups and S.U.V.s have qualified, also did not respond.
There is another way drivers can benefit from the credit. Under an exception intended for businesses with vehicle fleets, the Inflation Reduction Act allows dealers to apply the subsidy to leased vehicles and pass it on to customers. That wrinkle has helped Hyundai and other foreign automakers remain competitive even though they do not produce electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.
More than 40 percent of Hyundai's electric vehicle sales are leases, a spokesman said, up from just 5 percent before new restrictions took effect this year. The same provision in the law has allowed people who lease cars made abroad by Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo and Polestar to receive the credit indirectly.
But leasing is not a panacea. Many people prefer to own their cars, and foreign automakers are sore that they have been excluded from the subsidy available to buyers. The electric vehicle credit "is overly complex and unfortunately creating customer and dealer confusion," Volvo Cars said in a statement.
But the lawmakers who drafted and passed the Inflation Reduction Act have said they wrote it to force carmakers to realign their supply chains. That is happening, but the changes will take some time to bear fruit.
The list of eligible vehicles could grow over the course of 2024 as carmakers ramp up U.S. production to qualify for the credits and other subsidies.
The Korean automaker Kia expects to begin producing the EV9, a seven-passenger electric sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Georgia next year. Those domestically assembled vehicles should be eligible for half the credit, or $ 3,750, a Kia spokesman said.
Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Dodge, Ram and Jeep, plans to introduce six mass-market electric vehicles in 2024, including versions of the Dodge Charger, Jeep Wagoneer and Ram pickup. The company has not said whether the vehicles will qualify for credits.
Some hybrids, which have internal combustion engines and electric motors, will also qualify if they meet the sourcing requirements and have a battery with a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid will most likely still be eligible for a $ 7,500 credit, a company spokesman said, while buyers of the Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids are expected to be eligible for up to $ 3,750.
Market forces are pushing down the prices of electric vehicles, a trend that is expected to continue as carmakers increase production. The average list price of an electric vehicle fell to $ 63,000 in November from $ 68,000 a year earlier, according to CarGurus. The average list price of a vehicle with an internal combustion engine was $ 48,000, the same as in the previous year.
Federal subsidies and loans for battery factories and electric car plants are also helping to lower prices. At some point during the next several years, analysts expect electric vehicles to become less expensive than internal combustion models even without tax credits.
"The long-term trend is going to be one of reducing prices," Mr. Roberts of CarGurus said. "You are going to see more mainstream vehicles."

Volkswagen Is Hiring 3,000 Engineers in China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Volkswagen is shifting more operations to China, tapping the country's electric vehicle capacity and building factories.
A bright orange robot, 10 feet tall, looms over Volkswagen's new electric car assembly line in central China. It was imported from Germany. The factory's other 1,074 robots were made in Shanghai.
Volkswagen used to import shock absorbers from Central Europe for cars it makes at Chinese factories. Now it buys them from a company in China for 40 percent less.
After relying for decades on engineers in Germany to design cars for the Chinese market, Volkswagen has begun hiring for a team of nearly 3,000 Chinese engineers, which will include hundreds transferred from Volkswagen operations elsewhere in China. They will design electric cars at VW's industrial complex in Hefei, a city in central China.
The new strategy, which Volkswagen calls "In China, for China," is another sign of how China's commanding lead in electric vehicles has upended global auto making. Chinese car brands are appearing more in Germany and throughout Europe, causing politicians to worry about job losses.
But Volkswagen is doubling down on its business in China, which is the world's largest car market and also Volkswagen's biggest market. VW's aim is to match the speed and efficiency of Chinese electric car manufacturers, which have seized a rapidly growing share of the Chinese car market. That has caused sales of the German car maker's gasoline-powered vehicles to plunge in China.
China's city governments and state-controlled banks have been pouring money into electric car makers, helping them build new factories faster than their sales have grown. The resulting overcapacity has triggered a price war that has pushed electric car prices down sharply. Volkswagen wants low costs to make sure its electric cars can be priced competitively. So it plans to start production in Hefei in the coming weeks of its new Tavascan sport utility vehicle for sale in China and export to Europe.
"We all know how difficult it is to make money on electric cars," said Ralf Brandstätter, the chairman and chief executive of VW's overall China operations.
The need to reduce costs is so great that it has also meant painful cuts in Germany -- a difficult choice for a company that has been a pillar of German industry since the 1930s. The German state of Lower Saxony owns nearly 12 percent of the company. European labor leaders hold nearly half the seats on the company's supervisory board.
Volkswagen is looking to shrink its costly, heavily unionized work force in Europe, as well as trim its reliance on high-cost European auto parts manufacturers. Executives began breaking the news in late November to staff at the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg that job reductions in Europe will have to be part of a 10 billion euro, or $ 10.9 billion, worldwide cost-cutting plan started earlier this year.
"To increase our efficiency, we have to reduce our work force," Oliver Blume, Volkswagen's chief executive, told the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
The cuts in Europe and imports from China could produce a double whammy for Germany, where the car industry has been a mainstay of the economy and accounts for nearly 800,000 jobs. Industry analysts predict the shift to electric vehicles, which are simpler to assemble than gasoline-powered cars, will cause that number to shrink by 12 percent.
VW and Chinese carmakers have begun building facilities in China to make electric cars, instead of converting existing factories. The new factories, for local manufacturers like BYD and Nio as well as VW in Hefei, are among the world's most modern and highly automated.
Midea, a Chinese appliance maker, in 2016 bought the German company Kuka, a leading producer of car factory robots. The new VW factory in Hefei uses robots from Kuka, which has shifted considerable production to Shanghai.
Last summer Volkswagen acquired a 4.9 percent stake in Xiaopeng, a Chinese electric car maker that is particularly strong in instrument panel electronics. And VW is replacing European parts manufacturers that still supply its Chinese factories.
"The really big potential is the localization, to really localize 100 percent of the parts in China," said Ludger Lührmann, the chief technology officer for VW's operations in Hefei.
Volkswagen's move reflects a painful reality for every traditional multinational car company: They have been caught flat-footed by China's rapid shift to electric cars and Chinese automakers' success in cutting costs, said Bill Russo, an electric car industry consultant in Shanghai.
Electric cars account for over 30 percent of China's car market, up from 5 percent three years ago. By 2025, VW expects, half the cars sold in China will be electric.
Multinational companies have long sold the majority of China's gasoline-powered cars through joint ventures with local automakers. But they sell fewer than 20 percent of China's electric cars, and those are mostly made by Tesla, the American automaker. The Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers BYD, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, Zhejiang Geely, Li Auto and Nio have moved much faster than their European counterparts.
Volkswagen is the longtime leader for gasoline-powered cars in China, holding almost a fifth of the market through two big joint ventures with Chinese state-owned companies. But it sells less than 3 percent of the country's electric cars.
VW is racing to catch up. Its new factory in Hefei is designed to churn out 350,000 cars a year initially, more than the industry standard size of 250,000 or so. And the buildings have been built with large expanses of empty space inside, so that further equipment can be quickly installed to ramp up production even higher.
Building a factory in China, instead of converting existing factories, has big advantages for Volkswagen. Starting in the 1980s when China began opening to foreign automotive investment, Beijing has required that foreign automakers assemble gasoline-powered cars in China through joint ventures with its state-owned automakers, and share management control. Volkswagen owns 40 percent of one of its joint ventures, with First Auto Works, and 50 percent of the other, with Shanghai Automotive.
But Beijing has exempted electric car production from the joint venture rule. Volkswagen owns 75 percent of its electric car manufacturing operation in Hefei -- a local partner owns the rest -- and VW fully owns its new engineering center in the city. It has full managerial control of both. Tesla, the leading foreign maker of electric cars in China, has operated in Shanghai since 2019 free of any joint venture requirement.
Foreign automakers are allowed full ownership of factories that make auto parts. So converting these to electric car component production has been more worthwhile.
Despite its aggressive new push in China, Volkswagen must compete with a domestic auto sector that receives heavy government assistance. Just 30 miles from its Hefei factory, a Chinese electric rival, Nio, has opened its second factory. Its operation is in some ways even more advanced than Volkswagen's -- sections of the assembly line are essentially mobile and can be rolled to new locations.
The local government provided the land and the building, said Ji Huaqiang, Nio's vice president for manufacturing. "Nio does not own the factory or the land -- it is renting, but the factory was custom built for Nio," he said.
Nio's two factories give it the capacity to assemble 600,000 cars a year, even though its annual rate of sales this autumn is only about 200,000 cars. Nio is nonetheless already building a third plant.
Volkswagen executives say that with China doing so much to build up its car industry, they have to be involved. "To build up a Chinese automotive industry," Mr. Brandstätter said, "was a clear target always of the industrial policy of the government."

E.V. Jobs? China Has Them to Spare.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: China misjudged the rapid expansion of its electric vehicle sector, leaving a shortfall of skilled technicians as young people shun manufacturing careers.
Xing Wei graduated from a vocational high school in northeastern China in 2003 and went to work as an electrician in an auto parts factory in the country's south. The only set of wheels he could afford was a black, three-speed bicycle.
He earned $ 1,150 a year and shared a sweltering dormitory room with three other workers. "There was air-conditioning, but because we had to pay the electricity ourselves, we basically didn't turn it on," Mr. Xing said.
Two decades later, Mr. Xing, 42, makes close to $ 60,000 a year. He works as a senior electrician installing industrial robots at electric car factories for Nio, a Chinese automaker. Last winter, he bought a $ 52,000 Nio ES6 sport utility vehicle.
China's electric vehicle market is the world's largest and fastest growing. A frenzy of construction and expansion of factories has made electricians and robotics specialists a hot commodity.
"If you want to recruit people with relevant experience, there are relatively few people in this industry," Mr. Xing said.
More than 1.5 million people now work at dozens of electric vehicle companies in China and their suppliers. The largest of them, BYD, has 570,000 workers, compared with 610,000 worldwide for Detroit's Big Three combined.
As parts of China's economy slow, Beijing needs to shift workers to sectors that are still growing fast, most notably electric vehicle manufacturing. But Beijing faces a shortfall in vocational training, as well as a surplus of young people with university degrees who aren't interested in factory work.
Most in demand are skilled technicians and engineers like Mr. Xing. Assembly line workers at automotive plants earn less than half his salary.
Beijing estimated in 2021 that the country had more than twice as many jobs for skilled technicians as the actual number of qualified workers.
A report issued last year by the Shanghai government found that the highest-paid 10 percent of senior factory technicians earned at least $ 51,000 a year. Workers with these skills change jobs frequently: Before moving to Hefei in central China two years ago to work for Nio, Mr. Xing set up a stamping line in nearby Ningbo for Zeekr, a division of Zhejiang Geely.
Fueled by loans from state-owned banks and assistance from municipalities, Chinese automakers are building electric car factories faster than sales are rising, prompting a price war that has left most companies losing money. That has caused a shakeout in the industry. Nio, for example, announced in November that it laid off 10 percent of its employees. None of the cuts were in manufacturing, Nio said.
"We are already very concerned about the shortage of hands," said Ji Huaqiang, Nio's vice president of manufacturing.
The seeds of the labor shortage were planted years ago when the Chinese government's economic planners failed to see the scale of the electric car boom and to train enough workers for it.
In 2016, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology predicted that the electric car industry would need 1.2 million workers in 2025, and warned that China had only 170,000 people then with the necessary skills.
To be sure, more than two-fifths of the country's 11 million college graduates each year study topics related to science and engineering. That is double the proportion in the United States, which also has a shortfall of welders, electricians and other industrial workers.
But many of those college graduates aspire to work in white-collar jobs at internet companies and the civil service, not at factories.
For several decades, factories in China could count on a constant flow of farmers' sons and daughters who arrived in cities and would take practically any job, no matter how dull.
One of them was Mr. Xing. He was determined as a teenager to leave his hometown, Hongshi, near China's border with North Korea. He attended a vocational high school, where his teacher said he should look for work in southeastern China, near Hong Kong. As soon as he earned his high school diploma, he packed his bags.
In Guangzhou, he found a job at a factory that stamped out car body parts for a nearby Honda assembly plant. Whenever new equipment arrived, foreign experts connected it to laptops and made all the decisions on test runs. Mr. Xing understood little.
"I could only look at them like a dummy," he said.
It left a mark on him. He lived on free cafeteria meals at the factory and saved his pay, $ 100 a month, to buy a $ 1,195 IBM laptop. He studied automation on weekends through an adult education program.
The training would help set him up for a career in the electric vehicle sector. By 2019, he had bought a nearly 1,100-square-foot condo in an outlying suburb of Ningbo, 800 miles from Guangzhou. Today, his parents are living in the condo while Mr. Xing and his wife and their two sons pay $ 350 a month to rent a 1,300-square-foot apartment in Hefei.
The Chinese government has tried to train a generation of workers like Mr. Xing, with mixed results.
In 2014, Xi Jinping, China's top leader, exhorted government and Communist Party officials, as well as businesses, to "cultivate hundreds of millions of high-quality laborers and technical and skilled personnel."
But that goal has collided with the rising aspirations of Chinese parents who have shown less interest in sending their children to vocational high schools to learn the skills of an electrician, a machinist or another technician.
The number of teenagers entering vocational and technical high schools plummeted 25 percent between 2010 and 2021, the year with the most recent data. At the same time, the number of students attending academic high schools barely changed.
"Factory jobs are often associated with the 'three D's' -- dirty, dangerous and demeaning," said Minhua Ling, an associate professor specializing in China's vocational education system at the Geneva Graduate Institute. Younger Chinese "find it demeaning," she said. "Feeling like a machine is not meaningful to them."
About 60 percent of the Chinese population turning 18 enroll at a university. In 2000, it was 10 percent.
Companies in China have been slower than those in some countries, like Germany, to set up long-term apprentice programs to train future factory floor leaders.
"The demand rose so quickly that the education system was caught flat-footed, and it takes a few years to adequately prepare and train top-notch technicians," said Gerard A. Postiglione, an emeritus professor of higher education research at the University of Hong Kong.
A steepening decline in birthrates adds to the urgency of the challenge.
The number of young people turning 18 each year in China has dropped by more than 40 percent since the mid-1980s. Based on the number of babies born in the past few years, the number of 18-year-olds will halve in the coming years.
China, and particularly the electric car industry, is trying to use automation to address its shortage of willing hands.
According to the International Federation of Robotics, businesses in China installed more industrial robots in 2022 than the rest of the world combined. It exceeded its biggest manufacturing rivals, Japan, the United States, South Korea and Germany.
By 2027, Nio plans to replace half its managerial positions with artificial intelligence and a third of its factory workers with robots, said Mr. Ji, the company's vice president of manufacturing. One of Nio's factories makes 300,000 E.V. motors a year and has a mere 30 workers.
"All of these companies have a hard time to find blue-collar labor," said Zhou Linlin, the chief executive of Principle Capital, a Shanghai investment firm with stakes in numerous Chinese factories. "That's why all the companies are looking for automation and robotics solutions."
But robots can make up for only some of China's growing demand for factory technicians.
Volkswagen is hiring for a new research center near Nio, in Hefei, that will staff 3,000 engineers to develop electric cars, and it is preparing to build electric cars there.
That means even more demand for specialists like Mr. Xing, who already has trouble filling his own team of electricians. "We are also constantly recruiting," he said, "and we are not able to recruit suitable, relevant personnel."

U.A.W. Says 3 Carmakers Violated Labor Laws: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: A week after declaring a drive to organize nonunion automakers, the United Automobile Workers union filed charges against three foreign manufacturers.
The United Automobile Workers union accused three foreign automakers on Monday of unfair labor practices, asserting that they had interfered with efforts by employees to build support for the union at U.S. plants.
The union said it had filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board contending that the automakers -- Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen -- had tried to prevent workers from discussing U.A.W. representation at work and that the companies had discriminated against those who had done so.
The action came two weeks after the U.A.W. announced an effort to organize nonunion plants owned by 10 foreign-owned companies, along with the domestic manufacturers Tesla, Lucid and Rivian, which make electric vehicles. The union has tried unsuccessfully to unionize some of those companies' factories in recent years, but not simultaneously on such a wide scale.
The U.A.W. said Monday that hundreds of workers at Honda's plant in Greensburg, Ind., and at Hyundai's plant in Montgomery, Ala., and more than 1,000 workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., had signed cards expressing support for joining the union.
At Honda, the union said, workers "report being targeted and surveilled by management for pro-union activity," while at Hyundai, "management has unlawfully confiscated, destroyed, and prohibited pro-union materials in nonwork areas during nonwork times."
It said that Volkswagen "had harassed and threatened workers for talking about the union" and that it had "confiscated and destroyed pro-union materials in the break room," among other accusations.
In a statement, Volkswagen said that it took such accusations seriously and that it would investigate the matter. "Volkswagen respects our workers' right to determine who should represent their interests in the workplace," it said.
Honda said, "We have not and would not interfere with our associates' right to engage in activity supporting or opposing the U.A.W." Hyundai said that the union's depiction of the matter was not accurate and that its workers "may choose to join a union or not as is their legal right."
Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, lashed out at the three companies in a statement issued by the union. "These companies are breaking the law in an attempt to get autoworkers to sit down and shut up instead of fighting for their fair share," he said. "But these workers are showing management that they won't be intimidated out of their right to speak up and organize for a better life."
The U.A.W. is trying to organize foreign-owned plants after a six-week wave of strikes against the three Detroit automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, which makes Jeep, Chrysler and other brands -- that resulted in contracts providing record wage increases and additional gains in benefits.
In addition to Honda, Hyundai and Volkswagen, the foreign companies that the U.A.W. said last week that it was targeting are Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Mazda and Volvo.
The new contracts at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis raise the top hourly wage to $ 40 at the end of the four-and-a-half-year term, from $ 32 previously. Hourly wages at the foreign automakers in the United States generally range from the high teens to the high 20s.
After the U.A.W. agreements with the Detroit automakers were reached this fall, Honda said it would provide raises of 11 percent next year, and Hyundai said it would increase pay 14 percent next year and 25 percent by 2028. Toyota also announced raises.

Simon & Schuster Name a Board of Directors
Simon & Schuster announced on Thursday a board of directors with experience that covers the life cycle of a book, including traditional publishing and audiobooks, movie spinoffs and TikTok. The board was constituted after the private equity firm KKR bought Simon & Schuster this year for $ 1.62 billion. Under its previous owner, Paramount, the publisher did not have a board. "This board is going to help us be the pre-eminent publisher," said Jonathan Karp, right, the chief executive of Simon & Schuster, who is also a board member. The seven-member board will include three KKR executives, including Richard Sarnoff, chairman of media in KKR's American business. Mr. Sarnoff, who will be the chairman of the Simon & Schuster board, held senior positions at Random House, the Association of American Publishers and Bertelsmann, which owns Penguin Random House. Also on the new board will be Madeline McIntosh, the former chief executive of Penguin Random House U.S., the largest book publisher in the country. She also briefly worked at Amazon. V Pappas, another board member, has experience in a different aspect of book selling: social media. Mx. Pappas was the chief operating officer at TikTok, which has become enormously important in the industry. Kareem Daniel, who spent 18 years at the Walt Disney Company, was also named a director.

1,000 VW Workers Seek Vote for Union
The United Automobile Workers union said on Thursday that more than 1,000 factory workers at Volkswagen's assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., had signed union authorization cards. Last week, the U.A.W. announced a push to publicly organize the entire nonunion auto sector in the United States after winning new contracts with the Detroit Three automakers. The union, which said 30 percent of workers at the VW plant had signed cards, has outlined an organizing strategy that says if 30 percent of workers at a nonunion plant sign cards seeking to join, it will make that public. If 50 percent of workers seek to join, the U.A.W. will hold a rally with its president, Shawn Fain. At 70 percent and with an organizing committee in place, the U.A.W. would seek recognition or demand a union representation vote. VW, which produces the Atlas and ID.4 at the plant, said it respected "the right of our workers to determine who should represent their interests in the workplace." The U.A.W.'s deals with General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis included an immediate 11 percent raise and a 25 percent increase in base wages through 2028, cut the time needed to reach top pay to three years from eight years, and raised the pay of temporary workers by 150 percent and made them permanent. VW said last month that it would raise pay 11 percent at its Tennessee factory, joining several foreign automakers that have announced significant pay and other compensation improvements in response to the U.A.W. contracts. VW said on Thursday that the recent pay increase reflected "our constant commitment to our team members." REUTERS

U.A.W. Aims To Unionize More Plants: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The United Automobile Workers' effort, with a long-elusive goal, follows its success in securing big raises in contracts with the Detroit automakers.
The United Automobile Workers union announced Wednesday that it was undertaking an ambitious drive to organize plants owned by more than a dozen nonunion automakers, including Tesla and several foreign companies -- a goal that has long eluded it.
The move comes weeks after the U.A.W. won new contracts from General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis that included wage increases of 25 percent or more over four and a half years for its 146,000 members employed there.
In addition to Tesla, the targets of the drive are two other electric vehicle start-ups, Lucid and Rivian, and 10 foreign-owned automakers: Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo.
The U.S. plants owned by those companies employ nearly 150,000 workers in 13 states, the union said.
If the organizing drive gains momentum, it could become one of the largest by the U.A.W. since its infancy in the 1930s. The union's past efforts to organize even single plants owned by the foreign automakers, concentrated in the South, came to nought. A foothold among those companies would signal a big shift in the American auto industry, where nonunion manufacturers have long had a significant cost advantage over the Detroit automakers.
The union said the organizing drive had been prompted by inquiries from several thousand workers at nonunion plants.
"Workers across the country, from the West to the Midwest and especially in the South, are reaching out to join our movement and to join the U.A.W.," the union's president, Shawn Fain, said in a video posted on Facebook. "The money is there. The time is right."
A Honda statement cited the automaker's "competitive wages and benefits," adding, "We do not believe an outside party would enhance the excellent employment experience of our associates." Hyundai referred to its "excellent wages and benefits," adding, "Our team members have not shown an interest in union representation." Subaru pointed to wage increases and its benefits package but did not comment directly on the union drive. Rivian and Volkswagen said they had no comment.
At the DealBook Summit conference sponsored by The New York Times on Wednesday, Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, said, "If Tesla gets unionized, it will be because we deserve it and we failed in some way." He reiterated his opposition to unions, saying that "it's not good to have an adversarial relationship" between groups within a company.
The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.
On Wednesday, the U.A.W. activated websites where workers can electronically sign cards that serve as an official certification of their desire to have union representation. Earlier, at a handful of plants, the U.A.W. had already received signed cards from more than 30 percent of the work force, the threshold required under federal law for the union to move forward with a vote on unionization, a person familiar with the matter said.
The union is now working to send organizers to areas around these nonunion plants to collaborate with workers at those factories, this person said.
After the U.A.W. reached agreements with the Detroit automakers to raise wages, Toyota, Honda and Hyundai announced that they, too, would increase workers' pay.
Toyota has told workers that it will raise hourly rates 9 percent in January. Honda will lift wages 11 percent and Hyundai 14 percent next year. Hyundai plans to increase wages 25 percent by 2028.
The U.A.W. said Wednesday that it was making a concerted effort to organize a large Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky., that employs about 7,800 workers and produces the Camry sedan and RAV4 sport utility vehicle.
U.A.W. members have long earned more than nonunion workers. At plants in the South, wages tend to start below $ 20 an hour and top out at less than $ 30. The top U.A.W. hourly wage, previously $ 32, climbed to more than $ 40 in the contracts the union signed with the three Detroit manufacturers.
The U.A.W. has fallen short twice in the past decade -- by narrow margins, in 2014 and 2019 -- in unionization votes at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. The U.A.W. lost by a substantial margin at a Nissan plant in Canton, Miss., in 2017. Organizing efforts at other companies' plants have petered out before coming to a vote.
But after Mr. Fain became the union's president this year, the union promised a more aggressive approach to its contract talks with the Big Three and vowed to renew efforts to widen its reach in the industry.
In addition to wage gains at the Detroit companies, the U.A.W. won agreements to preserve jobs and to keep open a Stellantis plant in Illinois that had been slated to close.
Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said the U.A.W.'s wage gains created a stronger case for joining the union.
"It shows collective bargaining works and shows the U.A.W. was successful," he said. "They can say: 'We saved this plant. Look at what we got. You can have this, too."'
Past organizing drives were hurt because the U.A.W. had a tarnished image, Mr. Wheaton added: Many unionized plants had closed, its members had been required to accept wage and benefit cuts to help the Detroit manufacturers survive the 2009 financial crisis, and federal corruption investigations had implicated senior union officials.
"A lot of the negative things about the union -- a lot of that stuff has gone away now," Mr. Wheaton said.

The United Auto Workers union announced Wednesday that it was undertaking an ambitious drive to organize plants owned by more than a dozen nonunion automakers, including Tesla and several foreign companies — a goal that has long eluded it.
The move comes weeks after the UAW won new contracts from General Motors, Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis that included wage increases of 25% or more over 4 1/2 years for its 146,000 members employed there.
In addition to Tesla, the targets of the drive are two other electric vehicle startups, Lucid and Rivian, and 10 foreign-owned automakers: Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Volkswagen, Mazda and Volvo.
The U.S. plants owned by those companies employ nearly 150,000 workers in 13 states, the union said.

Full text: "Among Friends" is a history of an industry transformed by consolidation and shifting tastes.
AMONG FRIENDS: An Illustrated Oral History of American Book Publishing and Bookselling in the 20th Century. Edited by Buz Teacher and Janet Bukovinsky Teacher.
Some of the most stressed-out young people in the United States, if movies can be believed, work in publishing. IMDb, the online database, yokes these films together as a genre.
This makes sense. The young in publishing are acutely underpaid; some suffer from a broken-spirited servility; they fear they will never master the ninja techniques of literary social climbing. The older and more established in publishing have trod over a mountain of bodies to get where they are. They're not jumping unless pushed -- as some have recently been.
No one knows anything, not really. Everyone is dowsing for a best seller, or wandering like Eeyore in search of his lost tail. Editors are living and dying by their profit and loss statements, or P&Ls. They are all hoping to be able to say once in a while, as John Le Carré reportedly did whenever he got a good publishing deal, "Baby will eat tonight."
So what a treat it is to settle into "Among Friends: An Illustrated Oral History of American Book Publishing and Bookselling in the 20th Century," a monster-size art book with a monster-size price ( $ 200) that primarily revisits the 1960s through the 1990s. This was a time, if the contributors can be believed, when all martinis came in triplicate, when levelheaded hippies out West made big money publishing books about "hydroponics" before you could say they were about "pot" and all kinds of mass-market and novelty bets, like "Juggling for the Complete Klutz," which came with three bean bags, and "How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive," paid off.
The editors have gathered a chorus of voices. Some are well-known editors such as Robert Gottlieb, who was once the lead pelican in elite publishing's flying V formation, and Nan A. Talese and Morgan Entrekin. But many others are less known. Included also are the voices from the business side, as well as bookstore owners, the editors of children's books, the far-flung publishers of indie presses, sales reps and so on.
I don't trust all the happy vibes in "Among Friends." The first thing that falls out of any history is the fear. But I liked them. In one essay, Jennifer Enderlin, the president and publisher of St. Martin's Publishing Group, recalls entering publishing in the late '80s and making her bones on a mass-market horror novel (she loved it, she writes, with a "white-hot passion") called "Voodoo Fury." The first printing was 65,000 copies, enough for a football stadium!
But because of industry consolidation and other factors, the bottom dropped out of mass-market books. The spinning wire paperback racks in drugstores and supermarkets vanished. Then, for a certain kind of reader, came Oprah's Book Club. Enderlin writes:
Suddenly, books were vitamins, not potato chips. They existed to edify you, to inform you, to discuss with other people. The guilty pleasure of reading "Princess Daisy" by Judith Krantz ("Which one of you bitches is my mother?") or a Jackie Collins novel was no longer in vogue.
You are unlikely to read "Among Friends." I'm not convinced you should, at least until it arrives, if it ever does, in paperback. It's Brutalist in size and laden with dead space, like a haphazardly packed suitcase. Unlike the most dazzling oral histories, there is no presider, working like a D.J., mixing the material. Contributors have simply mailed in essays that can read like the "class notes" section of a college magazine. But this book, edited by Buz Teacher and Janet Bukovinsky Teacher, is a passion project, and it performs a necessary service, getting these stories on paper before they vanish. The ephemera (old Publishers Weekly covers, advertisements, etc.) is first-rate. Some good stories get told as well.
For example, here is Jason Epstein, the editorial director of Random House, replying to Mario Cuomo, then the governor of New York, when Cuomo complained that his wife could not find a copy of his new memoir in a bookstore: "Governor, no author since Homer has been able to find his own book in a bookstore."
We read about the time Bob Woodward was walking with his agent, David Obst, and saw a dime on the street. Literary agents traditionally have taken 10 percent of their client's earnings, though that figure has risen. Woodward bent down and picked up the coin. Then he rummaged in his pocket, found a penny and handed it to Obst.
One more. Ram Dass had to be talked into publishing his best-selling 1971 book "Be Here Now," about meditation and yoga. He felt it was wrong to make money from his teachings. His future publisher, Bruce Harris, told him: "Don't worry. Most authors don't make money." The book came out.
There is a lot here about Stewart Brand's counterculture bible, the "Whole Earth Catalog," and how it inspired a legion of small publishers. One contributor calls it "the mother ship of this era." Back then, you could start a publishing house for about the price of a new car. This book charts the small beginnings -- every Goliath was once a David -- of chains like Borders and Books-A-Million. A lot of small trust funds were burned through.
The young will widen their eyes at the tales of regular tables at the Russian Tea Room and the Rainbow Room, weeklong parties down the Nile River for 100 guests and a weekend party at Mar-a-Lago, hosted by Oprah, for Maya Angelou.
They are more likely to be inspired by all the little-guy success stories here. Books about needlework and bird carving and leather tooling saved some publishers. So did items like "ALF" coloring books. We hear the origin stories of books like "Our Bodies, Ourselves," the "Moosewood Cookbook," "Zen Flesh, Zen Bones," "The Tassajara Bread Book" and the earliest books from conspicuous consumption specialists such as Martha Stewart and Ina Garten.
If you have not heard terms like hand-tipped plates, head and tail bands, and pigskin and Smyth-sewn binding for a while, this book might be a hearth for you.
In the early 1990s, on my first date with the woman who would become my wife, I took her to the publisher Charles Tuttle's used bookstore in Rutland, Vt., the contents of which were scattered over many floors of a rambling old house.
I was glad to see Tuttle recalled in "Among Friends." He was a protean figure who, among other things, opened the first English-language bookstore in Japan. We also learn he instructed that the following should be on his tombstone: "Here lies Charles Tuttle. They said he would never stop drinking. Well he has."

Amazon's iRobot Deal Scrutinized for Fairness
European Union regulators said on Monday that Amazon's $ 1.4 billion acquisition of the vacuum maker iRobot might squeeze out rivals on its online marketplace.
Amazon announced the deal amid increased scrutiny of Big Tech acquiring rivals and accumulating data that could boost their market dominance or help them expand into other markets.
"Amazon may have the ability and the incentive to foreclose iRobot's rivals by engaging in several foreclosing strategies aimed at preventing rivals from selling R.V.C.s on Amazon's online marketplace and/or at degrading their access to it," the European Commission said in a statement.
The E.U. competition enforcer said Amazon's online marketplace was an important channel for robot vacuum cleaners in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. It sent a statement of objections to the company detailing its concerns, and Amazon said it was working to address them. Reuters

Volkswagen to Reduce Headcount at VW Brand
Volkswagen's $ 10.9 billion savings program will include staff reductions, managers told staff on Monday as the brand chief executive Thomas Schaefer warned that high costs and low productivity were making its cars uncompetitive.
The German carmaker is in the midst of negotiations with its works council over a cost-cutting scheme at its VW brand, the first step in a groupwide drive to increase efficiency in the transition to electric cars.
"With many of our pre-existing structures, processes and high costs, we are no longer competitive as the Volkswagen brand," Mr. Schaefer, above, told staff at a meeting at the carmaker's headquarters in Wolfsburg.
The company had previously said it planned to take advantage of the "demographic curve" to reduce its workforce, having pledged that it would not carry out dismissals until 2029. Reuters
Aviation
L3Harris Is Selling Its Solutions Business
L3Harris Technologies is selling its commercial aviation solutions business to the private equity firm TJC for $ 800 million, the defense company said on Monday.
The deal includes a $ 700 million cash purchase price and a $ 100 million earnout based on the achievement of certain financial performance targets for this year and 2024. The commercial aviation solutions business of L3Harris offers pilot training, flight data analytics, avionics and advanced air mobility products and services.
"Aligned with our capital allocation priorities, we plan to use the proceeds from this transaction to repay debt, which will accelerate our timeline to reach our debt leverage objective," L3Harris said in a statement.
Morgan Stanley and Moelis & Company were financial advisers to L3Harris, while J.P. Morgan Securities advised TJC. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2024. Reuters

Relax, E.V.s Truly Are the Best Choice for the Planet: [Op-Ed]

Full text: It has been a bumpy few weeks for carmakers who sell electric vehicles, which are moving more slowly off the lot than they were earlier this year. What's going on? It seems that American drivers may be more hesitant about E.V.s than automakers expected.
I am familiar with trepidation about electric vehicles; I hear it when I give talks around the country about how each of us can take small steps to slow and stop climate change, when I chat with my neighbors and when I go on a road trip in my own E.V. Some people worry about running out of battery power far from a charging station; others are dissuaded by the upfront costs. The electric Volkswagen ID. 4, for example, sells for about $ 40,000, while the similarly sized, gas-powered Volkswagen Tiguan sells for about $ 30,000 -- though the E.V. has a lower total cost over the life of the car.
Those concerns will likely diminish in 2024 as money from the Inflation Reduction Act flows into building more charging stations and making discounts for electric vehicles available right at the dealership. But I think something else may explain why so many Americans, including those who consider themselves climate conscious, have been hesitant to buy an electric vehicle. It's a fear that such vehicles aren't really all that much better for the environment than hybrid vehicles that have both gas and electric motors, and might even be worse, because of everything required to manufacture batteries and mine the materials that go into them. This worry is keeping some would-be buyers on the sidelines of the E.V. revolution.
If you look under the hood, so to speak, these concerns share two fundamental misunderstandings: They assume that the electric vehicle industry is locked in to today's technology, and they discount the huge environmental drawbacks of gas-powered alternatives. Electric vehicles are like digital cameras in their early iterations. They are already better than the alternative for almost everyone, and improving at a breathtakingly fast clip. And while there are environmental concerns with them, they are dwarfed by the benefit they provide regarding climate change -- the biggest environmental threat to human well-being in the 21st century.
Let's start with the concern about emissions during battery construction, a topic that comes up in almost every talk I give on this subject. Electric vehicle batteries require a lot of materials and electricity to manufacture, and that process does produce more greenhouse gas emissions than not making a battery.
But let's do the math as I've done for my family's two E.V.s. We got the first to replace our 10-year-old, gas-powered Subaru, and after only two years of driving, the E.V. has created fewer emissions over its lifetime than if we had kept the old car. It will take our second E.V. only four years to create fewer emissions over its lifetime than the 2005 hybrid Prius it replaced. That's counting the production of the batteries and the emissions from charging the E.V.s, and the emissions payback time will only continue to drop as more emissions-free wind and solar power comes onto the grid and battery technology improves.
My colleague Yue Qi, a battery researcher, recently told me, "Every prediction made 10 years ago about the change in price, efficiency and energy density of batteries was too pessimistic." For instance, an assessment from the Argonne National Laboratory found that the lifetime emissions of E.V.s dropped 40 percent between 2015 and 2020. Even 2020 is ancient history when you look at another oft-cited concern -- that we will run out of materials like lithium, cobalt and nickel to make batteries. Here again, it's a mistake to think present constraints will continue into the future given that the price of lithium has fallen roughly 70 percent from its high in 2022.
Cobalt, another key component of batteries, has been in the public eye because of its scarcity and the horrific working conditions for miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Those conditions need to be addressed, but it's a mistake to view them in isolation. Oil extraction has its own horrific human and environmental costs, as does climate change. In my view, relying on gas cars over electric vehicles is the bigger contributor to environmental injustice.
Happily, an increasing number of E.V.s, including those of Tesla and the Chinese automaker BYD, no longer use cobalt in their batteries in most markets because the performance of cobalt-free alternatives is rapidly improving. Within a decade, many batteries may be built with sodium in place of lithium, a trend already accelerating in China, the world's biggest market for electric vehicles. Again, our present concerns will most likely fade in the near future.
After batteries, the second most common question that comes up is about plug-in hybrids, which are cars that can run for about 25 to 50 miles on a smallish battery and then switch to a gas engine for longer trips. You might think that that's a pretty good compromise -- most car trips in the United States are, after all, under 25 miles, and if everyone had a plug-in hybrid, a vast majority of trips would be solely battery powered.
But what matters for emissions is not trips but miles, and long trips are where we really pile on the miles. That means about half of all miles driven in plug-in hybrids would still be driven using gas on long trips. Thus, buying a hybrid, rather than an electric vehicle, perpetuates our dependence on gas production and distribution, slowing -- rather than hastening -- the transition to a zero-emissions future. Simply put, we can't solve the climate crisis if we keep our gas infrastructure; only fully electric vehicles (coupled with clean electricity) can eliminate emissions from our cars.
Even without considering climate, anyone who has already switched to an electric vehicle knows it is more fun to drive, and saves time. My family doesn't have to spend time charging our E.V. every week for the simple reason that we charge our vehicle overnight at home and wake up to a full battery. And because electric vehicles have fewer parts -- no gas tank, no exhaust system, no catalytic converter, no radiator, no fuel injector, no timing belt -- downtime for repairs is practically eliminated.
Given all the benefits of electric vehicles, it's clear they should be the next car purchased by a vast majority of American drivers. And getting over our uncertainty is one of the biggest steps we can take toward a safer climate future.

Broadcom Closes Deal for Cloud Firm VMware
Broadcom on Wednesday closed its $ 69 billion acquisition of the cloud-computing firm VMware after receiving regulatory approval in its last major market, China, and ending a monthslong saga.
The deal, one of the biggest globally when announced in May 2022, was the latest in the chief executive Hock Tan's efforts to increase the chipmaker's software business.
China's regulatory approval came through on Tuesday after ongoing tensions with the U.S. around tougher chip export control measures had stoked fears among some investors on the company's ability to close the deal before the Nov. 26 deadline.
Big Tech mergers like Microsoft's now-closed $ 69 billion purchase of the "Call of Duty" publisher Activision have faced heightened regulatory pressure from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission under its chair Lina Khan. REUTERS

Volkswagen Will Raise Salaries at Factory 11%
Volkswagen said on Wednesday that it would raise salaries 11 percent for production workers at its assembly plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., weeks after the United Auto Workers union won major pay and benefit increases from the three Detroit automakers.
The company and other nonunion automakers in the U.S. have come under increased pressure to improve pay and benefits after the record contracts achieved by the U.A.W. in late October after thousands of its members went on a six-week targeted strike.
Honda and Toyota have raised wages for nonunion U.S. factory workers in recent weeks amid signs that the union is turning its attention to organizing the work force at foreign-owned and Tesla auto plants.
Hyundai Motor has also announced a 25 percent increase over the next four years for nonunion production workers in Alabama and Georgia. REUTERS
MANUFACTURING
Higher Borrowing Costs Could Hinder Deere
Deere forecast 2024 profits below analysts' expectations on Wednesday, saying high borrowing costs and tighter budgets will likely dent demand for the farm equipment maker's agriculture and construction machinery.
Deere, a barometer for the global economy, predicted a downturn in agriculture and construction equipment sales across all of its regions for the fiscal year ahead, validating analysts' concern that demand may have peaked for big industrial companies.
The company now expects 2024 net income between $ 7.75 billion and $ 8.25 billion, far below the consensus for $ 9.33 billion, according to LSEG data.
The heavy equipment maker's net income for the quarter rose to $ 2.37 billion, or $ 8.26 per share.
Despite beating Wall Street profit estimates, the manufacturer's stock slump mirrors peers such as Caterpillar that also outperformed forecasts. REUTERS

Musk Nods At Bigotry; X Loses Ads: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Disney, Apple, Paramount and Lionsgate halted marketing on X, formerly Twitter, as Elon Musk faced a furor over antisemitic abuse on his social media platform.
The blowback over Elon Musk's endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X gathered steam on Friday, as several major advertisers on his social media platform cut off their spending after his comments.
Disney said it was pausing spending on X, as did Lionsgate, the entertainment and film distribution company, and Paramount Global, the media giant that owns CBS. Apple, which spends tens of millions of dollars a year on X, also suspended advertising on the platform, a person with knowledge of the situation said. They followed IBM, which cut its spending with X on Thursday.
Mr. Musk, who bought Twitter last year and renamed it X, has been under scrutiny for months for allowing and even stoking antisemitic abuse on the site. That snowballed on Wednesday when the tech billionaire agreed with a post on X that accused Jewish people who are facing antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war of pushing the "exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them" and supporting the immigration of "hordes of minorities."
"You have said the actual truth," Mr. Musk replied.
Jewish groups have compared the statement in the original post to a belief known as replacement theory, a conspiracy theory that posits that nonwhite immigrants, organized by Jews, intend to replace the white race. That idea fueled Robert Bowers, who raged against Jewish people online before killing 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018.
On Friday, the White House condemned Mr. Musk, 52, for boosting the anti-Jewish conspiracy theory. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that it was "unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust."
An X spokesman declined to comment on the advertising pauses, and Apple didn't respond. Axios reported earlier on Apple's decision, and Bloomberg reported earlier on the Lionsgate suspension.
Linda Yaccarino, X's chief executive, posted on the site on Thursday that the company had been "extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination." But on Friday, Mr. Musk agreed with a post on X that suggested advertisers like IBM were pulling back from the platform to save face.
He later said accounts that made "clear calls for extreme violence" would be suspended, highlighting two phrases associated with Palestinian supporters that would not be tolerated on the site.
Advertisers have been skittish about X since Mr. Musk bought the social media service last fall and said he wanted more free speech and would loosen content moderation rules. That meant the platform could theoretically place brands' ads next to posts with offensive or hateful speech.
Many companies, including General Motors and Volkswagen, have balked at various points over the past year at having their promotions appear alongside a heavily documented surge in hate speech, misinformation and foreign propaganda on X. In April, Mr. Musk said nearly all advertisers had returned, without indicating whether they were spending at the same levels; he later noted that ad revenue had fallen 50 percent.
Mr. Musk also swung from threatening any advertisers that dared to pause their spending with a "thermonuclear name & shame" to wooing them by choosing Ms. Yaccarino, a former top ad executive at NBCUniversal, to replace him as chief executive. He picked public fights with major spenders like Apple and churned through sales executives given the task of maintaining relationships in the advertising industry. Top advertising companies, such as IPG, urged their clients to step back from X.
Advertising had long been about 90 percent of Twitter's revenue before Mr. Musk bought the company. Last month, X told employees that the company was valued at $ 19 billion. That was down from the $ 44 billion that Mr. Musk paid.
The heightened sensitivity around antisemitism, Mr. Musk's penchant for public squabbling and general fatigue after months of fuss over X left many advertising professionals hesitant to weigh in on Friday.
"Clients have always had to make decisions about content they will or will not be associated with," Renee Miller, the founder of the Miller Group advertising agency in Los Angeles, said in an email. "We generally counsel our clients to not take an openly public political stand."
IBM, which cut off about $ 1 million in advertising spending that it had committed to X for the rest of the year, said on Thursday that it had "zero tolerance for hate speech and discrimination." The tech company acted after a report this week from Media Matters for America, a left-wing advocacy group, which said ads from companies including Apple and IBM were appearing on X next to posts supporting white nationalism and Nazism.
Mr. Musk posted late Thursday that "Media Matters is an evil organization."
Angelo Carusone, president and chief executive of Media Matters, said Mr. Musk's "calling us evil" for pointing out what was on X was "not dissimilar from any right-wing account who we highlight."
He added that X was "not just going to just lose money with Apple, but also the cornerstone of their strategy to woo back advertisers."

The blowback over Elon Musk’s endorsement of an antisemitic conspiracy theory on X gathered steam Friday, as several major advertisers on his social media platform cut off their spending after his comments.
The Walt Disney Co. said it was pausing spending on X, as did Lionsgate, an entertainment and film distribution company, and Paramount Global, a media giant that owns CBS. Apple, which spends tens of millions of dollars a year on X, also suspended advertising on the platform, a person with knowledge of the situation said. They followed IBM, which cut its spending with X on Thursday.
Musk, who bought Twitter last year and renamed it X, has been under scrutiny for months for allowing and even stoking antisemitic abuse on the site. That snowballed Wednesday when the tech billionaire agreed with a post on X that accused Jewish people who are facing antisemitism amid the Israel-Hamas war of pushing the “exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them” and supporting the immigration of “hordes of minorities.”
“You have said the actual truth,” Musk replied.
Jewish groups have compared the statement in the original post to a belief known as replacement theory, a conspiracy theory that posits that nonwhite immigrants, organized by Jews, intend to replace the white race. That idea fueled Robert Bowers, who raged against Jewish people online before killing 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018.
On Friday, the White House condemned Musk, 52, for boosting the anti-Jewish conspiracy theory. Andrew Bates, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement that it was “unacceptable to repeat the hideous lie behind the most fatal act of antisemitism in American history at any time, let alone one month after the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust.”
An X spokesperson declined to comment on the advertising pauses, and Apple didn’t respond. Axios reported earlier on Apple’s decision, and Bloomberg reported earlier on the Lionsgate suspension.
Linda Yaccarino, X’s CEO, posted on the site Thursday that the company had been “extremely clear about our efforts to combat antisemitism and discrimination.” But Friday, Musk agreed with a post on X that suggested advertisers such as IBM were pulling back from the platform to save face.
He later said accounts that made “clear calls for extreme violence" would be suspended, highlighting two phrases associated with Palestinian supporters that would not be tolerated on the site.

U.S. Retail Sales Decline On Weakening Demand
Retail sales in the United States fell for the first time in seven months in October as motor vehicle purchases and spending on hobbies dropped, pointing to slowing demand at the start of the fourth quarter that further strengthened expectations the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates.
That was supported by other data on Wednesday showing the biggest decline in producer prices in three and a half years in October on the back of cheaper gasoline.
Retail sales slipped 0.1 percent last month, the Commerce Department said. Data for September was revised higher to show sales increasing 0.9 percent instead of the previously reported 0.7 percent rise.
Retail sales are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation. Sales were mixed last month, with receipts at motor vehicles and parts dealers falling 1.1 percent. REUTERS
RETAIL
Target Tops Expectations Under Weight of Inflation
Target on Wednesday reported a hefty third-quarter profit increase that handily beat Wall Street expectations as the retailer held down costs and cut inventory. Revenue slipped more than 4 percent, however, as customers saddled with broadly higher costs pulled back on spending as the holiday season nears.
The Minneapolis retailer has been trying to right itself after loading up with too much inventory last summer and was forced to discount heavily to clear it.
Target narrowed its outlook for the year as well on Wednesday.
More than half of Target's annual sales come from discretionary items like toys, fashion and electronic gadgets.
Target reported a 36 percent increase in third-quarter profit of $ 971 million, or $ 2.10 per share, easily beating Wall Street expectations. Revenue fell 4.2 percent to $ 25.4 billion. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Vatican Turns to E.V.s In a Deal With VW
The Vatican signed an agreement Wednesday with the German carmaker Volkswagen to gradually replace its auto fleet with electric vehicles as part of the Vatican's efforts to reduce its carbon emissions.
The announcement did not give any details on the value of the deal or set a timetable for completing the switch to electric vehicles.
The partnership falls under the Vatican's "Ecological Conversion 2030" plan, which aims to pursue sustainable, carbon-neutral projects and technologies in the city state in the center of Rome.
Pope Francis has made caring for the planet a hallmark of his papacy and will become the first pope to address a U.N. climate conference when he attends the COP28 meeting in Dubai.
In a statement, the Vatican said it was committed to pursuing netzero emissions technologies and sustainable transport projects to reduce the carbon footprint of its auto fleet. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Carmakers Downshift on E.V. Spending as Sales Growth Slows: [Business/Financial Desk]

Author: Ewing, Jack

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Growth is brisk but slower than expected, causing automakers to question their multibillion-dollar investments in new factories and raising doubts about the effectiveness of federal incentives.
Normally a 50 percent increase in sales is considered very good. But when the number of electric vehicles sold in the United States grew that much during the third quarter from a year earlier, it was a disappointment.
Carmakers and analysts had expected more. Instead of celebrating, auto executives worried that demand for electric vehicles was slackening, raising questions about their plans to invest tens of billions of dollars to develop new models and build factories.
In recent weeks, General Motors, Ford Motor and Tesla cited slower sales and signs that the economy was weakening in announcing that they would delay that spending. That was a blow to the Biden administration's plan to fight climate change by promoting zero-emission vehicles, and it cast doubt on whether generous federal tax credits for electric car buyers were working as well as policymakers had hoped.
"Our commitment to an all-E.V. future is as strong as ever," Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of G.M., told analysts on a conference call last month. But, she added, the market is turning out to be "a bit bumpy." As a result, G.M. is waiting several months to begin selling some new electric models, including a battery-powered incarnation of the Chevrolet Equinox sport utility vehicle.
Ford and G.M. have staked billions to retool factories and build new ones to produce electric vehicles, batteries and other components. If the carmakers have miscalculated, the consequences could be severe. (Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Jeep and Ram, has not yet begun selling any all-electric vehicles in the United States.)
Sales of electric vehicles in China and Europe are also growing more slowly than they were a few months ago.
Still, electric vehicle sales are growing faster than any other major category of automobile, and Americans will buy more than one million of them this year, a record. From July through September, battery-powered cars accounted for 8 percent of the new cars sold in the United States, up from 6 percent a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive.
But some once-hot models are selling more slowly. Sales of the Ford Mustang Mach-E, which commanded a stiff markup a year ago, slumped 10 percent in October from a year earlier, Ford said last week.
"E.V.s are still in high demand," Jim Farley, Ford's chief executive, told analysts. But he added that increased competition had pushed down prices.
Carmakers have introduced at least 14 new all-electric models in the last year, according to Cox, and stepped up production of other models that had been in short supply. Inevitably, some sell better than others.
"The demand is inching up, but it's not moving up nearly to the degree that supply and production is increasing," said Rob Cochran, chief executive of #1 Cochran Automotive, which owns 34 dealerships in Pennsylvania and Ohio that sell nearly all major brands, including Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Volkswagen.
Even Tesla -- which dominates the electric car market, with about half of all sales in the most recent quarter -- has struggled to sell cars and had to cut prices by thousands of dollars.
Some conservatives have seized on recent data to argue that electric vehicles are overhyped. Republicans like Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio have claimed electric vehicles are destroying auto industry jobs, and have proposed rolling back policies designed to encourage people to buy battery-powered cars.
A political agenda is driving some of those proclaiming an end to the electric vehicle boom, said Albert Gore III, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, an industry group whose members include carmakers like Tesla and Rivian, charging companies like EVgo and ChargePoint, and suppliers of equipment and raw materials.
"There are a lot of folks eager to draw a conclusion we should be less aggressive with policy," Mr. Gore said.
Some analysts said the uneven growth was not surprising as electric vehicles go from being a niche product to a more mass market offering. Most car owners are still learning about the technology, and carmakers and dealers are figuring out how best to sell to them.
"We had a lot of early adopters buy expensive electric vehicles," said Tom Narayan, global autos analyst at RBC Capital Markets. "Now you're at the point where the Main Street consumer is looking at E.V.s."
Ford illustrates the mixed signals that sales figures are sending. While sales of the Mach-E were up just 1.5 percent in the first 10 months of the year, sales of the F-150 Lightning, a battery-powered pickup, surged 43 percent. All told, sales of Ford electric vehicles rose 13 percent from January through October while sales of cars and trucks with internal combustion engines were up 7 percent. Sales of hybrid vehicles, which combine electric propulsion with internal combustion engines, climbed 19 percent.
The weak Mach-E sales probably reflect competition from the Tesla Model Y more than any broader trend, analysts said. Many buyers might be comparing the two vehicles, which are of a similar size and style. Tesla has cut the price of the Model Y so that the least expensive model is $ 2,500 less than the Ford after federal tax credits are applied.
The end of the United Automobile Workers' recent strikes against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis has refocused attention on traditional carmakers' attempts to compete with Tesla.
Electric vehicles played an important role in the U.A.W. negotiations, and tentative contract agreements extend at least some union privileges to workers at new battery factories. But the deals will increase manufacturing costs and make it that much harder for Ford, G.M. and Stellantis to catch up to Tesla, which is not unionized.
Buyers remain interested in electric vehicles, surveys show, but struggle to afford them. The average price paid for an electric vehicle in the United States was less than $ 51,000 in September, according to Cox Automotive. That's a huge decline from last year's $ 65,000. But it's still too high for many new-car buyers, especially as high interest rates have made monthly car payments more expensive. The average rate on a car loan is more than 8 percent, according to Federal Reserve data, compared with less than 5 percent in early 2022.
In the last few years, carmakers flooded the market with S.U.V.s aimed at affluent suburban homeowners. And there is still a dearth of cars priced below $ 30,000 that middle-class buyers can afford.
"A lot of automakers were rushing vehicles into the market," said Kevin Roberts, director of industry insights and analytics at CarGurus, an online car marketplace. "Now they're running into a situation in a rising interest rate environment that they are not priced properly."
Some would-be electric vehicle buyers may also be worried about finding enough places to quickly charge cars on road trips. After price, charging infrastructure is the No. 1 thing people worry about when considering an E.V., many surveys conclude.
Public charging is also essential for anyone who lives in an apartment or can't install a home charger, a group that skews young. "The younger demographic is more open to electric vehicles than the older demographic," Mr. Cochran, the Ohio and Pennsylvania dealer, said. "Typically it's the younger demographic that's in apartment settings. The fact that the infrastructure is not built up is a deterrent."
At least two of Mr. Cochran's customers returned newly purchased electric vehicles after discovering there weren't enough chargers near their homes, he said.
For people interested in buying an electric vehicle, the good news is that prices are likely to continue falling as carmakers ramp up new factories. Starting in January, dealers will be able to apply federal tax credits of up to $ 7,500 when a customer buys a car. Previously, buyers had to wait until they filed their taxes to claim the credit.
The charging system is also improving, albeit slowly. Parts of Tesla's network of fast chargers, the largest in the United States, will open to Ford, G.M. and other brands next year. Other carmakers are building their own chargers. Mercedes-Benz said last week that it would install at least 55 stations at high-end shopping malls in the United States and Canada operated by Simon Property Group, a large real estate firm.
Carmakers have gotten the message that selling electric vehicles is different from selling gasoline cars. "Charging," said Andrew Cornelia, chief executive of Mercedes's high-power charging unit in North America, "is still a critical problem to solve."

U.A.W. Gains May Have Set New Bar for Unions: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Experts said the union's new contracts could set precedents that give labor advantages when bargaining contracts and organizing workers.
Laying out a tentative contract agreement to end a six-week wave of walkouts at Ford Motor, the United Automobile Workers president made an unusual pitch to other labor unions.
"We invite unions around the country to align your contract expirations with our own," the U.A.W. leader, Shawn Fain, said Sunday night.
"If we're going to truly take on the billionaire class and rebuild the economy so that it starts to work for the benefit of the many and not the few," Mr. Fain added, "then it's important that we not only strike, but that we strike together."
While it remains to be seen whether other unions follow the U.A.W.'s lead, Mr. Fain's invitation highlights the sweeping ambition of the union's strategy during the recent strike, the first to target all three Detroit automakers simultaneously.
Beyond seeking the largest wage and benefit increases in decades -- and a reversal of the concessions the union made during the companies' downturn, such as lower wage tiers for newer workers -- Mr. Fain repeatedly spoke of fighting for "the entire working class."
Labor experts said the proposals that union negotiators agreed to with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Jeep, Ram and Chrysler, had produced gains that could in fact reverberate well beyond the workers that the union represented.
"It is a historic and transformative victory by the U.A.W.," said Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Dr. Lichtenstein said that winning substantial gains through a strike in a critical industry demonstrated the benefits of work stoppages after decades in which workers had been taught to regard strikes warily.
"Fain says: 'Hey, strikes work, solidarity works; we're more unified now than before the strike,"' he added. "I think that's a powerful argument unions can take elsewhere."
Even before the strike ended, unions at other companies appeared to be doing just that.
In an interview in late September, David Pryzbylski, a lawyer who represents employers, said union officials in two separate contract negotiations had invoked the U.A.W. when discussing the possibility of a strike. "Outside the U.A.W., it's putting wind in their sails," Mr. Pryzbylski said. "They may be blustering, but I am seeing it already trickle down."
A recent report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce raised concerns that an emboldened labor movement was increasing strike activity and "causing collateral damage to a host of local businesses and communities" by harming the economic ecosystem that depended on automakers and other employers.
The element of strategy that the U.A.W. brought to its strike may also prove instructive to other workers and unions. Rather than ask all employees to strike at once, the union started small, with one key plant at each of the Big Three, then ramped up as it sought to bring additional pressure. The U.A.W. refrained from expanding the strike when it felt a company was bargaining productively, and it expanded to a highly valuable plant when it felt a company was dragging its feet -- in both cases, to create an incentive for the companies to engage with the union.
The approach may not translate perfectly to other industries, such as retail and hospitality, that are harder to disrupt with the loss of a small number of locations. But Peter Olney, a former organizing director with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, said the strategy was more widely applicable than it might appear at first glance.
He cited the possibility of organizing and striking at coffee bean roasting plants and distribution centers for a company like Starbucks, where workers at hundreds of retail stores in the United States have organized over the past few years. "They have 9,000 locations, there's a lot of redundancy and replication," Mr. Olney said, referring to company-owned stores in the United States. "But there are some choke points in that system, too."
And it is difficult for service-sector industries to send operations offshore in response to labor unrest, because proximity to customers is critical. By contrast, the U.A.W. may have to contend with the risk that companies shift production to Mexico as labor costs increase.
"That's where the international solidarity aspect of it comes in -- the need to build up a cross-border network with Mexico," Mr. Olney said. Last year, workers at a large G.M. plant in the country voted out a union accused of colluding with management in favor of an independent union.
In some ways, the recent U.A.W. effort builds on the gains made by unions involved in other high-profile standoffs. To resolve a nearly five-month strike with Hollywood writers in September, major studios agreed to a set of restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence. The agreement was a break with employers' typical insistence that management should have control over technology and investment decisions.
The tentative U.A.W. contracts award the union more influence over such decision-making as well -- for example, by allowing workers to strike against the entire company over the threat of a plant shutdown before their contract has expired. The union also successfully pressed Stellantis to reopen an Illinois plant that the company had closed.
Mr. Pryzbylski, the management-side lawyer, said that while such strike provisions and plant reopenings are not unheard of, they are uncommon.
Dr. Lichtenstein said securing these gains in such a high-profile context could prompt employees at other companies to demand a say in decisions that their employers had typically characterized as management prerogatives. "It restores a kind of social and political character to investment decisions," he said. "It's something the left has wanted for over a century."
In other cases, the U.A.W. managed to extract concessions at plants where it doesn't yet represent workers -- another unusual win that could be mimicked by fellow unions. Ford agreed that U.A.W. members would be allowed to transfer into battery and electric vehicles plants under construction in Michigan and Tennessee, and that these plants would fall under the union's national contract if the workers unionized there. According to the U.A.W., that would happen without the need to hold a union election at either site.
Madeline Janis, co-executive director of Jobs to Move America, a group that seeks to create good jobs in clean technology industries, called these arrangements a "huge historic, unprecedented deal" for helping to ensure that the E.V. transition benefited workers.
U.A.W. officials say that adding new members is critical to the union's survival, and that the Big Three contracts will provide a major boost to these efforts because organizers can point to large concrete benefits of unionizing.
"We're not going to win a contract victory this big in the future if we're not able to start organizing, especially in the E.V. sector," said Mike Miller, a U.A.W. regional director in the Western United States. "It has to involve Tesla, Volkswagen and Hyundai."
But some experts said the momentum of the recent contracts could help organizing campaigns that were even further afield. "It's not just personal vehicle manufacturing -- it's the fleets of delivery vans, big electric buses and trains," said Erica Smiley, executive director of Jobs With Justice, which helps workers seeking to unionize and bargain collectively.
Ms. Smiley noted that many of these companies, just like electric vehicle manufacturers, had received public subsidies, creating an opportunity for organizers to appeal to politicians for help raising pay and improving benefits so that they more closely resembled what the U.A.W. just won.
"The administration is investing in these industries," she added. "The question is how to use this to raise the floor."

UAW Strike Gains Could Reverberate Far Beyond Autos

Laying out a tentative contract agreement to end a six-week wave of walkouts at Ford Motor, the United Auto Workers president made an unusual pitch to other labor unions.
“We invite unions around the country to align your contract expirations with our own,” the UAW leader, Shawn Fain, said Sunday night.
“If we’re going to truly take on the billionaire class and rebuild the economy so that it starts to work for the benefit of the many and not the few,” Fain added, “then it’s important that we not only strike, but that we strike together.”
While it remains to be seen whether other unions follow the UAW’s lead, Fain’s invitation highlights the sweeping ambition of the union’s strategy during the recent strike, the first to target all three Detroit automakers simultaneously.
Beyond seeking the largest wage and benefit increases in decades — and a reversal of the concessions the union made during the companies’ downturn, such as lower wage tiers for newer workers — Fain repeatedly spoke of fighting for “the entire working class.”
Labor experts said the proposals that union negotiators agreed to with Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Jeep, Ram and Chrysler, had produced gains that could in fact reverberate well beyond the workers that the union represented.
“It is a historic and transformative victory by the UAW,” said Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Lichtenstein said that winning substantial gains through a strike in a critical industry demonstrated the benefits of work stoppages after decades in which workers had been taught to regard strikes warily.
“Fain says: ‘Hey, strikes work, solidarity works; we’re more unified now than before the strike,’” he added. “I think that’s a powerful argument unions can take elsewhere.”
Even before the strike ended, unions at other companies appeared to be doing just that.
In an interview in late September, David Pryzbylski, a lawyer who represents employers, said union officials in two separate contract negotiations had invoked the UAW when discussing the possibility of a strike. “Outside the UAW, it’s putting wind in their sails,” Pryzbylski said. “They may be blustering, but I am seeing it already trickle down.”
A recent report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce raised concerns that an emboldened labor movement was increasing strike activity and “causing collateral damage to a host of local businesses and communities” by harming the economic ecosystem that depended on automakers and other employers.
The element of strategy that the UAW brought to its strike may also prove instructive to other workers and unions. Rather than ask all employees to strike at once, the union started small, with one key plant at each of the Big Three, then ramped up as it sought to bring additional pressure. The UAW refrained from expanding the strike when it felt a company was bargaining productively, and it expanded to a highly valuable plant when it felt a company was dragging its feet — in both cases, to create an incentive for the companies to engage with the union.
The approach may not translate perfectly to other industries, such as retail and hospitality, that are harder to disrupt with the loss of a small number of locations. But Peter Olney, a former organizing director with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, said the strategy was more widely applicable than it might appear at first glance.
He cited the possibility of organizing and striking at coffee bean roasting plants and distribution centers for a company such as Starbucks, where workers at hundreds of retail stores in the United States have organized over the past few years. “They have 9,000 locations, there’s a lot of redundancy and replication,” Olney said, referring to company-owned stores in the United States. “But there are some choke points in that system, too.”
And it is difficult for service-sector industries to send operations offshore in response to labor unrest, because proximity to customers is critical. By contrast, the UAW may have to contend with the risk that companies shift production to Mexico as labor costs increase.
“That’s where the international solidarity aspect of it comes in — the need to build up a cross-border network with Mexico,” Olney said. Last year, workers at a large GM plant in the country voted out a union accused of colluding with management in favor of an independent union.
In some ways, the recent UAW effort builds on the gains made by unions involved in other high-profile standoffs. To resolve a nearly five-month strike with Hollywood writers in September, major studios agreed to a set of restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence. The agreement was a break with employers’ typical insistence that management should have control over technology and investment decisions.
The tentative UAW contracts award the union more influence over such decision-making as well — for example, by allowing workers to strike against the entire company over the threat of a plant shutdown before their contract has expired. The union also successfully pressed Stellantis to reopen an Illinois plant that the company had closed.
Pryzbylski, the management-side lawyer, said that while such strike provisions and plant reopenings are not unheard of, they are uncommon.
Lichtenstein said securing these gains in such a high-profile context could prompt employees at other companies to demand a say in decisions that their employers had typically characterized as management prerogatives. “It restores a kind of social and political character to investment decisions,” he said. “It’s something the left has wanted for over a century.”
In other cases, the UAW managed to extract concessions at plants where it doesn’t yet represent workers — another unusual win that could be mimicked by fellow unions. Ford agreed that UAW members would be allowed to transfer into battery and electric vehicles plants under construction in Michigan and Tennessee, and that these plants would fall under the union’s national contract if the workers unionized there. According to the UAW, that would happen without the need to hold a union election at either site.
Madeline Janis, co-executive director of Jobs to Move America, a group that seeks to create good jobs in clean technology industries, called these arrangements a “huge historic, unprecedented deal” for helping to ensure that the EV transition benefited workers.
UAW officials say that adding new members is critical to the union’s survival, and that the Big Three contracts will provide a major boost to these efforts because organizers can point to large concrete benefits of unionizing.
“We’re not going to win a contract victory this big in the future if we’re not able to start organizing, especially in the EV sector,” said Mike Miller, a UAW regional director in the Western United States. “It has to involve Tesla, Volkswagen and Hyundai.”

U.A.W. Deal Won't Put Ford At a Disadvantage, Analysts Say: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A tentative agreement gives union members at the carmaker their best terms in decades but could complicate Ford's electric vehicle plans.
When autoworkers went on strike in September, executives of the large U.S. automakers warned that union demands could significantly undermine their ability to compete in a fast-changing industry. The chief executive of Ford Motor said that the company might have to scrap its investment in electric vehicles.
The future doesn't look quite that bleak now that Ford and the United Automobile Workers union have reached a tentative agreement that is likely to serve as a template for deals the union eventually reaches with General Motors and Stellantis, the maker of Ram, Jeep and Chrysler.
Ford's costs will rise under the terms of the new contract, which includes a 25 percent raise over four and a half years, improved retirement benefits and other provisions. The extra expense will weigh on profit and could hamper Ford's ability to invest in new technology, John Lawler, the company's chief financial officer, said Thursday.
But some analysts said the increases should be manageable. What will matter more for the company's prospects, they said, is how innovative and efficient the company is in designing and producing cars and technology that can compete with offerings from Tesla, which dominates electric vehicles, the auto industry's fastest growing segment.
"They haven't agreed to anything that will kill their competitiveness," said Joshua Murray, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University who is an author of a book that examined how U.S. automakers lost ground to Japanese and European rivals. He said the deal could even help Ford, in part because the four-year contract ensures there would be no labor strife during an intense phase of the transition to electric vehicles.
"They won't be engaged in labor conflict while they're dealing with" the technology shift, Mr. Murray said.
Ford said on Thursday that it earned $ 1.2 billion from July through September on revenue of $ 44 billion; the company lost $ 827 million in the third quarter of 2022. But the division that makes electric vehicles lost $ 1.3 billion because of investments in new technology and increasing competition that has pushed down prices.
The roughly 17,000 Ford workers who had been on strike, out of a total of 57,000 U.A.W. employees at the company, are expected to begin returning to factories soon. At U.A.W. Local 900 in Wayne, Mich., across the street from a Ford plant that was one of the first three factories to be struck by the U.A.W., workers were disposing of signs, firewood and bottled water that had been stockpiled for picket lines.
"This is the best contract I have seen in my 30 years with Ford," said Robert Carter, 49, who works with engineers to lay out work stations on the assembly line. He said younger workers who had been earning well below the top wage of $ 32 an hour would see the biggest impact with the new contract; their pay would rise to more than $ 40 an hour over the next four and a half years.
"For some people, their pay is going to almost double," he said. "How can you say that's not huge?"
The reaction on Wall Street suggested that investors did not regard the agreement as a catastrophe. The carmaker's shares fell 1.7 percent during regular trading on Thursday.
But Ford stock slumped almost 5 percent in after-hours trading after the company said that, because of the cost of the strike, it could no longer stand by an earlier estimate that profit before interest expenses and taxes would be $ 11 billion to $ 12 billion in 2023. Mr. Lawler also said that strike would cost the company $ 1.3 billion this year.
Analysts at Barclays estimated the annual cost of pay raises, improved retirement benefits and other measures in the new union contract to be $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion annually by the end of the four-year contract period, or equivalent to about 1 percent of sales.
Mr. Lawler said on a conference call that the contract would raise the company's labor costs by an average of $ 850 to $ 900 per vehicle. He said Ford would try to "identify efficiencies and improve productivity to help us deliver on our targets" in light of those higher labor costs.
Some analysts were critical of the deal with the U.A.W., saying the cost to Ford could put it at a significant disadvantage, perhaps prompting the company to move more production to Mexico.
"It adds a constraint in a very competitive market," said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive. "It's definitely a compromise that, I think, down the road will either limit Ford's performance or force them to consider alternatives."
During the contentious negotiations, Ford complained that a big raise for workers would put it even further behind Tesla in the electric vehicle market. Sales of Ford's two main battery-powered models, the F-150 Lightning truck and the Mustang Mach-E sport-utility vehicle, have been disappointing this year, and the company recently scaled back plans to increase production of the Lightning.
"There is tremendous downward pressure on E.V. pricing," Mr. Lawler said.
But Tesla and other automakers like Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan and Honda, whose factories in the United States do not have unions, may now face pressure to raise wages, eroding any cost advantage they might have had.
The U.A.W. has declared its intention to try to organize those factories. The pay agreement with Ford, by far the biggest boost in compensation that the union has won in decades, is likely to serve as a powerful advertisement for collective bargaining.
"Elon Musk better be looking at this," said Madeline Janis, executive director of Jobs to Move America, an advocacy group that has close ties to organized labor. "Hyundai and Toyota better be looking at this. This is a new era where workers are standing up."
Tesla, the company Mr. Musk runs, and other carmakers that don't have union workers in the United States, like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, may decide to pre-emptively hand out raises to keep labor organizers at bay.
"One strategy to deter union organizing is to raise wages," said Rebecca Kolins Givan, an associate professor of labor studies and employment relations at Rutgers University.
The decisive factor in the electric vehicle market will be the ability of Ford, G.M. and Stellantis to produce innovative products, Ms. Givan and others said. That is the responsibility of management, not assembly line workers.
"It's clear that these companies have work to do in the electric vehicle market," Ms. Givan said. "There is nothing in this contract that creates any constraints."
In addition to the 25 percent pay increase, the contract gives Ford's hourly workers cost-of-living wage adjustments, major gains on pensions and job security, and the right to strike over plant closings. The union had initially asked for a 40 percent wage increase.
Ford has not yet set dates for restarting plants idled by the strike. The company previously said it could take up to four weeks to reach full production. Ford also needs some 600 suppliers to resume production and to deliver parts.
"Bringing a plant back up is much more difficult than taking it down," Bryce Currie, vice president of Americas manufacturing at Ford, said this month.
Workers at the Wayne plant, which makes the Ranger pickup and the Bronco sport-utility vehicle, had not received return-to-work orders on Thursday, but they expected to be back on the assembly line next week.
Walter Robinson, 57, has worked at the Wayne plant for 34 years and expects to retire by the end of the new contract. But he said three of his children work for Ford and would see a big benefit from the new terms.
"My daughter has only been here two years, and it was going to take years for her to get the top wage," he said. "This is going to help her immensely. This is going to make all of their lives better."

Not in U.A.W. But Still Part Of the Strike: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The three U.S. automakers say they are already at a disadvantage to nonunion rivals while labor leaders hope that big gains in negotiations will inspire workers in Southern states to unionize.
Tens of thousands of people who work for Toyota in Kentucky, Mercedes-Benz in Alabama or Tesla in Texas are technically not involved in the high-stakes negotiations taking place between labor and management in and around Detroit.
But they are very much a presence.
Executives at Ford Motor, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent of Chrysler, invoke nonunion automakers, many of them in the South, as a competitive threat that makes it impossible for them to meet striking workers' demands for big raises, more generous benefits and better working conditions.
"Toyota, Honda, Tesla and others are loving this strike because they know the longer it goes on, the better it is for them," Bill Ford, the executive chair of Ford Motor, said in Michigan last week. "They will win, and all of us will lose."
The United Automobile Workers union sees such statements as an attempt to play workers off one another. It views the strikes, entering their sixth week, as a first step toward better pay for not only U.A.W. members but also the nonunion workers that it plans to recruit in the future.
"We won't be used in this phony competition," Shawn Fain, the U.A.W. president, said on Friday, reacting to Mr. Ford's speech. He added, "Nonunion autoworkers are not the enemy. Those are our future union family."
The pay gap between union and nonunion factories has long been a point of contention. Some industry executives have argued that high union wages were a big reason G.M. and Chrysler had to resort to bankruptcy after the 2008 financial crisis.
Union leaders and progressive lawmakers have asserted that the growth of nonunion manufacturing, mostly in the South but also in the Midwest and West, has helped to erode the middle class over the past several decades.
Veteran union autoworkers tend to make more than production workers who are not represented by unions. They often have more say in their schedules and overtime work.
But starting pay at Ford, G.M. and Stellantis factories can be lower than at nonunion factories. And the pay of nonunion workers at Southern auto plants tends to go further because the cost of living there is lower than it is in the Midwest.
Even the geographic divide between union and nonunion plant is not always as clear as it may seem. Toyota and Honda have plants in the South, where unions are weak, but they also have factories in Ohio and Indiana, where unions are stronger. And G.M. and Ford have union operations in Kentucky, Tennessee and Texas.
The debate about auto industry wages has become more urgent as automakers invest billions to build factories that produce batteries for electric cars. Most of those factories are being built in Southern states, like Georgia and Tennessee, where local laws make it more difficult for unions to organize a factory.
"A good agreement with the Detroit Three would be powerful because it gives union organizers better arguments for joining the union," said Ian Greer, a Cornell research professor who studies the effect of electric vehicles on labor.
Even with a union wage of almost $ 32 an hour from her job assembling chassis at a Ford factory in Chicago, Schataan Lyke said she did not have it easy. She is the sole breadwinner for three children and worries about how to afford a prom dress for her oldest.
Ms. Lyke, who has been on strike, said she was glad to have the union behind her. "You've got someone on the outside fighting for you," she said.
But Ms. Lyke, 37, has it better than people doing similar work in the South. At a Nissan factory in Canton, Miss., Morris Mock, 49, makes about $ 1 less than Ms. Lyke per hour even with more than 20 years of experience, he said.
An attempt to unionize Nissan in 2017 failed to win enough support from workers. That means Mr. Mock, one of the people who led the union drive, will not benefit directly from the contract that the U.A.W. works out with automakers. But he said he was glad the union was fighting to protect wages as the industry switched to electric vehicles.
"The market is about to change," Mr. Mock said. "I'm glad that they understand that we must put workers first."
Government statistics suggest wide regional pay gaps. Michigan autoworkers make 22 percent more than production workers in Tennessee, 23 percent more than South Carolina workers and 28 percent more than Alabama workers, according to a Census Bureau survey. Those figures include people who work for suppliers, where pay is often lower than in factories that assemble vehicles.
Some labor experts said the bigger difference between union and nonunion autoworkers had less to do with pay and more with things like mandatory overtime and the scheduling of shifts. Union workers tend to have more say in those matters.
The auto industry has been moving South for decades, drawn by lower costs, weak unions and local government incentives. Foreign automakers have often chosen sites in the South when they set up factories in the United States. BMW and Volvo Cars have factories in South Carolina; Mercedes and Hyundai in Alabama; Toyota in Kentucky; and Volkswagen in Tennessee.
Most of the foreign automakers do not disclose what they pay their workers. Volkswagen, an exception, said the starting pay at its factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., was $ 21.10 for hourly production workers. Veteran workers earn more than $ 29, the company said.
Foreign automakers concentrated in the South sometimes pay their U.S. workers more than Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, according to a study by EY for Autos Drive America, an industry association that represents Nissan, Toyota, Mercedes and others.
The average starting wage at foreign automakers was $ 19 an hour, the survey said, more than the $ 17 starting wage for U.A.W. members. But the average maximum pay at the foreign automakers was $ 28, compared with $ 32 for U.A.W. members under the current contract.
A Nissan spokesman declined to say how much the company pays its U.S. workers, but he said the average was higher than that reported by the Autos Drive America survey.
Tesla, which is based in Texas and has factories there and in Buffalo; Fremont, Calif.; and Sparks, Nev., does not disclose what it pays its workers, but the Detroit automakers say it is less than what they pay.
Ford has said its labor costs, including benefits and bonuses, are 40 percent more per worker than Tesla's. That figure does not include stock awards that at least some Tesla employees receive. On Tesla's website, job advertisements for a production associate pay $ 20 to $ 23 an hour.
Even if autoworker pay in Alabama or Mississippi is less than what it is in Michigan or Illinois, it is often more than what employers in other industries pay in those places.
Working conditions are often a bigger issue than pay, labor representatives say.
In February, Emily Erickson of the University of Warwick in England and Berneece Herbert of Jackson State University published a survey of 211 workers at Mercedes's factory in Vance, Ala., near Tuscaloosa.
The workers reported earning an average of $ 27 an hour at Mercedes, high for the region. But they said they were forced to work overtime or change their work schedules with little notice. Almost half worked more than 50 hours a week. The study also found that white workers made an average of $ 3 more per hour than Black workers.
Mercedes denied that it discriminates. "Our pay structure is equal for all team members regardless of race, age or ethnic origin, and our pay progressions are based on seniority," the company said in a statement.
It noted that the company employed 6,000 people in Alabama, suggesting that the study sampled too few workers. "We do not agree with its conclusions," Mercedes said.
The gulf between pay in the South and the North is certain to widen when Ford, G.M. and Stellantis agree on new contracts with the U.A.W. The union is demanding a 40 percent increase over four years. Ford, G.M. and Stellantis have already offered raises of 23 percent and could go higher.
Unions have made some progress in the South recently. Workers at Blue Bird, which makes school buses in Georgia, voted to join the United Steelworkers in May and are negotiating a contract. Workers at ZF, which makes axles for Mercedes in Alabama, ended a monthlong strike last week after the German company agreed to raise the top hourly wage to $ 23.
Labor leaders say they have already been deluged with calls from workers at Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai who expressed interest in organizing unions. Workers at Volkswagen voted not to join the union in 2019, but the environment may be different this time.
"These workers will say, 'Look what the U.A.W. did for these workers at G.M., Ford and Stellantis,"' said Tim Smith, director of U.A.W. Region 8, which includes all of the Southeast.
"We've got organizers on the ground there right now," he said. "We're starting to make our move."

Tesla Says Justice Department Is Broadening Inquiry Into the Company's Business Practices: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The Department of Justice has sought documents related to vehicle range and "personal benefits," Tesla said.
The Department of Justice has expanded its inquiry into Tesla's business practices to include how far its vehicles can travel on a full charge and "personal benefits" to high-ranking executives or large shareholders, the company said without elaborating.
The disclosure followed recent news reports that the carmaker appears to have misled customers about how far its vehicles could travel before needing to be plugged in.
Tesla also said in a regulatory filing that the government had subpoenaed documents related to "personal benefits" and unidentified "related parties," a term that often refers to top management, company directors or large shareholders.
The U.S. attorney's office in New York has looked into whether funds were misused in a planned house for Elon Musk, the company's chief executive, near Tesla's factory in Austin, Texas, The Wall Street Journal reported in August. The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment on Monday.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
"To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred," the company said in the filing, a quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Tesla said it was cooperating with the authorities.
Reuters and Consumer Reports have reported that Tesla vehicles fell short, in road testing, of the range indicated by the Environmental Protection Agency, which tests cars on rollers in a laboratory. Carmakers have some discretion in how they configure cars for the tests and can influence the results.
The range of all battery powered cars suffers in cold weather, but a Tesla Model Y sport utility vehicle that Consumer Reports tested fell at least 50 miles short of the claimed range even in warm weather.
The Ford Mach-E and Volkswagen ID.4 S.U.V.s exceeded their claimed warm-weather ranges when tested by Consumer Reports under identical conditions as the Tesla vehicle. A Hyundai Ioniq 5 came within two miles of its E.P.A. range.
Tesla had earlier disclosed that the Justice Department had issued subpoenas for documents related to its self-driving software. Tesla is the target of lawsuits claiming the software played a major role in accidents that caused deaths and injuries and does not live up to the claims about its performance made by Mr. Musk and the company.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the S.E.C., and various local and international authorities have also requested information, Tesla said without providing details.
Tesla's shares have fallen 13 percent since Wednesday when the company reported that profit in the third quarter slumped 44 percent after it slashed prices of its models.

Restaurants Are Different After Covid. That's a Good Thing.: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Like so many other chefs, I was drawn to the restaurant business because it is exciting. I ignored its dysfunction and accepted that I'd forgo higher education, financial stability and holidays with family in order to share my craft with others.
All it took was a pandemic, an enormous wave of inflation and an impossibly tight job market to force me and many others to burrow to the very core of what a restaurant does for its guests, workers and community and redefine it from the ground up.
This is the silver lining of the pandemic and the never-ending economic uncertainty that has ensued: More places are finally figuring out how to make this business an actual business.
The start of my story is a typical one. I gleefully started skipping school to work in kitchens at 15, then shipped off to New York to experience all kinds of "character building" abuse, and by my early 30s, I had made it in San Francisco as an executive chef ... which meant 80-hour workweeks while barely scraping by.
I eventually struck out on my own, deciding to play it safe by opening a restaurant with a normal business model. And as is usually the case, normal sucked. Our 80 seats were full every night, employing great folks and serving great food and cocktails -- and sweating our $ 11,000 rent and roughly $ 90,000 payroll each month. Structurally, our mission to price affordably had landed us in the death zone: full service yet unable to charge fine-dining prices. The anxiety was weapons grade.
The standard model for a business almost all of us engage with regularly, the one we frequently post our own reviews about, has barely worked for a majority of the more than 12 million people it employs. The restaurant industry accounts for some 4 percent of the G.D.P. in the United States but has been stuck in a deeply flawed business model with sadly outdated practices. The pandemic only brought this reality to the center of the plate and made it something we couldn't push aside anymore.
Yet I find deep meaning and purpose in the work in a way I can't quite put my finger on, something to do with providing for other human beings.
Then it was March 2020. I was sitting at the redwood table I'd recently finished staining for my barely year-old restaurant, digesting the news that the night's party of 18 had just canceled. Something called Covid-19 was causing our bookings to disappear. It was also emptying grocery shelves; a friend asked to buy three flats of eggs. Right next to me sat a stack of invoices.
My egg friend also desperately needed paper towels, since evidently grocery stores were out of those, too. I took his order, took this as a sign and flipped our space into a general store. It took off, we even hired people, and that stack of bills was soon paid, which felt like a triumph. But after five chaotic months of repackaging bulk food, the supply chain adjusted, shelves at traditional grocers refilled, and the floor fell out from underneath us again, only more so. On Aug. 11, 2020, almost the same day Congress decided it would go on recess without any agreement for additional small business aid, I made the gut-wrenching decision to close, adding me and my staff to the country's devastating unemployment statistics.
I needed to find some work or to create some, and I remembered a crazy idea I had years ago while driving back home to Iowa. My mind was deep in "I'm so frustrated with the miserable economics of my chosen profession" territory as I passed a used R.V. lot. I chuckled and thought, "Maybe you should just open a tiny private dining room."
I chuckled again nervously as I recalled it. Then I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations and scraped together $ 18,000 to buy a 1989 Volkswagen camper I found on Craigslist.
I renamed the van SuperStella and rebuilt her with a surprisingly luxurious (yes, really) dining room for four. For 11 months starting in November 2020, SuperStella served two Covid-safe seatings a night in a private lot that had a commanding view of the Bay Bridge and its twinkling lights. For a check that ranged from $ 88 to $ 165 a person, diners enjoyed a glamping-themed menu of things like whole grilled trout with nasturtium butter poured from a thermos and a fat slice of grilled milk bread with salted maple butter shaved over it for dessert. I was the waiter, sommelier and cook. Not only did I get tons of vitamin D (for once) and bring joy to some lockdown-fatigued diners, but thanks to the fact that I had low to no overhead, I was also making a comfortable living for the first time in my career.
Was SuperStella a restaurant? Technically, no: I'd navigated some regulatory gray area by designating it as catering and the private lot as a venue. It would be only temporary, since operating longer would have been a case study in navigating bureaucracy. (No, thanks.) But I was emboldened to believe that whatever I did next could and would make money. All I had to do was throw out the definition of how a restaurant normally works and start over from scratch.
Fast-forward to today. Most days, you'll find me at my new pasta shop in a residential neighborhood on the west side of San Francisco, where we've rethought pretty much everything in order to create a sustainable business model.
Standard restaurant logic dictates that your dining room be as big as possible, but we cut ours in half (to just 35 seats) so the business has an additional leg to stand on: a retail shop that is open all day selling freshly made pastas, sauces and high-end pantry items, all of it prepared and curated for people to make easy dinners at home.
Our consistent retail traffic balances most seasonal ups and downs; when young diners are at Burning Man, families still swing by to grab bucatini and olive oil. Granted, a minuscule dining room means no massive Friday night sales, but that's a welcome trade-off for better consistency throughout the week, and that consistency gives us the freedom to operate with less complexity and fewer moving parts.
Our restaurant is walk-in only, so we don't pay an online reservation platform or lose money on no-shows. Our tiny menu is efficient and minimizes waste. Our product, pasta, is affordable enough to keep profit margins sufficient even during inflationary periods. Most important, guests order at the front door with the host before being pointed to their (fully set) table, which eliminates 15 minutes of profit-killing dead time at the beginning of each meal.
It's becoming common for us to do more than four turns on a table at night. The faster we turn tables, the stronger our sales are. The more we do with less, the better our margins are. Better margins enable us to price more competitively and pass on our savings at a time when everyone is feeling the squeeze; almost all of our pastas are under $ 20. Our staff is paid competitively, and even I am taking home a regular, decent paycheck, something that happened only occasionally before.
Admittedly, not everyone is into how we do things. We've had ... incidents. People have railed about our small (totally fine and indestructible!) wineglasses on Yelp and occasionally complain we're overpriced (which would happen even if we paid people to eat here). Once in a while, someone will voice a big opinion about our service charge, which is 15 percent of the pretax bill. This is a step toward moving away completely from the outdated practice of tipping and will eventually, hopefully, evolve into an all-in pricing model that factors employees' wages into the menu prices.
Most diners come around. Some don't. We do play Nirvana a little loud.
You might have noticed more top-rated restaurants have summoned the nerve to charge you reservation fees or for entire meals up front and more prix fixe dinners instead of the be-everything-to-everyone menus we've gotten so used to. You'll probably see some offbeat service models.
Embrace it, because a lot of this stuff is working for us and will work for you.
Some experiments -- such as QR code menus in formal settings -- may need to fade back to wherever they came from. And hopefully, the best parts will work their way through, just as farm to table did; even my hometown in Iowa has an excellent version.
Resetting expectations is messy work, definitely not glamorous or Instagrammable. But it's part of the next phase for restaurants -- a sector that grew from carrying a stigma as transitory, low-prestige work to becoming lauded and respected over time. If chefs, servers and diners all play our part in this next chapter, that troubled industry will play a more crucial role as a load-bearing pillar of our culture and economy.

Pret Plans to Accelerate Expansion in the U.S.
Pret A Manger is planning to expand its U.S. footprint more than fivefold to 300 stores by 2029, as the British sandwich and coffee chain looks to double its overall business, its chief executive, Pano Christou, told Reuters on Friday.
Pret has struck a partnership with its existing franchisee Dallas International to accelerate its U.S. expansion through new openings, store renovations and new formats, Christou said.
With about 58 U.S. outlets currently, Pret is focused on opening more stores in regional and suburban areas and targeting transport hubs, moving beyond its traditional focus on cities and office-oriented locations.
A similar move in the U.K. in 2021 helped Pret revive its business after sales were crimped during the pandemic.
Christou added Pret was growing ten times faster outside of urban centers in the U.K., where it has more than 450 stores. REUTERS
Earnings
Resilient Amex Reports Healthy Quarterly Gains
American Express on Friday reported third-quarter profit that beat expectations, helped by resilient spending from its wealthy customers who shrugged off concerns about an economic downturn.
Amex, which caters to a premium customer base, has largely been able to mitigate the hit from inflation and the Federal Reserve's rate hikes, which have made borrowing costly and reined in discretionary spending.
"It appears that the firm's relatively affluent cardholder base is providing it with a level of credit protection not shared by many of its peers," Morningstar analyst Michael Miller said. "The sequential resiliency of American Express's credit metrics is a noticeable contrast to other consumer lenders, who did see continued deterioration during the quarter."
Amex reported a profit of $ 3.30 per share, up from $ 2.47 per share a year earlier. REUTERS
AUTOMOBILES
Volkswagen Reduces
Its Profit Margin Outlook
Volkswagen cut its profit margin outlook for the current year on Friday, blaming negative effects from raw materials hedges at the end of the third quarter.
For Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, this led to a 2.5 billion-euro ( $ 2.7 billion) non-cash loss that it will be unable to offset by the end of the year, it said in a statement.
The company said it now expected an operating profit before special items in 2023 that would be at the prior year level of 22.5 billion euros, indicating a return on sales of 7.0 percent to 7.3 percent, down from 7.5 percent to 8.5 percent forecast previously.
"But this may be better than some investors have feared and could spell an end to negative sentiment on the name for now," Bernstein analysts wrote.
Volkswagen kept its outlook for deliveries and sales, still expecting to hand between 9 million and 9.5 million vehicles to clients this year. REUTERS

Climate Researcher's Refusal to Fly To Reduce Footprint Gets Him Fired: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: To reduce emissions, he took five trains, nine buses, two ferries, two taxis, one shared car and one police convoy to reach a research site.
Getting from the northern German city of Kiel to the South Pacific is a schlep no matter what. By commercial air, it takes about two days and several connecting flights.
But Gianluca Grimalda, an Italian social scientist, opted to make the trip much, much longer when he set out from Kiel to Papua New Guinea on a research trip earlier this year.
To journey the 14,038 miles, he took five trains, nine buses, two ferries, two taxis, one shared car, one police convoy and, when there were no other options, two flights. Dr. Grimalda did this out of concern for the climate, wanting to generate as few planet-heating emissions as possible, even though the whole trip took 35 days.
But he said his plan to journey back to Kiel much the same way cost him his job.
On Wednesday, Dr. Grimalda said he was being fired from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank, after refusing to take transcontinental flights back from Papua New Guinea.
"Many people asked me if I regret not catching a plane to go back," Dr. Grimalda wrote by email. "And my answer is no."
"I have a moral commitment to this type of travel," he later said in a phone interview from Papua New Guinea. "To be at peace within myself knowing that I have done the absolute right thing."
Elisabeth Radke, a spokeswoman for the Kiel Institute, said the organization would not publicly comment on personnel matters, but largely supported climate-friendly travel and had "no general reservations about slow traveling." She also said the Kiel Institute had supported Dr. Grimalda's slow travel plans before.
Yet on Sept. 27, Dr. Grimalda said he was told that he had until Oct. 2 to return to Kiel, or be dismissed. To him, flying back was inconceivable. His research included the effects of climate change on the people of Bougainville, Papua New Guinea, which is part of the Solomon Islands chain, a remote, economically stricken archipelago being swallowed up by rising oceans. He said he had promised local residents that his return trip would be low carbon.
"White men (as we're called here) are often referred to as giaman (= liars, fraudsters)," he wrote on X, formerly Twitter, adding that he didn't want to be giaman.
Dr. Grimalda said he first committed to avoiding flying whenever possible in 2010, and had the support of the Kiel Institute, where he began working in 2013.
He said his relationship with the organization grew fraught last year, after he joined a protest with Scientist Rebellion, a group of scientists engaged in climate activism, and glued his hand to the floor of a Volkswagen museum in Germany. Dr. Grimalda said supervisors at Kiel warned him that similar actions could get him fired. The next month, he partook in a brief blockade of a private Italian airport while on vacation there. Though neither action led to his arrest, the actions drew attention from the press.
Dr. Grimalda and the Kiel Institute both agreed that he had its support when he presented his plan to travel slowly to Papua New Guinea in February.
But Dr. Grimalda said his fieldwork had lasted seven weeks longer than expected, partly due to a volcanic eruption and security threats; he said he was held hostage by a group of machete-wielding bandits. After learning that the Kiel Institute expected that he fly back, Dr. Grimalda went public, posting about its warning on social media. "There is nothing I must do in Kiel that I cannot do while traveling," he said. "Nothing."
Dr. Grimalda said traveling by plane from Germany to Papua New Guinea would create 5.3 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per person, about a dozen times more than the 420 kilograms of carbon dioxide slow travel would generate.
He acknowledged that one trip by plane would create just a fraction of the total greenhouse gas emissions generated by aviation; commercial flights are responsible for about 3 percent of worldwide emissions.
But Dr. Grimalda said there was research showing that climate scientists who worked to reduce their carbon footprint were more persuasive than those who did not. As of Thursday, he was still in Bougainville, with plans to leave by cargo ship and then to travel by ferry, bus and train back to Kiel, where he will appeal his firing.
"I understand not everyone has the privilege to be able to travel 50 days," he said. But he hoped to inspire others to do more to help the Earth.
"Many people tell me I'm crazy, that I'm not going to change anything," Dr. Grimalda said. "To me it's crazy to go on like a herd of sheep going toward the cliff without trying to sound the alarm."

China's E.V. Companies Pull Ahead With a Lot of Government Support: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Chinese electric vehicle companies like Nio are pulling ever further ahead, partly through government support but also through rapid technological advances.
Nio, a Chinese electric car company that competes with Tesla, employs 11,000 people in research and development, but sold a mere 8,000 cars per month from April through June.
It has invested so extensively in robots that one of its factories employs just 30 technicians to make 300,000 electric car motors a year. Nio offers $ 350 augmented reality glasses for each seat in its cars, and has introduced a cellphone that interacts with the car's self-driving system.
And none of it is profitable -- far from it. Nio lost $ 835 million in the second quarter, or $ 35,000 for each car it sold.
Nio and other companies in China's sprawling electric car sector have formidable government backing that allows them to withstand such losses and keep growing. When Nio nearly ran out of cash in 2020, a local government immediately injected $ 1 billion for a 24 percent stake, and a state-controlled bank led a group of other lenders to pump in another $ 1.6 billion.
Today Nio embodies China's dominance of electric vehicle innovation and manufacturing, underlining its threat to traditional auto powers in Europe and the United States.
The strike by the United Automobile Workers union against three Detroit carmakers, now in its third week, is at its heart a conflict over electric vehicles: The companies say they must invest billions of dollars to retool their operations, while workers say they must defend their jobs from automation and technology while increasing their pay.
On Wednesday, European politicians worried by a wave of Chinese exports formally launched an investigation into whether electric car manufacturers in China have received government subsidies, a step that could lead Europe to impose tariffs. China's E.V. exports have surged 851 percent in the past three years, mainly to Europe. The inquiry by the European Union is geopolitically complicated: Many of Europe's most important companies have ties to China's market, and China is ready to retaliate.
China's Ministry of Commerce denounced the inquiry on Wednesday, calling it "naked protectionist behavior that will seriously disrupt and distort the supply chain of the global automotive industry chain."
Companies like Nio, which is spending heavily on marketing in Germany and other European countries, need exports. The question is whether Nio can sell enough cars to justify its enormous research and investment effort.
"I'm actually not concerned about the capacity or volume of manufacturing -- I'm only concerned about the demand," said William Li, the chairman and chief executive of Nio, at a news conference in Shanghai.
As American and European manufacturers struggle to catch up, Chinese automakers lead the world in a critical aspect of the E.V. supply chain: battery technology. They have pioneered new battery chemistries that allow long-range driving at considerably reduced cost. China also dominates electric motor production, and in designing high-efficiency systems that tie together batteries and motors.
Electric car sales are growing fast, but China has been building factories even faster for practically every electric car component. That has created a glut of capacity that has driven price tags for electric cars below the price of gasoline-powered cars.
Wages also tend to be lower in China. Autoworkers in big cities like Shanghai earn about $ 30,000 a year in pay and benefits, while workers in less expensive cities in the interior earn considerably less.
By contrast, Ford Motor has said its workers earned an average of $ 110,000 a year in pay and benefits. The U.A.W. is seeking a roughly 40 percent pay raise over four years, plus a paid day off each workweek.
As Nio's new electric motor factory shows, Chinese car manufacturing is now among the most automated in the world. American automakers are finding that they have to buy industrial robots and other automation from Chinese suppliers, said Michael Dunne, an auto analyst in San Diego who specializes in China.
"They look around and say does America have anything close to their ability on automation, and the answer is no," said Mr. Dunne, a former president of General Motors Indonesia.
Paul Gong, head of Asia automotive research for the bank UBS, predicted that Chinese carmakers would capture a third of the global car market by the end of the decade. Much of the growth in his forecast is a jump in Chinese carmakers' share of the European market to 20 percent, from just 3 percent now.
In China, he said, "the competition is so fierce that it pushes every automaker to develop new technologies."
China's technological edge has convinced some European automakers that it makes economic sense to strike partnerships even though they compete with Chinese exporters.
In July, Volkswagen paid $ 700 million for a 4.99 percent stake in XPeng, a money-losing Chinese electric car start-up, putting a valuation of $ 14 billion on XPeng. Nio received assistance from the Hefei local government, but XPeng has acknowledged assistance from the local government in Wuhan, also in central China.
Volkswagen announced in April that it would build a $ 1.1 billion car development center in the central China city of Hefei. VW will hire 2,000 engineers to do work previously performed at its headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, for cars manufactured in China.
Not all Chinese E.V. companies are losing money. BYD, the electric car leader in China and globally, tripled profit to $ 1.5 billion in the first half of this year. BYD makes its own batteries and is a highly efficient manufacturer.
UBS researchers teamed up with an engineering firm to tear apart a BYD Seal electric car. They found that the Seal hatchback sedan cost at least 35 percent less to make than a slightly smaller car of similar quality, the Volkswagen ID3.
The global market can expect far more exports from BYD: The company recently ordered, from Chinese shipyards, its own fleet of the largest transoceanic car-carrying ships ever built.
In addition to Europe, Chinese brands report soaring auto sales in markets from Australia to the Mideast to Latin America. The only market in which Chinese cars have a negligible share and are not expected to gain ground is the United States.
In 2018, Robert E. Lighthizer, President Donald J. Trump's trade representative, imposed a 25 percent tariff on all cars imported from China. The Biden administration has created a subsidy proposal for electric vehicles that excludes Chinese cars.
The overall car market in China has been shrinking since 2017, as sales of gasoline-powered cars have plummeted faster than electric car sales have risen. Ride-hailing services have become ubiquitous while high-speed rail lines and subways have knit the country tightly together.
Chinese companies keep racing to improve their technology. Since April, Nio has introduced its first small touring wagon and a new coupe sport utility vehicle while upgrading three other car models. Nio's Internet-enabled augmented reality glasses can allow passengers to project a video meeting or share a computer game.
These initiatives are starting to increase the company's sales, although they remain low. Figures released by the company on Sunday showed that the average monthly pace of vehicle deliveries rose to 18,477 from July through September. The company has not yet released financial information for the third quarter.
Selling smartphones and electric cars together has long been the dream of the electric car and smartphone industries. The cellphones, which work closely with a car's self-driving functions, can be replaced much more frequently as technology improves than semiconductors in cars, which must pass lengthy safety reviews.
On Sept. 21, Nio put on sale its own brand of cellphone with a button on the left side for car controls. The founder of Geely, another Chinese automaker, last year acquired 79 percent of a smartphone manufacturer, Meizu, and has begun putting its software into Geely cars. Apple has talked for years of selling electric cars in addition to iPhones, but the Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is in the final stages of preparing to enter the car market next year.
So China's electric carmakers persevere despite initial losses. "You all know we have not broken even, we are under great pressure," Nio's Mr. Li said. But he reaffirmed the company's tech investments as "the path we should take."

German E-Bikes Gain Power as the Car Industry Falters: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: E-bikes sales in Germany have jumped, as drivers, suppliers and even automakers embrace their role in the future of transportation.
Germany's automakers are facing steep challenges as they convert to battery-powered lineups and confront rising competition from China. But business is booming in another corner of the German transport industry: e-bikes.
Sales of bicycles in Germany reached a record 7.36 billion euros, or $ 7.8 billion, in 2022, with e-bikes accounting for nearly half of sales, according to the German Bicycle Industry Association. The group is forecasting that this year, for the first time, Germans will buy more e-bikes than conventional models.
Electric bicycles and scooters are the backbone of what's known as micromobility, seen as crucial to cutting the carbon emissions of transportation and helping to ease pollution and congestion in European cities. Analysts at EY cite e-bikes as the factor behind predicted annual growth of 4.6 percent in Europe's bicycle market in the coming five years, as more people adjust their lifestyles to cut emissions. At the same time, the number of privately owned cars could drop by as much as 25 percent, according to a study by PWC, as consumers shift to car sharing and alternative mobility models.
Germany's auto industry has noticed. Porsche offers a sporty, all-terrain e-bike -- with the carmaker's familiar gold-and-red crest under the handlebars. Audi has a similar model.
"Demand for micromobility is growing," said Sandra Wolf, the chief executive of Riese & Müller, a leading German bicycle maker with a wide range of electric models. "E-bikes play an important role in that."
Germany is Europe's largest overall market for bicycles, and in recent years German bike makers have seen a growing demand for their e-bikes abroad, especially within Europe. China is the world's largest producer of e-bikes, but duties imposed by the European Union on Chinese imports have helped to shield producers in Europe.
Several German firms are among the leading e-bike manufacturers in Europe, along with rivals in France, Italy and the Netherlands. In the first quarter of this year, exports of battery-powered bicycles made in Germany jumped 56 percent from a year earlier, according to the German Bicycle Industry Association.
That sort of growth has attracted investors. Last year LRMR Ventures, the investment firm of the National Basketball Association star LeBron James, led a group investing €30 million in Canyon, a German bicycle producer based in Koblenz, with an eye to expanding its e-bike offerings and presence in the United States.
Germany's largest automobile show, in Munich, was rebranded as a "mobility" fair in 2021. During a panel discussion at the show this month, Oliver Blume, the chief executive of Volkswagen, explained how his company was working on technology to reduce the cost of the batteries for electric vehicles.
Ms. Wolf, who was also on the panel, said cycling was already filling the space for more affordable, sustainable transportation. "It is one of the cheapest transport modes and one with easiest access," she said.
Still, the average e-bike in Germany sold for €2,800, or nearly $ 3,000, last year, according to the German Bicycle Industry Association, a high price point that has made leasing popular. Across Europe, some companies are offering employees a perk of leasing an e-bike for commuting. Delivery firms are also renting electric cargo bikes -- the larger models capable of carrying heavy or bulky loads -- for their drivers.
Automakers are getting into this market, too. "Bike leasing is booming," said Christian Dahlheim, the chief executive of Volkswagen's Financial Services division, which handles leasing of the company's cars. Volkswagen recently teamed up with Pon, a Dutch company, in a venture focused on leasing bicycles to workers via their employers, with an eye to expanding in Europe and the United States.
Companies known for auto parts also see opportunities in e-bikes. Bosch, long a leading supplier of powertrains and other technology for German automakers, is now a major supplier of the batteries, motors and brakes for e-bikes. Technology originally developed for cars, such as anti-lock breaks, are now being used in e-bikes.
Increasingly, customers are looking for more nimble, lighter e-bikes that can carry cargo loads of up to 140 pounds. Such models are growing in popularity, with families seeking a car-free way to transport children and groceries.
Older riders who want to remain mobile and active, but are looking for what William Kraus, 67, called "a little boost," are another growing target market. Mr. Kraus, who tried several models on display at the show in Munich, said he hadn't decided on the right one yet for himself and his wife.
But he was convinced that the next vehicle he bought would be an e-bike.
"They take the strain out of riding and make it more fun," he said. And while prices ranging from $ 2,000 to $ 5,000 were still high, they were a fraction of the $ 35,000 starting price for a new electric car.

Despite Cutting Prices at Tesla, Sales Are Down: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Analysts expected a decline in sales for the quarter. Still, the dip may raise concerns about flagging demand.
Sales of Tesla electric cars slipped from July through September after the company paused production at some factories to upgrade assembly lines.
The company delivered 435,000 vehicles worldwide in the third quarter, down from 466,000 in the second quarter. Wall Street analysts had expected the decline, which they attributed to production slowdowns as Tesla refitted factories in the United States and China.
The decline "was caused by planned downtimes for factory upgrades," Tesla said in a statement on Monday, adding that it still expects to deliver 1.8 million vehicles this year, up from 1.3 million in 2022.
Still, the dip in sales may renew concerns that demand for Tesla cars is slackening even after the company cut prices. In China, Tesla is trying to fend off Chinese carmakers, like BYD and Nio, that are rolling out new models more quickly.
In the United States, Tesla faces increased competition from established carmakers like Ford Motor, General Motors, Hyundai and Volkswagen. They have been chipping away at Tesla's dominance; the company accounted for about 60 percent of the electric vehicle market in the second quarter.
Another of the new competitors is Rivian, which said on Monday that it delivered 15,600 electric vans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in the third quarter, up from 12,600 in the previous quarter. Though Rivian is far smaller than Tesla, its pickups pose a competitive threat to Tesla's Cybertruck pickup. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has said the Cybertruck will go on sale by the end of the year.
Tesla cut prices significantly on all its models this year to fend off competition and keep its sales growing at a rapid clip. As a result, its profit margin has fallen sharply, though it remains higher than those of more established carmakers.
More recently, the company has slowed or stopped production at its factory in Austin, Texas, to prepare for production of the Cybertruck. In China, Tesla paused some production as it switched assembly lines to an upgraded version of its Model 3 sedan known as the Highland.
On an annual basis, Tesla continued to grow faster than the traditional carmakers. Sales grew 26 percent from the third quarter of 2022, when Tesla delivered 344,000 vehicles.
Tesla could also benefit from the United Automobile Workers strike against Ford, G.M. and Stellantis, the owner of Jeep, Ram and Chrysler. Sharply higher wages for unionized workers at the Detroit carmakers would widen Tesla's cost advantage. Tesla workers do not belong to the U.A.W., although the union has said it plans to try to organize them.

Strikes and Deep Roots: 'Good Stories in Detroit': [National Desk]

Full text: As electric vehicles usher in a new era for the car economy and workers strike against rooted manufacturers, Neal E. Boudette is in Motor City to cover it all.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
For the first time in the nearly 90-year history of the United Auto Workers, the union is on strike against all three of the large Detroit automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler -- at the same time.
The targeted strike, which started on Sept. 15 and expanded last Friday, has shut down three auto plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri, and 38 parts distribution centers operated by G.M. and Stellantis. About 18,300 U.A.W. members are on strike while the union demands a 40 percent pay increase. The shutdowns affect only a few car models, but a protracted strike would affect consumers and the U.S. economy.
Neal E. Boudette, who covers the auto industry from Detroit for The New York Times, has been reporting on the negotiations between the union and automakers. He has covered the automobile industry since 2002, when he was in Germany working for The Wall Street Journal. He joined The Times in 2016.
In an interview, Mr. Boudette spoke about the evolution of the industry, its symbolism in the United States and what this strike could mean for other automakers. This interview has been edited and condensed.
President Biden visited a picket line in Michigan this week, which has been described as unprecedented for a sitting president. Does this strike feel different from U.A.W.'s strike at General Motors in 2019, or ones before that?
A lot of the strikes in the past 20 years have been symbolic more than strategic. This year, it's a totally different dynamic. The union has a very strong negotiating position. The car companies are making tons of money, and workers have not received raises that have kept up with inflation. The workers have a lot of support from the public.
There have been strikes in the past that were very contentious and even resulted in street clashes. But in the 21st century, there hasn't been a strike like this.
You worked in Germany before coming to Detroit. How do the settings compare?
Detroit is Motor City. The whole region has this very strong connection to automobiles. There's a century-long history and a great deal of culture built around the automobile. The Detroit Red Wings -- their logo is a winged wheel.
It was less so in Germany. I was based in Frankfurt, not an auto center. Opel was a little bit outside of Frankfurt, and Mercedes was south of Frankfurt. B.M.W. was down in Munich; Volkswagen was up north in Wolfsburg. Each of those towns is a little like Detroit, but you didn't have the concentration that you have in Detroit.
How has the evolution of electric vehicles changed your beat?
The biggest trend is electrification, and there are many different aspects of it. Aside from the fact that you have to get these cars designed and developed and produced, there's a social aspect to it. We need chargers all over the place, and charging a car is a different social experience than filling up your gas tank.
Then there's the climate aspect. The evolution of the industry to electronic vehicles has been called the biggest transition the industry has seen since the introduction of the moving assembly line.
The beat is multifaceted now. Before the financial crisis, it wasn't quite like that. There was a technology race, but it was a very limited technology race. And now it's taking on a much greater breadth.
What affects will the strike have on the industry?
Eventually the union and automakers will come up with an agreement. And then the next big question will be: How much of a burden does this contract put on these companies? Their competitors -- Toyota, Volkswagen, Honda, Kia -- are foreign companies who operate nonunion factories. Most of their workers make considerably less than the top U.A.W. wage.
In recent years, U.A.W. tried to organize a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee and a Nissan plant in Mississippi, and the workers voted down union representation. They didn't want to rock the boat.
But there's a lot of power on the side of workers these days. I think it's possible workers in the South say: We're making $ 22 an hour. The workers in Detroit are making $ 32 an hour. We should be in the union.
As an auto industry reporter, are you a big car guy?
It's funny, I'm not. I'm interested in cars, but I'm not a big car person. I drive a Chevy Malibu, believe it or not.
Cars are interesting products to cover. There's no other country in the world where there are as many pop songs and movies about cars. The Beach Boys' "409"; that David Hasselhoff TV show, "Knight Rider." It's a whole TV show built around a car.
There are good stories in Detroit. Sometimes it's a matter of explaining things to readers. We did a lot of that in the past year on the transition to E.V.s. There are also really interesting personalities to write about. That's what keeps me going.

Swedish Battery Maker To Build Quebec Factory With Help From Subsidies: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Canadian government matched financial incentives available in the U.S. to attract the investment from Northvolt, a Swedish company.
Northvolt, a Swedish maker of batteries for electric cars, said on Thursday that it would build a factory near Montreal after the Canadian government matched financial incentives that would have been available from the United States.
The company will invest $ 5 billion in the factory, which will employ as many as 3,000 people and be among the largest battery plants in North America when it begins production in 2026.
The Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden's signature climate law, includes billions of dollars in incentives to create a domestic battery industry. It has sparked a boom in investment as well as fierce competition among government officials seeking to lure companies to their states or provinces.
U.S. allies have complained that incentives designed to create a domestic supply chain have ignited a costly subsidy arms race.
Canada's federal government and Quebec's provincial government will each provide $ 1 billion in subsidies for the project, effectively matching the incentives that Northvolt would have received had it decided to build a plant in the United States, said Paolo Cerruti, a founder of the company.
"Canada is mirroring those measures pretty much one to one," Mr. Cerruti, a former Tesla executive who will oversee the factory, said in an interview.
Northvolt was also drawn to the site, in McMasterville and Saint-Basile-le-Grand, Quebec, because of the region's ample hydropower as well as mines that could eventually supply lithium and other raw materials, Mr. Cerruti said. A lithium mine near La Corne, Quebec, about 350 miles northwest of Montreal, began operations this year.
"We would like to have as much lithium as possible from Canada," Mr. Cerruti said.
Northvolt markets itself as a sustainable battery producer that aims to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental damage caused by its factories. The site in Quebec will also include a recycling center that Northvolt says will eventually yield half of the lithium, cobalt, nickel and other raw materials required for electric car batteries.
Mr. Cerruti said Northvolt had lined up customers for the Quebec plant, but he declined to name them. In Europe, Northvolt makes batteries for carmakers including BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo. The company's main factory is in northern Sweden, and it is building a factory near Hamburg that will receive subsidies from the German government.
In April, Volkswagen said it would invest about $ 5 billion to build a battery factory in St. Thomas, Ontario, which will also benefit from government financing.

Full text: The United Auto Workers said it had "reasonably productive conversations with Ford" but did not mention G.M. or Stellantis.
The United Auto Workers union and the three Detroit automakers on Saturday resumed negotiations on a new labor contract as a targeted strike entered its second day.
The union is striking against all three manufacturers -- General Motors, Ford and Stellantis -- but for now has limited the work stoppages to one plant at each of the companies: a Ford plant in Michigan, a G.M. plant in Missouri and a Stellantis plant in Ohio.
"We had reasonably productive conversations with Ford today," the union said in a statement. It made no mention of its talks with G.M. and Stellantis.
On Friday Ford said it had told 600 workers who are not part of the strike not to report to work, and G.M. said the work stoppage could force it to lay off about 2,000 workers at a plant in Kansas that gets parts from the Missouri factory.
In a statement on Saturday, the U.A.W. president, Shawn Fain, said the automakers' hints at possible layoffs were intended to "squeeze our member to settle for less" than the union has demanded.
"With their record profits, they don't have to lay off a single employee," he said.
The union is seeking a substantial pay increase, an expansion of pension plans to cover all workers, company-paid retiree health care and shorter work weeks. It also seeks an end to the "tiered" wage system in which new hires start at a little more than half the standard union wage and have to work eight years before reaching the top level.
In its initial list of demands, the U.A.W. called for a 40 percent wage increase, saying that matches the average pay increase the chief executives of the three companies have gotten over the last four years.
On Saturday, Stellantis -- the parent of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram -- said its most recent offer provided for an immediate 10 percent raise and additional increases that would lift wages a total of 21 percent over the life of the new contract, which is typically four years.
The company also said it offered to allow inflation-based wage adjustments. Under its proposal, new hires would rise to the top wage -- currently $ 32 an hour -- over four years instead of eight. Temporary workers, who now make $ 16.67 an hour, would move to about $ 21 an hour, Stellantis said.
"It's a very fair, highly competitive offer," Mark Stewart, chief operating officer of Stellantis's North American division, said in a conference call.
"We clearly understand we've been in an inflationary environment," Mr. Stewart said. "We understand we need to make changes to reflect what's happened since the last contract." At the same time, he continued, the company has to make sure it can compete with rivals that operate nonunion plants, including Tesla and foreign-owned automakers like Toyota, Honda and Volkswagen.
"We've got to have a viable industry," Mr. Stewart said. "At the end of the day, we have to be able to compete."
G.M. and Ford have made similar offers on wages and reducing the climb to the top wage to four years, but all three companies have rejected many of the union's other demands related to pensions, health care, and job security.
Mr. Stewart also said Stellantis made a proposal to provide "job security" for about 1,350 people who lost their jobs earlier this year when Stellantis idled a plant in Belvidere, Ill. He declined to detail the company's offer and would not say if it included having the Belvidere plant produce new vehicles, a step that would signal it planned a full reopening of the factory.
That offer only remained on the table until the strike began, however.
Later on Saturday, Mr. Fain released a statement: "Belvidere Assembly was a profitable plant that just a few years ago supported around 5000 workers and their families. Now that number is zero, and Stellantis wants to keep playing games." He added, "Our attitude is: Save Belvidere."
Reopening that plant is one of the most important goals for Mr. Fain. He was elected to his post earlier this year on a promise to take a harder and more confrontational approach than his predecessors.
Four years ago, the U.A.W. went on strike for 40 days against G.M. and hoped to push the company to reopen a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that G.M. had tagged for closing. In the end, the union agreed to a deal that allowed the company to shutter the factory.

UAW Strike Looms Over Detroit Auto Show

DETROIT — The Detroit auto show kicked off this week with a burst of hoopla and glam, including a Darius Rucker concert sponsored by Ford Motor and an indoor test track built by Jeep that features a hill with a 40-degree slope.
But beyond the excitement and bright lights, Detroit’s annual auto show has been clouded by foreboding and dread. The three established U.S. automakers, the anchors of the show, are locked in difficult contract negotiations with the labor union that represents nearly 150,000 of their employees.
Even as automakers sought to drum up excitement about new versions of popular vehicles such as the Ford F-150 pickup truck and the GMC Acadia SUV to journalists, analysts and dealers, labor negotiators were racing to avoid a strike by the United Auto Workers that could make it impossible for those new models to find their way to showrooms. Despite those efforts, the union called a strike at three factories starting Friday.
The three automakers based in the Detroit area — General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which owns Jeep, Chrysler and Ram — are entangled in their greatest labor crisis in more than a decade even as they seek to display their best and brightest new models.
“You can feel it,” said Matt DeLorenzo, an independent auto analyst and author. “The executives I’ve talked to, you can see they’re concerned. I don’t see a lot of optimism that it’s going to be resolved fairly quickly.”
The UAW and its new president, Shawn Fain, are seeking a 40% increase in wages over the next four years. The union has also demanded pension improvements, a shorter workweek, company-paid health care for retirees and an end to a wage system in which new hires start at about half the top union wage of $32 an hour.
The automakers, which have been making near-record profits for the past several years, have countered with wage increases about half of what the union is seeking, while rejecting most of the UAW’s other demands.
There were few direct references to the UAW talks at the show, which will open its doors to the general public Saturday. But a prolonged strike would almost certainly jeopardize the automakers’ plans to roll out new cars and trucks to take advantage of still strong demand.
The auto industry has spent much of the past three years struggling to produce enough vehicles because of pandemic shutdowns and supply chain chaos. The inventory of new cars remains very low by historical standards, and prices are quite high, helping to raise profits.
If striking workers slow or stop production lines for many weeks or several months, customers looking for new cars will increasingly turn to foreign automakers or Tesla, the Texas-based producer of electric vehicles that is growing fast. Those other automakers operate U.S. plants that use nonunion workers and their production is unlikely to be affected directly by the strikes.
The Detroit show, officially the North American International Auto Show, was once one of the premier auto expositions in the world. The top executives from all major automakers, including those not based in Michigan, attended. Celebrities and musicians were often hired to add sizzle.
But several years ago, attendance began declining at auto shows around the world, and the Detroit organizers tried to refashion theirs, moving it from January to the summer. But the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to shut down completely. The show returned last year, but was sparsely attended, and many foreign automakers didn’t bother to participate.
This year the no-shows include Honda, BMW, Volkswagen, Audi and Mercedes-Benz, but the show has added new attractions. A test track for electric vehicles has a 300-foot straightaway where visitors — riding in the passenger seat with a trained driver at the wheel — can get a sense of the exhilarating acceleration of seven models, including the electric Ford F-150 Lightning pickup and the Cadillac Lyriq, an electric SUV.
A startup company, Alef Aeronautics, put on display a concept for what it hopes will someday become a flying car that can “hop” over hills, or even traffic jams.
To highlight the off-road abilities of its vehicles, Stellantis’ Jeep division created a stand out of 50 pine trees, 30 tons of boulders and 40 cubic yards of dirt. There, amid the faux wilderness, Jeep introduced a new version of its Gladiator pickup.
“Even after 100 years, this city is still a home for innovating visionaries, designers, builders and adventure-seekers,” Jim Morrison, a Stellantis senior vice president and head of the Jeep brand in North America, said during a presentation Wednesday.
Hours later, Stellantis issued a statement saying it was still awaiting the UAW’s response to the company’s latest wage offer.

DETROIT — The Detroit auto show kicked off this week with a burst of hoopla and glam, including a Darius Rucker concert sponsored by Ford Motor and an indoor test track built by Jeep that features a hill with a 40-degree slope.
But beyond the excitement and bright lights, Detroit’s annual auto show has been clouded by foreboding and dread. The three established U.S. automakers, the anchors of the show, are locked in difficult contract negotiations with the labor union that represents nearly 150,000 of their employees.

The automakers, which have been making near-record profits for the past several years, have countered with wage increases about half of what the union is seeking, while rejecting most of the UAW’s other demands.
“We’re seeing movement from the companies, but they’re still not willing to agree to the kinds of raises that will make up for inflation on top of decades of falling wages,” Fain said Wednesday evening in a video on Facebook.
He added that workers at all three companies were prepared to strike and stay away from their factory stations as long as it took to win big gains. The UAW has never struck the three companies simultaneously before.
There were few direct references to the UAW talks at the show, which will open its doors to the general public Saturday. But a prolonged strike will almost certainly jeopardize the automakers’ plans to roll out new cars and trucks to take advantage of still strong demand.

E.V. Subsidies By China Rouse Interest of E.U.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, announced the inquiry, which could lead to tariffs, amid concern over China's dominance in electric vehicles.
The European Union will begin an investigation into Chinese subsidies of electric vehicles, the bloc's top official announced Wednesday, in a move that highlights Europe's growing industrial and geopolitical competition with China.
The inquiry could lead to trade restrictions, such as import tariffs on Chinese vehicles.
Chinese automakers have gained a dominant position in the global electric vehicle industry and see Europe as a key potential market. Automakers in Europe, who are racing to expand their battery-powered lineups, have expressed concern that they face unfair competition against models from China that can be sold at a lower price, thanks to subsidies from the government in Beijing.
"Europe is open for competition, not for a race to the bottom," said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, speaking in Strasbourg, France. "We must defend ourselves against unfair practices."
She announced the initiative during her annual state of the European Union address, which sets the tone for the year ahead.
The European Union sees the electric vehicle sector as "a crucial industry for the clean economy, with huge potential for Europe," Ms. von der Leyen said. "But global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars. And their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies."
The remarks were met with "strong concern and opposition" by the China Chamber of Commerce to the European Union, which urged the bloc to view China's electric vehicle industry "with objectivity rather than resorting to unilateral economic and trade measures."
Despite longstanding and deep economic ties between Europe and China, political and diplomatic relations between the two sides have deteriorated since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, because of Beijing's support of Moscow.
A flurry of diplomatic visits this year has underscored that European Union members don't have a clear united policy on China. Ms. von der Leyen has been pushing for the concept of "de-risking" the Europe-China relationship by becoming less economically dependent on Beijing, rather than severing ties.
But the association representing German automakers urged caution in response to the inquiry. The industry is heavily invested in the Chinese auto market, the world's largest, and a trade war with China over electric vehicles could cost them more than they stand to gain.
Earlier this year, Volkswagen announced that it was investing 1 billion euros ( $ 1.1 billion) to build a new innovation center for electric cars in Hefei, China. It also bought a $ 700 million stake in XPeng, a Chinese start-up that makes electric vehicles.
"Possible counter reactions from China must be taken into account," warned the German Association of the Automotive Industry.
The China Chamber of Commerce, in its statement, noted the "robust cooperative partnership" between the automotive industries in Europe and China, and that each electric vehicle required "tens of thousands of suppliers from around the world."
The inquiry would be part of a European Union push against what it calls anti-competitive behavior by China that throttles European businesses, costing Europe jobs and revenue.
"We have not forgotten how China's unfair trade practices affected our solar industry," Ms. von der Leyen said. "Many young businesses were pushed out by heavily subsidized Chinese competitors."
In the late 2000s, Beijing pumped vast amounts of money into solar energy technology, enabling domestic manufacturers to make multibillion-dollar investments in new factories and gain market share globally. China's boom in production caused the price of panels to plummet, forcing dozens of companies in Europe and the United States out of business.
China has taken a similar approach to the development and commercialization of electric cars. Government programs promoting production in China picked up speed after Wen Jiabao became the country's premier in 2003. Mr. Wen set ambitious targets for the sale of electric cars and required cities to make sure that those targets were met.
By 2009, China had set a clear goal of becoming a global leader in electric cars, and was offering government subsidies of $ 8,800 per car for taxi fleets and local government agencies in 13 Chinese cities to buy all-electric or hybrid gasoline-electric cars.
Chinese makers of electric cars have been stepping up efforts to expand in Europe and elsewhere. China's auto exports surged 31 percent in August, after a 63 percent jump in July, according to the China Passenger Car Association. New models from China dominated the international auto show held in Munich last week.

Union Push On E.V. Pay Tests Biden: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A looming auto industry strike could test the president's commitment to making electric vehicles a source of well-paying union jobs.
President Biden has been highly attuned to the politics of electric vehicles, helping to enact billions in subsidies to create new manufacturing jobs and going out of his way to court the United Automobile Workers union.
But as the union and the big U.S. automakers -- General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, which owns Chrysler, Jeep and Ram -- hurtle toward a strike deadline set for Thursday night, the political challenge posed by the industry's transition to electric cars may be only beginning.
The union, under its new president, Shawn Fain, wants workers who make electric vehicle components like batteries to benefit from the better pay and labor standards that the roughly 150,000 U.A.W. members enjoy at the three automakers. Most battery plants are not unionized.
The Detroit automakers counter that these workers are typically employed in joint ventures with foreign manufacturers that the U.S. automakers don't wholly control. The companies say that even if they could raise wages for battery workers to the rate set under their national U.A.W. contract, doing so could make them uncompetitive with nonunion rivals, like Tesla.
And then there is former President Donald J. Trump, who is running to unseat Mr. Biden and has said the president's clean energy policies are costing American jobs and raising prices for consumers.
White House officials say Mr. Biden will still be able to deliver on his promise of high-quality jobs and a strong domestic electric vehicle industry.
"The president's policies have always been geared toward ensuring not only that our electric vehicle future was made in America with American jobs," said Gene Sperling, Mr. Biden's liaison to the U.A.W. and the auto industry, "but that it would promote good union jobs and a just transition" for current autoworkers whose jobs are threatened.
But in public at least, the president has so far spoken only in vague terms about wages. Last month, he said that the transition to electric vehicles should enable workers to "make good wages and benefits to support their families" and that when union jobs were replaced with new jobs, they should go to union members and pay a "commensurate" wage. He is encouraging the companies and the union to keep bargaining and reach an agreement, one of Mr. Biden's economic advisers, Jared Bernstein, told reporters on Wednesday.
A strike could force Mr. Biden to be more explicit and choose between his commitment to workers and the need to broker a compromise that averts a costly long-term shutdown.
"Battery workers need to be paid the same amount as U.A.W. workers at the current Big Three," said Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California who has promoted government investments in new technologies.
Mr. Khanna added, "It's how we contrast with Trump: We're for creating good-paying manufacturing jobs across the Midwest."
At the heart of the debate is whether the shift to electric vehicles, which have fewer parts and generally require less labor to assemble than gas-powered cars, will accelerate the decline of unionized work in the industry.
Foreign and domestic automakers have announced tens of thousands of new U.S.-based electric vehicle and battery jobs in response to the subsidies that Mr. Biden helped enact. But most of those jobs are not unionized, and many are in the South or West, where the U.A.W. has struggled to win over autoworkers. The union has tried and failed to organize workers at Tesla's factory in Fremont, Calif., and Southern plants owned by Volkswagen and Nissan.
As a result, the union has focused its efforts on battery workers employed directly or indirectly by G.M., Ford and Stellantis. The going wage for this work tends to be far below the roughly $ 32 an hour that veteran U.A.W. members make under their existing contracts with three companies.
Legally, employees of the three manufacturers can't strike over the pay of battery workers employed by joint ventures. But many U.A.W. members worry that letting battery manufacturers pay far lower wages will allow G.M., Ford and Stellantis to replace much of their current U.S. work force with cheaper labor, so they are seeking a large wage increase for those workers.
"What we want is for the E.V. jobs to be U.A.W. jobs under our master agreements," said Scott Houldieson, chairperson of Unite All Workers for Democracy, a group within the union that helped propel Mr. Fain to the presidency.
The union's officials have pressed the auto companies to address their concerns about battery workers before its members vote on a new contract. They say the companies can afford to pay more because they collectively earned about $ 250 billion in North America over the past decade, according to union estimates.
But the auto companies, while acknowledging that they have been profitable in recent years, point out that the transition to electric vehicles is very expensive. Industry executives have suggested that it is hard to know how quickly consumers will embrace electric vehicles and that companies needed flexibility to adjust.
Even if labor costs were not an issue, said Corey Cantor, an electric vehicle analyst at the energy research firm BloombergNEF, it could take the Big Three several years to catch up to Tesla, which makes about 60 percent of fully electric vehicles sold in the United States.
Data from BloombergNEF show that G.M., Ford and Stellantis together sold fewer than 100,000 battery electric vehicles in the United States last year; in 2017, Tesla alone sold 50,000. It took Tesla another five years to top half a million U.S. sales. (The Big Three also sold nearly 80,000 plug-in hybrids last year.)
The three established automakers had hoped to use the transition to electric cars to bring their costs more in line with their competitors, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, a research firm. If they can't, he added, they will have to look for savings elsewhere.
In a statement, Stellantis said its battery joint venture "intends to offer very competitive wages and benefits while making the health and safety of its work force a top priority."
Estimates shared by Ford put hourly labor costs, including benefits, for the three automakers in the mid- $ 60s, versus the mid- $ 50s for foreign automakers in the United States and the mid- $ 40s for Tesla.
Ford's chief executive, Jim Farley, said in a statement last month that the company's offer to raise pay in the next contract was "significantly better" than what Tesla and foreign automakers paid U.S. workers. He added that Ford "will not make a deal that endangers our ability to invest, grow and share profits with our employees."
Mr. Biden and Democratic lawmakers had sought to offset this labor-cost disadvantage by providing an additional $ 4,500 subsidy for each electric vehicle assembled at a unionized U.S. plant, above other incentives available to electric cars. But the Senate removed that provision from the Inflation Reduction Act.
Such setbacks have frustrated the U.A.W., an early backer of Mr. Biden's clean energy plans. In May, the union, which normally supports Democratic presidential candidates, withheld its endorsement of Mr. Biden's re-election.
"The E.V. transition is at serious risk of becoming a race to the bottom," Mr. Fain said in an internal memo. "We want to see national leadership have our back on this before we make any commitments."
The next month, Mr. Fain chided the Biden administration for awarding Ford a $ 9.2 billion loan to build three battery factories in Tennessee and Kentucky with no inducement for the jobs to be unionized.
Mr. Biden tapped Mr. Sperling, a Michigan native, to serve as the White House point person on issues related to the union and the auto industry around the same time. By late August, the Energy Department announced that it was making $ 12 billion in grants and loans available for investments in electric vehicles, with a priority on automakers that create or maintain good jobs in areas with a union presence.
Mr. Sperling speaks regularly with both sides in the labor dispute, seeking to defuse misunderstandings before they escalate, and said the recent Energy Department funding reflected Mr. Biden's commitment to jump-start the industry while creating good jobs.
Complicating the picture for Mr. Biden is the growing chorus of Democratic politicians and liberal groups that have backed the autoworkers' demands, even as they hail the president's success in improving pay and labor standards in other green industries, like wind and solar.
Nearly 30 Democratic senators signed a letter to auto executives this summer urging them to bring battery workers into the union's national contract. Dozens of labor and environmental groups have signed a letter echoing the demand.
The groups argue that the change would have only a modest impact on automakers' profits because labor accounts for a relatively small portion of overall costs, a claim that some independent experts back.
Yen Chen, principal economist of the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit group in Ann Arbor, Mich., said labor accounted for only about 5 percent of the cost of final assembly for a midsize domestic sedan based on an analysis the group ran 10 years ago. Mr. Chen said that figure was likely to be lower today, and lower still for battery assembly, which is highly automated.
Beyond the economic case, however, Mr. Biden's allies say allowing electric vehicles to drive down auto wages would be a catastrophic political mistake. Workers at the three companies are concentrated in Midwestern states that could decide the next presidential election -- and, as a result, the fate of the transition to clean energy, said Jason Walsh, the executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of unions and environmental groups.
"The economic effects of doing that are enormously harmful," he said. "The political consequences would be disastrous."

U.S. to Recall A Key Part For Airbags: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The action covers airbags made by two companies and used by 12 automakers from 2000 to 2018. The parts were linked to seven injuries and one death.
Federal auto safety regulators moved Tuesday toward a recall of about 52 million airbag inflaters used by a dozen major carmakers, calling the parts unsafe and susceptible to rupture.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration scheduled a public meeting on Oct. 5 on its recommendation to recall the airbags, manufactured by ARC Automotive and Delphi Automotive Systems. ARC rejected the agency's initial findings that its airbags were defective.
The agency said that at least seven people had been injured and one killed in seven incidents in the United States as a result of the defective airbags.
Of the 52 million airbags, 41 million were manufactured by ARC and 11 million were produced by Delphi using a design licensed by ARC. The airbags were variously made in China, Mexico and Knoxville, Tenn., and were used by a dozen major carmakers: BMW, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, Kia, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen.
"An airbag inflater that fails by rupture not only does not perform its job as a safety device, but instead actively threatens injury or death, even in a crash where the vehicle occupants would otherwise have been unharmed," the agency said in its announcement.
ARC and Delphi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The ARC matter comes several years after the safety agency's investigation of inflaters made by Takata, a Japanese supplier, that were found to explode violently and suddenly, even when the airbags were not deployed in a crash. In that case, regulators determined that Takata used a propellant that could break down over time from exposure to humidity.
The safety agency linked the Takata defect to more than a dozen deaths in the United States. More than 70 million vehicles equipped with Takata inflaters were recalled in more than 40 countries.
In April, the safety agency demanded in a letter to ARC that the company recall tens of millions of airbag inflaters that were made from 2000 to 2018.
The agency's investigators found that a small number of inflaters designed by ARC could explode more violently than intended when a vehicle's airbags are deployed, and therefore "pose an unreasonable risk of death or injury," the letter said.
The letter prompted G.M. to recall nearly one million vehicles made from 2014 to 2017 and equipped with ARC inflaters. The automaker said it was taking the action "out of an abundance of caution."
In response to the agency's demand, ARC declined to issue a recall and said in a letter in May that it did not believe a defect existed and that in its view NHTSA's finding was not based on "any objective technical or engineering conclusion."
Inflaters use an explosive substance such as ammonium nitrate that is compacted into tablets stored in a metal cylinder. In a crash severe enough to set off a vehicle's airbags, the tablets are supposed to create a controlled explosion that rapidly fills the airbags with gas.
The safety agency said it had found that ARC's manufacturing process could leave bits of welding material, known as weld slag, inside the cylinder. If the airbags are deployed, that material could clog the exit opening and cause an explosion violent enough to blast shards of metal and plastic into the vehicle's interior.
The agency has been looking at ARC inflaters since 2015. The most recent incident involving a rupture occurred in Michigan in March, when the driver of a 2017 Chevrolet Traverse sustained facial injuries.
ARC, in its letter to regulators in May, said that weld slag had been ruled out as the cause of two of the seven incidents noted by the agency, and that it had not yet been found definitively to be the cause of the other five.
A large-scale recall, and any related legal expenses, could have considerable costs for the inflater makers. After the Takata recall, the largest in automotive history, which forced it to pay millions of dollars in fines to U.S. regulators, the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and was sold to Joyson Safety Systems, formerly known as Key Safety Systems.
Takata had been responsible for the cost of replacing the defective inflaters -- a task handled by local car dealerships -- but the bankruptcy filing left automakers to pick up the bill. About 11 percent of the affected airbags still haven't been replaced, according to the safety agency's most recent estimate.
The agency has come under scrutiny for its investigations of vehicle defects. In May the Department of Transportation's inspector general issued a report concluding that the agency's Office of Defects Investigations did not identify and investigate safety defects in a timely manner.

In Munich, China's Cars Outperform Germany's: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: China, an electric-vehicle juggernaut, will have at least seven brands on display, while Germany's automakers are now a drag on their home economy.
For decades, the phrase "Made in Germany" signaled cutting-edge automotive technology and design. But now German automakers are falling behind in the global race to produce more electric vehicles, and some executives are using a new catchphrase to describe how quickly they need to catch up: "China speed."
The term reflects the rapid transformation of the Chinese car industry into a battery-powered juggernaut. And that speed was on display Monday at I.A.A. Mobility, a massive auto show in Munich, with newcomers from China stealing the show.
BYD, an all-electric Chinese carmaker that overtook Volkswagen as China's best-selling brand this year, unveiled a sleek, new sedan and a sport utility vehicle to applause from a packed crowd.
"I think the Europeans are just pretty much petrified of how the Chinese will perform in Europe," said Matthias Schmidt, an independent analyst of the electric-car market based in Berlin.
The show arrives at a precarious time for the German auto industry, the largest in Europe, and for the German economy more broadly. Once a critical driver of the country's economy, German automakers have instead become a drag. In June, production in the auto industry shrank by 3.5 percent compared with the previous month, weighing on the country's overall industrial production, which declined by 1.5 percent.
The doldrums extend beyond automakers. Economic output in Germany is stagnating, weighed down by the high cost of energy and raw materials, a lingering effect of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.
Prominent German companies, including Volkswagen and the chemical giant BASF, have delayed expansion plans or announced that they will build in regions with enticing incentives, including China and North America. Persistently high inflation is eating away at Germans' purchasing power and contributing to pessimism from consumers and businesses alike.
After Germany's economy dipped into a recession late last year and early this year, its growth was flat from April to June. Last week, the country's central bank, the Bundesbank, said that economic output was expected to "more or less stagnate again in the third quarter of 2023."
Among eight advanced economies studied by the International Monetary Fund, Germany's was the only one projected to shrink this year, leading some economists to recall the specter of the late 1990s when, hampered by record-high unemployment and the cost of reunifying East and West Germany, economists declared the country the "sick man" of Europe.
The government in Berlin is rushing to respond. Last week, it approved 32 billion euros, or almost $ 35 billion, in corporate tax cuts over four years to help revive production.
The government also proposed cutting Germany's notorious mounds of paperwork for businesses, for example by accepting digital, not paper, copies of official documents in an attempt to drag it into the digital age. A recent survey of 500 companies showed that fax machines remained in use as the most secure form of communication.
Compare that to HiPhi (pronounced "hi-fi"), a luxury car company from China that was founded in 2019. It is now producing the third version of its tech-heavy electric vehicles, with doors that glide open at the push of a button, and lights on the outside and inside of the doors that can flash and change colors. The cars are now selling in Germany and Norway, starting at 105,000 euros, or $ 113,000, and were on display at the auto show.
The ability to produce the car so quickly is linked to a different approach to the auto business, said Mark Stanton, the company's chief technology officer.
"The fear of failure is huge and that mentality really becomes a roadblock in your everyday process of what you do," Mr. Stanton said. "We completely wipe that away."
One of the leading factors worrying companies in Germany is the persistently high price of energy.
For decades, Germany prided itself on its steady supply of power that kept factories producing steel and cars humming. But the source of that power was natural gas piped in from Russia, and Germans refused to consider other suppliers.
After Moscow halted the flow of natural gas to Germany a year ago as a consequence of Berlin's support for Ukraine, the price of gas more than quadrupled, forcing many companies to scale back production. Although prices have fallen, they remain nearly twice as high as they were in 2021.
The whiplash has cost companies that require high amounts of energy, like chemical makers, a sense of security for long-term planning, an annual survey of businesses showed. The study, conducted by the German Chambers of Commerce and Industry, found that confidence in the government's energy policy was at its lowest point in more than a decade.
"After the energy price shock at the end of last year and the relatively mild winter, companies are deeply concerned about future developments," said Achim Dercks, the organization's deputy general manager.
That fear is causing many German industrial firms to reconsider previously planned investments. Earlier this year, Volkswagen decided to scrap plans to build a second battery factory in Germany.
The company is already building one battery factory in Salzgitter, near its headquarters in Wolfsburg, and another in Valencia, Spain. This spring, Volkswagen announced that it had chosen Ontario as the site for its first battery plant outside Europe, lured by lucrative incentives and industrial power prices roughly one-third cheaper than in Germany.
Lowering energy prices by just 1 cent per kilowatt-hour can translate to an annual difference in cost of up to 100 million euros when producing batteries for electric vehicles, Oliver Blume, Volkswagen's chief executive, said in an interview with the German public broadcaster ZDF.
"If we look at the prices we are currently being offered in North America or in other regions of the world, Germany is a long way off," Mr. Blume said.
Volkswagen is not alone in looking abroad to expand its electric vehicle production capacity. Earlier this year, BMW, which is based in Munich, announced it would invest €800 million in Mexico to produce high-voltage batteries and its new fully electric models. Those cars are expected to go into production in 2025 at the company's plant in Hungary.
In China, German automakers' failure to meet the growing demand for battery-powered vehicles left a vacuum, which domestic automakers quickly moved to fill, producing affordable and attractive electric cars that are taking over their home market.
Volkswagen is making moves to improve its position in China. Last month, it announced that it would invest $ 700 million for a nearly 5 percent stake in XPeng, a Chinese start-up that makes electric vehicles, in an effort to help it meet the demands of the Chinese market.
But now Chinese automakers have their eyes on Europe, where gas-fueled cars are to be banned in 12 years.
At the auto show on Monday, traditional German automakers presented plans for expanding production of all-electric vehicles in the coming years, but manufacturers from China revealed new models they were bringing to the European market.
"Europe is a strategic market for BYD," said Michael Shu, managing director of BYD Europe. Last month, he said, his company became the first automaker in the world to deliver five million fully electric or hybrid vehicles.
Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, director of the Center Automotive Research in Duisburg, Germany, described this year's auto show as a "Zeitenwende," or turning point -- the same term used by Chancellor Olaf Scholz when pronouncing Germany's transition in foreign policy after Russia invaded Ukraine.
"A Zeitenwende, that sees Europe becoming an interesting market for Chinese electric vehicles," he said. "The competition will be tougher."

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Australia's consumer commission said in legal proceedings that Qantas, the country's national carrier, had sold tickets for routes it never intended to fly.
Qantas Airways, Australia's national airline, sold thousands of tickets for flights that it had already canceled, the country's consumer watchdog said in a lawsuit against the carrier, and left travelers scrambling to make alternative arrangements.
In a statement on Thursday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it had started legal proceedings in Australian federal court against Qantas. It said the airline had engaged in false, misleading or deceptive conduct by advertising tickets for more than 8,000 flights scheduled from May 2022 to July 2022 that it knew it would never fly.
The airline said it took the allegations "seriously" and would respond to them in full in court. But, in a statement, it noted that the flights had occurred at a time of "upheaval" for the industry, during a "challenging" postpandemic return to normalcy.
In its filing, the watchdog group said tickets remained available for an average of more than two weeks and sometimes as long as 47 days after the flights had been canceled.
The flight cancellations were typically related not to weather or staffing shortages but to circumstances within the airline's control, including changes in "consumer demand, route withdrawals or retention of takeoff and landing slots at certain airports," Gina Cass-Gottlieb, the chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, said in a statement. The commission did not state why Qantas would have sold tickets for canceled flights.
The news came as anger swirls in Australia at revelations that the government blocked Qatar Airways from adding flights to Australia to protect Qantas's interests, in turn keeping fares at double the cost of those of before the pandemic.
The proposal, which would have added one million seats a year and most likely have reduced prices, was blocked by Catherine King, the transportation minister, who said it was not in Australia's national interests, including the "need to ensure that there are long-term, well-paid, secure jobs by Australians in the aviation sector."
The airline faces a separate class-action lawsuit over its policy on flights canceled because of the pandemic, in which the airline issued travel credits that would expire rather than give refunds to customers.
"By acting in this way," the suit alleges, "Qantas has enjoyed significant financial benefits at its customers' expense."
In a statement, Qantas said the period referred to by the watchdog "was a time of unprecedented upheaval for the entire airline industry." The company posted a record profit of around 2.5 billion Australian dollars, or $ 1.6 billion, for the fiscal year that ended June 30. During the pandemic, it received 2.7 billion Australian dollars in support from taxpayers, which it has said it will not pay back.
Speaking to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the country's public broadcaster, on Friday, Ms. Cass-Gottlieb said the commission would seek "a record penalty" of at least 250 million Australian dollars from the airline to send a warning to companies about consumer-related misconduct.
"This is going to be an important test for us. We consider these penalties have been too low," she said, adding: "We are going to seek a penalty that will underline that this is not just to be a cost of doing business -- it is to deter conduct of this nature."
The previous highest penalty, 125 million Australian dollars, was issued to Volkswagen in 2020 after the carmaker was found to have misled consumers and regulators about its compliance with Australian diesel emissions standards.

Heineken Cuts Forecast
Amid Global Sales Slump
Heineken, the world's second-largest brewer, cut its 2023 profit growth forecast on Monday after an economic slowdown in Vietnam and price increases squeezed sales volumes, depressing first-half earnings more than expected.
Shares in the Dutch brewer, whose brands include Tiger and Sol, fell as much as 6.7 percent to their lowest level since January.
Brewers profited late last year from drinkers' willingness to pay higher prices, but inflation has since taken its toll.
While some shoppers have sought out cheaper alternatives to branded food and white goods, beer drinkers have remained largely loyal to established brands but consumed less.
For Heineken, the average price of its beers was 12.7 percent higher than a year earlier.
In the first half, Heineken sold 5.6 percent less beer, with declines in all regions. Over half of the drop was in Vietnam and Nigeria, with price increases also having an impact. REUTERS

Lamborghini May Sell
10,000 Cars, C.E.O. Says
Lamborghini could sell 10,000 cars this year for the first time, its chief executive said on Monday as the automaker reported a rise in profit and revenues for the first half of the year.
The Italian luxury sports car brand, a subsidiary of Germany's Volkswagen, sold 5,341 cars between January and June, up 4.9 percent from a year earlier. The United States was its largest market, with 1,625 deliveries. Lamborghini's revenue grew 6.7 percent to 1.42 billion euros ( $ 1.56 billion), and its operating income rose 7.2 percent to a record €456 million, the company said.
Lamborghini's chief executive, Stephan Winkelmann, said it was not easy to make forecasts because of market uncertainties, including with raw materials, but added that selling 10,000 cars this year was a "feasible goal."
Supported by the success of its Urus sport utility vehicle, which costs around 200,000 euros before taxes, Lamborghini has in recent years expanded its output, relying on solid demand from wealthy car lovers. REUTERS

New Board for Pirelli,
Diluting Chinese Influence
Pirelli investors approved a new board on Monday, giving the tire maker a new three-year governance framework after the Italian government took steps last month to curb the influence of the company's leading Chinese investor.
Andrea Casaluci, previously the general manager operations, has been promoted to chief executive, Pirelli said in a statement. He succeeds Marco Tronchetti Provera.
Mr. Tronchetti Provera, whose Camfin vehicle is Pirelli's second-largest shareholder, retains a strong voice in the new 15-member board in the role of executive vice chairman. Pirelli's new chairman is Jiao Jian, the chief executive of the leading shareholder Sinochem, the state-owned Chinese group.
The Italian government used "golden power" legislation that protects key national assets to impose prescriptions on the proposed renewal of a governance pact between Sinochem and Camfin. REUTERS

With the Aid of A.I., Google's Robots Get Smart: [National Desk]

Full text: Our sneak peek into Google's new robotics model, RT-2, which melds artificial intelligence technology with robots.
A one-armed robot stood in front of a table. On the table sat three plastic figurines: a lion, a whale and a dinosaur.
An engineer gave the robot an instruction: "Pick up the extinct animal."
The robot whirred for a moment, then its arm extended and its claw opened and descended. It grabbed the dinosaur.
Until very recently, this demonstration, which I witnessed during a podcast interview at Google's robotics division in Mountain View, Calif., last week, would have been impossible. Robots weren't able to reliably manipulate objects they had never seen before, and they certainly weren't capable of making the logical leap from "extinct animal" to "plastic dinosaur."
But a quiet revolution is underway in robotics, one that piggybacks on recent advances in so-called large language models -- the same type of artificial intelligence system that powers ChatGPT, Bard and other chatbots.
Google has recently begun plugging state-of-the-art language models into its robots, giving them the equivalent of artificial brains. The secretive project has made the robots far smarter and given them new powers of understanding and problem-solving.
I got a glimpse of that progress during a private demonstration of Google's latest robotics model, called RT-2. The model, which is being unveiled on Friday, amounts to a first step toward what Google executives described as a major leap in the way robots are built and programmed.
"We've had to reconsider our entire research program as a result of this change," said Vincent Vanhoucke, Google DeepMind's head of robotics. "A lot of the things that we were working on before have been entirely invalidated."
Robots still fall short of human-level dexterity and fail at some basic tasks, but Google's use of A.I. language models to give robots new skills of reasoning and improvisation represents a promising breakthrough, said Ken Goldberg, a robotics professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
"What's very impressive is how it links semantics with robots," he said. "That's very exciting for robotics."
To understand the magnitude of this, it helps to know a little about how robots have conventionally been built.
For years, the way engineers at Google and other companies trained robots to do a mechanical task -- flipping a burger, for example -- was by programming them with a specific list of instructions. (Lower the spatula 6.5 inches, slide it forward until it encounters resistance, raise it 4.2 inches, rotate it 180 degrees, and so on.) Robots would then practice the task again and again, with engineers tweaking the instructions each time until they got it right.
This approach worked for certain, limited uses. But training robots this way is slow and labor-intensive. It requires collecting lots of data from real-world tests. And if you wanted to teach a robot to do something new -- to flip a pancake instead of a burger, say -- you usually had to reprogram it from scratch.
Partly because of these limitations, hardware robots have improved less quickly than their software-based siblings. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, disbanded its robotics team in 2021, citing slow progress and a lack of high-quality training data. In 2017, Google's parent company, Alphabet, sold Boston Dynamics, a robotics company it had acquired, to the Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank. (Boston Dynamics is now owned by Hyundai and seems to exist mainly to produce viral videos of humanoid robots performing terrifying feats of agility.)
In recent years, researchers at Google had an idea. What if, instead of being programmed for specific tasks one by one, robots could use an A.I. language model -- one that had been trained on vast swaths of internet text -- to learn new skills for themselves?
"We started playing with these language models around two years ago, and then we realized that they have a lot of knowledge in them," said Karol Hausman, a Google research scientist. "So we started connecting them to robots."
Google's first attempt to join language models and physical robots was a research project called PaLM-SayCan, which was revealed last year. It drew some attention, but its usefulness was limited. The robots lacked the ability to interpret images -- a crucial skill, if you want them to be able to navigate the world. They could write out step-by-step instructions for different tasks, but they couldn't turn those steps into actions.
Google's new robotics model, RT-2, can do just that. It's what the company calls a "vision-language-action" model, or an A.I. system that has the ability not just to see and analyze the world around it, but to tell a robot how to move.
It does so by translating the robot's movements into a series of numbers -- a process called tokenizing -- and incorporating those tokens into the same training data as the language model. Eventually, just as ChatGPT or Bard learns to guess what words should come next in a poem or a history essay, RT-2 can learn to guess how a robot's arm should move to pick up a ball or throw an empty soda can into the recycling bin.
"In other words, this model can learn to speak robot," Mr. Hausman said.
In an hourlong demonstration, which took place in a Google office kitchen littered with objects from a dollar store, my podcast co-host and I saw RT-2 perform a number of impressive tasks. One was successfully following complex instructions like "move the Volkswagen to the German flag," which RT-2 did by finding and snagging a model VW Bus and setting it down on a miniature German flag several feet away.
It also proved capable of following instructions in languages other than English, and even making abstract connections between related concepts. Once, when I wanted RT-2 to pick up a soccer ball, I instructed it to "pick up Lionel Messi." RT-2 got it right on the first try.
The robot wasn't perfect. It incorrectly identified the flavor of a can of LaCroix placed on the table in front of it. (The can was lemon; RT-2 guessed orange.) Another time, when it was asked what kind of fruit was on a table, the robot simply answered, "White." (It was a banana.) A Google spokeswoman said the robot had used a cached answer to a previous tester's question because its Wi-Fi had briefly gone out.
Google has no immediate plans to sell RT-2 robots or release them more widely, but its researchers believe these new language-equipped machines will eventually be useful for more than just parlor tricks. Robots with built-in language models could be put into warehouses, used in medicine or even deployed as household assistants -- folding laundry, unloading the dishwasher, picking up around the house, they said.
"This really opens up using robots in environments where people are," Mr. Vanhoucke said. "In office environments, in home environments, in all the places where there are a lot of physical tasks that need to be done."
Of course, moving objects around in the messy, chaotic physical world is harder than doing it in a controlled lab. And given that A.I. language models frequently make mistakes or invent nonsensical answers -- which researchers call hallucination or confabulation -- using them as the brains of robots could introduce new risks.
But Mr. Goldberg, the Berkeley robotics professor, said those risks were still remote.
"We're not talking about letting these things run loose," he said. "In these lab environments, they're just trying to push some objects around on a table."
Google, for its part, said RT-2 was equipped with plenty of safety features. In addition to a big red button on the back of every robot -- which stops the robot in its tracks when pressed -- the system uses sensors to avoid bumping into people or objects.
The A.I. software built into RT-2 has its own safeguards, which it can use to prevent the robot from doing anything harmful. One benign example: Google's robots can be trained not to pick up containers with water in them, because water can damage their hardware if it spills.
If you're the kind of person who worries about A.I. going rogue -- and Hollywood has given us plenty of reasons to fear that scenario, from the original "Terminator" to last year's "M3gan" -- the idea of making robots that can reason, plan and improvise on the fly probably strikes you as a terrible idea.
But at Google, it's the kind of idea researchers are celebrating. After years in the wilderness, hardware robots are back -- and they have their chatbot brains to thank.

Volkswagen, Europe's largest automaker, is scaling back its forecast for deliveries in 2023 as it grapples with lagging sales of its electric vehicles, but the company said on Thursday that it hoped to bolster its position in China through increased collaboration with local technology companies.
Financial targets for the year remain unchanged, the company said in its half-yearly financial report, but it expects deliveries of between nine million and 9.5 million vehicles for the year, widening the range from the 9.5 million previously forecast.
For decades, Volkswagen was the leading automaker in the Chinese market, which contributed nearly half of its earnings. But failure to understand Chinese customers' appetite for electric vehicles has cost the German carmaker market share, and deliveries in China fell for the first half of the year.
Shares fell more than 3 percent on Thursday.
The Numbers
Volkswagen said its after-tax earnings in the first half of the year fell 20 percent from a year earlier, to 8.5 billion euros, or $ 9.45 billion. But overall revenue increased 18.2 percent as the company stemmed some of its losses in China, where deliveries were down 1.2 percent.
Western Europe provided the company with its strongest business, with 1.65 million vehicles ordered in the first half of the year, and 200,000 of them -- or 12 percent -- were electric, the company said. It expects shorter waits by the second half of the year, when constraints on supplies and transport as well as logistics tangles will ease.
The company also confirmed that it had sold its Russia operations, including a manufacturing plant, for €125 million. The sale of Volkswagen Group Rus to Avilon, a Moscow-based dealership, was announced in May.
The China Strategy
As part of an effort to claw back ground lost in the Chinese market, Volkswagen said on Wednesday that it would invest $ 700 million for a nearly 5 percent stake in XPeng, a Chinese start-up that makes electric vehicles.
Last year, the Chinese automaker BYD overtook Volkswagen as the leading brand in the country. BYD widened the gap in the second quarter of the year, selling more than 595,000 hybrid or fully electric models, compared with 544,000 vehicles sold by Volkswagen, only 23,400 of them electric.
Volkswagen hopes that its investment in XPeng will help advance the German automaker's electric vehicle software to the standards produced by Chinese manufacturers. Analysts say German companies have yet to match the technological advancements in phones, homes and vehicles as well as in-car entertainment that drivers in China expect.
The company also said its Audi division would expand its relationship with SAIC, a Chinese automaker that sells cars under the British brand MG.
Some analysts interpreted the move as a concession that Volkswagen was unable to compete with Chinese companies on the latest technology.
"The automobile of the future is coming from China. The Chinese are the leaders in important technology sectors," said Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, the director of the Center for Automotive Research in Duisburg, Germany. "Without the know-how of the Chinese, Volkswagen would lose customers in China and, in a few years, in the rest of the world."
What's Next
Unlike Tesla, which has become the world's most popular electric-car company partly by producing relatively few models in a limited palette of exterior and interior colors, Volkswagen Group offers dozens of models from its 10 brands, which include Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini. Analysts have increasingly questioned whether such a complex offering can remain competitive in today's market.
But Oliver Blume, Volkswagen's chief executive, expressed confidence that VW customers, including those in China, wanted more variety in their vehicles.
"People love brands -- people love design and individuality," Mr. Blume said on Thursday. "We think that is our specialty."

Full text: The companies will jointly spend at least $ 1 billion to build a North American network in an effort to persuade more people to buy battery-powered cars and trucks.
Seven major automakers announced a plan on Wednesday to nearly double the number of fast chargers in the United States in an effort to address one of the main reasons that people hesitate to buy electric cars.
The carmakers -- BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis -- will initially invest at least $ 1 billion in a joint venture that will build 30,000 charging ports on major highways and other locations in the United States and Canada.
The United States and Canada have about 36,000 fast chargers -- those that can replenish a drained battery in 30 minutes or less. In some sparsely populated areas, such chargers can be hundreds of miles apart. Surveys show that fear about not being able to find a charger during longer journeys is a major reason that some car buyers are reluctant to buy electric vehicles.
Sales of electric vehicles have risen quickly in the United States, but there are signs that demand is softening. As a result, Tesla, Ford Motor and other carmakers have cut prices in recent months and are offering incentives. Popular models that had long waiting lists last year are now available in a few days or weeks.
Major carmakers are investing billions of dollars to manufacture electric vehicles and batteries and to establish supplier networks. Having staked their futures on the technology, they have a strong incentive to ensure that electric vehicles catch on with car buyers.
The chargers installed by the joint venture will have plugs designed for the connections used by most carmakers other than Tesla, as well as the standard developed by Tesla that Ford, G.M. and other companies have said they intend to switch to in 2025.
"The better experience people have, the faster E.V. adoption will grow," Mary T. Barra, the chief executive of General Motors, said in a statement.
The seven automakers plan to formalize the joint venture and announce its name by the end of the year, Chris Martin, a Honda spokesman, said. The first chargers will begin operating around the middle of 2024, he said, with all 30,000 in place by the end of the decade.
The joint venture is open to adding other partners, he said. Among major automakers, Ford was a notable absence from the announcement on Wednesday. The company said in a statement on Wednesday that it would continue to invest in its own network, which allows Ford owners to charge from a variety of providers with one mobile phone app.
The partnership also does not include Volkswagen. The company is a majority shareholder of Electrify America, one of the largest fast-charging providers.
Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States and has said it will open its networks to other car brands, though, so far, it has made fewer than 100 ports available. Owners of Ford and G.M. vehicles, among others, will be able to connect to 12,000 Tesla fast chargers using an adapter beginning next year. In 2025, Ford and G.M. plan to make models designed to take the Tesla plug without an adapter.
The decision to form the joint venture is an indication that the seven carmakers do not intend to rely solely on Tesla, which dominates sales of electric vehicles, for charging.
The chargers being built by the joint venture will be concentrated in urban areas and along major highways, especially those used most heavily by vacationers and other travelers, the companies said in a statement. Charging stations will be close to restrooms, restaurants and other amenities. The partners said they would try to take advantage of federal and state funds available for charging infrastructure.
Most electric vehicle owners charge at home and rarely need to use public chargers. Home chargers typically replenish batteries overnight. Most public chargers, about 125,000 in the United States and Canada, also operate relatively slowly -- taking four to 10 hours to do the job.
But fast chargers are important for longer trips. Fear of not being able to find one is a major psychological impediment for many would-be electric car buyers. A related problem is that many charging companies have been reluctant to build too many stations in places where few people own electric cars.
The best way to promote electric vehicle ownership, said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity firm in New York that focuses on transportation, would be to install chargers in states in the West, Midwest or Southeast where there aren't many, rather than in California or Eastern states that already have extensive charging networks.
Studies have found that in Norway, where almost all new cars sold are battery-powered, sales of electric cars increased steeply when fast chargers became available, Ms. Natarajan said. But the impact diminished as chargers became more commonplace.
"In states where E.V. adoption is the lowest, that is where it would make sense to build chargers," she said. "That is where you are going to have the most impact."
But even California could use more charging stations, said Cathy Zoi, the chief executive of EVgo, a Los Angeles company that builds and operates public charging stations nationwide.
"The most mature market is California, and we're not saturated in California yet," Ms. Zoi said. "Potential buyers of E.V.s are still feeling they need to see more charging stations."
The new joint venture could be a competitor to EVgo, Electrify America and other companies hoping to cash in on the growth of electric vehicles. But the carmakers may also want to tap the expertise of EVgo and others that have experience in finding suitable sites, acquiring permits and connecting to the electric grid.
EVgo has a partnership with G.M. to build fast-charging stations, and Ms. Zoi said the company was open to working with the joint venture.
An Energy Department database that maps the location of chargers highlights the gaping holes in current networks. In Minnesota, for example, fast chargers are sprinkled across the bustling Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. But in the state's northern city, Duluth, home to nearly 90,000 people, there are just five fast-charging ports, four of which can charge only Tesla cars.
Fast chargers are concentrated in wealthier counties, according to a study by Bumper, an online marketplace for cars. There are also racial disparities. Counties where most residents are Black have, on average, fewer than half as many chargers per capita as white counties, according to Bumper. Native American counties have even fewer.

G.M.'s Electric Vehicle Rollout Delayed by Slow Battery Production: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The company is earning big profits on gasoline cars and trucks but is struggling to catch up to Tesla in the fastest-growing segment of the auto market.
General Motors is investing tens of billions of dollars to produce new electric vehicles and, it hopes, catch up to Tesla.
But those ambitious goals appear distant. This year, the company is struggling to produce a new electric car battery pack meant for the electric vehicles it plans to introduce over several years.
On Tuesday, G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said the delays were "disappointing" and stemmed from a supplier's inability to deliver automated manufacturing machinery.
"We are working on multiple fronts to put this behind us," she said in a conference call with analysts.
Many investors are increasingly worried about the company's plans because electric vehicles are the fastest-growing segment of the auto industry and are the most important piece of Ms. Barra's long-term strategy for G.M.
The company's share price was down 3.5 percent at the close of trading on Tuesday.
A big fear for investors is that G.M., Ford Motor and other large automakers stand to lose customers as more drivers buy battery-powered cars. In China, Europe and California, where electric vehicles account for a significant and growing share of new car sales, once dominant automakers like Volkswagen and Toyota have been losing market share to Tesla and Chinese automakers like BYD.
Two years ago, Ms. Barra said, G.M. aimed to double annual revenue by 2030, to about $ 280 billion. Much of the increased business is supposed to come from electric vehicles, and new revenue from software and services linked to those cars and trucks. The company has also set a goal of phasing out internal combustion models by 2035.
Right now, G.M. is "way behind where they should be," said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, a consulting firm. "If they're having trouble with the first wave of these new E.V.s, and if they can't roll them out, that's not good for the next wave of higher-volume models."
In the first half of this year, G.M. built just 50,000 electric vehicles, and about 80 percent were Chevrolet Bolts that use an older battery pack made by a supplier. In the United States, G.M. sold fewer than 2,800 vehicles that used its new, modular Ultium battery packs, which are made at an Ohio factory that the company owns with LG Energy Solution. Two other Ultium factories are under construction, in Tennessee and Michigan.
Ms. Barra said G.M. was sticking with a previous forecast that it would make 400,000 electric vehicles in North America from 2022 to 2024, and it is expected to make 100,000 in the second half of this year. But she did not repeat an earlier prediction that the company would make more than one million in 2025, most of which were supposed to use Ultium technology.
Ultium battery packs are made from Lego-like modules that can be combined in different sizes. By using them in many vehicles, from compact cars to large pickups, G.M. hopes to reap economies of scale and gain a cost advantage over other automakers.
G.M. had said it would stop making the Bolt, but Ms. Barra said the company now planned to update the car with Ultium technology.
For now, the sluggish electric vehicle rollout isn't hurting the company's bottom line. G.M. said on Tuesday that it made a profit of $ 2.6 billion from April to June, an increase of 52 percent from a year earlier. Revenue totaled $ 44.7 billion, up 25 percent.
G.M.'s chief financial officer, Paul Jacobson, said the company had benefited from higher prices and strong sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America. The average price of the vehicles that G.M. sold in the second quarter was $ 52,000 -- about $ 1,600 more than in the first quarter of the year.
G.M. sold 833,000 cars and trucks in North America in the second quarter, a 26 percent increase from a year earlier. In the rest of the world, it sold 147,000 vehicles, about 8,000 fewer than a year earlier.
Mr. Jacobson also said G.M. now expected to earn $ 9.3 billion to $ 10.7 billion this year, up from a previous target of $ 8.4 billion to $ 9.9 billion. The company also expects to reduce costs by $ 3 billion by the end of 2024, $ 1 billion more than an earlier forecast.
The company could struggle to hit its financial targets this year if the United Auto Workers go on strike. The company's contract with the U.A.W. ends in September and management and union officials recently started negotiating a new deal. The union has taken a more aggressive posture to the talks under a new president, Shawn Fain.
G.M. currently offers only a few vehicles that use Ultium batteries. They include the Cadillac Lyriq, an S.U.V.; the GMC Hummer, which has a starting price of about $ 90,0000; and large delivery vans made by a new division called BrightDrop.
This summer and fall, G.M. is supposed to add three electric Chevrolets -- the Blazer and Equinox S.U.V.s and an electric Silverado pickup. The company had previously said the Silverado would go on sale in the spring, but the truck is now not expected until the fall.

In Wings of 'Camelot,' Shakespearean Spells: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: On a recent Wednesday, a dozen members of the cast of "Camelot" gathered in a circle in a rehearsal room in the basement of Lincoln Center Theater. Fergie Philippe, who plays Sir Sagramore and understudies as King Arthur, sat on a chair in the middle, staring quizzically at a sheet of paper with a monologue from Act V, Scene 1 of Shakespeare's "Titus Andronicus."
Next to him stood Dakin Matthews, who plays both Merlyn and Pellinore, dressed in cargo shorts and a purple polo. As Philippe began speaking, Matthews squinted his eyes shut and silently mouthed the words.
"Even now I curse the day----" Philippe said before he was quickly cut off by Matthews, who jabbed a finger in the air.
"You went down on 'day,"' Matthews said, referring to Philippe's incorrect inflection.
Over the next two hours, Matthews paced the room coaching the group through monologues from "Julius Caesar," "Henry IV" and "Macbeth," interrupting a performer to correct the pronunciation of "doth," or to help find the "internal shape" in a text.
"I feel like I'm a monk in a scriptorium keeping something alive," Matthews said.
Matthews, an 82-year-old veteran of the theater, has performed in over 200 shows around the world -- from Broadway to the Teatro Español in Madrid. His life has become inseparable from the stage: In addition to acting, he has directed, translated and written numerous plays of his own, many of which have been performed on the West Coast.
But his colleagues know Matthews best as a maestro of the intricate world of Shakespearean drama, the man who can tell you exactly how to untangle a thorny text from "Henry IV." And when he appears in shows, he often hosts workshops where younger members can learn Shakespeare.
"There's this complete understanding that there's somebody in this room who has way more experience than us, who has put the work in, and on a different level performs at a caliber different than us," Philippe said, "and we all agree and know and decide, 'Yes, please teach us."'
Born in Oakland, Calif., in 1940, Matthews grew up surrounded by an extended Irish family. He was a sophomore at a Catholic high school when he was introduced to Shakespeare's "Henry IV."
Wanting to enter the priesthood, he moved to Rome to continue his religious education.
One summer in 1962, he traveled from Rome to Stratford, England, where he saw his first professional Shakespeare production. It was Peter Hall's "A Midsummer Night's Dream." Matthews, 21 at the time, was transfixed.
"I was like, 'Oh my God,"' he recalled. "It was really like entering a portal, like entering a different world."
A seed was planted. "This is something one could actually do," he realized.
Back in Rome, he rallied the other priests-in-training, purchased costumes from a theater shop and directed two student plays, "Julius Caesar" and "Henry IV."
Matthews returned to the Bay Area and later earned a master's in English from East Bay, where he became a professor. While in graduate school, he won the role of Falstaff in "Henry IV" at the Marin Shakespeare Festival in 1965.
For the next two decades, Matthews taught and rehearsed during the day, and starred in shows around the Bay Area at night, darting around in his green Volkswagen beetle. (He met his wife, Anne McNaughton, in 1967 at the Santa Clara Shakespeare Festival.)
In 1990, he retired from teaching and moved to Los Angeles, where he continued working in theater and began performing in movies and TV, including "Down Home," "Soul Man" and "The Jeff Foxworthy Show."
Matthews made his Broadway debut in 2003 in "Henry IV." Ethan Hawke, who played Hotspur, remembered watching in awe as Matthews argued with Kevin Kline, who played Falstaff, over minutiae in the text.
"It's like listening to Thoreau and Emerson bicker about the state of mankind," Hawke said. "It was life and death for them."
The earliest of Matthews's Shakespeare workshops for fellow cast members was in 2001, for the actors in Peter Hall's "Romeo and Juliet" in Los Angeles. He also held the classes for the Broadway production of "To Kill a Mockingbird" and has led them for the Actors Center in New York. As the July 23 closing night of "Camelot" approached, Matthews resumed the workshops.
Philippe said learning from Matthews has made his "Camelot" performances more versatile.
"It gave me the opportunity to play a bit more. I was able to find some new things in the character every night," he said. "It just makes you a smarter actor."
Matthews has no plans to stop acting, but he said he has lost 20 pounds while performing in "Camelot" and has started to feel his age. His knees creak, and his voice can't project as it once did.
"For the first time it felt like work," he said. "That's the first time I've ever seriously thought about retiring."
For now, he plans to keep performing and to continue mentoring a younger generation of actors.
"We're bridging a gap, a chasm," he said. "And someone's got to keep something going somehow."

G.O.P. Eyes Ford's Deal On Batteries With Chinese: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Republicans are raising fresh concerns about CATL, the battery maker Ford is working with to bring new technology to the U.S., and its connections to Xinjiang.
A licensing agreement between Ford Motor and a major Chinese battery maker is facing scrutiny by Republican lawmakers, who say it could make an American automaker reliant on a company with links to forced labor in China's Xinjiang region.
In a letter sent to Ford on Thursday, the chairs of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and the House Ways and Means Committee demanded more information about the agreement, including what they said was a plan by Ford to employ several hundred workers from China at a new battery factory in Michigan.
Ford announced in February that it planned to set up the $ 3.5 billion factory using technology from Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd., known as CATL, the world's largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles. CATL produces about a third of electric vehicle batteries globally and supplies General Motors, Volkswagen, BMW, Tesla and other major automakers.
Ford has defended the collaboration, saying it will help diversify Ford's supply chain and allow a battery that is less expensive and more durable than current alternatives to be made in the United States for the first time, rather than imported.
But lawmakers, who previously criticized the agreement, cited evidence that CATL had not relinquished its ownership of a company it helped set up in Xinjiang, where the United Nations has identified systemic human rights violations.
CATL publicly divested its share of the company, Xinjiang Zhicun Lithium Industry Company, in March, after its deal with Ford was announced. But the shares were bought by an investment partnership in which CATL had owned a partial stake when it was established, as well as a former CATL manager who holds leadership roles in other companies owned by the battery maker, corporate records show.
The circumstances of the sale raise "serious questions about whether CATL is attempting to obscure links to forced labor," wrote Representatives Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, the chairman of the select committee, and Jason Smith of Missouri, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
The lawmakers, citing details of Ford's licensing agreement that are on file with the select committee, also criticized the automaker's commitment to employ several hundred Chinese workers. Employees from China would set up and maintain CATL's equipment at the Michigan factory until about 2038, the lawmakers said. The factory is expected to employ 2,500 U.S. workers, Ford has said.
"Ford has argued that the deal will create thousands of American jobs, further Ford's 'commitments to sustainability and human rights' and lead to American battery technology advancements," they wrote. "But newly discovered information raises serious questions about each claim."
T.R. Reid, a spokesman for Ford, said the company was going through the letter and would respond in good faith. He said that human rights were fundamental to how Ford did business, and that the automaker was thorough in assessing such issues.
"There has been an awful lot said and implied about this project that is incorrect," Mr. Reid said. "At the end of the day, we think creating 2,500 good-paying jobs with a new multibillion investment in the U.S. for great technology that we'll bring to bear in great electric vehicles is good all the way around."
CATL responded after publication saying that it has no equity relationship with the investment partnership that bought the Xinjiang company, but it did not immediately provide any documentation.
CATL's collaboration with Ford could be a bellwether for the electric vehicle industry in the United States. Critics have labeled the agreement a "Trojan horse" for Chinese interests and called for scuttling the partnership. If it succeeds, they say, reliance on Chinese technology could become the norm for the U.S. electric vehicle industry.
Ultimately, China's control over key technologies like batteries could leave the United States "in a far weaker position," said Erik Gordon, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.
"The profit margins go to the innovators who provide the advanced technology, not the people with screwdrivers that assemble the advanced technology," he said.
But CATL and other Chinese companies have battery technology not readily available from suppliers in the United States or Europe. The Michigan plant would be the first in the United States to produce so-called LFP batteries that use lithium, iron and phosphate as their main active materials.
They are heavier than the lithium, nickel and manganese batteries currently used by Ford and other automakers but less expensive to make and more durable, able to withstand numerous charges without degrading. They also do not use nickel or cobalt, another battery material, which are often mined in environmentally damaging ways, and sometimes with child labor.
Without the most advanced or least expensive batteries, U.S. carmakers could fall behind Chinese rivals like BYD that are pushing into Europe and other markets outside China. Americans may also have to pay more for electric cars and trucks, which would slow sales of vehicles that do not emit greenhouse gases.
A battery unveiled by CATL last year delivers hundreds of miles of driving range after a charge of just 10 minutes.
"The hard truth is that the Chinese took a huge gamble on electric vehicles and plopped down over a trillion Chinese dollars and subsidies on this industry, and it just so happens that gamble came up all aces," said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
"If you decide not to partner with a very large battery maker, then you're essentially committing to delaying the U.S. energy transition," he added.
Ford plans to use batteries made with CATL technology in lower-priced versions of vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning pickup. The least expensive version of Tesla's Model 3 sedan comes with an LFP battery that CATL is widely reported to have supplied.
For decades, Western companies have had a monopoly on the world's most advanced technologies, and have sought access to the Chinese market while also safeguarding their intellectual property.
But China's dominance in electric vehicle batteries, as well as in the production of solar panels and wind turbines, has flipped that dynamic. It has created a particularly tricky dilemma for the Biden administration and other Democrats, who want to reduce the country's reliance on China but also argue that the United States must quickly make a transition to cleaner energy sources to try to mitigate climate change.
The solar and electric vehicle battery industry's exposure to Xinjiang further complicates the situation. The Biden administration has condemned the Chinese government for carrying out genocide and crimes against humanity in the region.
The United States last year barred imports of products made in whole or in part in Xinjiang, saying companies operating in the region are not able to ensure that their facilities are free of forced labor.
In 2022, CATL and a partner registered a lithium processing company in the region called Xinjiang Zhicun Lithium Industry Company, which promoted plans to become the world's largest producer of lithium carbonate, a key battery component.
Through a series of subsidiaries and shareholder relationships, that Xinjiang lithium company has financial ties to a Chinese electricity company, Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Company, or TBEA, according to records that The New York Times reviewed through Sayari Graph, a mapping tool for corporate ownership. TBEA has participated extensively in so-called poverty alleviation and labor transfer programs in Xinjiang that the United States considers a form of forced labor.
While the Chinese government argues that labor transfer and poverty alleviation programs are aimed at improving living standards in the region, human rights experts say that they are also directed at pacifying and indoctrinating the population, and that Uyghurs and other minority groups there cannot say no to these programs without fear of detention or punishment.
In December, CATL told The Times that it was a minority shareholder in the Xinjiang company and strictly prohibited any form of forced labor in its supply chain.
The Republican lawmakers also raised concerns about whether batteries made at Ford's Michigan plant would qualify for tax credits that the Biden administration was offering consumers who bought electric vehicles as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.
The law prohibits "foreign entities of concern" -- like companies in China, Russia, Iran or North Korea -- from benefiting from government tax credits. But because Ford is licensing CATL technology for the plant -- rather than forming a joint venture, as has often been the case with automakers and battery suppliers -- the batteries made in Michigan may still qualify for those incentives.
The Biden administration has not yet clarified exactly how the restriction on foreign entities will be applied. But Ford officials said they had been in conversation with the administration about the Michigan plant, and were confident that the facility would qualify for all of the law's benefits.
"We think batteries built by American workers in an American plant run by the wholly owned subsidiary of an American company will and should qualify," Mr. Reid, the Ford spokesman, said.

Tesla Wants to Double the Size Of Its German Assembly Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The electric automaker wants to produce a million cars a year at its plant near Berlin, a step that would make it Europe's largest car factory.
Tesla wants to double the production capacity of its assembly plant outside Berlin to one million electric vehicles a year, a move that would make it the largest car plant in Europe at a time when German automakers are struggling to keep pace in the transition to electric vehicles.
Since it began production in Grünheide 16 months ago, Tesla has disrupted the German automobile landscape. Over the first half of this year, for the first time, it eclipsed Volkswagen in electric vehicle sales.
If the expansion, detailed in thousands of pages made public on Wednesday, wins the approval of local officials, the plant's output will surpass that of Volkswagen's landmark factory in Wolfsburg, which was built in the 1930s and has remained Europe's largest, able to roll out 815,000 cars a year.
Volkswagen and other German automakers, including BMW and Mercedes-Benz, have spent years fumbling their attempts to produce electric cars that can compete with Tesla in price and popularity. Across the continent in June, new registrations of electric cars increased more than 66 percent from a year earlier, outselling diesel cars for the first time, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.
Since March 2022, Tesla's German plant has been producing about 5,000 Model Y sport utility vehicles each week -- a pace that is roughly half of its current capacity, which is still ramping up. The company said it would like to add capacity to build other models at the plant, but did not specify which ones. It is also seeking to double its production of battery cells, up to a storage capacity of 100 gigawatt hours per year, the expansion documents show.
The number of employees would rise to 22,500, up from 10,000 now, the company told residents at a town hall-style event near the plant on Tuesday. Dozens of jobs are advertised on the company's website, the majority of them in manufacturing, indicating the company still has openings in the current plant.
Dirk Schulze, the regional head of the IG Metall labor union, which counts 2.3 million workers nationwide among its ranks, welcomed the announcement of more jobs in the economically weak region. But he called for better working conditions for those on the job.
"Despite high levels of sick leave, staff are being cut on a significant scale," Mr. Schulze said. "But production targets are not being adjusted downward, so pressure on the remaining colleagues is increasing."
IG Metall has been frustrated at its inability to attract enough workers to produce a collective-bargaining agreement for employees at the plant. Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, has been blunt about his opposition to unions.
Local residents and organizations have one month to examine the plans and submit any concerns to authorities. A public hearing is to be held in October.
Tesla has encountered resistance from residents in the area since the plant was first proposed in 2019; they are concerned that the existing factory will be a drain on the groundwater. The expansion plans include construction of a water treatment facility, which would allow the factory to recycle water instead of expanding its use of resources.

America Can't Build a Green Economy Without China: [Op-Ed]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Roughly a century ago, when Henry Ford revolutionized modern car production, engineers from France, Japan, Germany and the Soviet Union flocked to Detroit to learn how to copy his miraculous methods. Ford's River Rouge plant, then the world's largest factory, ultimately inspired facilities by Renault, Volkswagen, Toyota and the Russian automaker Gaz. It also gave rise to the nightmarish wartime economies of World War II, when tanks, planes and toxic chemicals rolled off assembly lines worldwide.
Those engineers weren't in Detroit just out of curiosity. They knew they had to catch up to American methods. As one Weimar conservative said, Germany had to "study the means and mechanisms of the Americans" or become "America's prey."
Now, America is in its own game of economic catch-up -- in the booming area of clean energy. As of this year, China is the world's largest car exporter -- thanks to a surging electric vehicle industry -- and it commands at least 74 percent market share in each step of the solar panel supply chain. China learned to master the solar, battery and electric vehicle industries through the 2010s, while the United States was debating whether to pass clean-energy policy -- and even whether climate change existed at all. With the Inflation Reduction Act, the United States now has an opportunity to become more competitive, and nothing gets lawmakers from across the political spectrum pumped up faster than the prospect of crushing China.
But the United States cannot build a competitive renewable or electric vehicle industry from scratch. The history of innovation -- and of the modern world, frankly -- shows that American engineers will progress in these industries only when they can work with their Chinese counterparts.
Look no further than the pickle Ford is in now. By 2026, Ford wants to start selling electric vehicles outfitted with batteries made of a chemical cocktail known as L.F.P. -- lithium, iron, and phosphate -- to the American market. L.F.P. batteries can be charged more quickly and more often than the cobalt and nickel batteries that Ford uses today; they're also cheaper and more rugged and the minerals are easier to source.
The only problem: Ford doesn't know how to make L.F.P. batteries on a large scale. No American company does. Although Americans first invented and developed L.F.P. technology, back in the 1990s, Chinese companies were the ones that figured out how to produce it at scale. Today, Chinese companies essentially have a monopoly.
But Ford has a solution. In February, it announced plans to open a new $ 3.5 billion L.F.P. battery factory in Michigan. It would license the technology from a Chinese battery maker, whose engineers would -- in the words of Bill Ford, the automaker's chairman -- "help us get up to speed so that we can build these batteries ourselves." It seemed like a win-win: The Chinese company, CATL, would get cash and prestige; Ford would learn how to make these batteries; and America would get 2,500 new manufacturing jobs. This was, apparently, exactly the kind of situation that President Biden's climate law was meant to set up.
Yet Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who helped shape the law, exploded at the news. "I'll be damned if I'm going to give them $ 900 out of $ 7,500, to let it go to China for basically a product we started," he told an energy conference in Houston. (He was referring to the subsidy that the law grants to buyers of new electric vehicles, though Ford says none of that federal money would go to the Chinese company.)
"You're telling me we don't have the smart people and the technology, and we can't get up to speed quick enough?" he asked. "That doesn't make sense."
Republicans, too, blanched at the partnership. Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, who had once angled to win the factory for his state, abruptly withdrew his proposal and criticized the project as a "Trojan horse relationship with the Chinese Communist Party." Senator Marco Rubio of Florida demanded that the Treasury Department evaluate the deal as a national security risk.
But for all the overheated rhetoric, the truth is that free-flowing, in-person collaboration has been the fundamental mode of how technology moves across borders. With few exceptions, you either let yourself learn from your competitors or you fail to compete with them at all.
Other countries understand this. It is the United States that has had to learn this lesson again and again.
We learned it first in the 1910s, when Germany had the world's greatest chemical industry. American chemical companies had to wait until after World War I to bring German scientists to the United States so that DuPont and Dow could learn to make chemicals as good as their German competitors'.
We learned this lesson again in the 1980s when the Reagan administration pushed Japanese automakers to open factories with their American counterparts -- which allowed American engineers to better understand the superior manufacturing model the Japanese had developed. Those initial factories were such a success -- in one, labor input dropped to 19 hours per vehicle from 36 hours -- that the model was adopted across the industry and the world.
As American engineers began to work with their Japanese counterparts, they marveled at how certain ideas and approaches eluded them until they could see the Japanese do it themselves. "Toyota instructs implicitly," a business-school professor observed. "They cannot tell you in words what they are doing, not even in Japanese."
In industry after industry, it is a similar story. To describe the crucial information that can't be written down in a book or described in a patent, social scientists use the term "tacit knowledge." We can use a simpler term: know-how.
Know-how is what makes our modern, technical society work. Doing surgery, refining a dangerous chemical or manufacturing a lithium-ion battery -- they all require know-how.
Anyone can buy a machine tool on the global market, but only with know-how can you use it well and deploy it on an assembly line efficiently.
And know-how is why Ford has, at last, sought out the Chinese company. Sure, Ford's engineers can study the chemistry of these more advanced batteries, but that won't help to make them, any more than memorizing the N.F.L. rule book would make you Tom Brady. China is, for now, the world's No. 1 maker of electric vehicle batteries. Only its engineers can show Ford's engineers how to produce them in a fast, reliable way -- and at a globally competitive price. That's true in all the other green industries, too.
Mr. Manchin and Mr. Rubio may find ways to discourage this kind of partnership. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, electric vehicle batteries produced by a "foreign entity of concern" are ineligible for the $ 7,500 electric vehicle tax credit. Although the meaning of that phrase remains unclear, one possible interpretation suggests that virtually any firm subject to Chinese law might be forbidden -- meaning that even if Ford produced every part of a car in the United States, the Chinese company's involvement might still disqualify the car's buyer from receiving the $ 7,500 tax credit.
But rejecting Chinese know-how would make us, ironically, more dependent on China in any future security-related rupture -- because we will simply have to import from China what we never learned to make ourselves.
This is the kind of conundrum that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had to navigate during her recent trip to China -- and that federal officials must negotiate for years to come. If American companies can't open factories with Chinese ones in the United States, then the country's workers will miss out on jobs, its consumers won't get new technology and its engineers will fall behind the world's best. Competing with China is a good idea. Being so suspicious of it that you trip over your own feet isn't.

Why Deep-Sea Mining Is the Next Battleground in the Energy Transition: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Countries and companies are in a fight between those that want to excavate minerals used in electric vehicles and others that warn the cost is too high.
Surging demand for metals used in electric vehicle batteries has kicked off an international race to mine the deep seas. And there are no rules.
On Sunday, the International Seabed Authority missed an important deadline to establish a regulatory framework, which means that companies can now apply for licenses before rules are final. Representatives from the agency, which is made up of 167 member states and the European Union, have gathered in Jamaica for two weeks to debate what should happen next.
Canada, France, Germany and others want to pause deep-sea mining because of its largely unknown environmental consequences. But countries including China, Norway and Russia are pushing ahead on establishing a framework, arguing that it is less destructive than land mining.
Seabed exploitation ventures, meanwhile, are eager to get started.
"We're preparing our application," said Gerard Barron, the chief executive of the Metals Company, a Canadian business that has an agreement with the Pacific island country of Nauru to sponsor its deep-sea mining endeavors.
The company preferred that there were final rules before acting, Mr. Barron told DealBook, "but we reserve the right to move forward."
Regulators are under pressure to act. A United Nations convention establishes waters beyond 12 nautical miles from a territorial coast as communal property, which means that profits from minerals discovered there should be shared to some extent. The I.S.A. is responsible for setting up the structure for profit-sharing and taxing of mining efforts, as well as the legal and ecological guidelines. Or it could ban large-scale commercial mining altogether -- though it's not clear there is a legal path for a pause.
Mining could damage ecosystems that scientists don't yet understand, said Jessica Battle, an ocean policy expert at the World Wildlife Fund. A study published in the journal Nature on Tuesday, for example, argued that seabed mining could interfere with tuna migration patterns as climate change drives fish into new waters. Ms. Battle has been leading an effort to have businesses pledge not to finance seabed mining or source seafloor materials in their supply chains. More than 30 companies, including BMW, Google, Samsung, Volvo and Volkswagen, have signed on. Similarly, prominent banks in Britain, such as Lloyds and Standard Chartered, are refusing to do business with deep-sea mining entities. And seafood industry groups have demanded a moratorium.
Some also doubt the economic opportunity. Electric vehicles are expected to make up about 35 percent of cars sold globally by 2030, up from 14 percent in 2022, according to projections from the International Energy Agency. That growth will increase demand for metals like cobalt, copper and nickel that are used in batteries. But critics say that the expense and logistics of mining in the remote ocean -- and transporting metals back to land -- raise doubts about whether deep-sea mining can be profitable. Ms. Battle argued other solutions in the works -- like alternative materials and programs for reusing and recycling batteries -- could sufficiently satisfy demand for critical metals. "This industry could start without being needed," she said of deep-sea mining.
But seabed mining supporters say that existing mining is worse for the environment, and deep-sea mining could help wrestle control of critical metals from China and Russia. Some also see it as an economic lifeline for small island nations that are suffering the worst effects of climate change.
"Do not tell me to ignore the potential for promoting the green transition by not exploring these much-needed minerals for the green revolution that sit in my ocean," Mark Brown, the prime minister of the Cook Islands, said at a U.N. climate conference last year. He referred to claims of environmental concern from countries that destroyed the planet "through decades of profit-driven development" as "patronizing."
Mr. Barron of the Metals Company, who was in Jamaica for the I.S.A. meetings this week, pointed out that even some of the countries calling for a moratorium have exploration licenses, which allow them to experiment with mining on a small scale for research purposes. He believes representatives are deciding not whether deep-sea mining can begin, but when. "That horse has bolted," he said. -- Ephrat Livni
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
Lina Khan's bumpy week. The head of the F.T.C. lost a bid to block Microsoft's $ 70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, opened the first big investigation into OpenAI over ChatGPT's privacy and security practices, and was grilled by a Republican-led congressional committee over her approach at the agency. The F.T.C. lost its appeal of the Microsoft ruling.
Hollywood shut down. Actors voted to go on strike for the first time in 43 years, joining screenwriters who had already taken industrial action. Unions say they want better wages, higher fees from streaming services and protections to deal with new technological threats, such as artificial intelligence. Studio bosses say the demands are unrealistic at a time when the entire industry is being disrupted.
The details behind the PGA Tour-LIV Golf talks. A Senate hearing into a potential deal between the rival golf competitions revealed new details about the talks: the agreement was announced before it was done; the PGA Tour didn't have the resources to fight off the Saudi-backed LIV indefinitely; and governance is going to be a crucial part of any final deal.
Meeting over at Shopify. The Canadian e-commerce company embedded a calculator in employees' calendar apps that measures the financial cost of meetings with three or more people. It's the company's latest effort to stop pointless gatherings. It had previously canceled all recurring meetings of more than two people.
Tech stock dominance, by the numbers
The great tech stock rally shows no signs of slowing, with the Nasdaq composite hitting a 15-month high this week. One reason: Wall Street is betting that an improving inflation outlook, underscored by Wednesday's Consumer Price Index, will compel the Federal Reserve to pivot to a more dovish rates policy, which tends to lift tech stocks.
How big has Big Tech gotten? Bank of America researchers ran the numbers this week. Here are three takeaways:
The stock gains this year have been especially concentrated among seven firms: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta.
The combined market capitalization of the so-called magnificent seven is roughly $ 11 trillion, a figure that exceeds the G.D.P. of every country but the United States and China.
This group has seen its combined market cap grow by $ 4 trillion this year.
The companies are cash rich. Six of the seven (all but Amazon) have a combined $ 200 billion net cash-to-debt balance.
What to watch: Big institutional investors have bought in on these stocks, which could sustain the rally in the short run. And the interest-rate risk for these companies is waning. But the bigger they grow, the more attention they could get from politicians.
The "political campaign rhetoric will likely include headline risk around regulation of megacap Tech," Savita Subramanian, Bank of America's head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, writes in the report.
Paris takes on 'auto-besity'
Health authorities have waged a war on obesity for years. Now, in an effort to curtail the rise of big cars such as S.U.V.s and cut down on pollution, Paris has declared a war on "auto-besity." Its first step is to charge drivers more to park the vehicles -- a move that could eventually hit car companies.
S.U.V. use has surged more than 60 percent in Paris over the past four years, according to city officials. That mirrors a broader trend across the European Union, with S.U.V.s accounting for about half of all car sales in the bloc, up from about 14 percent in 2011, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, an auto industry group.
Critics say that is bad for the planet. "We would like the City of Paris to change the pricing of paid parking to make it progressive according to the weight and size of vehicles," Frédéric Badina-Serpette, the city councilor behind the increased charges, told The Guardian. He added that the aim was "to focus on an absurdity: auto-besity ... the inexorable growth in the weight and size of vehicles circulating in our cities."
The new rules will add to carmakers' worries. Details haven't been revealed, but electric vehicles and big families that require bigger vehicles are expected to be exempt. The higher tariffs will go into effect on Jan. 1, and could inspire similar moves in other big cities.
"France has traditionally been one of the most aggressive nations in combating the growth of large cars," Matthias Schmidt, an independent auto analyst, told DealBook. Carlos Tavares, the chief executive of Stellantis, was already pressuring the French government to do more to support the industry, which is starting to feel the effect of Tesla's price cuts and facing the growing threat of Chinese carmakers set to enter Europe. French brands, Mr. Schmidt added, are "in the middle of an uncomfortable sandwich, pressed from above and below."
On our radar: A.I. as a villain
"Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part One," the latest installment in Tom Cruise's efforts to transcend physics for the sake of entertainment, is forecast to earn $ 90 million in its first five days, a franchise record. (Mild spoilers ahead.)
But the movie also represents how the hype around artificial intelligence is seeping into pop culture: The big bad guy in the movie is the Entity, a rogue artificial intelligence program that poses a threat to humanity.
Over decades, humans' relationship with artificial intelligence has been explored by movies like "2001: A Space Odyssey," "Ex Machina" and, yes, "A.I." But the public debut of ChatGPT last year, which gave many people their first chance to converse with an A.I., has made visions of sentient technology feel less like science fiction and, for some, stirred up existential dread.
Remember how over 350 A.I. experts called in May for "mitigating the risk of extinction from A.I."? The Entity is capable of "collapsing the world's economic systems, evading national-security protocols and rerouting nuclear weapons on a whim." At least in the movies, a nearly superhuman secret agent can beat back killer technology. (We presume; this is a Cruise movie, after all.) In real life, it may take coordination by lawmakers worldwide -- and time will tell if that mission is ... well, you know.

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Maybe you've heard there's a Barbie movie coming out?
Well, this isn't about that. It is, however, about the 11½ inches of intellectual property that inspired all the madness: the doll itself.
You know the one. Often blond, always smiling, occasionally naked and neglected at the bottom of a toy chest? Chances are you do: According to Mattel, more than 100 dolls are sold every minute, and quite a few minutes have elapsed since Barbie made her debut, at a toy industry trade show, in 1959.
Just as remarkable as the ways the doll has changed since then are the ways it hasn't. Like the characters on "Sesame Street" or "South Park," Barbie exists alongside us without quite aging with us -- reflecting our times, but not our wrinkles.
That adaptive consistency may play a role in maintaining her cultural ubiquity (alongside her literal ubiquity), for while the things that make Barbie Barbie may get a face lift every few years, the DNA remains unchanged.
From her hair to her feet, her portfolio of properties to her fleet of automobiles, practically everything in Barbie's tiny plastic world bears her unmistakable signature. How? It's all about the visuals.
Turns Out, It Doesn't Grow Back
Since Barbie first hit the market, rocking a ponytail and curly micro-bangs, her hair has undergone countless changes, from her feathery bouffants and bobs of the 1960s to her "flip" styles of the '70s. Today, you can find Barbies with different updos, highlights, Afros and a range of hair textures. If a hairstyle has been in vogue, there's a good chance that Barbie has at least tried it.
Obsession with the doll's hair reached a peak in 1992, the year Mattel released Totally Hair Barbie, whose 11.5 inches of crimped hair fell down to her toes. According to Mattel, it remains the best-selling Barbie in history.
But for all the variety in Barbie's hair over the decades, nothing came close to the at-home customization children would give to their dolls. There exists a venerable tradition of cutting it with a pair of scissors, often leaving her ends frayed and uneven. Some children would apply paint or Kool-Aid to her tresses -- a de facto form of hair dye -- or dip them in hot water in an attempt to form curls. Plenty of people can say they first learned how to braid or make a ponytail using their Barbie dolls as practice.
Of course, there were many others who accepted her hair as is. But in a society with beauty standards that historically haven't been kind to those without blond, straight or thick hair, transforming Barbie's hair in their own image was one way children could really make the doll their own.

Living Life on Tiptoe
One needs only to see a perfectly pointed foot, positioned to fit neatly into a high heel, to know it belongs to Barbie. The doll's feet spawned an Instagram trend in 2018, and in the first shot of the trailer for the coming "Barbie" movie, Margot Robbie steps out of a pair of pompommed stilettoes onto the ball of her foot, her heel still suspended in air. It's a look as glamorous as it is unnatural; while promoting the film, Ms. Robbie explained that to get the shot, she had to hold on to a bar to keep her balance.
Though a Barbie from the 1970s could wear flats as well as heels, Barbies who could wear flats didn't become mainstream until 2015, when Mattel released a line of dolls with ankles that could be manipulated to fit into flat shoes. Some saw it as a sign that Barbie was modernizing, moving away from outdated standards of femininity.
Although Barbie's feet have stood for years as a sort of visual shorthand for the doll itself, Dr. Priya Parthasarathy, a podiatric surgeon, said that if Barbie were human, she would be wise to get checked out for equinus, a chronic condition that often results from tightness in the calf muscles or Achilles tendon, sometimes because of long-term stiletto use.
Even with the risks, Dr. Parthasarathy doesn't think women need to retire their high heels for good. Still, she cautioned, "we don't want too many people wearing high heels all the time, because women should also be comfortable."

Proportional Misrepresentation
Is there anything more symbolic of all that is surreal about Barbie -- the way the doll gave young women a twisted idea of the perfect body, the way she represented female reality distorted by male fantasy (she was based on a German doll meant to be enjoyed at bachelor parties) -- than her measurements? Her pneumatic bosom, teeny waist, blossoming hips and endless legs are just the most obvious distortions. The more you look into her proportions, the clearer it becomes that she is unlike anything ever made in nature -- even Margot Robbie.
Indeed, there have been various efforts to scale her up to adult size, simply to reveal the impossibility of her body shape, which originally clocked in at about 39-18-33. In a 1995 article in The International Journal of Eating Disorders, researchers calculated that to attain Barbie proportions, a healthy adult woman would have to "increase 24 inches in height, 5 inches in the chest and 3.2 inches in neck length, while decreasing 6 inches in the waist." Ten years ago, Rehabs.com issued a report that examined Barbie's effect on young girls' body image, noting that the odds of finding someone with the doll's chest-to-waist ratio were in the billions. The neck of a life-size Barbie would be too thin to support her head, and her torso would have room for only half a liver.
Barbie got a new body in 1998 -- slightly wider waist, smaller chest and hips. By 2016 Mattel had caved to pressure and offered petite, tall and curvy Barbies. But despite all the supposedly more realistic options, impossible Barbie remains the standard Barbie for many. When it comes to the psychology of our physiology, she defies not just nature, but reason and expectations.

The Original Boy Toy
Barbie's ultimate accessory is her man. Since Mattel's introduction of the Ken doll in 1961, Barbie's boyfriend has entered the public imagination as a benevolent himbo, a chisel-jawed foil to her dynamism and curves. Their relationship is sexless (neither has genitals) but supportive: In early promotional images, Barbie occupies the foreground while Ken stands behind her to carry a bag or offer her a flower.
Ken arrived two years after Barbie, a literal afterthought. The original doll was a slim blond who wore skimpy red swim trunks. He beefed up as he tried on the styles of each decade: In the 1970s, there was Sport & Shave Ken, who had bulging forearms and a 5 o'clock shadow. By the 1990s, Ken had a Harley.
His image has been lightly complicated over time. Earring Magic Ken, released in 1993, became a cult item among gay men thanks to his pierced ear. In 2017, amid flagging sales, Mattel released a suite of Kens of different races, body shapes and hairdos (one had a man bun). Ken was no longer a monolith, Caity Weaver wrote in GQ: "He can be complicated, mysterious -- maybe even vegan."
Depending on whom you ask, Ken may be the epitome of emasculation, an all-American sex symbol, a feminist fantasy or a gay icon. He is all of this while still being secondary to Barbie. "She's everything," the poster for the "Barbie" movie reads. "He's just Ken."

Not Too Shabby for a Bachelorette Pad
It has taken many architectural forms over the decades, from a three-story townhouse with groovy Verner Panton-style furniture introduced in 1974 to a pink mansion with a balcony and a turret released in 1995, but one aspect of the Barbie Dreamhouse has remained consistent: its lone occupant.
"Even when she has a huge suburban mansion, she has a single bed," said Whitney Mallett, an editor, with Felix Burrichter, of "Barbie Dreamhouse: An Architectural Survey." "Ken does not live there. It's Barbie's house, Barbie's world."
The Dreamhouse has long functioned as both a design lab -- reflecting the changing American interior at a sort of time lag (recent versions have eco-conscious additions like recycling bins) -- and a playground for female self-invention. The first version, a foldout ranch home introduced in 1962, included a bed, a sofa and a stereo console but no kitchen. It was a signal -- radical for its time -- that Barbie's life would not be centered on family or domestic labor but rather on hosting friends and pursuing a career (or, in Barbie's case, many, many careers).
Around 1990, Dreamhouses were supersized, and the elevators, spiral staircases, two-story slides and other over-the-top décor suggested affluence in Barbie's fictional life -- as did her Malibu, Calif., address. "The luxurious expansion of the Barbie Dreamhouse tracks economic expansion in the United States and conspicuous consumption," said Alexandra Cunningham Cameron, curator of contemporary design at Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.
As for the play set itself, it was made first out of cardboard and then out of molded plastic, inexpensive materials seemingly at odds with the fantasy interiors. But the contradiction makes sense, considering the mass-market nature of Barbie herself: The doll who has everything, at least materially, can be had for $ 5.97 at Walmart.
-- Steven Kurutz
A Clotheshorse With Room to Gallop
Barbie made her entrance into the world in a knit, black-and-white-striped, strapless one-piece swimsuit, but even back then she had other outfits -- 22 of them, in fact. Over the years, she acquired clothes almost as quickly as she was acquired; Mattel estimates that by this point, over one billion outfits have been made for Barbie and her clan, using over 105 million yards of fabric.
Her wardrobe has been a mirror held up to our most identifiable trends over the decades -- a sleeveless blouse and a pencil skirt in the '60s, a bandanna print halter-neck maxi dress in the '70s, an aerobics-ready purple leotard and matching leg warmers in the '80s -- and to our sense of self. Barbie always dressed the parts we allowed ourselves to imagine, from debutante to doctor. Her outfits helped keep her relevant.
Little wonder fashion loves her. Dozens of designers have done special Barbie collaborations, starting with Oscar de la Renta in 1985. There have been Bob Mackie Barbie (1990, in gold paillettes and white marabou stole), Dior Barbie (1997, complete with throwback New Look jacket and skirt), Diane von Furstenberg Barbie (2006, wearing a signature pink-and-white wrap dress and toting a wheelie bag) and Moschino Barbie (in 2015, with faux leather outfit), to name a few.
In 2009, for Barbie's 50th birthday, 50 designers created life-size Barbie-inspired looks for a special runway show at New York Fashion Week. In 2019, Barbie was given the Board of Directors' Tribute by the Council of Fashion Designers of America -- an award that had previously been bestowed on Michelle Obama and Gloria Steinem. Why? Well, Barbie may not be us, but her wardrobe is.
-- Vanessa Friedman
Tickled a Very Specific Pink
Though she is now synonymous with a pink so distinctive that she has co-opted the Pantone swatch 219 C, Barbie made her 1959 debut in monochrome. With just a pop of crimson on her lips, Barbie's black-and-white striped bathing suit provided a neutral springboard that begged to be swapped out for one of 22 other looks (sold separately) in a classic palette of mostly navy, black and red.
Still, there was a hint of the pink to come in a few pieces from Barbie's debut collection: notably, the "Nighty Negligee" dressing gown and the regrettably named "Plantation Belle" ensemble, which featured a flirty pink tea-length frock and matching straw purse. Those particular pinks were a far cry from neon, more reflective of the soigné shades immortalized in the "Think Pink" sequence from the 1957 film "Funny Face." "That candy pink totally suited the moment," said Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute.
But the moment changes. The collector and author Bradley Justice cites the late '60s as the time when the relative restraint of Barbie's wardrobe gave way to the pop influence of Mod. Fluorescent colors increasingly came into play in the '70s. Kim Culmone, Mattel's head of design for Barbie, points to the boa-draped Superstar Barbie in 1977 as the first moment the doll "went full-on pink."
The dawn of the '80s ushered in a taste for all things brighter and bolder, and with it, Barbie's signature color. In 2011, Mattel and the industry color authority Pantone teamed up on a Barbie doll swathed in 219 C, a shade already available to the public, and the association stuck. The color is a rich, turbocharged pink that telegraphs the potency and staying power of Barbie not just as a toy but as a global brand.
-- Jeremy Allen
Top Down, Wind in Her Stitched-In Hair
Barbie's taste for the finer things extends well beyond fashion. Her car collection -- sports cars, Jeeps, even a camper -- as well as the various shades of pink that it comes in, is proof.
Her first car, introduced in 1962, was an Austin-Healey 3000 Mark II. The British sports car came in a variety of colors -- most indelibly, a faded light orange with aqua seats, a silver steering wheel and dashboard, whitewall tires and silver hubcaps. It was perhaps sleeker than later Barbie rides, and her signature car -- all-American this time -- was yet to come.
In 1976, the Star 'Vette, as Barbie's Chevrolet Corvette was called, became an immediate touchstone of the doll's image and an enduring staple of her car collection. The toy sports car came in metallic shades of hot pink and purple with shooting star decals on the hood and either of its two doors. Her luggage also came attached to the top of the trunk. Barbie was on the move.
A label on the original packaging called the micro-Corvette a "dream machine for Barbie doll and her friends."
The Star 'Vette has made an appearance in every decade since. Barbie's garage would later grow to include a Ferrari 328 GTS, a Porsche 911 Cabriolet and, in 2000, a Volkswagen New Beetle.
With the top down and room for a passenger friend, Barbie's image took on another meaning, showing girls that the freedom of the road was theirs to enjoy, too.
-- Frank Rojas
A Closet's Worth of Choking Hazards
The designer Michael Kors once called accessories the exclamation point of an outfit. When it comes to Barbie, her accessories also became, for countless parents of Barbie-loving children, the exclamation point at the end of "Ouch!" -- as in "Ouch! I just stepped on a tiny stiletto!"
Household annoyances aside -- dogs eating her handbags, vacuums sucking up her cat-eye sunglasses -- a Barbie is largely defined by her accessories. Once upon a time, these accessories were fashion-forward and valuable collectibles. In the 1960s, a doll-size fur stole made of real mink was sold at Sears for $ 9.99 -- the equivalent of almost $ 100 today.
But as Barbie collected more occupations and hobbies, her accessories became more like identity totems. Today, Music Producer Barbie carries a sound mixing board and wears over-the-ear headphones. Teacher Barbie comes with a blackboard and thick-framed glasses. Fashion Designer Barbie wears statement necklaces and a sewing tape measure around her neck. Where would Surfer Skipper or Surfer Ken be without their accompanying surfboards? At the bottom of the toy box, waiting to be given -- via accessory -- a purpose.
-- Jessica Testa
Dressed for Success, in Every Field Imaginable
Barbie is the ultimate career woman. Who else among us has been a fighter pilot, UNICEF ambassador, marine biologist, cupcake chef, computer engineer and aerobics instructor?
Inevitably, for someone with a résumé boasting more than 250 different occupations over six decades and diamond-hard ambition barely concealed by her fluffy exterior, Barbie's extensive toolbox has grown in line with the advances of modern women in the workplace. In the 1960s, fans could buy Barbie as a ballerina with ribboned shoes; a student teacher with notebooks and glasses; or a registered nurse with medicine, a hot water bottle and a diploma (though as the space race took off, an astronaut Barbie came with a white helmet, a silver suit and snazzy zip-up moon boots). Later on, Barbie also became a veterinarian, complete with a white jacket, plastic cats and dogs, and a stethoscope; an Olympic swimmer with goggles and medals; and an entrepreneur, armed with an iPhone and a tablet displaying a rather promising-looking bar chart.
In recent years, Barbie, who has never had children, has focused on building a career in STEM (the acronym used for science, technology, engineering and mathematics -- all fields in which women are underrepresented). Now, Barbie comes as a science researcher, a robotics engineer and a software developer, with free coding classes for those who buy those dolls.

'Undress Me Everywhere'
To play with Barbie is to take her clothes off. It's all right there in the Aqua song: "You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere." And you can undress her everywhere: Her pelvis is smooth plastic, devoid of anything remotely clinical or anatomically correct. After all, despite what Greta Gerwig's film would have you believe, she is not a human woman.
Still, that distinction hasn't stopped Barbie's nether region from stirring up some controversy. In the mid-1990s, Mattel released Teacher Barbie, an educator doll that sported a skater dress covered in numbers and apples and that came with her own blackboard. Teacher Barbie, like many a Barbie doll, was issued without any underwear. (If you want to get technical, her pelvic area was lightly textured to represent underwear, according to a report from The Journal Times of Racine, Wis.) Moral outrage ensued, and the doll was ultimately reissued with cloth underwear. "They keep forgetting it's a child's toy, and when we put our adult eyes on it, we see things kids don't think of," a spokeswoman for Mattel told the newspaper.
Strangely, there was no such hand-wringing over whether Elizabethan Queen Barbie, issued the same year as Teacher Barbie, needed a set of panties.

Germany Warns of Dependence on China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A long-awaited strategy statement from Berlin is an attempt to set a coherent approach for dealing with China, Germany's largest trading partner, in policy and business.
The German government approved its first national strategy on China on Thursday, defining the Asian superpower as "a partner, competitor and systemic rival" and calling for a significant reduction of dependency on Chinese goods while still maintaining economic ties worth hundreds of billions of dollars.
The new policy calls for export controls and the screening of investments by German companies doing business in China to protect the flow of sensitive technology and know-how. But it fails to address exactly how Berlin plans to review Chinese investments in Germany, a point that has been a recent cause for concern.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government adopted the 61-page document on Thursday, after months of discussions and delays stemming from disagreements within his three-party coalition over how tough their position should be. The strategy echoes themes from the European Union that urge "de-risking" ties with China.
The government said reducing reliance on Chinese producers and consumers would ultimately strengthen the German economy.
"We do not want to decouple from China, but minimize our risks. This includes strengthening our European economy as well as reducing dependencies," said Annalena Baerbock, the foreign minister. "The more diverse trade and supply chains are set up, the more resilient our country is," she added.
The strategy takes a tougher line toward China than the one embraced by governments led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, who viewed China as a huge growth market for German goods.
That push created a tight relationship with China, with more than a million German jobs that depend directly on China, and many more indirectly. Nearly half of all European investments in China are from Germany, and almost half of German manufacturing businesses rely on China for some part of their supply chain.
But supply chain issues prompted by the coronavirus pandemic laid bare the extent to which Germany, and Europe, had grown dependent on China for goods, ranging from medicines to processed minerals essential for green technology. Russian's invasion of Ukraine last year also raised fears that Beijing could take advantage of economic dependencies in ways similar to how Moscow weaponized Germany's dependence on its natural gas exports.
Under the strategy, companies are called on to "more strongly internalize" the geopolitical risks of doing business in China, to prevent the need to tap state funds in the event of a crisis. The government said it was working to provide incentives to encourage German companies to diversify their businesses beyond China.
The policy also called for reassessing export guarantees, to ensure the protection of sensitive technology, and it stressed Germany's intent to draw up a list of technology used in fields including cybersecurity and surveillance that would be subject to export controls.
"We have understood that it is in our own national interest to take care of our economic security," Ms. Baerbock said. She added that Germany could not afford to find itself needing to "pay more than 200 billion euros to get out of a dependency," as happened when Russia cut off gas flows to Western Europe.
The Chinese government, through its embassy in Berlin, on Thursday pushed back against how it had been described in the policy, insisting that it was a partner with Germany, not a rival.
The embassy said in a statement that it "firmly opposes" efforts to "interfere in China's internal affairs, distort and smear China, and even damage China's core interests."
Whether and how companies will support the policy remains a question. Some midsize and family-led businesses have said geopolitical risks have complicated their business in China, but leading industrial players, such as BASF and Volkswagen, have doubled down on Chinese investments in China.
"Volkswagen Group will continue to invest in China," said Ralf Brandstätter, Volkswagen's head of China and a member of the board.
"China is a dynamic growth market and a key technological innovation driver," he said, adding that it is "ultimately crucial for the global competitiveness of Volkswagen and the entire German automotive industry."
The strategy will now move to Parliament, where lawmakers are expected to begin debating it when they reconvene in September.
Last month, Germany unveiled its first national security strategy, calling for a "robust" defense and other policies. But the government had separated China from the overall strategy, given its importance as Germany's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade volumes last year reaching nearly €300 billion, or about $ 334 billion.
The strategy makes clear that Berlin opposes military action by Beijing to assert its claim of sovereignty over the Taiwan, a self-ruled island democracy. "The status quo of the Taiwan Strait may only be changed by peaceful means and mutual consent. Military escalation would also affect German and European interests."
Coming more than a year after Mr. Scholz decided to take a more critical stance toward Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, the China strategy is the latest step in recalibrating Germany's foreign policy, said Mikko Huotari, executive director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies.
"Looking at China from a risk-oriented perspective is a huge step in a different direction," Mr. Huotari said. "It is a major shift for Germany."

Full text: It's not easy to do your job when everyone around you is having a good time.
I hugged my father goodbye in Dublin and boarded a plane for New York. My best friend from college was with me. We had student work visas and a vague plan to make enough money to spend the summer in California. We had visions of swimming in the Pacific and walking across the Golden Gate Bridge.
After a visit with my cousin in Manhattan, we flew out to San Francisco. It was gray and cold. The hostel on Market Street was more than a little depressing, so we ended up staying with two girls from Ireland in a tiny room on the top floor of a house in Berkeley.
The four of us slept on the carpet and shared a bathroom with a bunch of students. After several sleepless nights, I found a thin foam mattress in a thrift shop and carried it upstairs.
We fell in love with vibrant Berkeley and spent as much time as we could in its music stores, bookstores and cafes. It was 1998, but the earthy scent of Nag Champa lingered in the air, just as it must have in the hippie days.
For a few weeks I commuted on a BART train to a monotonous telemarketing job in San Francisco. Then came a brief stint at a sleazy burger joint off Union Square. In Berkeley I worked at Blondie's Pizza, which I enjoyed, but none of the jobs paid much, so I kept looking.
One Wednesday afternoon I spotted a flyer pinned to the window of a yellow building four blocks from Mission Street: A company called Peachy's Puffs was hiring young women to sell cigarettes, sweets and other novelties at events and clubs in the area.
Curiosity and the need for cash propelled me through the door and into a dingy office. Lining the walls were glamour shots of women resembling movie stars from decades earlier. The job interview was quick and to the point. A dark-haired man seated behind a cluttered desk ordered me to twirl around.
"You've got a pretty cute body!" he said, looking me up and down.
As I filled out some paperwork, he told me to come back on Friday in a nice dress, so that I could go to the Furthur Festival. I had no idea what this festival was, but I was game. He also instructed me to buy new shoes and a flashlight. Then he scribbled an address on a scrap of paper and told me to get a vendor's permit down the street.
When I mentioned the Furthur Festival to my friends, they were thrilled on my behalf. It was almost impossible to get tickets for the event, they said, not to mention expensive, and the Other Ones, a band composed mainly of surviving members of the Grateful Dead, would be headlining.
My pals were so excited that they planned to catch a ride to Mountain View, where the festival was held, and camp outside the gates of the Shoreline Amphitheater, where they would be able to hear the music for free.
On Friday I was back in the dingy office in San Francisco dressed in a pink vintage frock, a knee-length shift dress that cost $ 15 in Haight-Ashbury. I complemented it with my worn-in combat boots, since I couldn't bring myself to spring for new shoes.
My appearance failed to impress the man who hired me. He looked me over with a neutral expression, handed me a heavy tray stacked with candy and grudgingly ordered me onto the minivan idling outside.
Nervously, I climbed aboard. Three young women seated in the back wore colorful makeup to go with their bright, low-cut belly tops, short pleated skirts and platform sandals. They sat upright, trays on their knees, and eyed my chunky old boots with disdain. Just before the driver slammed the door, a woman in a red flapper dress joined us.
On the long drive to Mountain View, I wondered at the exorbitant candy prices. Who would pay $ 5 for a packet of M&M's? And I was somehow supposed to sell everything in my tray, or I wouldn't make any money.
The traffic grew thick near the festival grounds, and I began to get a sense of what was going on. This was a movement of sorts, and the movement involved thousands of people of all ages, many of them modern-day hippies in flowing skirts, summer dresses, tie-dye shirts and sandals. There were even a few colorfully painted Volkswagen buses along the road. Everybody glowed.
On a grassy hilltop inside the gates, I set down my overflowing tray. Music blasted from large speakers. I sat next to Nubia, one of my new co-workers, and for a while we watched the people dancing in the California sunshine, their bodies loose and happy.
I thought of how reserved the Irish are on the dance floor, unless they've been drinking. Here, the crowd was alive, energetic and buzzed. White-bearded men twirled with barefoot children. Dreadlocks bounced on bare shoulders.
By the time Rusted Root came onstage, Nubia and I could stand it no longer. We jumped up and started dancing with abandon. The air smelled of patchouli. After a while, she lifted her tray and went back to work, but I couldn't stop. I had barely sold any candy, but I didn't care.
As Hot Tuna played, a few people approached me. Smiling, they plucked packets of candy from the assortment and asked how much they cost. They shook their heads at the price and many walked away.
"Overpriced," I said to the next customer.
"A rip-off," I said to another.
And then I started giving the candy away.
My offerings were met with warm embraces. A few people even told me they loved me. They called out to friends, waving them over.
Darkness fell as the Other Ones took the stage. Their soothing jams sounded like prayers as I danced in the evening chill. My candy was all but gone, but my circle of friends had increased.
Grateful for the M&M's I had given her, and observing how cold I was, a young woman removed a green woolen blanket from her shoulders and draped it across mine. She told me her name was Rose and said the blanket had been knit by her Irish grandmother. She insisted I keep it, even as I objected. We took photos together, our smiles wide, our bodies close.
I made no money that day. In fact, I owed the Peachy's Puffs company $ 40, which I paid on the spot. It was worth every penny.

German Businesses That Bet on China Seek Out a Plan B: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Geopolitical risks have exposed long-ignored strains on Germany's socioeconomic model. The family businesses underpinning its economy are seeking a new path.
Amid the ruins of a city ravaged by World War II, Karl Haeusgen's grandfather invented a hydraulic pump he was so proud of that he founded a company to sell it. Back then, there were no revenue projections or five-year growth strategies. The plan was survival: "It was just about grabbing chances," Mr. Haeusgen said.
Seven decades and three generations later the family business, Hawe Hydraulics, ships some 2,500 parts around the globe. Instead of scrambling for sales, though, Mr. Haeusgen must parse the geopolitics of an ever more polarized world.
"A third of my business, if not more, depends on how Biden and Xi get along," he said. "I sometimes wish I ran a restaurant and didn't have to care about global politics."
With China and North America as Hawe's biggest trade partners, Mr. Haeusgen doesn't have that luxury. As tensions between Beijing and the West rise, Hawe officials are working to hedge the company's dependence on the huge Chinese market.
Long a linchpin of Chinese trade in Europe, Germany is increasingly caught in the diplomatic tussle between the world's two largest economies -- wooed by China but urged by Washington to move further away from Beijing, even as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen arrives in China on Thursday for talks seeking common economic ground.
How Hawe and other midsize German companies navigate these new global forces will be critical to the country's future prosperity. Though Germany's 20th century success as the economic powerhouse of Europe is often seen through its biggest brands -- like Volkswagen, Mercedes and Siemens -- it is small and medium enterprises that are the backbone of its economy.
These companies, known in German as the "Mittelstand," are struggling to create a model for the future, as the country's socioeconomic order begins to falter under the weight of stalled modernization and ruptures in global politics.
Some executives like Mr. Haeusgen are embracing transformation, testing new strategies and markets. Other businesses, however, are wary of abandoning a model that for decades enabled Germany to thrive but defied change.
The tensions are felt even on Hawe's factory floor.
"I just can't see it. What's the alternative to China?" said Holger Rebbe, a floor manager.
Hawe's handling of international affairs is not just a concern for its 2,700 employees. The economies of some German towns depend on it.
In Kaufbeuren, a brightly painted Bavarian town nestled below the Alps, Hawe is a top employer. In the tiny village of Sachsenkam, 60 miles to the west, Hawe provides 250 jobs -- the next largest employer is the local brewery, with a staff of 17.
"It's like we were successful for too long," said Stefan Bosse, the mayor of Kaufbeuren, who is keen to attract other businesses to diversify the employers his town relies on. "Now, gradually, we see: 'Uh oh -- this is not a given. This can also be endangered."'
The archetypal Mittelstand company is based in a rural German town, making a piece of equipment few have heard of, but that is crucial for goods worldwide -- like a screw needed for every airplane or passenger car.
These companies provide the majority of Germany's economic output, according to some studies. They employ 60 percent of its workers, and make up 99 percent of its private sector -- a higher percentage than in any industrialized nation in the world.
"The German business model, particularly Mittelstand, is being extremely good at doing one thing: Slowly but steadily perfecting one product," said Mathias Bianchi, spokesman for the German Mittelstand Association. "Because that worked so well for years, they had no need to adapt to changes. But now, they need to adjust to the new economic reality."
Even as the tech revolution and climate change added strain in recent decades, Germany's model plodded profitably along.
But the pillars it relied on to do that -- cheap Russian natural gas and the Chinese market -- are collapsing.
Moscow's invasion of Ukraine forced Germany to wean itself off the gas that provided its industry with cheap power. China's drive toward self-reliance means a market that once seemed an unending source of growth is not only less assured, but a rival.
Staking out a socioeconomic transformation for the country, pledged by Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition government, has become a source of national anxiety.
Like its population, Germany's business owners and entrepreneurs are aging -- the average Mittelstand association member is 55.
Some are resistant to adapting to new technologies and cling to a loyalty-based system that created lifetime employees -- and customers. (Hawe's very first client in 1949, a forklift producer, still buys from it today.)
The government, too, has a poor record in shedding outdated practices -- like its labyrinth, paperwork-based bureaucracy. In 2017, it vowed by 2022 to digitalize its 575 most used services, like company registrations. A year past that deadline, said Mr. Bianchi, only 22 percent of those services are online.
Such failures makes businesses wary of transformation plans the government says will be costly now, but will make Germany a diversified, digitized and climate neutral economy.
"Our companies don't see it at the moment," Mr. Bianchi said.
A survey of Mittelstand companies released Tuesday by the analytics firm Kantar showed a sobering statistic: Over half the companies polled did not want to expand in Germany, and a quarter were considering relocating.
Even among companies like Hawe, the pace of geopolitical shifts has been eye-opening.
The day after Vladimir V. Putin's forces invaded Ukraine, Hawe decided to halt operations in Russia. It was an easy decision. Russia was not a major market.
Still, Mr. Haeusgen said, the move felt like a shock: "This was something that had never happened before -- that, as the consequence of a political event, we closed down an operation."
On the Hawe factory floor, the anxieties it sparked still linger.
Marita Riesner, inspecting parts, said her heating costs spiked to 740 euros ( $ 803) a month from 120 euros ( $ 130). She and her neighbors are growing vegetable gardens to ease the pain of inflation as the country dips into recession.
"I was a very positive thinker before," she said. "But these days, I'm sweating it. It seems a lot is going wrong."
Should geopolitical events disrupt business with China, Mr. Haeusgen said, the consequences could eliminate more than half of Hawe's jobs in Kaufbeuren. Currently, he said, 20 percent of Hawe's business comes from China.
Some business groups raised alarm in recent years over Germany's vast exposure to China -- before the risks were taken seriously by former chancellor Angela Merkel's government, which had heavily encouraged German-Chinese trade.
Today, some policymakers privately worry that an event like a Chinese attack on Taiwan would be an inescapable disaster for Germany's economy. The government is now pushing "de-risking" by finding alternatives to trade with China.
Berlin plans to release a new strategy paper this month to outline how it will go forward with its relationship with China. It is expected to take into account pressure from Washington, Germany's security guarantor, to move away from China.
But major brands like Volkswagen and BASF insist that China, as the world's second-largest economy, is too important a market to give up. Such German-based multinationals are responsible for a 20 percent rise in foreign direct investment in China this year.
German officials say their strategy will maintain ties to China, but will counterbalance that by strengthening relationships with other nations, like India or Vietnam.
The Mittelstand is doing the same: Hawe is investing heavily in India, where it plans to build a new plant, and other companies are looking to North America.
In Kaufbeuren, Hawe's department head, Markus Schuster, says diversification brings new challenges.
"It used to be that we made a majority of sales with three customers from China," he said. "Now we have many, many smaller customers scattered all over the globe."
Instead of making a few parts at a huge scale, as cheaply as possible, Hawe must make a wide variety of parts for an array of customers, as quickly as possible.
That means finding cost cuts, while developing automatization systems to allow flexible production, he said. He pointed to a team of robots engaged in an intricate dance, drilling and polishing metal parts.
Mr. Haeusgen believes that trade with China will remain a cornerstone of Germany's economy. And he will keep traveling to China with other Mittelstand leaders for talks to resolve business differences and repair ties.
The new socioeconomic model for Germany may be less about erecting pillars than managing an ever more intricate, international juggling act.
"Being able to live with and manage uncertainty and to handle complexity becomes, in my opinion, a core strength," Mr. Haeusgen said. "The way my grandpa did it won't work today."

That means finding cost cuts while developing automatization systems to allow flexible production, he said. He pointed to a team of robots engaged in an intricate dance, drilling and polishing metal parts.
Haeusgen believes that trade with China will remain a cornerstone of Germany’s economy. And he will keep traveling to China with other Mittelstand leaders for talks to resolve business differences and repair ties.
The new socioeconomic model for Germany may be less about erecting pillars than managing an ever more intricate, international juggling act.
“Being able to live with and manage uncertainty and to handle complexity becomes, in my opinion, a core strength,” Haeusgen said. “The way my grandpa did it won’t work today.”

Full text: Eager to avoid falling further behind Tesla and Chinese car companies, many Western auto executives are bypassing traditional suppliers and committing billions of dollars on deals with lithium mining companies.
They are showing up in hard hats and steel-toed boots to scope out mines in places like Chile, Argentina, Quebec and Nevada to secure supplies of a metal that could make or break their companies as they move from gasoline to battery power.
Without lithium, U.S. and European carmakers won't be able to build batteries for the electric pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and sedans they need to remain competitive. And assembly lines they are ramping up in places like Michigan, Tennessee and Saxony, Germany, will grind to a halt.
Established mining companies don't have enough lithium to supply the industry as electric vehicle sales soar. General Motors plans for all its car sales to be electric by 2035. In the first quarter of 2023, sales of battery-powered cars, pickups and sport utility vehicles in the United States rose 45 percent from a year earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book.
So car companies are scrambling to lock up exclusive access to smaller mines before others swoop in. But the strategy exposes them to the risky, boom-and-bust business of mining, sometimes in politically unstable countries with weak environmental protections. If they bet incorrectly, automakers could end up paying far more for lithium than it might sell for in a few years.
Auto executives said they had no choice because there weren't sufficient reliable supplies of lithium and other battery materials, like nickel and cobalt, for the millions of electric vehicles the world needs.
In the past, automakers let battery suppliers buy lithium and other raw material on their own. But lithium shortages have forced carmakers, which have deeper pockets, to directly acquire the essential metal and have it sent to battery factories, some owned by suppliers and others owned partly or fully by the automakers. Batteries rely on lightweight lithium ions to conduct energy.
"We quickly realized there wasn't an established value chain that would support our ambitions for the next 10 years," said Sham Kunjur, who oversees General Motors' program to secure battery materials.
The automaker last year struck a supply deal with Livent, a lithium company in Philadelphia, for material from South American mines. And in January, G.M. agreed to invest $ 650 million in Lithium Americas, a company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, to develop the Thacker Pass mine in Nevada. The company beat out 50 bidders, including battery and component makers, for that stake, said Mr. Kunjur and Lithium Americas executives.
Ford Motor has made lithium deals with SQM, a Chilean supplier; Albemarle, based in Charlotte, N.C.; and Nemaska Lithium of Quebec.
"These are some of the largest lithium producers in the world with the best quality," Lisa Drake, vice president for electric vehicle industrialization at Ford, told investors in May.
The deals that automakers are striking with mining companies and raw material processors hark back to the beginnings of the industry, when Ford set up rubber plantations in Brazil to secure material for tires.
"It almost seems like 100 years later, with this new revolution, we are back to that stage," Mr. Kunjur said.
Establishing a supply chain for lithium will be expensive: $ 51 billion, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a consulting firm. To benefit from U.S. subsidies, battery raw materials must be mined and processed in North America or by trade allies.
But intense competition for the metal has helped inflate lithium prices to unsustainable levels, some executives said.
"Since the start of '22 the price of lithium has gone up so quickly and there was so much hype in the system, there were a lot of really bad deals that one could do," said R.J. Scaringe, chief executive of Rivian, an electric vehicle company in Irvine, Calif.
Dozens of companies are developing mines, and there may eventually be more than enough lithium to meet everybody's needs. Global production could surge sooner than expected, leading to a collapse in the price of lithium, something that has happened in the recent past. That would leave automakers paying a lot more for the metal than it was worth.
Auto executives are taking no chances, fearing that if they go even a few years without sufficient lithium their companies will never catch up.
Their fears have merit. In places where electric vehicle sales have grown the fastest, established automakers have lost a lot of ground. In China, where almost one-third of new cars are electric, Volkswagen, G.M. and Ford have lost market share to domestic producers like BYD, which manufacturers its own batteries. And Tesla, which has built a supply chain for lithium and other raw materials over years, has steadily gained market share in China, Europe and the United States. It is now the second-largest seller of all new cars in California after Toyota.
Chinese companies often have an edge over U.S. and European car companies because they are state owned or state supported, and, as a result, can take more risks in mining, which often encounters local opposition, nationalization by populist governments or technical difficulties.
In June, the Chinese battery maker CATL completed an agreement with Bolivia to invest $ 1.4 billion in two lithium projects. Few Western companies have shown sustained interest in the country, known for its political instability.
With a few exceptions, Western carmakers have avoided buying stakes in lithium mines. Instead, they are negotiating agreements in which they promise to buy a certain amount of lithium within a price range.
Often the deals give carmakers preferential access, crowding out rivals. Tesla has a deal with Piedmont Lithium, which is near Charlotte, that ensures the carmaker a large portion of the output from a mine in Quebec.
Lithium is abundant but not always easy to extract.
Many countries with big reserves, like Bolivia, Chile and Argentina, have nationalized natural resources or have stringent currency exchange controls that can limit the ability of foreign investors to withdraw money from the country. Even in Canada and the United States, it can take years to establish mines.
"Lithium is going to be tough to get and to fully electrify here in the U.S.," said Eric Norris, president of the Lithium global business unit at Albemarle, the leading American lithium miner.
As a result, auto executives and consultants are fanning out to mines around the world, most of which have not begun producing.
"There's a bit of desperation,," said Amanda Hall, chief executive of Summit Nanotech, a Canadian start-up working on technology to hasten extraction of lithium from saline groundwater. Auto executives, she said, are "trying to get ahead of the problem."
Yet, in their hurry, car companies are making deals with small mines that may not live up to expectations. "There are a lot of examples of problems that come up," said Shay Natarajan, a partner at Mobility Impact Partners, a private equity fund focused on investing in sustainable transportation. Lithium prices could eventually collapse from overproduction, she said.
The miners appear to be the big winners. Their deals with the car companies typically assure them fat profits and make it easier for them to borrow money or sell shares.
Rio Tinto, one of the world's largest mining companies, recently reached a preliminary agreement to supply lithium to Ford from a mine it was developing in Argentina.
Ford was one of several car companies that expressed interest, said Marnie Finlayson, managing director of Rio Tinto's battery minerals business. Rio Tinto takes car company representatives through a checklist, she said, that covers mining methods, relations with local communities and environmental impact "to get everyone comfortable."
"Because if we can't do that, then the supply is not going to be unlocked, and we're not going to solve this global challenge together," Ms. Finlayson said, referring to climate change.
Until a few years ago, the price of lithium was so low mining it was hardly profitable. But now with the growing popularity of electric vehicles, there are dozens of proposed mines. Most are in early development stages and will take years to begin production.
Until 2021, "there was either no capital or very short-term capital," said Ana Cabral-Gardner, co-chief executive of Sigma Lithium, a Vancouver-based company that is producing lithium in Brazil. "No one was looking at a five-year horizon and a 10-year horizon."
Auto companies are playing an important role in helping mines get up and running, said Dirk Harbecke, chief executive of Rock Tech Lithium, which is developing a mine in Ontario and a processing plant in eastern Germany that will supply Mercedes-Benz.
"I do not think that this is a risky strategy," Mr. Harbecke said. "I think it's a necessary strategy."

Tesla Sales Are Up 10% As Perks Fuel Demand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Incentives and price cuts made Tesla electric cars cheaper than comparable gasoline models. But the company faces growing competition in China, a key market.
Tesla sales rose a better-than-expected 10 percent in the second quarter as the company led by Elon Musk benefited from government incentives and price cuts that made its electric cars less expensive than comparable gasoline models.
Tesla delivered 466,000 vehicles from April through June, up from 423,000 vehicles in the previous quarter, the company said on Sunday. Compared with a year earlier, sales in the second quarter rose 83 percent as the company expanded production at new factories in Austin, Texas, and near Berlin.
The sales figures exceeded estimates by Wall Street analysts and showed that Tesla was able to overcome the effect of higher interest rates, which raise monthly payments for people who buy cars on credit.
Tesla was the first of the automakers to report its sales numbers. Sales of most major car brands probably rose sharply in the last quarter, analysts say. Supply chain issues have improved, making it easier for carmakers to get the components they need and for buyers to find the cars they want. Analysts at Cox Automotive forecast that U.S. new vehicle sales will rise more than 8 percent this year from 2022.
Rules that took effect this year allowed buyers of Tesla vehicles to qualify for $ 7,500 in federal tax credits. With the credit, the least expensive Model 3 sedan sells for less than $ 33,000, cheaper than similar luxury sedans sold by Mercedes-Benz and BMW that run on gasoline and in line with mass market cars like the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.
Owners of electric cars also benefit from fuel savings and lower maintenance costs. Electric vehicles don't require oil changes, and electricity is generally cheaper per mile than gasoline.
Tesla is the dominant maker of electric cars in the United States, with a market share of 62 percent in the first quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. But its share has slipped from more than 70 percent at the beginning of 2022 as established automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen have begun offering more electric models.
In China, a bigger car market than the United States or Europe, Tesla faces intense competition from local manufacturers that have newer model lineups, like BYD. On average, electric vehicles by Chinese manufacturers have been in showrooms a bit more than a year, according to AlixPartners, a consulting firm. Tesla's most popular car, the Model Y sport utility vehicle, went on sale in 2020.
Chinese manufacturers also offer interior and exterior styling and entertainment and information systems that better cater to local tastes, AlixPartners noted, citing consumer surveys.
While Tesla sales have continued to climb, the company's profitability has suffered because it has had to cut prices to prop up demand. Tesla made $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter, down from $ 3.7 billion in the last three months of 2022.
Many investors are betting that Tesla's growth will accelerate as demand for electric vehicles grows, and the company begins selling the Cybertruck, an electric pickup truck, later this year. Tesla's agreement to let other carmakers, including Ford and G.M., use its charging network could also become a new source of revenue.
Tesla's share price has more than doubled this year although it remains well below its peak in 2021, when the company was worth more than $ 1 trillion.
The carmaker said on Sunday that it would publish its financial results for this year's second quarter on July 19.

Full text: For decades, waves of immigrants and artists have caught glimpses of sea and skyline from the hills of Union City -- a New Jersey town just across the Hudson River from New York City.
The spectacular views remained relatively off the luxury real estate radar, keeping prices reasonable enough to allow two winding roads along the edge of a cliff -- aptly named Mountain Road and Manhattan Avenue -- to become a sanctuary for sculptors and painters.
The Beaux-Arts sculptor, Raffaele Menconi, who designed the flagpole bases at the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, co-owned a 13-room mansion on Mountain Road, starting in 1912. Charles X. Harris, a painter of Americana, and Olive Kooken, a sculptor known for her lamps and toy soldiers, lived in a house just up the road at different times in the early 20th century.
Even into the 1980s, the cliff-side community atop the Palisades remained a home to creatives: The photographer Bonnie Berger, who owned a three-family brick house, ran a collectibles shop down the hill in Hoboken and served as a landlord to a photographer while a jewelry designer lived next door, recalled her daughter Jennie Berger.
"It was an amazing place to grow up," Ms. Berger, 45, said from her home in Chicago recently. The mother and daughter lived on the first floor and collected rent from the two upstairs tenants. "We had a great backyard. My mom had vegetable gardens. We had hammocks, and a turtle was living there. It was a little oasis. We could see the fireworks every year. It was pretty unique."
But in 2005, Bonnie Berger, who had bought the house for $ 130,000, got an offer she couldn't refuse: A group of investors paid her $ 1.7 million for the property, and three years later, another group of investors paid $ 2.8 million to take it off their hands.
One by one, investors began taking over Mountain Road and Manhattan Avenue. Between 2005 to 2009, investors bought 12 contiguous properties on the cliff -- many with century-old buildings displaying unique architectural features -- for between $ 360,000 and $ 6.5 million. There were initial plans by a developer, Sky Pointe LLC, to build 450 to 500 residential units in five towers.
And then, nothing happened.
For reasons neighbors are only partly aware of, neither development nor demolition has occurred on the properties since they were bought. Instead, they've suffered from fires, intruders, graffiti, broken fencing, and overgrowth that make it difficult for an onlooker to believe they were occupied and full of light 18 years ago. In a hot real estate market (where other developments have risen on the hills to take advantage of the views), such a promising neighborhood has been left to crumble.
On a recent afternoon, shafts of sunlight squeezed through thick trees to brighten boarded windows and ivy covering the structures. Across the road, the thump of someone's drums emerged from a street-level window.
David Spatz, the city planner for Union City, said he has not heard from Sky Pointe in "probably six to seven years."
"I think the city would like housing developed on that property, but in a way that is sensitive to the existing neighborhood and the cliffs itself," Mr. Spatz said, "developing something that wouldn't block views to the people live to the west of the property, but also be sensitive to the Palisades."
He said the investors -- who have been embroiled in a series of legal battles since 2015 -- still have not submitted formal plans for a development project to the city.
In September 2015, Union City's board of commissioners designated the 12 properties and one vacant city-owned lot as a "noncondemnation area in need of redevelopment." That designation gave Sky Pointe some protection from local residents opposed to any changes. Several neighbors publicly accused the developer of purposely ignoring the properties in order to attain the special privileges. They also argued that the properties could still be fixed up without a special designation. Still, other residents just want the houses torn down.
Kate Sparrow, who has lived in a stately, century-old Mountain Road home since 1999, started a petition to raze the houses in 2015, writing, "These buildings are a fire hazard, an eyesore, reduce our property values, and give Union City a disgusting presentation."
She got only 33 signatures. "There was nothing wrong with the houses," Ms. Sparrow said recently from her living room overlooking the cliffs, thumbing through a folder of paperwork from hearings she attended in the mid-2010s. "They didn't have to let them rot. But now that they did, why aren't they tearing them down? There have been fires, vagrants, critters."
In yet another camp is a retired social studies teacher, Joe Sivo, 94, who owns two Manhattan Avenue homes he bought after moving to Union City in 1958. He said he was among the few neighbors who supported the investors' quest to develop the cliffs.
"They were going to give us a park," said Mr. Sivo on a recent day, as he and wife Caroline, 87, prepared to drive down the hill to the Hoboken ShopRite.
The residents thought there was new movement in the summer of 2019, when lawyers for Sky Pointe advertised a community meeting to discuss a new plan for two towers, totaling 99 units, with an 8,500-square-foot park between them.
The meeting was canceled.
Ms. Sparrow and other residents said so much time has passed that they fear developers will build an out-of-scale project to recoup their money. "I'm not against development," Ms. Sparrow said. "Only when it's too big and too much. When they overpay, they want everyone else to make good on their investment."
But even if the houses are eventually razed and a development is finally approved, a project could run into obstacles. Other new condo developments planned on the cliffs face the challenges of the topography and more. "Before we can build any of these four buildings vertically, we must first blow the mountainside asunder. We continue to dynamite the rocks away," reads a 2021 construction report for a planned 55-unit luxury condo development at 1300 Manhattan Ave., called Hoboken Heights. The project was just 400 feet south of Sky Pointe's lots, but the year after that report, the property owners filed for bankruptcy, leaving yet another chunk of the mountainside with an uncertain future.
Whatever the outcome, the stately houses tucked into the cliff-side will never be what they once were. Ms. Berger, who sat in her backyard as a child and watched the fireworks shoot into the sky from the Hudson River, cried, thinking about her home and community of artists that have disappeared.
She remembered how her imaginative mother, who drove a powder blue Volkswagen Bug, painted the word "increase" in giant script next to a peace symbol on the wood fence outside their house in different colors.
Today, a metal fence separates her former home and the other dilapidated houses from the street, bearing a phone number for a property management company. The views of the New York skyline from the hills of Union City, N.J., such as this one, had remained off the luxury real estate radar until the mid-2000s, when investors started purchasing properties that they have yet to develop.; The houses along Manhattan Avenue and Mountain Road in Union City once formed a sanctuary for sculptors and painters, until investors started buying homes in 2005. But those properties remain in limbo, and their structures are still standing. "They didn't have to let them rot," said Kate Sparrow, who has lived on Mountain Road since 1999. "But now that they did, why aren't they tearing them down? There have been fires, vagrants, critters."

Full text: The News
Volkswagen is replacing the chief executive at its luxury brand Audi, naming Gernot Döllner to take over from Markus Duesmann, as the company seeks to accelerate its transition to electric vehicles.
Mr. Döllner, who has served as Volkswagen's leading strategist, will start his new role on Sept. 1, Audi said in a statement on Thursday. Audi, although profitable, is struggling to convert to battery power and compete with the growing threat from Chinese carmakers.
Herbert Diess, Volkswagen's chief executive before Oliver Blume took over in September, brought Mr. Duesmann to Audi from BMW three years ago, with the hope that he could help the brand innovate and strengthen sales of its electric models.
The company's earnings grew 40 percent to 7.6 billion euros, or $ 8.3 billion, in 2022, thanks to a decision to prioritize its higher-end vehicles over more affordable cars as it worked through a chips shortage caused by the supply chain disruptions linked to the coronavirus pandemic.
Audi is now working on its final generation of combustion engine models and plans to bring 10 new electric models to its lineup, ahead of plans to produce only E.V.s beginning in 2026.
What It Means: Audi faces competition for electric vehicles.
Audi is Volkswagen's second-most-important luxury line, after Porsche. Although Porsche has successfully broken into the market for electric vehicles, Audi's strength has been the continued popularity of its combustion engine vehicles.
Now, the company faces stiff competition from the leading producers of electric vehicles, such as Tesla and Chinese automakers. Mr. Blume has said he expects the company to maintain 14 percent growth and wants to see Audi better coordinate its production with both VW and Porsche.
That will be easier with Mr. Döllner as the company's head, as he worked many years alongside Mr. Blume when both were top-level managers at Porsche, which like Audi is owned by the Volkswagen Group.
Mr. Döllner has been working at Volkswagen since 1993, while still earning his doctorate. He served as head of Porsche's four-door Panamera sedan series, which he helped develop.
What's Next: A focus on North America and China.
A main focus for Mr. Döllner will be to push ahead talks on opening a factory in North America. Audi's main competitors, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, both have production facilities in the United States, allowing them to produce nearly twice as many vehicles for that market. Audi's S.U.V.s are popular with U.S. drivers, and the company is looking at developing electric versions of several of its leading models.
In China, Audi's combustion engine vehicles remain popular, but the company needs to speed up production of electric vehicles if the brand is to remain competitive with popular local producers, including BYD and Chery.

Berlin and Beijing Try A Reset of Relations, With New Calculations: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: This week the two countries will restart government consultations after a pandemic hiatus, but amid the war in Ukraine and rising U.S., Chinese tensions, common ground may be elusive.
BERLIN -- When Germany and China launched their government consultations a decade ago, Angela Merkel was still chancellor and their relations seemed an endless opportunity for trade and profit. The dialogues were a time for pomp and circumstance, trade deals and signing ceremonies, red carpets and military salutes.
But on Tuesday, Germany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and China's premier, Li Qiang, will relaunch the consultations after a three-year hiatus during the pandemic in a very different world -- one with new calculations over political vulnerabilities and economic dependencies.
The two countries return to the talks nearly as estranged partners, their relations strained by Russia's war in Ukraine, Beijing's deepening courtship with Moscow and China's simmering tensions with the United States, Germany's most important ally.
"These consultations seem out of sync with the times," said Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin. "Government-to-government consultations are usually something you would do with your democratic allies. The challenge is to balance the new realism we are facing with the old, Merkel-style of doing China consultations."
These consultations will be the first for Mr. Scholz, as well as the first visit to Berlin for Mr. Li as premier, who will be accompanied by a large train of ministers. There is little doubt their missions will be at odds, even as they try to shape areas of common interest.
For Germany, the meeting will be an opportunity to assert a new stance, one in which China is still one of its most critical economic partners but also a "systemic rival." That means Berlin will try to shield its critical technologies and encourage its businesses to diversify away from Beijing.
For China, it will be an opportunity to convince its largest European trading partner to stick to business as usual -- and drive a wedge between Berlin and Washington.
How to maintain necessary economic ties with China, in the shadow of growing U.S. pressure to align with it against Beijing, is a balancing act Germany is still struggling to master.
One German official privately called it Berlin's "three-body problem." Keenly aware that Washington is its security guarantor, German officials no longer have the luxury of treating its economic and political interests separately.
Relationships it once treated as bilateral and distinct -- German-Chinese, German-American and American-Chinese -- now feel tangled together. Security concerns have also intruded on economic ambitions in ways that did not preoccupy Germany before.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine forced Germany to reconsider economic relationships it had taken for granted, like its dependency on cheap gas from Russia, which once provided 50 percent of its supply. Germany managed to pivot to other supplies, narrowly avoiding a severe energy crisis, though not a recession.
By comparison, an event like a Chinese attack on Taiwan that sets off a U.S.-Chinese military confrontation would be far more painful. German officials believe they would be compelled to get involved, after having pushed so hard for Asian nations to support Europe against Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a violation of territorial sovereignty.
The economic consequences would be even more severe: More than a million German jobs depend directly on China, and many more indirectly. Nearly half of all European investments in China are from Germany, and almost half of German manufacturing businesses rely on China for some part of their supply chain.
For China, too, this is a trying moment.
Its post-pandemic economic recovery has been slower than expected. Some Western companies have also been wary of making new investments in China, as President Xi Jinping embarks on a push to fortify national security this year -- including a broadening of counterespionage laws that has heightened police scrutiny of Western companies in China.
Relations with Germany are especially important: It is China's largest European trading partner and source of European foreign investment.
"The fact that Germany has been talking about de-risking or becoming less dependent on the Chinese market naturally worries China," said Hu Chunchun, an associate professor at Shanghai International Studies University.
During talks in Berlin, German officials will most likely offer China a sense of what is coming in their long awaited China strategy paper, which was delayed by months of internal wrangling within Germany's government over how tough its stance should be. The paper is now expected to be made public in July.
A leaked original draft reflected a much tougher line on the need to diversify economic interests away from China, particularly in areas like critical infrastructure, as well as raw materials for technologies needed for a carbon-neutral economy, such as solar modules and electric car batteries.
That tone is expected to have been softened somewhat under pressure from Mr. Scholz, who is wary of too much shock to an economy that has dipped into recession.
German officials will make clear that they have no intention of changing their "One China" policy, acknowledging Beijing's goal of unifying with Taiwan while maintaining "friendly, but unofficial" relations with the Taiwanese.
They will also underline a message Mr. Scholz has repeatedly stressed: that Germany has no plans to "decouple" from China, as U.S. officials once urged. But, rather, it will lean into the concept of "de-risking."
The problem, analysts say, is defining what de-risking actually means.
"Does it mean getting rid of risk or minimizing it? How fast do you do it? There is a lot of leeway in that term," said Mr. Benner. "Scholz is walking a fine line. He does 'de-risking lite.' He is very big on diversification, but he doesn't want to discourage investment."
In April, Chinese officials raised concerns with Germany about news reports that said Berlin was considering limiting the sale of chemicals used in semiconductors to Beijing. The U.S. has been seeking to enlist European and other allies in its push to block Beijing's access to critical technologies like semiconductors, an effort that has infuriated China.
"They need to keep the Europeans as far away from the Americans as possible," said Mikko Huotari, executive director of the Mercator Institute for China Studies, of the Chinese delegation's goal this week. "Germany plays a huge role in that."
Beijing is still banking on the fact that many European companies rely so heavily on Chinese consumers that they cannot afford to distance themselves from China, said Paul Haenle, a former director for China on the National Security Council in both the Bush and Obama administrations.
"Chinese leadership has calculated that Europe is still very much at play," he said.
With Germany, in particular, China has cards to play: The biggest and most powerful German businesses -- the chemical producer BASF, and automakers like Volkswagen -- have bucked the trend of many other, increasingly wary German companies, and doubled down on their investments in China.
Late last year, China lifted its strict pandemic restrictions and reopened its economy, rolling out the red carpet to encourage foreign investors to pour money into China. Volkswagen's chief executive, Oliver Blume, was one of the first multinational business leaders to visit China. The country is the automaker's largest sales market.
"China feels that because of this dependency from a handful of big German companies, in the end, Germany will always be able to compromise or at least strike a deal with China," said Philippe Le Corre, a senior fellow for the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis.
Indeed, Germany's biggest challenge may not be a reckoning with Beijing but with its own companies -- and making clear that in the future, they must proceed in their economic dependencies on China at their own risk.
It makes the path for Germany to transform its relationship with China possible, but risky, the analyst Mr. Huotari said: "There is a way. Whether it is going to be a painful one, we have to see."

Full text: An innovative E.V. ride-sharing program is bringing low-cost clean transportation to an agricultural town in California's Central Valley. Others are following suit.
Three mornings a week, Herminia Ibarra makes her way to a fleet of sparkling electric vehicles lined up in a dusty alley alongside a former diesel repair shop. Of the five Chevy Bolts, three Tesla Ys, two Volkswagen e-Golfs and a BMW i3, she always tries to snag her favorite: the red Bolt set up with her Bluetooth. In this E.V., she will pick up the two retired farmworkers who are her regular clients and ferry them on two-lane roads to their dialysis appointments 20 miles away.
Ms. Ibarra is a raitera, a term for the practice of neighbors providing rides to community members in need. The shop, which has a Mexican flag wrapped around its staircase, is the nerve center of Green Raiteros, an E.V. ride-sharing initiative in Huron, Calif., that shuttles low-income residents, many of them elderly, to medical appointments for free.
Ms. Ibarra, behind the wheel of the red Bolt, is what its proponents call "mobility justice" in action: an effort to address the reality that low-income communities most affected by pollution from diesel trucks, highways and other sources have had the least access to zero-emission vehicles.
Enter the Green Raiteros. Born of a lack of public transit, a concern for the environment and stubborn resolve, the program was masterminded by the Latino Equity Advocacy & Policy Institute, a nonprofit founded by Rey León, Huron's mayor.
Similar efforts are underway elsewhere in California, New York and other areas, along with a growing push in Washington, D.C., to subsidize E.V. programs. Under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the federal government is providing $ 700 million in grants to local governments to set up charging infrastructure in underserved areas.
The goal of all these initiatives is to give more people in low-income communities access to cleaner forms of transportation. In Huron, the result of the local effort is 30 charging stations placed strategically around the city, among other projects aimed at lowering carbon emissions in the area.
Ringed by vast acres of garlic and tomato fields, Huron is a small agricultural city in "the Heart of the Valley," as a sign on the main road into town announces. Of Huron's 6,200 residents, 95 percent are Latino and about 50 percent are immigrants. And despite being just 50 miles from Fresno, the state's fifth largest city, Huron is too remote for Uber or Lyft to operate.
Mr. León has referred to the tradition of ride sharing in Latino communities as "Indigenous Ubers." He is the son of a migrant worker brought to the U.S. under the Bracero program that ran from 1942 to 1964, and a graduate of University of California, Berkeley. The emotional resonance of ride-sharing came early: When Mr. León was a child, his uncle worked as a raitero. "He was a tall man with a big sombrero and a tiny car -- a green Pinto," he recalled. "He was like Curious George with the Man with the big Yellow Hat. Big guy, small car."
When Mr. León's uncle wasn't available, the family's transit options were limited. Mr. León remembers that he and his mother had to take the county bus to visit a critically injured cousin in the hospital some 55 miles away, an exhausting three-and-a-half-hour journey with at least 16 stops.
For Mr. León, the ordeal from his youth laid the groundwork for Green Raiteros. Electric vehicles that usually zip around the dappled hills of wealthy Malibu or Marin County are now accessible to "maintainers of the food chain," as Mr. León describes his majority farmworker residents.
Huron's average household income is $ 35,000, and many people, Mr. León said, spend 30 to 40 percent of their monthly wages on gas-powered cars that frequently break down. Residents breathe air consistently ranked as some of the country's worst.
"Like affordable housing, mobility and transportation are a basic human right," said Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program for the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment at University of California Berkeley law school. In low-income, ecologically vulnerable areas like Huron, he said that it often requires multiple sources of public funding to get the necessary infrastructure up and running -- charging stations especially -- including staff to apply for the grants in the first place.
Mr. León launched Green Raiteros in 2018 with private foundation money and half a million dollars from the settlement of a legal case between NRG Energy and the California Public Utilities Commission. The Teslas were courtesy of a $ 1 million grant from the California Air Resources Board, the state air quality regulator charged with developing programs to fight climate change. (A statute requires that at least 35 percent of certain climate investment projects benefit low-income communities and households.) The $ 150,000 annual operating budget is largely a mix of funding from the air board, state agencies and philanthropies, supplemented by a recent contribution from General Motors."It's always about playing catch-up," Mr. León said.
Tax credits and consumer rebates for purchasing E.V.s tend to be of little use for people for whom owning a car is a significant financial hurdle. "Owning a car is a poverty perpetuator," Mr. León observed, sitting in the Green Raiteros dispatch center behind the faded brown stucco colonnades of the main street.
Ms. Ibarra, like some Green Raiteros drivers, started out as a client. Her husband, Victor Garcia, worked as an agricultural truck driver and needed access to the sole family car, so Ms. Ibarra relied on raiteros to get around. Gregorio Hernandez, 69, one of her regulars and a retired farmworker, was an original "green raitero" but became unable to drive after two strokes. He usually rides in Ms. Ibarra's Bolt along with Enrique Contreras, a fellow dialysis patient who said it would otherwise cost $ 40 a day to pay someone to drive him.
Ms. Ibarra's route to the dialysis center is a slice of Central Valley life, bisecting miles of pistachio and almond orchards, and cotton fields shedding fluff along the shoulders. She passes local employers like a major state prison and the sweltering tomato paste processing plant where she used to work. In the car, the three chitchat about what's growing, the job scene in the fields and, of course, the weather. Ms. Ibarra always waits for the two men to finish their dialysis appointments, then drives them home.
She cares about the planet but likes E.V.s chiefly because she hates pumping gas, she said. She tracks mileage on her iPhone, pulling up to a charger at day's end. At night, the program's cars reside behind a chain-link fence guarded by two pit bulls, Princess and Puki.
"It's important because many people don't drive, don't have cars and there is nobody to take them," Ms. Ibarra said. "They are all farmworkers and would have to lose a day of work."
Green Raitero's clients, about 120 in total, either sign up for rides in advance or just wander into the former repair shop. Many "still have old-fashioned flip phones," said David Mercado, the dispatcher and a longtime driver. "They can call day or night. We're a tight community."
Inventive models for E.V. ride sharing are flourishing elsewhere, from rural, unincorporated communities outside Fresno to a new car-sharing program bringing E.V.s to affordable housing complexes in eight states. A pioneering public-private effort in Los Angeles, BlueLA powered by Blink Mobility, began in 2015 with funding from California Air Resources Board and the city's Department of Water and Power. It offers car sharing at discounted rates for low-income members: $ 1 per month for membership and 15 cents a minute in rental fees.
At Rancho San Pedro, a largely Latino public housing complex abutting the heavily polluted, highly trafficked Port of Los Angeles, residents campaigned for a $ 100,000 state-funded pilot launched by the nonprofit Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator to bring two electric vehicles and charging stations to this transportation desert more than 20 miles from downtown.
The communal Nissan Leafs, renting for $ 5 an hour, have been a hit with residents, with prime time starting at 6 a.m. for school drop-offs. "If the car breaks down, you don't have to repair it," said Maria Montes, who coaches others on how to use the E.V. sharing program.
Other E.V. pilots, like the nonprofit Miocar, based at affordable housing developments throughout the Central Valley, have relied on public investments.
The most far-reaching concept is the country's first municipally owned car share, in Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minn., a fleet of 170 electric vehicles and 70 charging spots covering a 35 square-mile area with a high concentration of poverty. Evie Carshare debuted last year, subsidized by $ 7 million in federal grants, $ 4 million from Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy Inc. and funding from both cities.
But collectively, these nonprofit programs face broader hurdles. Because they offer below-market pricing, their long-term financial sustainability and ability to scale up can be uncertain. "It's an inversion of the dominant car-sharing model, which is a for-profit operation in affluent urban areas with high-quality transit," said Caroline Rodier, associate director of the Urban Land Use and Transportation Center at UC Davis, who has studied Miocar and rural car sharing.
Obtaining auto insurance can also be a struggle, said Creighton Randall, the chief executive of the Mobility Development Group, which specializes in launching such projects.
Ithaca Carshare in upstate New York, which has operated for 15 years with 30 cars and 1,500 members, recently went on hiatus after the two remaining private insurers of car sharing left the New York market. Last week, the state passed legislation allowing nonprofits to pool insurance, allowing programs like the one in Ithaca to secure affordable plans and continue operating.
And in Cantua Creek, Calif., a tiny Central Valley town (population 471), the much-anticipated arrival of four E.V.s and six chargers in November 2019 through a state program was short-lived. The cars were put on hold at the start of the pandemic and later unceremoniously removed.
Poetically named "Van Y Vienen" (meaning "they come and go"), community members could volunteer as drivers through an app set up by Green Commuter, a private ride-sharing company. For residents like Rosario Rodriguez, 47, who lives in neighboring Three Rocks and does not drive, this was a huge relief.
The $ 1.9 million project included $ 749,800 in California air board funding. Its demise "speaks to the larger issue of how we invest in public transit that goes beyond traditional projects," said Veronica Garibay, co-executive director of Leadership Counsel for Justice & Accountability, a legal and social justice organization that works with low-income, rural communities.
The cars provided residents with a fleeting glimpse of independence. "They were rides with people I could trust," Ms. Rodriguez said, citing easy trips to her mammograms, dental appointments and food shopping in Fresno, 50 miles away. "Then one day, the cars were gone."
"To tell you the truth, I just feel helpless and disappointed," she said. "It's not a privilege or a luxury to have a form of transportation. It is a need."

Tesla Will Open Its Charging Network to G.M.'s Electric Vehicles: [Correction]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The electric car company, which operates the country's most extensive charging network, struck a similar deal with Ford Motor recently.
General Motors said on Thursday that it would adopt Tesla technology to charge its electric vehicles, including selling models that use the plugs pioneered by Tesla.
The announcement, two weeks after Ford struck a comparable agreement, is likely to make Tesla's plugs the industry standard and squeeze companies that are racing to build similar networks as sales of electric vehicles surge. The agreements mean that owners of Ford and G.M. vehicles will be able to use Tesla chargers, which are often the only ones available in many places and have a reputation for reliability.
"This really almost doubles access to chargers" for G.M. customers, Mary T. Barra, the automaker's chief executive, said during a streamed Twitter conversation with Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and owner of Twitter.
Mr. Musk said the deal "is going to be a fundamentally great thing for the advancement of E.V. adoption."
But it may raise concerns that Tesla, which already dominates electric vehicle sales, could overwhelm competitors in the fast-growing charging business.
While G.M. gets access to more chargers, Tesla will make money from selling energy to owners of models made by other automakers. Tesla has been charging owners of those other cars higher rates than owners of its own cars. The electric car company also needs to open up its network to qualify for some of the $ 7.5 billion that the federal government is spending to speed up the construction of charging stations.
By adopting Tesla's charging standard, Ford and G.M. also risk becoming dependent on their most formidable competitor. Neither of the Michigan-based automakers sells anywhere near as many electric cars as Tesla, and neither operates a charging network.
The agreement also has risks for Tesla. The popularity of its cars has created congestion at the company's charging stations in some cities and along some highways. Tesla owners may become irritated that they will now have to queue with cars made by Ford and G.M.
"I don't think Tesla owners will be pleased to watch a Ford Mustang Mach-E getting charged, while they wait in line," said Ben Rose, president of Battle Road Research, who follows the auto industry.
The battle between Tesla's charging plugs and the ones currently used by Ford, G.M. and other automakers recalls the competition between Betamax and VHS video cassettes in the 1980s. VHS ultimately won the battle.
At one level, the competition between the standards is a wonky technical issue with each side claiming its plug is the better choice. But it could have long-lasting implications for the millions of people who are expected to switch to electric vehicles in the coming years.
Tesla sells cars with a plug known as the North American Charging Standard. Ford, G.M. and most other carmakers have sold cars with plugs using the Combined Charging System plug. The two are not compatible.
Fast chargers offered by companies like EVgo typically have both plugs and can charge Teslas as well as cars from manufacturers that use C.C.S., including Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen and Volvo. For most of its roughly 10-year history, Tesla's network -- which operates more than half of the nearly 30,000 fast chargers in the country -- was closed to cars from other manufacturers, but the company recently began allowing other cars to use some of its chargers.
Reaction from competitors was restrained on Thursday. "We support all moves to increase E.V. adoption," Brendan Jones, the chief executive of Blink Charging, said in an email. He added, "We are monitoring the market closely and will adjust if we think necessary."
Investors welcomed the deal. The share prices of Tesla and G.M. were up about 3 percent in extended trading on Thursday.
This year is shaping up to be critical to G.M.'s electric vehicle ambitions. The company is weeks away from offering a battery-powered version of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. It also plans to introduce electric iterations of the Blazer and Equinox sport utility vehicles.
Ford is working to accelerate production of its electric F-150 Lightning at a factory in Dearborn, Mich.
Mr. Musk said during the conversation with Ms. Barra that Tesla would not use its control of the nation's largest charging network to disadvantage competitors. But if Tesla's standard becomes dominant, other operators will be reliant on a competitor for information they need to manufacture and install charging networks.
Jonathan Levy, the chief commercial officer of EVgo, said the company hoped that the North American standard "will be published in a way that suppliers across the industry will have access to deliver more charging options for E.V. drivers."
Beginning in early 2024, owners of Ford and G.M. electric vehicles will be able to buy adapters to connect to Tesla fast chargers. In 2025, both companies plan to sell vehicles designed to use Tesla's North American plug. Owners would need an adapter to connect to C.C.S. chargers.
By teaming with an archrival, Ford and G.M. have conceded that they need Tesla's network to sell electric vehicles.
"Dependable, widespread public charging is a key driver to scaling the adoption of E.V.s," Jim Farley, the chief executive of Ford, said in an email when the company announced its agreement with Tesla last month. "The Tesla Supercharger network has proven reliability and has already established charging corridors across the U.S. and Canada."

Musk Era Has Ravaged Twitter Ads: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In internal forecasts, the company projected that ad sales would keep declining, handing a tough challenge to its new chief executive.
Elon Musk recently said Twitter's advertising business was on the upswing. "Almost all advertisers have come back," he asserted, adding that the social media company could soon become profitable.
But Twitter's U.S. advertising revenue for the five weeks from April 1 to the first week of May was $ 88 million, down 59 percent from a year earlier, according to an internal presentation obtained by The New York Times. The company has regularly fallen short of its U.S. weekly sales projections, sometimes by as much as 30 percent, the document said.
That performance is unlikely to improve anytime soon, according to the documents and seven current and former Twitter employees.
Twitter's ad sales staff is concerned that advertisers may be spooked by a rise in hate speech and pornography on the social network, as well as more ads featuring online gambling and marijuana products, the people said. The company has forecast that its U.S. ad revenue this month will be down at least 56 percent each week compared with a year ago, according to one internal document.
These issues have been inherited by Linda Yaccarino, the NBCUniversal executive whom Mr. Musk named Twitter's chief executive last month. She started her new job on Monday.
On a Twitter Space audio event on Monday, Mr. Musk said advertisers in Europe and North America have put "extreme pressure" on the company, leading "half our advertising" to disappear. "They are trying to drive Twitter bankrupt," he said.
He did not respond to a request for comment and Ms. Yaccarino, through a spokesman, declined to comment.
The state of Twitter's advertising is crucial because ads have long made up 90 percent of the company's revenue. After Mr. Musk bought Twitter for $ 44 billion in October and took the company private, he vowed to build "the most respected ad platform." But he quickly alienated advertisers by firing key sales executives, spreading a conspiracy theory on the site and welcoming back barred Twitter users.
In response, several large ad agencies and brands, including General Motors and Volkswagen, paused their ad spending on Twitter. Mr. Musk has said Twitter was on track to post $ 3 billion in revenue in 2023, down from $ 5.1 billion in 2021, when it was a public company.
Twitter's valuation has since plunged. In March, Mr. Musk said the company was worth $ 20 billion, down more than 50 percent from the $ 44 billion he paid for it. Last week, the mutual funds giant Fidelity, which owns shares in Twitter, valued the company at $ 15 billion.
Twitter feels increasingly "unpredictable and chaotic," said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, an association for premium publishers. "Advertisers want to run in an environment where they are comfortable and can send a signal about their brand," he added.
Some of Twitter's biggest advertisers -- including Apple, Amazon and Disney -- have been spending less on the platform than last year, three former and current Twitter employees said. Large specialized "banner" ads on Twitter's trends page, which can cost $ 500,000 for 24 hours and are almost always bought by large brands to promote events, shows or movies, are often going unfilled, they said.
Twitter has also run into public relations snafus with big advertisers like Disney. In April, Twitter mistakenly gave a gold check mark -- a badge meant to signify a paying advertiser -- to the @DisneyJuniorUK account, which Disney doesn't own. The account posted racial slurs, leading Disney officials to demand from Twitter an explanation and assurances that it wouldn't happen again, two people with knowledge of the situation said.
Disney, Apple and Amazon declined to comment.
Six ad agency executives who have worked with Twitter said their clients continued to limit spending on the platform. They cited confusion over Mr. Musk's changes to the service, inconsistent support from Twitter and concerns about the persistent presence of misleading and toxic content on the platform.
Last month, for instance, a picture that appeared to show an explosion near the Pentagon -- which artificial intelligence experts identified as a synthetically generated image -- was shared by dozens of Twitter accounts and briefly caused the stock market to tumble.
Some advertisers also continue to worry about Mr. Musk's tweets. Last month, he posted several times comparing the billionaire financier George Soros, a frequent target for conspiracy theorists, to the "X-Men" comic book villain Magneto. Ted Deutch, the chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, noted that both Mr. Soros and Magneto are Holocaust survivors, and that "the lie Jews want to destroy civilization has led to the persecution of Jewish people for centuries."
"Musk should know better," he said.
Last week, Ella Irwin, Twitter's head of trust and safety, the division that oversees content moderation, and AJ Brown, the head of brand safety and ad quality, resigned, three current and former employees said. Ms. Irwin and Mr. Brown did not respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Musk has promoted new tools, known as adjacency controls, so advertisers can keep their ads away from tweets containing specific keywords or posts by certain users. Some advertisers are using the tools to keep their content away from Mr. Musk's tweets, four people familiar with the situation said.
Still, some marketers are returning to the platform. GroupM, a media-buying organization that is part of the ad giant WPP, informed employees in May that it was removing its "high risk" flag on Twitter and guiding clients to return, at their discretion, to business as usual, two people familiar with the decision said. IPG, another large advertising company, has recommended that clients proceed with caution when dealing with Twitter, after suggesting last fall that they temporarily pause their spending.
Twitter is exploring ways to make it easier for advertisers to buy space on the platform, testing an automated system outside the United States to make deals, two people familiar with the arrangement said. Insider earlier reported the move.
The company is experiencing ad growth in areas that it once shied away from or prohibited, including online gambling and marijuana products. In one week last month, four of Twitter's top 10 U.S. advertisers were online gambling and fantasy sports betting companies, according to one presentation. Twitter has also started allowing ads for cannabis accessories, including "bongs, vapes, rolling paper," as well as erectile dysfunction products and services, according to internal emails.
Adult content, which is permitted on Twitter, has become a concern among the company's sales staff. When some employees tried to drum up interest from advertisers for Mother's Day, they found that potential sponsored search terms, like "MomLife," surfaced pornographic videos, according to two people familiar with the conversations.
These are issues that some advertisers hope Ms. Yaccarino will solve.
Dave Campanelli, the chief investment officer of Horizon Media, said he was hoping for change after Ms. Yaccarino started, because media agencies like his struggled to maintain contact with Twitter last fall after Mr. Musk arrived.
"For a period, we weren't even sure who to get on the phone with to talk to," he said. "With Linda coming in, that could change that in a big way."
He acknowledged that Twitter's mercurial boss and volatile environment might pose a challenge for Ms. Yaccarino.
"It's a tall order," Mr. Campanelli said.

Newly Reviewed
Joan Brown
Through June 17. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, Manhattan; 212-243-0200, matthewmarks.com.
You could call the mature style of the great American painter Joan Brown (1938-1990) extra-late Egyptian, with her figures often rendered fully frontal or fully in profile. This formality -- along with expanses of startling solid colors -- contributes to the hypnotic stillness of her mainly autobiographical works. (Besides painting, her interests included her family, Hinduism, ballroom dancing, serious amateur swimming and Egyptian art.) It's not always clear what Brown, who appears in six of the paintings here, is thinking about, but the seriousness is undeniable.
So it's not surprising that this show of a dozen paintings, mostly from the 1970s, includes "The Visitor" (1977). It depicts the artist seated with an Egyptian pharaoh at a restaurant. The pharaoh is deep turquoise -- the color of Egyptian faience -- as is the wall behind him, which is incised with hieroglyphs. If two worlds are colliding, it seems to be occurring in Brown's imagination. After all, the show is titled "Facts & Fantasies."
In "Self-Portrait at Age 42" (1980) we encounter the artist with arms folded, staring ahead. She wears a blue pullover delicately smeared with paint and a clear plastic glove. Is she facing an unwelcome interruption in her studio? Then it dawns: Her hard stare seems like the kind artists reserve for paintings in progress. There are several other alluring works, but don't miss "Donald" (1986), a copper on wood sculpture of an extra-large tabby cat. As with the Egyptians, cats were another of Brown's favorite subjects.

Through June 10. Perrotin, 130 Orchard Street, Manhattan; 212-812-2902, perrotin.com.
Rina Banerjee's show at Perrotin is well timed: Her style of world-building with everyday materials is having a moment. Current museum exhibitions devoted to Wangechi Mutu, Daniel Lind-Ramos and Sarah Sze create a fruitful context for Banerjee, who's had a decades-long, successful career but no solo show here in eight years.
Like those other artists, Banerjee makes evocative creatures and grand yet intricate installations from unusual materials. But her work feels both more omnivorous and more precarious. Her arrangements -- of, say, small wooden and porcelain figurines atop a tangle of netting and string, giving way to clusters of horns and glass -- are as compelling as they are improbable. They coalesce at the same time that they don't. Banerjee, who was born in Calcutta and raised mostly in New York, seems interested not just in the imaginative possibilities of hybridity, but also how easily things might shift or come apart.
The show's centerpiece, "Black Noodles" (2023), commands the gallery, looking like an underwater ruin, and Banerjee's loose paintings of mythical female figures are transporting. But I kept returning to "Contagious Migrations" (1999--2023), a work that features a two-headed creature of sorts, set against a dizzying sketch of plans for a ventilation system. The plan's edges are cut into tentacle-like shapes, from which extend medical tubes, some covered in black netting. The piece evokes Covid-19 but is too abstract to be commentary. Instead it's beautiful, ominous and mysterious. It captures what's so mesmerizing about Banerjee's art, and what's so unsettling. JILLIAN STEINHAUER Giorgio de Chirico
Through July 29. Vito Schnabel Gallery, 455 West 19th Street, Manhattan; 646-216-3932; vitoschnabel.com.
Almost any of the 16 Giorgio de Chirico paintings in "Horses: The Death of a Rider" could sustain an exhibition by itself. A couple from the late 1920s are less polished, and you could reasonably call "Two Horses on a Seashore," 1970, a little glib. But for the most part the lush, peculiar and consistently delightful paintings show the Greek-born Italian painter at the top of his game for the better part of five decades.
As the exhibition title suggests, every canvas also holds one or more horses, often backed by one of the mysterious landscapes he's known for. Carnal but loaded with symbolism, the horse is a living link to antiquity, making it the perfect subject for a history-conscious artist like de Chirico (1888-1978). It's also full of bulging joints and fleshy mounds, and de Chirico approaches it, visually as well as conceptually, as a kind of chimera, a grab-bag of separate moments and encounters.
The majestic white steed in the title piece, "Death of a Rider," rears up on a twilit beach, letting its rider tumble off like Icarus behind it. In the distance stands a city on a hill; nearby, two voyagers or gods watch from a rowboat. But the horse's posture is actually that of a statue, its foreleg bent, its head in a dramatic profile that doesn't quite match the angle of its body. To one side it's a crouching, unconscious power; to the other a self-possessed, even arrogant personality. Altogether it encapsulates the drama of the scene, at once active and eternal.

'From the Margins: The Making of Art-Rite'
Through June 21. Printed Matter; 231 11th Avenue, Manhattan; 212-925-0325, printedmatter.org.
The title "From the Margins: The Making of Art-Rite" at Printed Matter" feels a little inaccurate from today's global-art standpoint. Founded in 1973 by Edit DeAk, Walter Robinson and Joshua Cohn, Art-Rite magazine published 19 issues and featured some of the biggest talents of the '70s, most of whom have gone on to become household names in the art world. This meticulous show tells its story via documentary photographs, letters, original paste-up materials and anecdotes filled with witticisms and insider gossip.
The young editors met in an art criticism seminar at Columbia University taught by the brilliant editor and artist Brian O'Doherty. The magazine (its name consciously echoes ShopRite grocery stores and the advertising circulars handed out there) was printed on newsprint and avoided "terminological pollution," that is, theory-jargon and artspeak. The first issue included contributions by the Pop Art scholar Lawrence Alloway, Hilton Kramer (at one point a New York Times critic), the feminist critic Lucy Lippard, and the art historians Irving Sandler and Leo Steinberg -- a jaw-dropping roster for an alternative "throwaway" publication.
Art-Rite arrived in an era when a "crisis in criticism," sparked partly by a burgeoning art market, was constantly being sounded. Critics suddenly had less power than curators, collectors and artists, and venues for criticism were shrinking. Now, as glossy art magazines are being consolidated as "brands" and criticism further homogenized, the need for a smart, scrappy publication like Art-Rite -- and one that looks this good 50 years after its founding -- is more urgent than ever.

Last Chance
Man Ray
Through June 2. Di Donna, 744 Madison Avenue, Manhattan; 212-259-0444, didonna.com.
Man Ray portrayed the artists and writers of Paris in the 1920s and '30s as indelibly as Nadar did their 19th-century predecessors. Indeed, Man Ray's deathbed photograph of Marcel Proust makes a fitting bookend to Nadar's of Victor Hugo. But Nadar, when he memorialized France's literary titan in 1885, was himself a venerable Paris institution, while Man Ray, who rushed to Proust's apartment in 1922 at the bidding of Jean Cocteau, was an American who spoke terrible French and had been living in Paris for little over a year.
The marvel of "Man Ray's Paris Portraits, 1921-1939" is his access as well as his artistry. Before relocating, Man Ray had been befriended by Marcel Duchamp and Tristan Tzara, two vanguard artists. They smoothed his Parisian entry, and are among the subjects in this exhibition of 72 vintage prints, mostly drawn from the collection of Timothy Baum, a private art dealer who knew Man Ray in the last years of his life and collaborated on this show.
Man Ray flattered his subjects. To soften wrinkles and other imperfections, he typically shot with a long lens from a distance, and he slightly overexposed the film. Yet his portraits were profoundly revealing: the knowing eyes of the poet Anna de Noailles, the glazed stare of the perennially pickled Sinclair Lewis, the burly forcefulness of a young Alexander Calder. And then there is his self-portrait, taken in his mid-30s -- tie intentionally askew, eyes penetrating, and mouth set in a line of unstoppable determination. ARTHUR LUBOW
Sylvia Plimack Mangold
Through June 3. 125 Newbury, 395 Broadway, Manhattan, 212-371-5242, 125newbury.com.
"I discovered the secret of the sea in meditation upon a dewdrop," wrote the Lebanese-born painter and poet Khalil Gibran. Sylvia Plimack Mangold approaches painting the same way. Fifteen works on view at 125 Newbury all depict a single maple tree living outside her studio in Washingtonville, N.Y., that she has been painting for decades.
Many of the paintings here are titled "Leaves in the Wind" and capture a green-filled summer rendered, close-up, in lush but no-nonsense brushstrokes reminiscent of Fairfield Porter or Édouard Manet -- as well as Claude Monet and his sharply framed compositions of waterlilies. Other works, titled "Winter Maple," function like dusty-blue skyscapes forked by leafless brown-gray branches.
The "secret" of the tree, of course, is that it is ever-changing, and hence produces infinite variations. (If, in fact, it is the same tree. We have to trust Mangold on this -- although Magritte's famous 1929 painting "The Treachery of Images," commonly known as "Ceci n'est pas une pipe" or "This is not a pipe," offered a blunt lesson on how truth operates in painting.)
In Mangold's hands, parts become wholes and the exhibition a master class in synecdoche: the tree is the forest; the painter a human representative negotiating with the natural world. In an age of restless movement and too much information, the practice of painting a single tree also becomes a profound, even radical act of mindfulness, meditation and care. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Beverly Fishman
Through June 3. Miles McEnery Gallery, 515 West 22nd Street, Manhattan; 212-445-0051; milesmcenery.com.
The artist Beverly Fishman has been thinking about the cure for what ails us for the last 40 years. Her candy-colored constructions exist somewhere between painting, sculpture and bad trip: uppers and downers pulsating in happy, fluorescent hues -- a medicine cabinet stocked with remedies for being human.
The new work here, continuing her series of faceted, urethane-shellacked wood forms that protrude from the wall (a funny play on the idea of "relief"), are a workaround to figuration -- about the body but never depicting it, geometric abstraction as a feint to talk about contemporary culture, and what we ingest to cope with it. They merge Frank Stella's hard-edged syncopation with Southern California's Finish Fetish movement, resulting in lustrous surfaces with an electric hum and smooth cast, like Everlasting Gobstoppers dipped in car paint. Each pill is rendered in concentric bands so that they resemble restless, polychromatic irises, or Wayne Thiebaud's glowing confections, if Thiebaud painted sherbert-ringed icons of existential pain.
Only their titles, doubling as diagnoses, reveal their nefariousness, as in "Untitled (Osteoporosis, Abortion, Depression, Anxiety, Birth Control)," 2023: healing as dictated by the medical-industrial complex, the promise of a quick fix and the drug dependency that promise has encouraged.
"Four help you through the night, help to minimize your plight," Mick Jagger sings on "Mother's Little Helper," the Stones' buoyant tune about a housewife developing a Valium habit. Since then, the pharmacological spectrum has only become more florid. That gives Fishman an inexhaustible pill box, her dosages calibrated to symptoms that never let up. MAX LAKIN

Uman
Through June 17. Nicola Vassell Gallery, 138 Tenth Avenue, Manhattan. 212-463-5160; nicolavassell.com.
In her first solo show at Nicola Vassell Gallery, the self-taught painter Uman, who was born in Somalia and now lives near Albany, pretty much takes the place over. On gallery walls painted deep green, purple or gold, she has mounted 15 enormous, vibrant, unremitting square paintings, each framed in a dark shadow box produced in her studio, and even more small drawings. (Not for nothing is the show titled "I Want Everything Now.") The paintings' colors are bold and saturated, and their textures range from slick, wet brushwork to the halting skitter of oil stick. Their forms mostly comprise circles, scribbles and squares, but also a smattering of eyes, flowers, suns, pointy teeth and ambiguous suggestions of intestines, chairs or vertebrae. The references are both cross-cultural and art-historical, but the effect, in general, leans toward the textile; one yellow canvas, divided into a triangular lattice by green and red lines, is also sewn together from triangular scraps. On another, what looks like a transparent sea horse rears over a bottle clearly labeled "Eau de Parfum."
In a way, though, Uman is a minimalist. Her gestures, like the schematic flowers that let her claim a toehold in figuration, are always distinctly efficient. Canvases may be covered edge to edge, but the paint application is thin, and the moment an explosive effect is achieved, she moves on to the next one. WILL HEINRICH
Aliza Nisenbaum
Through Sept. 10. Queens Museum, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Queens; 718-592-9700; queensmuseum.org.
Aliza Nisenbaum grew up in Mexico and now lives in New York. So do many of the people in Corona, Queens, whom she's spent years painting in their homes and workplaces, in her studio at the Queens Museum or while they were enrolled in a class she once taught called "English Through Feminist Art History." The museum's wonderful "Queens, Lindo y Querido" (Queens, Beautiful and Beloved), a wide-ranging show of her work, includes portraits of Delta Air Lines and Port Authority employees; of Hitomi Iwasaki, the show's curator, in her plant-filled office; and of an art class that Nisenbaum offered to food pantry volunteers at the museum, displayed along with a selection of the volunteers' own works ("El Taller, Queens Museum").
It's worth mentioning all of this because Nisenbaum's interest in people, her need to connect with them, doesn't just provide content for her paintings -- it comes through in their form. Realistic but with heightened colors and flattened planes, they're homey and glamorous at once, capable of absorbing any number of idiosyncratic details. "El Taller" (The Workshop) presents 10 budding artists, five working on self-portraits with the aid of small mirrors, against the unreal purple mists of Flushing Meadows Corona Park. And then there are the paintings-within-the-painting, each with its own distinctive style, not to mention 19 naïve, multicolored games of "exquisite corpse." It's a tribute to Nisenbaum's generosity -- and to her skills with composition -- that it all inhabits a single room in harmony. WILL HEINRICH
Natia Lemay
Through June 17. Yossi Milo, 245 10th Avenue, Manhattan; 212-414-0370; yossimilo.com
Three tiny sculptures, each less than 10 inches tall, fill all the psychic room in Natia Lemay's solo at Yossi Milo.
She stacks up miniature versions of banal furnishings -- a chair, a sofa, a rocking horse -- glued one on top of the other. Carved from soapstone, they copy the crude softwood miniatures that kids build from dollhouse kits.
Lemay was born into hardship in Toronto, with roots in African-Canadian culture and among the Mi'kmaq peoples of Canada's East Coast. Her generic home goods seem to commemorate the rough years she spent moving between public housing, homeless shelters and low-end rentals. I think of her sculptures as "memory towers," and their diminutive scale seems to concentrate their energies rather than diminish them. (Don't memories always feel small -- small enough to fit into a skull?)
Lemay links her towers to the Native art of the totem pole, which makes sense in terms of their form and mnemonic function.
The soapstone she uses, some of which came to her from her father, also recalls Indigenous crafts. Using that material to render the troubled urban world she has known, Lemay claims it as her continuing birthright. She reclaims it from the decades it has spent in the tourist trade.
There are also 20 oil paintings in Lemay's show. To me, they accept the authority of the old master tradition rather than pushing back against it. But then, I feel that way about most recent painting. Lemay's terrific little sculptures seem more like hand grenades, primed to blow a hole in our hierarchies. BLAKE GOPNIK
Aria Dean
Through June 17. Greene Naftali, 508 West 26th Street, 8th floor, Manhattan; 212-463-7770, greenenaftaligallery.com.
The young artist and theorist Aria Dean is known for essays connecting Blackness, objecthood and digital culture. (Her selected writings, "Bad Infinity," debuts this summer.) This is good to remember, since from the moment you pass through the bubble-gum pink saloon doors at Greene Naftali -- a deadpan work titled "Pink Saloon Doors" -- the polished sculptures and digital prints on view seem sparse and cryptic, defiantly superficial. Something's omitted. This show follows from Dean's dynamic thinking (or, less generously, illustrates points she's made on the page) regarding the ease with which lo-fi images circulate, although the uninitiated can also appreciate her chilly, cynical take on commercial art.
The sculpture "FIGURE A, Friesian Mare," a glossy, crumpled gray lump on a shipping palette, evokes a kind of trashed Minimalist cube or compacted equestrian statue, unsubtly twisting the connection between stark formalism and the viewer's body. The implications of treating living things as commodities are brutal.
The other four works on view are luxuriously tall dye sublimation prints on aluminum, three or four panels each, depicting ... what? From a distance, blurs and blotches, a sky, shapes whipping by at high speed, but blown up and zoomed in to such a degree that they're basically abstract, flecked with stray pixels. In fact, Dean's project could be summarized as exploring the violence abstraction causes, or makes possible. The taciturn slickness of this show provokes an uncomfortable reaction: Is there no feeling here? No pain? No humanity? TRAVIS DIEHL
Chris Burden
Through June 24. Gagosian, 821 Park Avenue, Manhattan; 212-796-1228, Gagosian.com
There can't be many artists whose works are as textbook-famous and as rarely encountered as Chris Burden's. We can't expect to see repeats of the 1970s performances for which he was nailed to a Volkswagen Beetle or shot in the arm with a .22. He died in 2015, and even when he was living those were one-offs. But this rare Burden show presents other examples of the Angeleno's radical works of the 1970s. They shifted the boundaries of art, which makes them now look safely "artistic" and gallery-worthy.
The show gathers several of the "relics" -- Burden's term -- meant to stand for his performances: An empty display case represents "Disappearing," a piece for which he made himself scarce for three days; a telephone and cassette recorder represent "Wiretap," for which Burden taped calls with art dealers.
There's also footage of Burden's shooting and of "Bed Piece," a well-known performance that had him lying in a gallery for 22 days.
More surprising are the one-minute "TV Commercials" that let Burden infiltrate art into broadcast TV, after buying the ad space required. One of them, "Full Financial Disclosure," sits in Andy Warhol's Business Art genre, revealing the numbers for Burden's 1976 income and expenses -- and for his paltry profit. In "Chris Burden Promo," names of world-famous artists fill the TV one after another: "Leonardo da Vinci," "Michelangelo," "Rembrandt," "Vincent van Gogh," "Pablo Picasso" and then ... "Chris Burden." That final name would once have seemed a joke or wildly wishful thinking, but now it lives cozily with the others. BLAKE GOPNIK

U.S. Battery Subsidies Put Allies on Edge: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The European Union is trying to assemble the building blocks to produce electric cars, but subsidies are luring companies to the United States.
European leaders complained for years that the United States was not doing enough to fight climate change. Now that the Biden administration has devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to that cause, many Europeans are complaining that the United States is going about it the wrong way.
That new critique is born of a deep fear in Germany, France, Britain and other European countries that Washington's approach will hurt the allies it ought to be working with, luring away much of the new investments in electric car and battery factories not already destined for China, South Korea and other Asian countries.
That concern is the main reason some European leaders, including Germany's second-highest-ranking official, Robert Habeck, have beaten a path to Vasteras, a city about 60 miles from Stockholm that is best known for a Viking burial mound and a Gothic cathedral.
Officials have been traveling there to court one of Europe's few homegrown battery companies, Northvolt. Led by a former Tesla executive, Northvolt is a small player in the global battery industry, but European leaders are offering it hundreds of millions of euros to build factories in Europe. Mr. Habeck visited in February to lobby the company to push ahead on its plan to build a factory near Hamburg, Germany. The company had considered postponing to invest in the United States instead.
"It's definitely attractive to be in America right now," Emma Nehrenheim, Northvolt's chief environmental officer, said in an interview last month in Vasteras. Northvolt declined to comment in detail on the discussions about the Hamburg plant, which the company committed to in May.
The tussle over Northvolt's plans is an example of the intense and, some European officials say, counterproductive competition between the United States and Europe as they try to acquire the building blocks of electric vehicle manufacturing to avoid becoming dependent on China, which dominates the battery supply chain.
Auto experts said that the tax credits and other incentives offered by President Biden's main climate policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, had siphoned some investment from Europe and put pressure on European countries to offer their own incentives.
The United States has provoked a "massive subsidy race," Cecilia Malmstrom, a former European trade commissioner, said during a panel discussion last month at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. She called on leaders to "jointly invest in the green transition and not compete against each other."
Biden officials have argued that U.S. and European policies are complementary. They have noted that the government and private money going into electric cars and batteries would lower prices for car buyers and put more emission-free vehicles on the road.
U.S. officials add that construction of battery factories and plants to process lithium and other materials is booming on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Efforts by governments to promote electric vehicles "will spur a degree of technological innovation and cost cutting that will be beneficial not only to Europe and the United States, but to the global economy and to our global effort to meet the challenge that climate change presents," Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in a recent interview.
The Biden administration has also been talking with European officials about allowing cars made from European battery materials and components to qualify for U.S. tax credits. And the administration has interpreted the I.R.A., which Mr. Biden signed in August, to leave room for producers in Europe and elsewhere to benefit.
"You're seeing less of a concern from Europe that those companies may be lured away from Europe to America," said Abigail Wulf, who directs the Center for Critical Minerals Strategy at SAFE, a nonprofit organization.
Still, the law has forced European leaders to put new industrial policies in place.
In March, the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, proposed the Critical Raw Materials Act, legislation to ensure supplies of lithium, nickel and other battery materials. One piece of the legislation calls for the E.U. to process at least 40 percent of the raw materials that the car industry needs within its own borders. The 27-nation alliance has also let countries provide more financial support to suppliers and manufacturers.
The money that the United States and Europe are pouring into electric vehicles will encourage sales, said Julia Poliscanova, a senior director at Transport & Environment, an advocacy group in Brussels. The legislation, which will need the approval of the European Parliament and the leaders of E.U. countries, would also bring some coherence to the fragmented policies of national governments, she said.
But Ms. Poliscanova added that European and U.S. policies risk canceling each other out. "Because everyone is scaling up at the same time, it's a zero-sum game," she said.
Business executives have complained that applying for financial aid in Europe is bureaucratic and slow. The Inflation Reduction Act, with its emphasis on tax credits, is simpler and faster, said Tom Einar Jensen, chief executive of the battery maker Freyr, which is building a factory in Mo i Rana, in northern Norway, and has plans to construct more plants in Finland and near Atlanta.
The I.R.A. has prompted "a dramatic increase in uptick in interest for batteries produced in the U.S.," Mr. Jensen said in an interview.
The future of European auto manufacturing is at stake, particularly for German companies. Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen have already lost market share in China to local automakers like BYD. Chinese automakers, including BYD and SAIC, are also making inroads in Europe. Selling cars under the British brand MG, SAIC has amassed 5 percent of the European electric vehicle market, putting it ahead of Toyota and Ford in that fast-growing segment.
European carmakers are frantically trying to build the supply chains they need to churn out electric vehicles.
In France, President Emmanuel Macron wants to convert a northern region where factory jobs have been in decline into a hub of battery production.
On Tuesday, Automotive Cells Company, a joint venture between Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz and TotalEnergies, inaugurated a factory in Billy-Berclau Douvrin, France, that aims to produce 300,000 electric batteries annually by the end of 2024. A.C.C. also plans to invest a total of 7.3 billion euros, or $ 7.8 billion, in Europe, including opening factories in Germany and in Italy, a deal sealed with 1.3 billion euros in public aid.
In Salzgitter, Germany, some 25 miles from Volkswagen's headquarters, steel beams tower above concrete foundations as excavators and dump trucks hum nearby. In a matter of months, the outlines of a battery factory have risen out of a field.
Volkswagen hopes to have battery-making machines installed before the end of the summer. By 2025, the automaker aims to produce battery cells for up to 500,000 electric vehicles a year -- a timeline that the company said was possible only because the factory was being built on land it owned.
Volkswagen is also building a factory in Ontario, but the company made the decision to do so only after the Canadian government matched U.S. incentives.
In Guben, a small city on Germany's border with Poland, Rock Tech Lithium, a Canadian company, is building a plant to process lithium ore. Mercedes has an agreement with Rock Tech to supply lithium to its battery producers.
These projects won't reach full production for several years. Recently, the Guben site was an open field. The only construction activity was a truck that dumped loads of crushed rock, making an ear-piercing screech.
Europe has some advantages, including a strong demand for electric cars: About 14 percent of new cars sold in the E.U. in the first three months of this year were battery powered, according to Schmidt Automotive Research, twice as many as in the United States.
But if Europe doesn't move quickly to aid the battery industry, "you will really lose momentum on the ground versus the North American market," said Dirk Harbecke, chief executive of Rock Tech.
Chinese battery companies have largely avoided the United States for fear of a political backlash. But Chinese battery firms have announced investments in Europe worth $ 17.5 billion since 2018, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies and the Rhodium Group.
Political tension between Western governments and China has put German carmakers in a delicate position. They do not want to be overly dependent on Chinese supplies, but they cannot afford to displease the Chinese government.
BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo plan to buy cells from a factory in Arnstadt, Germany, run by CATL, a Chinese company that is currently the world's largest maker of electric vehicle batteries.
To balance their reliance on Chinese suppliers, European executives and leaders are keen to work with Northvolt, whose chief executive, Peter Carlsson, oversaw Tesla's supply chain for more than four years.
Northvolt wants to control all the steps of making batteries, including refining lithium and recycling old cells. That should help Europe achieve supply chain independence and ensure that batteries are produced in the most environmentally responsible way possible, said Ms. Nehrenheim, who is also a member of the Northvolt management board. "We're de-risking Europe," she said.
The company develops manufacturing techniques at its complex in Vasteras. Northvolt's first full-scale factory, at a site in Sweden 125 miles south of the Arctic Circle chosen for its abundant hydropower, is the size of the Pentagon. Northvolt also plans to build a U.S. factory, but has not yet announced a site.
Still, the company is ramping up production and is not among the world's top 10 battery suppliers, according to SNE Research, a consulting firm. And construction on its Hamburg plant is on hold until E.U. officials approve German subsidies.

VASTERAS, Sweden — European leaders complained for years that the United States was not doing enough to fight climate change. Now that the Biden administration has devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to that cause, many Europeans are complaining that the United States is going about it the wrong way.
That new critique is born of a deep fear in Germany, France, Britain and other European countries that Washington’s approach will hurt the allies it ought to be working with, luring away much of the new investments in electric car and battery factories not already destined for China, South Korea and other Asian countries.
That concern is the main reason some European leaders, including Germany’s second highest ranking official, Robert Habeck, have beaten a path to Vasteras, a city about 60 miles from Stockholm that is best known for a Viking burial mound and a Gothic cathedral.
Officials have been traveling there to court one of Europe’s few homegrown battery companies, Northvolt. Led by a former Tesla executive, Northvolt is a small player in the global battery industry, but European leaders are offering it hundreds of millions of euros to build factories in Europe. Habeck visited in February to lobby the company to push ahead on its plan to build a factory near Hamburg, Germany. The company had considered postponing to invest in the United States instead.
“It’s definitely attractive to be in America right now,” Emma Nehrenheim, Northvolt’s chief environmental officer, said in an interview last month in Vasteras. Northvolt declined to comment in detail on the discussions about the Hamburg plant, which the company committed to in May.
The tussle over Northvolt’s plans is an example of the intense and, some European officials say, counterproductive competition between the United States and Europe as they try to acquire the building blocks of electric vehicle manufacturing to avoid becoming dependent on China, which dominates the battery supply chain.
Auto experts said the tax credits and other incentives offered by President Joe Biden’s main climate policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, had siphoned some investment from Europe and put pressure on European countries to offer their own incentives.
The United States has provoked a “massive subsidy race,” Cecilia Malmstrom, a former European trade commissioner, said during a panel discussion last month at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. She called on leaders to “jointly invest in the green transition and not compete against each other.”
Biden officials have argued that U.S. and European policies are complementary. They have noted that the government and private money going into electric cars and batteries would lower prices for car buyers and put more emission-free vehicles on the road.
U.S. officials add that construction of battery factories and plants to process lithium and other materials is booming on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Efforts by governments to promote electric vehicles “will spur a degree of technological innovation and cost cutting that will be beneficial not only to Europe and the United States, but to the global economy and to our global effort to meet the challenge that climate change presents,” Wally Adeyemo, the deputy Treasury secretary, said in a recent interview.
The Biden administration has also been talking with European officials about allowing cars made with European battery materials and components to qualify for U.S. tax credits. And the administration has interpreted the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed in August, to leave room for producers in Europe and elsewhere to benefit.
“You’re seeing less of a concern from Europe that those companies may be lured away from Europe to America,” said Abigail Wulf, who directs the Center for Critical Minerals Strategy at SAFE, a nonprofit organization.
Still, the U.S. law has forced European leaders to put new industrial policies in place.
In March, the European Commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, proposed the Critical Raw Materials Act, legislation to ensure supplies of lithium, nickel and other battery materials. One piece of the legislation calls for the EU to process at least 40% of the raw materials that the car industry needs within its own borders. The 27-nation alliance has also let countries provide more financial support to suppliers and manufacturers.
The money that the United States and Europe are pouring into electric vehicles will encourage sales, said Julia Poliscanova, a senior director at Transport & Environment, an advocacy group in Brussels. The legislation, which will need the approval of the European Parliament and the leaders of EU countries, would also bring some coherence to the fragmented policies of national governments, she said.
But Poliscanova added that European and U.S. policies risk canceling each other out. “Because everyone is scaling up at the same time, it’s a zero-sum game,” she said.
Business executives have complained that applying for financial aid in Europe is bureaucratic and slow. The Inflation Reduction Act, with its emphasis on tax credits, is simpler and faster, said Tom Einar Jensen, chief executive of the battery maker Freyr, which is building a factory in Mo i Rana, in northern Norway, and has plans to construct more plants in Finland and near Atlanta.
The Inflation Reduction Act has prompted “a dramatic increase in uptick in interest for batteries produced in the U.S.,” Jensen said in an interview.
The future of European auto manufacturing is at stake, particularly for German companies. Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen have already lost market share in China to local automakers like BYD. Chinese automakers, including BYD and SAIC, are also making inroads in Europe. Selling cars under the British brand MG, SAIC has amassed 5% of the European electric vehicle market, putting it ahead of Toyota and Ford in that fast-growing segment.
European carmakers are frantically trying to build the supply chains they need to churn out electric vehicles.
In France, President Emmanuel Macron wants to convert a northern region where factory jobs have been in decline into a hub of battery production.
On Tuesday, Automotive Cells Co., a joint venture between Stellantis, Mercedes-Benz and TotalEnergies, inaugurated a factory in Billy-Berclau Douvrin, France, that aims to produce 300,000 electric batteries annually by the end of 2024. ACC also plans to invest a total of 7.3 billion euros, or $7.8 billion, in Europe, including opening factories in Germany and in Italy, a deal sealed with 1.3 billion euros in public aid.
In Salzgitter, Germany, some 25 miles from Volkswagen’s headquarters, steel beams tower above concrete foundations as excavators and dump trucks hum nearby. In a matter of months, the outlines of a battery factory have risen out of a field.
Volkswagen hopes to have battery-making machines installed before the end of the summer. By 2025, the automaker aims to produce battery cells for up to 500,000 electric vehicles a year — a timeline that the company said was possible only because the factory was being built on land it owned.
Volkswagen is also building a factory in Ontario, but the company made the decision to do so only after the Canadian government matched U.S. incentives.
In Guben, a small city on Germany’s border with Poland, Rock Tech Lithium, a Canadian company, is building a plant to process lithium ore. Mercedes has an agreement with Rock Tech to supply lithium to its battery producers.
These projects won’t reach full production for several years. Recently, the Guben site was an open field. The only construction activity was a truck that dumped loads of crushed rock, making an ear-piercing screech.
Europe has some advantages, including a strong demand for electric cars: About 14% of new cars sold in the EU in the first three months of this year were battery powered, according to Schmidt Automotive Research, twice as many as in the United States.
But if Europe doesn’t move quickly to aid the battery industry, “you will really lose momentum on the ground versus the North American market,” said Dirk Harbecke, chief executive of Rock Tech.
Chinese battery companies have largely avoided the United States for fear of a political backlash. But Chinese battery firms have announced investments in Europe worth $17.5 billion since 2018, according to the Mercator Institute for China Studies and the Rhodium Group.
Political tension between Western governments and China has put German carmakers in a delicate position. They do not want to be overly dependent on Chinese supplies, but they cannot afford to displease the Chinese government.
BMW, Volkswagen and Volvo plan to buy cells from a factory in Arnstadt, Germany, run by CATL, a Chinese company that is currently the world’s largest maker of electric vehicle batteries.
To balance their reliance on Chinese suppliers, European executives and leaders are keen to work with Northvolt, whose chief executive, Peter Carlsson, oversaw Tesla’s supply chain for more than four years.
Northvolt wants to control all the steps of making batteries, including refining lithium and recycling old cells. That should help Europe achieve supply chain independence and ensure that batteries are produced in the most environmentally responsible way possible, said Nehrenheim, who is also a member of the Northvolt management board. “We’re de-risking Europe,” she said.
The company develops manufacturing techniques at its complex in Vasteras. Northvolt’s first full-scale factory, at a site in Sweden 125 miles south of the Arctic Circle chosen for its abundant hydropower, is the size of the Pentagon. Northvolt also plans to build a U.S. factory, but has not yet announced a site.
Still, the company is ramping up production and is not among the world’s top 10 battery suppliers, according to SNE Research, a consulting firm. And construction on its Hamburg plant is on hold until EU officials approve German subsidies.

The Economy In Germany Has Entered A Recession: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The News
Germany's economic output in the first three months of the year shrank 0.3 percent from the previous quarter, the country's statistics office said Thursday, tipping the economy into a recession.
Until now, Germany had defied predictions that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and the decoupling from Russian fossil fuels that powered the German economy, would send the country into two consecutive quarters of negative growth, the common definition of a recession. But the economy weakened in late 2022, contracting 0.5 percent. This year, stubbornly high inflation caused consumers to scale back consumption, sending spending down 1.2 percent in the first three months.
"The reluctance of households to buy was apparent in a variety of areas," the statistics office said. "Households spent less on food and beverages, clothing and footwear, and on furnishings." They also purchased fewer electric cars, as government incentives were reduced.
Why It Matters: Exports, a big driver of the economy, are down.
Germany is Europe's largest economy, and its health directly affects the health of the 20-member eurozone and the wider European Union, the world's third-largest economy, after the United States and China, in terms of output and purchasing power, according to the World Bank.
Initial estimates predicted that the German economy would remain flat in the first quarter, but the update on Thursday fully reflected additional data, including a 3.4 percent plunge in industrial output in March compared with the previous month, driven by drops in exports and the automotive industry.
Germany's economic growth depends heavily on exports, especially to China, where Volkswagen has been the dominant automaker for years. But a recent surge in the popularity of Chinese-made electric vehicles among customers in Asia caused Volkswagen to report a drop of 15 percent in sales in China in the first three months of the year.
Overall, exports in March dropped 5.2 percent from the previous month, according to government statistics.
German industrial companies were forced to scale back production at the end of last year because of energy prices that reached record levels, driven up by Germany's need to buy more liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., which is more expensive than the Russian gas delivered by pipeline.
Background: Inflation and high interest rates aren't helping.
Inflation remains high in Germany, at 7.6 percent in April, and the European Central Bank has indicated that it may continue to raise interest rates to help bring the rate of price gains closer to its 2 percent target.
At the same time, unions have been battling employers for higher wages to keep up with rising prices. Settlements reached in key sectors, including industrial and service workers, helped to drive wage increases up 6.3 percent in the first three months of 2023.
Still, economists stressed how hard the price spiral was hitting those with the lowest incomes in Germany.
"In many cases, people with low wages and incomes will need at least another five years before the purchasing power of their wages, and thus their standard of living, will return to precrisis levels," said Marcel Fratzscher, president of the German Institute for Economic Research.
What's Next: No strong recovery in sight.
The European Commission is predicting that Germany will be the bloc's weakest member in terms of economic growth this year, managing an increase of only 0.2 percent.
Some economists agree.
"Looking ahead, we doubt that gross domestic product will continue to fall in coming quarters, but we see no strong recovery, either," said Claus Vistesen, chief economist for the eurozone at Pantheon Macroeconomics.

Why Is Inflation So Stubborn? The Car Market Is a Big Reason.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Prices of new and used vehicles were supposed to recede quickly as supply chain problems dissipated. The market had other ideas.
‌Car prices soared after the coronavirus lockdowns, and two years into the United States' worst inflationary episode since the 1980s, the industry demonstrates that getting back to normal will be a long and lurching ride.
In 2021 and early 2022, global shipping problems, a semiconductor shortage and factory shutdowns coincided with strong demand to push vehicle prices sharply higher. Economists had hoped that prices might ease as supply chains healed and the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases deterred borrowers.
Instead, prices for new cars have risen further. Domestic automakers are still producing fewer cars and focusing on more profitable luxury models. Used car prices helped to lower overall inflation late last year, but rebounded in April as short supply collided with a surge in demand.
Echoes from the industry's pandemic disruptions are reverberating through the economy even though the emergency has formally ended, and illustrate why the Fed's fight to quash inflation could be a long one as consumers continued spending despite higher prices.
"Inflation is not going to be a smooth path downward -- there are going to be bumps along the road," said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price. "There are so many idiosyncratic factors at play right now, and I think some of that has to do with demand post-pandemic."
Elevated car prices have proved uncomfortably sticky. Used car prices have declined, but in a more muted -- and volatile -- fashion than economists had anticipated. And new cars have continued to get more expensive this year as manufacturers strive to maintain the margins established in 2021.
"The big question now is: Are companies going to start competing with one another on price?" Ms. Uruci asked.
But that's a difficult question to answer, because the automotive market has drastically changed. To understand the situation, it's useful to examine how the auto industry worked before.
"Going into the pandemic, the dynamic in the automobile business was this idea that retail profitability was under constant pressure, driven by the internet," said Pat Ryan, the chief executive of CoPilot, a car shopping app that monitors prices across about 40,000 dealerships.
Automakers produced more cars than the marketplace demanded, offering incentives to clear inventory and compete with lower-cost imports. Dealers made their profits on volume and financing, often resulting in customer complaints of excess fees.
As the coronavirus spread, factories shut down. Even when they reopened, semiconductors remained scarce. Manufacturers allocated chips to their highest-priced models -- trucks and sport utility vehicles -- offsetting lower volume with higher profits on each sale. About five million cars that normally would have been produced never were, Mr. Ryan said.
Dealers got in on the action, charging thousands of dollars above list price -- especially as stimulus programs rolled out, and consumers sought to upgrade their vehicles or buy new ones to escape cities. A study by the economist Michael Havlin, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, found that dealer markups accounted for 35 percent to 62 percent of total new-vehicle consumer inflation from 2019 to 2022.
There were downsides to the lower sales volumes; dealerships also make money on service packages years after cars drive off the lot. But on balance, "it was the best of times for car dealers, for sure," Mr. Ryan said.
It was the worst of times, however, for anyone who suddenly needed a car.
That's the position that Hailey Cote of Pittsburgh found herself in last summer. After tiring of low-wage jobs on farms and in restaurants, she built a business cleaning houses for $ 25 an hour. When her 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee broke down, she knew she had to find a replacement quickly to ferry cleaning gear to each job and get to school, where she's pursuing a degree in counseling.
At that point, the used cars she could find were only a few thousand dollars less than the cheapest new cars, so she went with a 2022 base model Toyota Corolla. Her loan payment is about $ 500 a month. Insurance, which has also become more expensive, is another $ 200. Including gas and maintenance, Ms. Cote's transportation cost is almost as much as her rent, leaving nothing for savings or recreation.
"I think it's the basic necessities that are really the worst," Ms. Cote, 29, said. "Food's gone up a bit, but the cost of housing, health care and cars is pretty brutal."
The car price frenzy began to ease in the second half of 2022, as more vehicles started rolling off assembly lines. But the supply has risen only gradually. Automakers, loath to relinquish profits enabled by scarcity, started talking about exercising "discipline" in their production targets.
"During this two-year period, auto dealers and auto manufacturers discovered that a low-volume, higher-price model was actually a very profitable model," Tom Barkin, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said in an interview.
"The experience of higher prices, and the ability to move prices, does broaden the perspectives of business people in terms of what their options are," he said. "It's attractive if you can do it."
One way the automakers tried to buoy prices was jettisoning cheaper models, like the Chevrolet Spark and Volkswagen Passat. Responding to federal subsidies, car companies rolled out electric vehicles, but that didn't help to bring prices down -- they started with luxury versions, like the $ 42,995 Mustang Mach-E.
And there have been added supply constraints. The generation of cars that would typically be coming off three-year leases is smaller than usual. Those who leased cars in the spring of 2020 have an incentive to buy them at the prices that were locked in before everything became more expensive.
On top of that, some rental car companies are aggressively restocking their fleets after being starved for several years, leading dealership groups like Sonic Automotive to complain on earnings calls that they're being outcompeted at auctions.
"There are so many sources of used vehicles that just dried up over the last few years," said Satyan Merchant, a senior vice president for financial services at TransUnion, a credit monitoring company. "And it all has this downstream effect."
The Fed has been raising interest rates sharply to slow demand -- including for cars -- and cool price increases. But during the adjustment period, that is making it even tougher for many Americans to afford a vehicle. According to TransUnion, the average monthly payment for a new car rose to $ 736 in the first quarter of 2023, from $ 585 two years before. Used cars average $ 523 per month, up $ 110 over the same period.
Cars are now a bifurcated market: Demand remains strong on the high end, where wealthy buyers with excess savings from the past two-plus years are able to absorb higher interest rates, or simply pay cash. Some are only now receiving vehicles they ordered in 2022 at inflated prices.
Competition for vehicles is also fierce on the low end, since people with thin financial cushions and in-person jobs can't afford to forgo transportation, which in most of the country is synonymous with a car. The job market has remained strong, especially for in-person jobs in fields like hospitality and health care, so more people have workplaces to get to.
And many people in between, who might switch cars every few years, are waiting for prices to fall.
"What we've seen is the disappearance of the middle," said Scott Kunes, chief operating officer of a dealership group in the Midwest. He faults the automakers for abandoning cheaper, smaller, basic cars that people need just to get around, especially as interest rates put fancier versions beyond reach. "It doesn't make any sense to me at all."
The situation may start to resolve itself soon. Wholesale car prices have begun to fall, and carmakers are offering more incentives. Kelley Blue Book data shows that average prices have fallen below list for the past two months, which Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, said signaled that demand was easing. Prices have come down in recent months for electric cars -- the fastest-growing segment of new car sales, though a small portion of the overall market.
Recent history has shown, however, that pricing trajectories are rarely linear. Adam Jonas, an auto industry analyst with Morgan Stanley, said that over the short to medium term, more inventory was the only answer.
"Even though the statements from the Japanese and the Koreans are that the chip shortage is ending, it takes many months to spool it up," he said. "Dealers should prepare for a tight summer."

Including gas and maintenance, Cote’s transportation cost is almost as much as her rent, leaving nothing for savings or recreation.
“I think it’s the basic necessities that are really the worst,” Cote, 29, said. “Food’s gone up a bit, but the cost of housing, health care and cars is pretty brutal.”
The car price frenzy began to ease in the second half of 2022 as more vehicles started rolling off assembly lines. But the supply has risen only gradually. Automakers, loath to relinquish profits enabled by scarcity, started talking about exercising “discipline” in their production targets.
“During this two-year period, auto dealers and auto manufacturers discovered that a low-volume, higher-price model was actually a very profitable model,” Tom Barkin, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said in an interview.
“The experience of higher prices, and the ability to move prices, does broaden the perspectives of businesspeople in terms of what their options are,” he said. “It’s attractive if you can do it.”
One way the automakers tried to buoy prices was jettisoning cheaper models, like the Chevrolet Spark and Volkswagen Passat. Responding to federal subsidies, car companies rolled out electric vehicles, but that didn’t help to bring prices down; they started with luxury versions, like the $42,995 Mustang Mach-E.
And there have been added supply constraints. The generation of cars that would typically be coming off three-year leases is smaller than usual. Those who leased cars in spring 2020 have an incentive to buy them at the prices that were locked in before everything became more expensive.
On top of that, some rental car companies are aggressively restocking their fleets after being starved for several years, leading dealership groups like Sonic Automotive to complain on earnings calls that they’re being outcompeted at auctions.
“There are so many sources of used vehicles that just dried up over the last few years,” said Satyan Merchant, a senior vice president for financial services at TransUnion, a credit monitoring company. “And it all has this downstream effect.”
The Fed has been raising interest rates sharply to slow demand — including for cars — and cool price increases. But during the adjustment period, that is making it even tougher for many Americans to afford a vehicle. According to TransUnion, the average monthly payment for a new car rose to $736 in the first quarter of 2023, from $585 two years before. Used cars average $523 per month, up $110 over the same period.
Cars are now a bifurcated market: Demand remains strong on the high end, where wealthy buyers with excess savings from the past two-plus years are able to absorb higher interest rates or simply pay cash. Some are only now receiving vehicles they ordered in 2022 at inflated prices.
Competition for vehicles is also fierce on the low end, since people with thin financial cushions and in-person jobs can’t afford to forgo transportation, which in most of the country is synonymous with a car. The job market has remained strong, especially for in-person jobs in fields like hospitality and health care, so more people have workplaces to get to.
And many people in between, who might switch cars every few years, are waiting for prices to fall.
“What we’ve seen is the disappearance of the middle,” said Scott Kunes, chief operating officer of a dealership group in the Midwest. He faults the automakers for abandoning cheaper, smaller, basic cars that people need just to get around, especially as interest rates put fancier versions beyond reach. “It doesn’t make any sense to me at all.”
The situation may start to resolve itself soon. Wholesale car prices have begun to fall, and carmakers are offering more incentives. Kelley Blue Book data shows that average prices have fallen below list for the past two months, which Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, said signaled that demand was easing. Prices have come down in recent months for electric cars — the fastest-growing segment of new car sales, though a small portion of the overall market.
Recent history has shown, however, that pricing trajectories are rarely linear. Adam Jonas, an auto industry analyst with Morgan Stanley, said that over the short to medium term, more inventory was the only answer.
“Even though the statements from the Japanese and the Koreans are that the chip shortage is ending, it takes many months to spool it up,” he said. “Dealers should prepare for a tight summer.”

Abstract: None available.

Full text: I slide into a cushy leather chair in this bustling shop next to a small flooring business. The hum of clippers echoes throughout the room.
Jay Organez swoops a crisp cape across my shoulders and grabs a pick, combing it through my hair as I describe my go-to cut: a little off the top with a shadow fade on the sides.
My eyes scan the Northern California shop -- 22 chairs in a half circle around the room, some of the individual stations with the Instagram handle of a barber painted above the mirror. A framed photo of former President Barack Obama hangs on a wall, and the TV is tuned to highlights from a recent Golden State Warriors basketball game.
But the volume is turned down low, and instead I hear snippets of conversations -- quick descriptions of desired cuts, followed by comfortable banter about politics (Donald Trump running for president -- again!) and sports (LeBron James passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the N.B.A. career scoring record) and life (a 20-something moving in with his girlfriend).
I instantly recognize the ease -- a trust built over time that sounds almost identical in the chairs here at KJ's Barber & Hair Creationz as it did a few days earlier inside polished N.B.A. locker rooms and gilded suites of five-star hotels.
Welcome to the world of influencer barbers, where a small cadre of skilled and savvy businessmen like Lionel Harris, who is known as Brownie Blendz and owns KJ's, have built trust with an exclusive and often extremely private clientele and used that access to build their own brands and land cushy endorsement deals. Mr. Harris, for example, has a recurring role on "The Shop Uninterrupted," a YouTube show that features guests at a mock barbershop talking about their personal lives as well as the world around them; Mr. James is an executive producer.
Powered by social media and word-of-mouth recommendations among V.I.P.s, the barbers have transformed what was once a stationary, monotonous job with modest pay -- a trade group estimates that barbers in the United States make $ 36,000 a year on average -- into six-figure salaries, whirlwind travel and a peek from the periphery into the world of celebrities and pro athletes.
The barbers are full-fledged influencers but also confidants to their clients -- sports stars, hip-hop legends and actors -- and although their schedules and prices have changed, they still strive to offer the same thing they got from going to the barbershop on weekends as boys: community and consistency.
Black barbershops have long provided a path to entrepreneurship and economic autonomy. They also served as centers of community engagement and congregation during the Jim Crow era, when racist laws limited the places where Black people could gather, said Quincy T. Mills, a history professor at the University of Maryland and author of "Cutting Along the Color Line: Black Barbers and Barber Shops in America."
"One could make a living, get a haircut, read the newspaper, engage in spirited conversations, play the numbers, organize a protest campaign or just take it all in," Mr. Mills said.
Over the course of a month, to see how this profession evolved with social media stardom, I tagged along with three celebrity barbers -- Mr. Harris, Marcus Harvey and Vince Garcia -- on appointments in Salt Lake City, Atlanta, San Francisco and Los Angeles, watching as they seamlessly dropped in and out of their famous clients' lives. While their clients, like those of many barbers, might want to see them weekly or twice a month, the difference is they travel to their V.I.P. customers, so they are essentially always on call.
Their own higher profiles have changed the dynamics at their original shops, and introduced a new challenge -- how to stay authentic to who they were when they started. The authenticity is part of what's appealing, said Brittany Bright, founder of the Influencer League, a group that provides marketing and management advice to people who work in the wellness and personal services industry.
"They've been able to tap into an audience that is highly engaged and interested in their professional perspective," she said. "The brand is always the foundation."
Although social media has changed the scope and location of the work for celebrity barbers, they say their drive is still grounded in a fierce desire to pave their own economic path.
It's just that now, the path isn't tethered to one spot.
Marcus Harvey, four hours off a plane from Atlanta, slung a black barber's cape over a chair facing the mirror inside the marble-tiled bathroom and meticulously situated his clippers and razors on the counter.
It was the start of N.B.A. All-Star Weekend in Salt Lake City, and Mr. Harvey was setting up a makeshift barbershop inside his suite at the Grand America Hotel.
As he fidgeted with his go-to pair of gold-colored clippers, he heard a soft knock at the door, and then Grant Hill, the Hall of Famer, bounded into the room.
"My brother, what's up?" Mr. Hill asked, greeting his longtime barber. "You ready to get this done?"
"Yup," Mr. Harvey said, guiding him toward the bathroom setup. "Let me clean you up."
A few hours earlier, Mr. Harvey, 40, had held court in the hotel's lobby, dapping up Spike Lee and recording videos he would later post for his 96,000 followers on Instagram.
One video showed an expansive view of snowcapped peaks and then cut to a close-up shot of black clippers from Bevel, a men's grooming company that has had a contract with Mr. Harvey for a decade.
"A barber doesn't just cut hair we shift thought processes," he captioned another Instagram post from All-Star Weekend. "Engineers of elegance, architects of swag, doctors of worth."
When he's on the road -- usually at least one day a week -- Mr. Harvey follows a fine-tuned routine.
He flies Delta Air Lines and picks a window seat, typically in first class. He uses FaceTime to connect with his young children, Nova and Kingsley, every night from his hotel and always packs his supplies into the same black hard-shell carry-on.
"My barbershop is in my bag," said Mr. Harvey, who grew up in Atlanta and got his first job as a teenager sweeping up hair clippings at a shop just outside the city.
He eventually started cutting hair and began to build a name for himself among local barbers. Then, in 2010, he caught a break.
A mentor whose barbershop he worked at, Ramsey Shepherd, connected him with Nasir Jones, the Grammy-winning rapper better known as Nas. It was 1:30 a.m., and Mr. Shepherd, who usually cut Nas's hair when the rapper was in Atlanta, was unavailable, so Mr. Harvey did the haircut.
"That moment really opened up a lot of doors," said Mr. Harvey, who traveled with Nas this month during a tour in Australia.
Chris Webber, the former N.B.A. All-Star, had recently moved to Atlanta to start a career as an analyst on TNT and needed a haircut. Nas, a close friend, pointed him to Mr. Harvey, who quickly won Mr. Webber over with his precise skills, endless supply of jokes and innate understanding that high-profile people want a cut far away from the spotlight.
"That was my first introduction into the world of N.B.A. athletes," Mr. Harvey recalled. "It's really been about cultivating and building on those connections."
Last year, Mr. Harvey spent several weeks in Europe with Nas during his world tour, and these days he sometimes makes house calls to the rapper in New York and Los Angeles. It's a reality beyond what he had ever imagined.
"A dream," Mr. Harvey said.
But a demanding one.
One afternoon, I met up with Mr. Harvey at his modest two-story home in Atlanta. He had just returned from New York, where he cut Nas's hair before a concert at Madison Square Garden, and was resting on a couch with his wife and daughter, who was home sick with allergies.
"While I travel a lot, I still have parenting duties," he said, cradling the 5-year-old in his arms.
When he is in town, he drops off and picks up his children from school or day care most days. He and his wife, Khrystina, like to walk laps around Piedmont Park near the city's Midtown neighborhood and go on date nights to Atlanta Hawks basketball games.
Between his celebrity clients, classes that he teaches to help other barbers build their brands, and his contracts with Bevel and a booking management company, Squire -- both of which he frequently tags on his Instagram profile -- Mr. Harvey typically brings in around $ 500,000 a year, he said. (The classes are part of his annual BarberStar Summit, where he coaches fellow barbers on, among other things, monetizing their brands online and networking to gain endorsement deals.)
"We live comfortably," Mr. Harvey said, "but it's a grind."
That afternoon, as he picked up his son, Kingsley, from day care, he rubbed his eyes -- the travel days were catching up to him. After dropping his son off at home, he turned his Volkswagen Tiguan south on Interstate 85 and drove 25 miles to Tyrone, Ga., where he wound his way along two-lane roads lined by thick forests before coming to a cast-iron gate.
He was buzzed in, and the gate slowly opened, revealing a 150-acre ranch with two man-made lakes and a mansion. Mr. Harvey pulled up to a barn on the property, which Mr. Webber owns, and began unloading his barbering tools.
The two men greeted each other with a hug, and Mr. Harvey set up a chair on the basketball court inside the barn. On the walls were posters and plaques documenting Mr. Webber's career, from his time at the University of Michigan, which he helped lead to national championship games in 1992 and 1993, to his stints with several N.B.A. teams.
The next day, Mr. Webber would be flying to New York to launch a cannabis initiative, and he needed to be cleaned up for the press event.
"A great thing about Marcus, among many things," Mr. Webber said, "is that he's always ready."
'When you look good, you feel good'
Ludacris was praising the power of a good barber. And even over Zoom, that priority was clear -- his hair meticulously braided in cornrows with a clean line up.
"When you look good, you feel good, you do good," the Grammy-winning musician, whose full name is Chris Bridges, told me, explaining that, as he sees it, Vince Garcia is among the best barbers on the planet.
"I can recognize talent," he said. "When we talk about M.V.P.s, he's one of the most valuable players in the barbering category."
Mr. Garcia, 36, who is based in Los Angeles, got his start in the early 2000s cutting hair in Toronto, where he was raised. He's Filipino Canadian but honed his skills at Black-owned Jamaican barbershops around the city.
His profile as a barber was steadily rising, and in 2008 he landed his first super-high-profile cut: Chris Bosh, a star on the Toronto Raptors. They slowly built a friendship, and before long he was Mr. Bosh's barber.
Two years later, when Mr. Bosh was traded to the Miami Heat, Mr. Garcia decided it was time for a move. But instead of Miami, he headed to Los Angeles, where he and a friend opened a shop in a popular fashion district. Soon, he had connected with some Lakers players and several musicians, including Ludacris.
"When you're in the L.A. area, there is always a celebrity clientele," Mr. Garcia said on a recent morning from his in-home barbershop, which is just north of Los Angeles and was decorated with signed jerseys from Travis Kelce, one of the top players in the N.F.L., and the N.B.A. star Devin Booker.
"There is always something happening, people are always here -- it's Hollywood, bright lights," he said.
But perhaps his biggest breaks came from Instagram.
Mr. Garcia started posting pictures of celebrity haircuts and, in 2019, signed a contract with Gillette, which requires that he post about the razor brand on social media at least a few times a month, he said. Like Mr. Harris, he also has a working agreement with "The Shop."
"The exposure from the show just elevates everything," said Mr. Garcia, who has 91,000 followers on Instagram.
Before the pandemic, Mr. Garcia was spending eight hours a day at his barbershop in the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles, then hustling off to the airport for tapings of the show or house calls for celebrities.
"As was the case for a lot of people, the pandemic slowed things down and allowed me to recalibrate," he said. He stopped working at the shop and focused on a solo career as a barber and on starting a company, By.Appt.Only., which produces specialized backpacks that barbers can use to carry their tools.
He charges $ 100 for haircuts at his house and $ 350 for house calls around Los Angeles, he said, but much of his roughly $ 250,000 income comes from endorsement deals, including a partnership with Dior.
"It's about being more than a barber," Mr. Garcia said. "Haircuts are the foundation, but for me I've always wanted to branch out."
Taking barbering to a new level
By the time I had arrived on the set of "The Shop," which was taping an episode in Salt Lake City during All-Star Weekend, Mr. Garcia and Mr. Harris were already working.
Mr. Garcia had just lined up the rapper Cordae, whose entourage was standing nearby scrolling through iPhones. In another room, Mr. Harris, who is 44 and from the Bay Area, was taking out his tools and preparing for the episode as hits from the Notorious B.I.G. played softly on speakers.
"What guys like Marcus, Vince and myself have done, in a lot of ways, is take barbering to a new level," Mr. Harris said. "But it's also about bringing up the next generation."
For Mr. Harris, who has been an influential figure in Black barber culture in the Bay Area for years, it was his primary client -- the Warriors star Draymond Green -- who helped open many doors. Mr. Green encouraged producers to put Mr. Harris on "The Shop," where he has since appeared in the background cutting the hair of celebrities who have been featured on the show, including Jimmy Kimmel and Jack Harlow.
On a recent morning, back in the Bay Area, Mr. Harris made his way through the narrow hallways of the Chase Center, the Warriors' arena in San Francisco. It was six hours before the Warriors tipped off against the New Orleans Pelicans, and Mr. Green sat in a mini-barbershop just outside the locker room.
"As a Black man, having a barber who you're close with means the world," Mr. Green said. "We talk about everything -- marriage, being fathers, just being better all-around men."
Mr. Harris, wearing a headlamp in the dimly lit room, nodded along as he used clippers to cut Mr. Green's closely cropped hair.
"One thing I think gets lost with a lot of us quote-unquote celebrity barbers is that we are first and foremost service people," he said. "Our profession is in the service industry."
And despite the opportunities that have opened up in recent years -- flying on a private jet, sitting courtside, rubbing elbows with celebrities at parties -- he still spends much of his time checking in on the seven barbershops he owns in the Bay Area and Central Valley.
KJ's, which stands for Keeping Jesus, is about an hour drive from the lavish confines of the Chase Center, in Tracy, Calif. Mr. Harris opened the shop in 2009, a year before Instagram was created.
"These are my roots," he said as he showed me around the shop one afternoon.
Mr. Harris was in a rush, but he surveyed the room, the half-circle of chairs that marked his pre-Instagram-famous professional life, the walls that now feature photos of him promoting his hair care products.
He pointed to Jay Organez's chair, and I took a seat.

VW Sells Russian Operations, Including an Assembly Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The German automaker, which quit making cars in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine, said it had sold its plant to a local auto dealership chain.
Volkswagen has sold its assembly plant and other operations in Russia to a local auto dealership, more than a year after the German carmaker ceased production in the country following the invasion of Ukraine, the company said on Friday.
Under the deal, which required approval from the Russian government, a Moscow-based dealership called Avilon acquired the assets of Volkswagen Group Rus, the carmaker said. Neither company specified a sales price, but Russia media, citing local records, said Avilon had paid about 125 million euros ( $ 135 million).
Volkswagen made the announcement in a terse statement, and declined to comment further on the deal.
The move makes Volkswagen the latest European carmaker to withdraw from Russia in the past year, joining several hundred other multinational corporations leaving a market where many spent decades currying and constructing. But outrage over Moscow's war in Ukraine, combined with the difficulties coping with tough economic sanctions aimed at punishing Russia, has made the Russian market less attractive.
Mercedes-Benz announced last month that it had sold its Russia division, including an assembly plant, to Avtodom, a Russian investor, roughly a year after it suspended local manufacturing and the export of passenger cars and vans to Russia. The sale included a limited repurchase option, the company said, but it did not give any further details.
Last year, the French automaker Renault negotiated a deal with the Russian government to sell its 68 percent stake in AvtoVAZ, Russia's biggest carmaker, to NAMI, an automotive research institute in Moscow, for the price of 1 ruble, with the option of resuming business in the country at a future date.
Volkswagen declined to say whether the sale included a clause to return to Russia. In addition to its plant, in Kaluga, a city in western Russia, the Volkswagen sale included the company's components and leasing divisions.
Avilon did not comment on the sale, and it was not immediately clear what its plans were for the Kaluga plant.
Before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Avilon sold Volkswagen vehicles as well as dozens of other Western brands, including Mercedes, Jeep and Rolls-Royce. Since last year, it has also begun selling leading Chinese brands, such as Chery, Great Wall and Zeekr.
Volkswagen spent €774 million building the Kaluga plant, which opened in 2007. Two years later, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia flew in by helicopter to celebrate the start of full production of several of the company's best-selling models, as well as models from its Skoda line.
The plant had capacity to turn out 225,000 vehicles a year, nearly the number the company delivered to customers in Russia in 2021. Shortly after the invasion in February 2022, Volkswagen ceased operations at the plant. It also quit making cars at another plant, in Nizhny Novgorod, that was owned by the Russian company Gaz Group.
Gaz Group sued Volkswagen over the halt, seeking to freeze the German company's assets in Russia. Last month, a court ruled in Volkswagen's favor.
Over the past year, the Kaluga plant's 4,000 employees remained on the payroll as they waited for information on whether they would be allowed to return to work. The idle plant was a financial drain on Volkswagen, which is scrambling to expand its electric vehicle offerings and revamp its core brand. It is also losing ground to local brands in China, the world's largest auto market.
Observers believe that large companies waited for several months to gauge the situation before deciding whether to pull out of Russia. Large multinational companies that had spent several decades building supply chains and networks realized that the complexity and reach of those systems made it difficult to bring them to a swift halt, said Sebastian Hoppe, a political economist at Berlin's Free University who researches Russia.
"The more suppliers you have in Russia itself, the harder it is to pull out and the longer this whole process takes," Mr. Hoppe said.
Carmakers in Russia employed 300,000 people in 2021, according to the country's statistics agency, and up to 3.5 million more are estimated to work in related industries. Those jobs have been devastated over the past year, as auto production has dropped 77 percent in large part because Western firms have pulled up stakes.
Other firms are also deciding to turn their back on Russia. Henkel, a German maker of washing powder and other household products, and Ikea, the Swedish furniture company, sold their factories to local buyers in Russia this year.
The sale of factories and other assets may have come at a loss, but many Western companies do not expect Russia's economy to return to normal growth in the near future.
"What I think is also important, it is of course the case that the Russian market tends to be less attractive than it was before the war," Mr. Hoppe said.

Full text: When seven thoroughbreds died at Churchill Downs, it was significant news, but little was said about the individual horses. Here are their stories, beginning with a $ 13,000 colt called Snowball.
1. Freezing Point (nicknamed Snowball)
Her voice catches and tears threaten to follow, but Randy Gootzeit wants you to know about how a strapping gray colt nicknamed Snowball brought a couple of horse lovers back to the track, and how they got their hearts broken.
Snowball, known on the track as Freezing Point, suffered a fatal breakdown during an undercard race at Churchill Downs on May 6, becoming the seventh horse to die in an agonizing eight days leading up to the Kentucky Derby. The deaths, as yet unexplained, have cast a pall over this year's Triple Crown and renewed questions about the safety of the animals as the sport prepares for Saturday's Preakness Stakes in Baltimore.
But for Gootzeit and her trainer Joe Lejzerowicz, the troubles in horse racing are just a backdrop to their private grief.
"We'd have done anything to save him, but we could not," Gootzeit said. "We miss him desperately."
Gootzeit, 71, lives near Phoenix. She galloped and trained horses in the 1970s and '80s at Belmont Park, but left the racetrack to return to school and become a physical therapist. She works on humans, but has also applied what she learned to horses.
She had not thought much about returning to the game until she talked to Lejzerowicz about buying a 2011 Volkswagen from him. A veteran trainer, he had learned his horsemanship under the Hall of Fame trainer Allen Jerkens and had worked for more than 30 years in barns from New York to California. Lejzerowicz was in Phoenix as well, selling cars and taking a break from the sport while learning to cope with Ménière's disease, a disorder of the inner ear that causes severe vertigo and ringing in the ears.
He and Gootzeit made an immediate connection. Their love of horses made them friends, but it was their shared view of how to treat the animals that made them business partners: Don't push them, keep them sound, choose rest over medication.
"We were coming out of the pandemic, and it was clear no one's timeline was guaranteed," Gootzeit said, "I told Joe that it was time to bet on ourselves."
With Gootzeit providing a bankroll of just $ 20,000, it took the pair some time to get back in the sport. They struck out at three auctions before Lejzerowicz fell in love with No. 954 at the Ocala, Fla., 2-year-old training sale last June. The colt was balanced, muscled and declared by a vet to be perfectly sound.
Surely, they thought, they couldn't afford him.
"He's perfect, but we don't have a snowball's chance in hell of getting him," Lejzerowicz told Gootzeit.
Lejzerowicz was so certain that their electronic bid would be topped that he was taking a nap in his truck when someone knocked and told him the colt was his for $ 13,000.
The pair took their time with the colt, whose official name was Freezing Point (a nod to his sire, Frosted), figuring out his eccentricities and admiring his work ethic.
"He was a little spitfire," Lejzerowicz, 53, said. "He was playful. I'd shake my finger at him, and he'd try to push it back at me."
Lejzerowicz took Snowball to Keeneland in Kentucky to get him ready to race. Gootzeit flew in every couple of weeks to help with training and tend to the colt. Snowball won once in three tries as a 2-year-old and began catching the eye of deeper-pocketed outfits. Gootzeit turned down offers of $ 150,000, $ 480,000 and, after Snowball finished third last month in the Lafayette Stakes, $ 600,000.
One of Gootzeit's mentors had advised her years earlier to take an offer for a horse only if the money was life-changing. This was a lot of money, but Snowball was already life-changing.
The gray colt had reconnected her to some of her happiest times and offered an opportunity to apply her knowledge of physical therapy and test her theories about what makes a happy horse.
In Lejzerowicz, she had not only found a friend but also a horseman who shared her values. "We loved the horse too much to consign him to anyone else's care," Gootzeit said.
And that is why the pair were at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May. They watched their horse run in the $ 500,000 Pat Day Mile Stakes just a couple of hours before the Derby.
They watched from the rail near the winner's circle. Snowball broke cleanly from the starting gate, but within a quarter-mile, Gootzeit and Lejzerowicz recognized their horse was in distress.
"His head popped up in the air," Gootzeit said. "It swung left. It swung right. Something happened. I knew something bad happened."
Within 30 minutes, Snowball was diagnosed with a broken bone in his left front ankle. Within an hour, Gootzeit and Lejzerowicz were saying tearful goodbyes to him. After the colt was euthanized, the vet passed on a locket of hair from his mane as a talisman.
Snowball will never be replaced, but the pair will press on. They are looking for another sound thoroughbred whose talent they can help surface.
"We are not going to be driven out of the game," Gootzeit said. "We want to succeed honestly and cleanly and give our horses the love and respect they deserve. "
2. Wild on Ice
3-year-old gelding
Injured his left hind leg during training and was euthanized
The jockey for this gritty Texas-bred horse, Ken Tohill, has won more than 4,100 races, but the gelding's victory in the Sunland Derby in March was his first in a graded stakes race. At 60, Tohill was set to become the oldest rider in Derby history. "A gift," is how Tohill described Wild on Ice one morning last month. He continued, "He's well bred enough and his talent is starting to show."
3. Code of Kings
3-year-old gelding
Flipped in the paddock and broke his neck
This son of Empire Maker was promising enough to debut in Saratoga, but he didn't live up to his promise, failing to finish higher than fifth in six starts. Code of Kings was being saddled when he became entranced by party lights at a D.J. booth, according to his trainer, and flipped once, twice and, finally, a fatal third time.
4. Parents Pride
4-year-old filly
Collapsed and died on April 29 during the eighth race at Churchill Downs
This filly had won two in a row and, with more than $ 153,000 in earnings, had tripled her purchase price. She was the second betting choice at odds of 2-1 and had Churchill's leading rider, Tyler Gaffalione, aboard. Parents Pride was sitting a comfortable second in the backstretch when Gaffalione suddenly pulled her up. She was vanned off the racetrack, then collapsed and died in Churchill's backside.
5. Chasing Artie
5-year-old gelding
Collapsed and died on May 2 after finishing the eighth race, in which he finished last
This versatile gelding had stakes victories on grass and dirt. He made a believer out of Albin Jimenez two summers ago at Monmouth Park when the jockey rode him as a last-minute replacement. "It was a good surprise to pick up this mount," said Jimenez. "I said, 'Great. Let's get the money."' They did, earning the first-place check in the My Frenchman Stakes.
Chasing Artie was trained by Saffie Joseph Jr., as was Parents Pride. Churchill and state regulators refused to let Joseph's colt Lord Miles race in the Derby.
"It crushes you. It knocks your confidence, it makes you doubt everything," Joseph said of the deaths.
6. Take Charge Briana
3-year-old filly
Was injured and fell during a May 2 race and was euthanized
This filly was bred by Willis Horton, a rancher and builder who died last year. She was trained by his longtime trainer, the Hall of Famer D. Wayne Lukas: "He had a great eye for a horse himself and he understood the game," said Lukas at the time of Horton's death last year. "He was game, and he wasn't afraid to step up and spend money on a good horse."
Take Charge Briana was ridden by Luis Saez, the same jockey who was on Chasing Artie.
7. Chloe's Dream
3-year-old gelding
Broke down during the second race on Kentucky Derby day and was euthanized
Chloe's Dream was named for the daughter of a business associate of Brook Smith, who operates the Rocket Ship Racing syndicate. Smith and his wife, Pam, are involved with the Backside Learning Center at Churchill, which offers education and wellness programs for racetrack workers and their families. Rocket Ship donates 10 percent of its winnings to the center. Smith took Chloe and her family to the paddock where he said Chloe's Dream looked "beautiful." When the gelding faltered coming out of the first turn, Smith said he and his party were traumatized.
"It leaves a hole in your stomach," Smith said. He added that he and his wife were not ready to return to the racetrack. "I can't go through it again."

Newly Reviewed
'Bonnard: The Experience of Seeing'
Through May 26. Acquavella, 18 East 79th Street, Manhattan; 212-734-6300, acquavellagalleries.com.
A kaleidoscopic show of Pierre Bonnard's paintings at Acquavella overlaps with a more modest selection at Jill Newhouse Gallery nearby -- not bad for a practically hallucinatory painter who's been dead since 1947. Bonnard bridged Post-Impressionism and Modernism; he's famous for his colors, mind-bending and vertiginous, unfurling the full spectrum within scenes others might see as "white" or "blue."
Where Impressionists had their favorite cathedrals or lily pads, Bonnard's masterpieces came alive at home. Acquavella focuses on his later years, from the 1920s to 1940s, and showcases the wonders of simply laid tables and balanced baskets of fruit and fantastic landscapes rushing through the windows. "Dining Room on the Garden," 1934-35, on loan from the Guggenheim Museum, takes pride of place on the back wall: a purpling banquet, the feverishly blue-green sky through the French doors, the hay-toned walls overtaking the chairs, a figure.
There are portraits, too, including a periwinkle bath scene (one of Bonnard's specialties), where the red rug jostles the composition's peace, and an alluring, long nude from 1920, where the figure is one stripe up the canvas between vertical passages of mottled gold and chevroned blue. The still lifes? Abundant. The tablecloths? Ecstatic. The kinetics of Bonnard's compositions reside in the way objects and animals relate, appearing both detached and boundless. This is why he's a peerless painter of dachshunds, although here you'll need to settle for the lazier chocolate hues of "The Dining Room, Fruit and Basset Hounds." TRAVIS DIEHL
Uman
Through June 17. Nicola Vassell Gallery, 138 Tenth Avenue, Manhattan. 212-463-5160; nicolavassell.com.
In her first solo show at Nicola Vassell Gallery, the self-taught painter Uman, who was born in Somalia and now lives near Albany, pretty much takes the place over. On gallery walls painted deep green, purple or gold, she has mounted 15 enormous, vibrant, unremitting square paintings, each framed in a dark shadow box produced in her studio, and even more small drawings. (Not for nothing is the show titled "I Want Everything Now.") The paintings' colors are bold and saturated, and their textures range from slick, wet brushwork to the halting skitter of oil stick. Their forms mostly comprise circles, scribbles and squares, but also a smattering of eyes, flowers, suns, pointy teeth and ambiguous suggestions of intestines, chairs or vertebrae. The references are both cross-cultural and art-historical, but the effect, in general, leans toward the textile; one yellow canvas, divided into a triangular lattice by green and red lines, is also sewn together from triangular scraps. On another, what looks like a transparent sea horse rears over a bottle clearly labeled "Eau de Parfum."
In a way, though, Uman is a minimalist. Her gestures, like the schematic flowers that let her claim a toehold in figuration, are always distinctly efficient. Canvases may be covered edge to edge, but the paint application is thin, and the moment an explosive effect is achieved, she moves on to the next one. WILL HEINRICH
Sylvia Plimack Mangold
Through June 3. 125 Newbury, 395 Broadway, Manhattan, 212-371-5242, 125newbury.com.
"I discovered the secret of the sea in meditation upon a dewdrop," wrote the Lebanese-born painter and poet Khalil Gibran. Sylvia Plimack Mangold approaches painting the same way. Fifteen works on view at 125 Newbury all depict a single maple tree living outside her studio in Washingtonville, N.Y., that she has been painting for decades.
Many of the paintings here are titled "Leaves in the Wind" and capture a green-filled summer rendered, close-up, in lush but no-nonsense brushstrokes reminiscent of Fairfield Porter or Édouard Manet -- as well as Claude Monet and his sharply framed compositions of waterlilies. Other works, titled "Winter Maple," function like dusty-blue skyscapes forked by leafless brown-gray branches.
The "secret" of the tree, of course, is that it is ever-changing, and hence produces infinite variations. (If, in fact, it is the same tree. We have to trust Mangold on this -- although Magritte's famous 1929 painting "The Treachery of Images," commonly known as "Ceci n'est pas une pipe" or "This is not a pipe," offered a blunt lesson on how truth operates in painting.)
In Mangold's hands, parts become wholes and the exhibition a master class in synecdoche: the tree is the forest; the painter a human representative negotiating with the natural world. In an age of restless movement and too much information, the practice of painting a single tree also becomes a profound, even radical act of mindfulness, meditation and care. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Beverly Fishman
Through June 3. Miles McEnery Gallery, 515 West 22nd Street, Manhattan; 212-445-0051; milesmcenery.com.
The artist Beverly Fishman has been thinking about the cure for what ails us for the last 40 years. Her candy-colored constructions exist somewhere between painting, sculpture and bad trip: uppers and downers pulsating in happy, fluorescent hues -- a medicine cabinet stocked with remedies for being human.
The new work here, continuing her series of faceted, urethane-shellacked wood forms that protrude from the wall (a funny play on the idea of "relief"), are a workaround to figuration -- about the body but never depicting it, geometric abstraction as a feint to talk about contemporary culture, and what we ingest to cope with it. They merge Frank Stella's hard-edged syncopation with Southern California's Finish Fetish movement, resulting in lustrous surfaces with an electric hum and smooth cast, like Everlasting Gobstoppers dipped in car paint. Each pill is rendered in concentric bands so that they resemble restless, polychromatic irises, or Wayne Thiebaud's glowing confections, if Thiebaud painted sherbert-ringed icons of existential pain.
Only their titles, doubling as diagnoses, reveal their nefariousness, as in "Untitled (Osteoporosis, Abortion, Depression, Anxiety, Birth Control)," 2023: healing as dictated by the medical-industrial complex, the promise of a quick fix and the drug dependency that promise has encouraged.
"Four help you through the night, help to minimize your plight," Mick Jagger sings on "Mother's Little Helper," the Stones' buoyant tune about a housewife developing a Valium habit. Since then, the pharmacological spectrum has only become more florid. That gives Fishman an inexhaustible pill box, her dosages calibrated to symptoms that never let up. MAX LAKIN
Last Chance
Michael McGrath
Through May 19. Crossing Art, 559 West 23rd Street, Manhattan, 212-359-4333, crossingart.com.
The artist Michael McGrath, who is based in Rhinebeck, in the Hudson Valley, paints what might be called the emoji landscape: screaming flowers; surprised-looking insects and trees. Scattered, wallpaper-like, across canvases whose titles nod to gods, witches and seasonal magic spells, his show "Moon Riot" at Crossing Art thrums with laid-back spiritualist energy.
McGrath's work took a radical turn a couple of years ago. (I discovered him on Instagram.) He was painting pleasingly anodyne landscapes and dark figures in the vein of Edvard Munch, and suddenly his work exploded with Day-Glo color and singing plants, unmoored in their compositions. Rather than serious or apocalyptic, his work is warm and funny, like folk art or children's drawings, and complemented by titles like "Intro to Hunting Gods," "Spring Training for Witches," "Redesigning Ghost Systems" and "Weekend Conference for Moons and Tiny Vampires."
The show includes a few missteps: It's overhung, and I could live without the fake-fur yeti figures that feel more like theme park mascots than sculpture. McGrath's work is refreshing, though, because it materializes the wonder of walking in the woods and a deeper sense that the world, minus humans, will be OK; everything regenerates, as it does in Thomas Cole's 19th-century Hudson River School masterpiece series "The Course of Empire" (1833-1836), which might be the first American paintings warning of the Anthropocene. McGrath has channeled something: maybe spirits, maybe gods, but mostly the anti-artifice of so-called outsider artists, who are plugged into a different frequency. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
'Kanten 観展: The Limits of History'
Through May 20. Apexart, 291 Church Street, Manhattan; 212-431-5270, apexart.org.
Beginning in the late 19th century, Japan amassed an empire that extended far beyond its contemporary borders. It was dismantled after the country's surrender in World War II -- but just because something is over doesn't mean it's forgotten. The exhibition "Kanten 観展: The Limits of History," curated by Eimi Tagore-Erwin, uses the work of eight artists and historical propaganda postcards to trace the scars left by imperial Japan.
In his photo series "Torii," Motoyuki Shitamichi documents Shinto gates that were once installed to mark the empire and now stand in other countries. The pictures show how the gates have been incorporated into their surroundings, becoming mundane but haunting remnants of the past.
Bontaro Dokuyama demonstrates how nationalist legacies live on in people. His video "My Anthem" (2019) features interviews with Taiwanese elders who can still recall the militaristic songs they had to memorize as children in a school choir. Scenes of them wearing uniforms and singing are both funny and sad.
My favorite piece, "Making a Perfect Donut" (2019), leans into humor as a tool for repair. The video features the duo Kyun-Chome trying to bridge the gap between Japanese locals and U.S. military personnel on Okinawa Island. They do so by enlisting people to make Japanese and American doughnuts on either side of a military fence and then put the two together: The small, roundish Japanese doughnut sort of fits, imperfectly, into the American one's hole. Their absurd quest becomes a metaphor for finding human-scale ways to navigate geopolitical complexity. JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Harris Rosenblum
Through May 20, Sara's, 2 East Broadway, third floor, Manhattan; saras.world.
What do preppers, gamers and religionists have in common? Not least, a taste for magical objects. With "Inorganic Demons," the Massachusetts-based artist Harris Rosenblum draws out the overlapping aesthetics of several contemporary subcultures, from primitive survivalists on Instagram to practitioners of the tabletop role-playing game "Warhammer." Laughably big, lumpy anime swords hang from the rafters; thus arrayed, the gallery, an unfinished loft in Chinatown, has the air of a LARPer's treasure room. Weaponry and relics include "Mourning Bracelet (For Hatsune)," 2022, a thin braid of cyan fibers from a manga cosplay wig; and "Knife," a World War II-style blade delicately displayed in a case lined with pink camouflage satin.
These are the accessories of subcultures that, maybe more than most, rely on fantasy. Several sculptures take the form of biblical paraphernalia. There's "The Sacrificial Lamb," a hollow statue patched together from disturbing, spongelike chunks of resin; and "Censer (Mechanical Squonk Mod)" made from PC parts and vaping components -- a peek into the sympathetic cults of customizable smoking and gaming gear. Rosenblum dedicates special attention to materials, the way a splinter of wood or bone proves the lives of the saints. Today, the rites of devout nerds involve PCs and fast internet, nicotine and fast food. In "Earth and New Earth Miku," one Hatsune figurine is 3-D printed, another made of clay from a Wendy's construction site. It takes some imagination to see past the crudeness of the objects to the magnificence of the beliefs they anchor. TRAVIS DIEHL
Marcelo Pombo
Through May 21.‌ ‌ Barro‌, 25 Peck Slip, Manhattan; 646-642-2625, barro.cc‌‌
The Argentine artist Marcelo Pombo is deviant in the best way: He depicts human sexuality as acts of speculation and ingenuity. Barro gallery's "Artisanal Conceptualism: Starting Point" offers the 1980s and '90s work of Pombo, who had fled the Argentine dictatorship for Brazil to avoid conscription in the Falklands War. This is half of the two-part exhibition -- Pombo's "Dibujos de San Pablo" ("The São Paulo Drawings") made in 1982 -- portraying human figures with bird bills or snouts like mice, or sex organs in the place of heads. These figures are engaged in all manner of gazing and wanton bodily exploration. It's utterly refreshing to see sexual relations as pansexual instead of expectedly heteronormative, or even rigidly homosexual. Using animal figures as surrogates, Pombo makes two human-bird hybrid creatures with wet beaks fondling each other ("Untitled 1982") intensely erotic, and curious.
Simultaneously Pombo uses this vocabulary of surrealism to make the terror of that time palpable. He draws a bird-man bleeding in a street from what are likely two bullet wounds, a dog and two witnesses weeping for this loss.
The other half contains everyday objects such as curtains and mosquito nets decorated as if Pombo insisted on recognizing that beauty often holds hands with tragedy. And his drawings of textiles, for example, the one with the knitting needles, "(1) ST," is so realistic I want to touch the paper. And that is the key to this work: the desire to touch and to come to know by touching. SEPH RODNEY
Arthur Dove
Through May 25. Alexandre, 25 East 73rd Street, Manhattan; 212-755-2828, alexandregallery.com.
The unmissable first full survey in a quarter century of the great American modernist painter Arthur Dove (1880--1946) is a swoony, museum-weight exhibition compressed into an Upper East Side gallery the size of a one-bedroom apartment. With 40 works, more than half of them paintings, all on loan from private collections, the show deftly sketches Dove's leaping, jolting career trajectory from Manhattan magazine illustrator, to Paris Impressionist, to fully abstract painter, some say the first such in the United States.
What he was for sure was American Modernism's great visual Transcendentalist. His images of molten rain clouds and God's-eye sunrises are views of the natural world as Thoreau might have seen and, more important, felt it. Dove always said that the meteorology -- the "sensation of light" -- he painted was a personal, intuitive one. And only somewhat more objective were his depictions of forces he saw as threats to that light: images of derricks, freight cars and cinder barges that evoked a spreading plague of industry and pollution.
Dove's art, despite its exultations, is tough and complex, as is clear at a glance through the splendid catalogue raisonné by Debra Bricker Balken. And although his reputation grew steadily in the New York art world, that world wasn't the one he really cared about. For years he lived in a sailboat moored on Long Island. And he spent his last years in a converted one-room former post office, a space probably not much different in size from that in which this gallery survey, one of the best of the season, is installed.

More to See
Man Ray
Through June 2. Di Donna, 744 Madison Avenue, Manhattan; 212-259-0444, didonna.com.
Man Ray portrayed the artists and writers of Paris in the 1920s and '30s as indelibly as Nadar did their 19th-century predecessors. Indeed, Man Ray's deathbed photograph of Marcel Proust makes a fitting bookend to Nadar's of Victor Hugo. But Nadar, when he memorialized France's literary titan in 1885, was himself a venerable Paris institution, while Man Ray, who rushed to Proust's apartment in 1922 at the bidding of Jean Cocteau, was an American who spoke terrible French and had been living in Paris for little over a year.
The marvel of "Man Ray's Paris Portraits, 1921-1939" is his access as well as his artistry. Before relocating, Man Ray had been befriended by Marcel Duchamp and Tristan Tzara, two vanguard artists. They smoothed his Parisian entry, and are among the subjects in this exhibition of 72 vintage prints, mostly drawn from the collection of Timothy Baum, a private art dealer who knew Man Ray in the last years of his life and collaborated on this show.
Man Ray flattered his subjects. To soften wrinkles and other imperfections, he typically shot with a long lens from a distance, and he slightly overexposed the film. Yet his portraits were profoundly revealing: the knowing eyes of the poet Anna de Noailles, the glazed stare of the perennially pickled Sinclair Lewis, the burly forcefulness of a young Alexander Calder. And then there is his self-portrait, taken in his mid-30s -- tie intentionally askew, eyes penetrating, and mouth set in a line of unstoppable determination. ARTHUR LUBOW
Chris Burden
Through June 24. Gagosian, 821 Park Avenue, Manhattan; 212-796-1228, Gagosian.com
There can't be many artists whose works are as textbook-famous and as rarely encountered as Chris Burden's. We can't expect to see repeats of the 1970s performances for which he was nailed to a Volkswagen Beetle or shot in the arm with a .22. He died in 2015, and even when he was living those were one-offs. But this rare Burden show presents other examples of the Angeleno's radical works of the 1970s. They shifted the boundaries of art, which makes them now look safely "artistic" and gallery-worthy.
The show gathers several of the "relics" -- Burden's term -- meant to stand for his performances: An empty display case represents "Disappearing," a piece for which he made himself scarce for three days; a telephone and cassette recorder represent "Wiretap," for which Burden taped calls with art dealers.
There's also footage of Burden's shooting and of "Bed Piece," a well-known performance that had him lying in a gallery for 22 days.
More surprising are the one-minute "TV Commercials" that let Burden infiltrate art into broadcast TV, after buying the ad space required. One of them, "Full Financial Disclosure," sits in Andy Warhol's Business Art genre, revealing the numbers for Burden's 1976 income and expenses -- and for his paltry profit. In "Chris Burden Promo," names of world-famous artists fill the TV one after another: "Leonardo da Vinci," "Michelangelo," "Rembrandt," "Vincent van Gogh," "Pablo Picasso" and then ... "Chris Burden." That final name would once have seemed a joke or wildly wishful thinking, but now it lives cozily with the others. BLAKE GOPNIK
Closed Shows
Pentti Monkkonen
Through May 18. Jenny's, 9 Pell Street, Manhattan; 646-861-1581, jennys.us.
It's been over a decade since New York has seen one of the grand, hyperrealist installations constructed by artists like Mike Nelson, Christoph Büchel, Gregor Schneider or Justin Lowe and Jonah Freeman. These large, psychedelic fun-house affairs functioned like surrealistic movie sets, à la Luis Buñuel or David Lynch, and came with warnings and waivers that visitors had to sign. The Minneapolis-born artist Pentti Monkkonen has created a much smaller but effectively unsettling environment with his new show, "Oscillator."
The setting is a wood-paneled office -- but things are off at the office. The shelving units radiate an icy glow; a giant moth sculpted in epoxy hangs on one wall; an enlarged vintage Visa card, issued to King Kong, on another. Embedded in the fourth wall is an old desktop computer outfitted with a synthesizer that visitors can play, creating their own retro-futuristic soundtrack. "Oscillator" mimics not so much the contemporary minimal office cubicle as a hallucinogenic rendition of a '70s Sidney Lumet movie involving contraband and hostages.
The overall medium here is nostalgia. Some appurtenances are outdated while others, like King Kong, have morphed over decades from movie monster to furry folk hero. The art world is similarly nostalgic: It used to embrace (and fund) epic installations; now we're stuck with immersive Van Gogh or Hieronymus Bosch "experiences" and art fairs. In this sense, "Oscillator" serves almost like a mnemonic device, reminding us not only of pop culture past, but lost art worlds. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Enrique Chagoya
Through May 13. George Adams Gallery, 38 Walker Street, Manhattan; 212-564-8480, georgeadamsgallery.com.
In Enrique Chagoya's painting "Detention at the Border of Language" (2023), three Native American figures in a canoe marked "Border Patrol" appear to be abducting a woman who has the head of Donald Duck. As if with a squeegee, the greenery flanking the scene has been dragged by Chagoya across the still-wet surface, creating a Gerhard-Richteresque visual glitch. The work characteristically mashes up pop and abstract elements with historical sources -- in this case by reworking Charles Ferdinand Wimar's 1853 painting, "The Abduction of Daniel Boone's Daughter by the Indians." This and the 13 other paintings, prints and book works included in "Borderless" provide a potent introduction to the Mexican-born, Californian artist's method of exploding history so as to make collages from the wreckage in a process Chagoya calls "reverse anthropology."
Chagoya's father moonlighted as an artist while working for Mexico's central bank, where his day job involved identifying forged currency. Following this example, Chagoya went on to study economics before turning to art and printmaking. This background informs "The Enlightened Savage Guide to Economic Theory" (2009-2010), in which two golem-like figures battle: one made of oil rigs with the head of Saddam Hussein provided by his portrait from an Iraqi dinar bill, the other made of fighter-jet parts with George Washington's head sourced from a U.S. dollar. Chagoya's best work remains these "codex" formats, where pre-Columbian Mayan and Aztec book traditions nearly obliterated by Spanish Catholic colonizers are hybridized with comic books and steeped in art-historical allusions. Chagoya's good-troublemaking remains ever fresh. JOHN VINCLER
King Cobra
Through May 13. JTT, 390 Broadway, Manhattan; 212-574-8152, jttnyc.com.
The schlock shock attitude of the artist known as King Cobra (a.k.a. Doreen Lynette Garner) announces itself with the ghoulish "Salome's Revenge" (2023): a pink silicone cast of a human head wedged in a deli slicer. So when you come to the tondo layered with rubbery, flesh-like scraps, you know what it's made of. Cobra's previous sculptures have used similar grindhouse techniques to explore the brutal history of medical experimentation on the Black body. Here, the "meat" contains "dirt from J. Marion Sims's grave," damning the man who pioneered gynecology on enslaved Black women, often without anesthesia.
The exhibition, "White Meat," imagines the racial concept of whiteness as a kind of mortadella -- an abstract meat, flecked with nuts and fat. Cobra's metaphorical butchery asks whether abstraction is itself a racial concept. Did white men invent abstract art? Can you abstract an artwork (or a medical "achievement") from the monster who made it?
The show's tour de force is a life-size model of a necrotic shark, patched together with pigmented silicone, beads, hair weave, steel mesh and razor blades (for the teeth), suspended in an open steel frame -- a clear parody of Damien Hirst's formaldehyded blockbuster. Work in a second gallery includes a rope of blond dreadlocks and a giant necklace of white, dreadlocked scalps. Maybe it takes this kind of bloody overstatement to show whiteness its own cruelty. And if there were ever purity in abstract art, Cobra's rough way of working rejects that, too. TRAVIS DIEHL
Peter Shear
Through May 13. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Manhattan; 212-242-7727, cheimread.com.
Peter Shear's little paintings resemble terse, challenging poems. Painting and title resonate in the mind and eye. You decide whether these ricochets hold your interest.
Small size is the only constant here; otherwise, variations in color, suggestion, internal scale and style, prevail. "Same Day" (2021), the show's first painting, isolates a short band of meager, wobbly white lines and two narrow horizontal shapes, midway on the right edge of a dark brown field. It could depict outdoor furniture -- an earlier a center of lively human interaction -- abandoned on a beach as dusk darkens. There's an end-of-summer sadness that's a lot for a painting to sustain, but it does.
Next to it, in "Door to Door" (2022), Shear lavishes loaded brushes of white, blue, brown and green across the surface -- for a bit of forest stream, melting snow or rocky beach. Although an end in itself, this work evokes the painting-study genre and its pleasures. And soon thereafter, "Following Sea" -- which gives the show its title -- is again white on brown but solidly painted -- a suggestion of whitecaps at sea or trailed white garments left on the floor.
The paintings in the show's small first gallery are especially strong. In the two larger spaces that follow, you may find that you're able to resist and argue with more of them -- at least for a while. Shear's next direction may be signaled by the jewel-like, more solidly structured forms of "Match." ROBERTA SMITH
Mamie Tinkler
Through May 13. Ulterior, 424 Broadway, #601, Manhattan. 917-472-7784; ulteriorgallery.com.
I've never seen watercolors quite like Mamie Tinkler's. The still lifes of "A Troubling," her second solo show at Ulterior Gallery, depict densely patterned textiles, unusually tinted feathers, mirrors, skulls, curious rocks, glass globes and crackling flames. All these things shade imperceptibly into patches of saturated color that sometimes read as continuations of the pictures -- as red velvet backdrops, say, or deep black shadows -- and sometimes as a loosening into abstraction. The contrast between exactingly rendered detail and the paint's naturally soft edges is subtle, but it registers as an undertone of tension, even anguish. It's as if Tinkler is using her medium against itself.
This tension struck me as very apropos to a moment when many old certainties are melting away. Things that used to look solid, like science, journalism, the Arctic ice shelf or liberal democracy, are starting to seem more like passing apparitions. But it also says something about perception and knowing. In the show's title piece, a golden finch alights on a twig atop a blue celestial globe. Above it and beside it, as reflections or possibly familiars, two more finches rest on two more globes, their highlights indicated by larger or smaller circles of unpainted white paper. The "real" twig, in front, is loose and fuzzy, like a vision or a dream; the shadow it casts is as crisp as a razor blade. WILL HEINRICH
Helen Lundeberg
Through May 6. Bortolami, 55 Walker Street, Manhattan; 212-727-2050; bortolamigallery.com.
In the 1930s the Angeleno modernist Helen Lundeberg advanced a style referred to as Post-Surrealism, an American splinter movement meant to temper the European version's weirder imagery (but not by much; one of her early efforts includes a wrench plucking a wilted nail out of a crimson pool). By contrast, the ‌10 bracing canvases ‌here share more with the strain of work Lundeberg created contemporaneously as a W.P.A. muralist in Southern California: hard-lined geometric abstraction rendered in plush color delineating domestic zones. But Lundeberg's feel for space wasn't entirely rigid, leaving room for Surrealism's psycho-geography to haunt its corners.
Made between 1952 and 1975, the selection here focuses on bands of vertical color, soft tones dialed up or down the spectrum to achieve an enigmatic interplay of shadow, flatness and depth -- an uncanny sense of spatial perception that collides classicism with the illogical dimensions of de Chirico, his empty arcades shot through with ‌Los Angeles's‌ sepia-smog light.
When Lundeberg's uniform fields are ruptured it's with beguiling effect: punctuated by three-dimensional still lifes, as in two versions of the same arrangement called "The Mirror and Pink Shell." The earlier painting, from 1952, appears to fuzz, its brushwork legible, while the later version, started in the same year but not completed until 1969, stiffens into focus, its fields smoothed and amplified. This vignette -- a simple chair, a mirror reflecting a bare bulb -- was one Lundeberg returned to for over ‌30 years, the contours of her life distilled into the metaphysical plane. MAX LAKIN
Erin Jane Nelson
Through May 6. Chapter NY, 60 Walker Street, Manhattan; 646-850-7486, chapter-ny.com.
Erin Jane Nelson's ceramics seem curiously alive -- not as recognizable creatures, but as biomorphic forms, maybe microorganisms blown up to visible size. Mounted on the wall, they have irregular, curvy shapes and short, spindly tentacles. They're almost always clumped together, in pairs or larger groups, as if each one were dependent on the others for its existence.
If you've seen some of these pieces before, like in Nelson's contribution to the 2021 New Museum Triennial, it may not come as a surprise that her current exhibition, "Sublunary," was inspired by the Okefenokee Swamp. There's a purposeful murkiness to the work of this Atlanta-based artist, who is also a curator and writer. Nelson's creations are rarely one thing or another, but hybrids that thrive in between.
"Sublunary" displays the outgrowths of a private performance Nelson conducted on multiple visits to the Okefenokee. There are quilted silks featuring photographs; a set of 365 glazed stoneware mounds titled, collectively, "Chronomicrobiome" (2023), that could represent a kind of ritualized, abstract calendar and the wall-bound ceramics, which still intrigue me most. They have rims and are covered with a clear layer of waterlike resin, so that looking at them recalls peering into a series of shallow pools.
What's inside? Sculpted mini-mounds, flowers, and fungi; multicolored patterns; and real photographs, sometimes of Nelson. If these complex artworks were alive, I would imagine them as swimming or slinking omnivores, accumulating bits of swamp and traces of Nelson's experiences as they go. JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Sarah Palmer
Through May 6. Mrs., 60-40 56th Drive, Maspeth, Queens; 347-841-6149, mrsgallery.com.
Photography was well on track to becoming Image Producer of the millennium -- then came smartphones. Now we are so inundated with images artists have to work like archivists to wade through the morass. Sarah Palmer, a Brooklyn-based artist, does this, using images from old catalogs, New York Public Library archives, slides bought on eBay and A.I.-generated images to create photomontages. The curious and uncanny results are on view in "The Delirious Sun" at Mrs.
Recycling and repurposing are essentially the subject of the work, immediately obvious in the jumble and juxtaposition of image fragments. But Palmer teases out some through lines, like how the female body is represented in photography. In "Age of Earth and Us All Chattering" (2022), an assemblage tinted an eerie orange, photos clipped from a vintage bondage catalog sit alongside an A.I. representation of a bouncy blonde. The bondage magazine images are attached with hot pink tape to a landscape photograph of the American West taken by Palmer, and rephotographed. "Under the Tangled Forest" (2023) visually rhymes human hair, tape and ribbons; other works feature a sculpture of a female torso and close-ups of the artist's pregnant belly.
Palmer scrambles the codes of photography that tell us what, when and why an image was produced -- which is what A.I. does too. However, by putting her own body in the image, Palmer reminds us that making, crafting and contemplating photographs remain a deeply human and embodied enterprise, even at a moment when machines, once again, seem to be taking over. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Michael Ray Charles
Through May 6. Templon, 293 10th Avenue, Manhattan. 212-922-3745; templon.com.
In the 1990s and early 2000s, Michael Ray Charles's paintings excavated the ugly history of antebellum minstrelsy with nervy appropriations of ubiquitous racist imagery -- the grotesque faces and rictus grins of Sambos and mammy figures -- and not always to appreciative reception. He was accused of perpetuating painful stereotypes when many people would have preferred they remain buried. For the last 20 years he has shown sporadically, mostly in Europe.
The pictures in Charles's first New York exhibition since then finds an artist still surfacing that past, but with a slicker veneer. Where the demeaning depictions of minstrel performance and advertising were replicated at confrontational scale, unblinking in their harshness, here their bitter taste is blended into ornament. The shining obsidian bust in "(Forever Free) Veni Vidi" (2002) sits in a richly appointed Baroque interior, a recognition of the ways racism smooths itself into the background of modern life.
These are contextually complex paintings, incorporating ideas about performance (of gender, race, sexuality) and the theatricality of identity. Blackface caricatures still haunt the canvases, but they're flattened à la wheatpaste street art and spliced onto burlesque dancers and dominatrixes. The figures are often half-formed -- Black faces grafted onto white bodies missing limbs or segments of torso, obscured by gimp masks or African ones studded with cowrie shells, performing in circuses and masquerades -- a dizzying cascade of historical references that reveals the nightmare of our insatiable need for extravaganza. The metaphors can get tangled, but Charles's equation of American racism with entertainment is hard to shake, a sadomasochistic relationship dependent equally on pain and pleasure. MAX LAKIN

Electric Work Vans Find Eager Buyers: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Passenger cars dominate the electric vehicle market, but light delivery trucks could benefit from the cost savings and range E.V.s offer.
Not long after buying a Ford E-Transit van for his plumbing business last November, Mitch Smedley sat down with some receipts and a calculator to figure out how much the electric vehicle was saving him on fuel expenses.
A few minutes of number crunching showed he was spending about $ 110 to $ 140 a week on fuel for each of the four older, diesel Transits in his fleet. Then he worked out how much electricity he was using to charge the electric model to drive the same distance -- about 300 miles a week. The cost: about $ 9 a week.
"I knew there was going to be some savings because our electricity here is very inexpensive," said Mr. Smedley, whose business is based in Blue Springs, Mo., just east of Kansas City. "But I was amazed when I worked it out. It makes it really, really cheap to operate."
In the auto industry's transition to electric vehicles, passenger vehicles have led the way. In the first quarter of 2023, sales of E.V.s were up 45 percent from a year earlier, to 259,000 cars and trucks, according to Cox Automotive, a research firm. Tesla remains the largest seller by far, while General Motors, Ford Motor, Hyundai, Volkswagen and others are selling multiple electric models. Cox expects the annual E.V. sales total in the U.S. market to top one million this year for the first time.
So far, commercial light vehicles are a small proportion of all electric cars and trucks sold, but in many ways battery-powered vehicles are well suited for work fleets. Since trucks and delivery vans often travel limited distances or established routes each day, they don't need large and expensive battery packs. Most can get by with enough energy to travel about 100 miles before they need a recharge.
One factor that makes electric cars significantly more expensive than internal combustion models is that consumers want the ability to travel 250 or 300 miles on a single charge because they fear being stranded far from any place to plug in. Commercial vehicles are typically parked overnight in lots where they can be easily charged and ready to go with a full battery in the morning.
Electric trucks also require less maintenance than traditional vehicles. They don't need oil changes and have no transmissions, mufflers or fuel pumps that can wear out or break down. And they don't burn fuel when idling.
More so than consumers, commercial fleet owners look closely at the total cost of owning and operating vehicles over several years. That means they are often willing to accept a higher initial price to buy an electric truck to save money over time through lower fuel and maintenance costs.
Yet commercial E.V.s have had a slower start in sales, in part because of the troubles of several companies that had hoped to make them. Start-ups like Lordstown Motors, Arrival and Canoo have struggled to start or ramp up production, as has Workhorse, a small manufacturer of commercial trucks. Rivian, a start-up backed by Amazon, had hoped to sell thousands of electric vans to the online retailer by now but has fallen far short of its goals.
The delays created an opening for Ford and G.M., two of the country's largest automakers, to bring out their own battery-powered work trucks. The E-Transit, a derivative of Ford's Transit commercial van, is available in various sizes and can be used as a delivery van, a shuttle bus, or a work truck for contractors, repairmen, plumbers and other small businesses.
Ford sold about 6,500 E-Transits last year. In March, the United States Postal Service ordered 9,250 E-Transits that are supposed to go into service by the end of 2024.
G.M. created an independent division, BrightDrop, to make a larger vehicle tailored for package and cargo delivery. BrightDrop produced a test fleet of about 500 battery-powered vans that were delivered to customers in 2022, and started commercial production of its Zevo 600 model at a plant in Ontario this year.
Along with the truck, BrightDrop has developed an electric cart to enable drivers to haul many packages from the truck, reducing the number of trips the driver makes back and forth. One version of the cart is refrigerated for deliveries of produce and groceries.
In Hooksett, N.H., Merchants Fleet, a company that manages vehicles used by delivery services, has been using 150 BrightDrop vans over the past year, and is eager to add more.
Brad Jacobs, the company's vice president for fleet consulting, said the depreciation cost and the cost of interest on the capital used to buy electric vans were roughly the same as for combustion engine trucks.
"What we've learned from the vehicles on the road is that you save anywhere from $ 10,000 to $ 12,000 a year because the cost of fuel and maintenance is so much lower with electric vehicles," he said. "If a company is planning on service life of five years, that's a savings of $ 50,000 per vehicle. That's very compelling."
Merchants Fleet has orders for 750 more BrightDrop trucks and reservations on an additional 17,000, Mr. Jacobs said.
Large delivery companies have been clamoring for electric trucks for years. Amazon hopes to buy as many as 100,000 vans from Rivian, and is considering an electric Ram ProMaster van that Chrysler's parent company, Stellantis, is supposed to start making this year.
UPS has ordered 10,000 electric vans from Arrival, a start-up company based in Luxembourg that has operations in Britain. Arrival has suffered financial troubles and production delays. FedEx, plans to buy only battery-powered vans starting in 2030, and hopes to operate an all-electric fleet by 2040. It has been testing 150 BrightDrop trucks, is taking delivery on 350 more and has reservations for an additional 2,000.
Nelson Granados, a FedEx delivery driver in Inglewood, Calif., has been using a BrightDrop vehicle for the past year, a white van with the orange-and-purple FedEx logo next to a picture of a bright green plug and electric cord.
Mr. Granados gives the truck a thumbs-up. The truck has comforts the diesel vans lack like a stereo and heated seats, as well as a lower floor that makes entering and leaving easier.
"You're getting in and out all day, so it pays off," Mr. Granados said. "It's like a luxury delivery truck."
Mr. Smedley, the plumber in the Kansas City area, has noticed benefits from his E-Transit besides fuel savings. At job sites, the truck can power equipment like drain-cleaning machines, eliminating the need to lug around a generator. He began taking the van to Kansas City Chiefs football games -- he has season tickets -- so he can use its electric outlets for tailgating parties. The truck also secures him premium parking in the spots at Arrowhead Stadium reserved for electric vehicles.
This year, Mr. Smedley decided to add a second electric model to his fleet, a Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck. He has also continued tracking the savings he's reaping from the E-Transit.
"When I look at the cost over five years," he said with a laugh, "it's almost like getting a free van."

Full text: Extreme weather linked to climate change is causing more blackouts. But generators and batteries are still out of reach for many.
When frigid weather caused rolling blackouts on Christmas Eve across North Carolina, Eliana and David Mundula quickly grew worried about their 2½-week-old daughter, whom they had brought home days earlier from a neonatal intensive care unit.
"The temperature was dropping in the house," said Ms. Mundula, who lives in Matthews, south of Charlotte. "I became angry."
But her husband pulled out a small gasoline generator a neighbor had convinced them to buy a couple of years earlier, allowing them to use a portable heater and restart their refrigerator, keeping them going for much of the five-hour outage.
North of Charlotte, in the town of Cornelius, Gladys Henderson, an 80-year-old former cafeteria worker, was less fortunate. She did not have a generator and resorted to candles, a flashlight and an old kerosene heater to get through a different recent outage.
"I lose power just about all the time," Ms. Henderson said. "Sometimes it goes off and just stays off."
Ms. Henderson is on the losing end of a new energy divide that is leaving millions of people dangerously exposed to the heat and cold.
As climate change increases the severity of heat waves, cold spells and other extreme weather, blackouts are becoming more common. In the 11 years to 2021, there were 986 weather-related power outages in the United States, nearly twice as many as in the previous 11 years, according to government data analyzed by Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists. The average U.S. electric utility customer lost power for nearly eight hours in 2021, according to the Energy Information Administration, more than twice as long as in 2013, the earliest year for which that data is available.
Outages are becoming so common that generators and other backup power devices are seen by some as essential. But many people like Ms. Henderson cannot afford generators or the fuel on which they run. Even after strong sales in recent years, Generac, the leading seller of home generators, estimates that fewer than 6 percent of U.S. homes have a standby generator.
Energy experts warn that power outages will become more common because of extreme weather linked to climate change. And those blackouts will hurt more people as Americans buy electric heat pumps and battery-powered cars to replace furnaces and vehicles that burn fossil fuels -- a shift essential to limiting climate change.
"The grids will be more vulnerable," said Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California and an expert in disaster response. "That furthers the divide between the haves and the have-nots."
The old, the frail and people who live in homes that are not well protected or insulated are most vulnerable, along with those who rely on electrically powered medical equipment or take medications that need to be refrigerated.
Power outages make heat, already a major cause of avoidable deaths, even more of a threat, said Brian Stone Jr., a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He has done research estimating how many people in Atlanta, Detroit and Phoenix would be exposed to extreme temperatures during power outages.
"A concurrent event where you have an extensive blackout during a heat wave is the most deadly type of climate threat we can imagine," he said, noting that the cooling centers in those cities would be able to house only a fraction of the people at greatest risk.
Ashley Ward, a senior policy associate at Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability, has studied how heat affects communities in North Carolina. Her research indicates that high temperatures cause more preterm births. She said that even healthy people who work in high temperatures often suffer heat-related illnesses, particularly if they cannot cool their homes overnight. "A power outage," she said, "is, in many cases, a catastrophic event."
The most recent power crisis in North Carolina, the one on Christmas Eve, occurred when the temperature fell to 9 degrees Fahrenheit in the Charlotte area.
The state's primary utility, Duke Energy, began cutting power to customers to ensure the grid kept operating after power plants failed and customers cranked up the heat in their homes. About 500,000 homes, or 15 percent of the company's customers, lost power in North and South Carolina, the first time the utility used rolling blackouts in the Carolinas.
The Mundulas had been through other weather-related power outages since moving into their suburban home. After renting generators during previous outages, the couple spent $ 650 to buy one in August 2020 to keep parts of their four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom house powered. A chorus of engines typically fills their neighborhood when the power fails. "It's just the hum of the generators," Ms. Mundula said, adding that she never heard generators in the lower-income neighborhood of Greensboro where she grew up.
The couple has considered bigger systems like solar with a battery, but those options would cost a lot.
Ms. Henderson, the retired cafeteria worker, lives alone in her three-bedroom home. She relies on family, friends and community groups to help her maintain the house, which gets its electricity from a community-owned utility. Frequent power outages are one of several problems in her historically African American neighborhood, which also floods frequently.
Developers have offered to buy her home, but Ms. Henderson wants to stay put, having lived there for 50 years.
"My problem really is the electrical problem," Ms. Henderson said. "It's very scary."
Duke said it was aware of the risks people like Ms. Henderson faced. The company tracks recurring outages in vulnerable communities to determine if it should bury power lines to reduce the likelihood of blackouts. The company is also developing and testing strategies to ease the strain on the grid when energy demand exceeds supply. Those approaches include having electric cars send power to the grid and installing smart devices that can turn off appliances, reducing energy use.
"So when an extreme weather event hits, we have a grid that can withstand it or quickly recover," said Lon Huber, a senior vice president for customer solutions at Duke Energy.
Other threats to the grid are harder to protect against.
In early December, somebody shot and damaged two Duke substations in Carthage, roughly 90 miles east of Charlotte, cutting off power to thousands of homes for several days. The emergency services received panicked calls from people whose oxygen machines had stopped working, requiring someone to visit those homes and set up pressurized canisters that don't require power, said the town's fire chief, Brian Tyner.
The chief's home doesn't have backup power, either, and he estimates that two-thirds of homes in the area do not have generators. "We couldn't ever justify the price," he said.
Backup power systems can be as small as portable gasoline generators that can cost $ 500 or less. Often found at construction sites and campgrounds, these devices can power only a few devices at a time. Whole-home systems fueled with propane, natural gas or diesel can provide power for days as long as there is fuel available, but these generators start at around $ 10,000, including installation, and can cost much more for bigger homes.
Solar panels paired with batteries can provide emissions-free power, but they cost tens of thousands of dollars and typically cannot provide enough to run big appliances and heat pumps for more than a few hours. Those systems are also less reliable during cloudy, rainy or snowy days when there isn't enough sunlight to fully recharge batteries.
Some homeowners who are eager to cut their carbon emissions, reduce their electric bills and gain independence from the electric grid have combined various energy systems, often at a substantial cost.
Annie Dudley, a statistician from Chapel Hill, N.C., slashed her energy consumption a few years ago. She installed a geothermal system, which uses the earth's steady temperature to help heat and cool her home, replacing an aging system that came with the house. She later added 35 solar panels on her roof and two Tesla home batteries, which can provide enough power to meet most of her needs, including charging an electric Volkswagen Golf.
"The neighborhood has lost power a whole lot, but I have not," Ms. Dudley said.
She spent about $ 52,000 on her solar panels and batteries, but $ 21,600 of that cost was defrayed by rebates and tax credits. Ms. Dudley estimates that her utility bills are about $ 2,300 a year lower because of that investment and her geothermal system.
Generator companies believe that growing electricity usage and the threat of outages will keep demand high for their products.
Last year, Generac had $ 2.8 billion in sales to U.S. homeowners, 250 percent more than in 2017. In recent years, many people bought generators to ensure outages would not interrupt their ability to work from home, said Aaron Jagdfeld, the chief executive of Generac, which is based in Waukesha, Wis. Many people also bought generators because of severe weather, including an extreme heat wave in 2021 in the Pacific Northwest, and winter storm Uri, which caused days of blackouts in Texas and killed an estimated 246 people.
"People are thinking about this," Mr. Jagdfeld said, "in the context of the broader changes in climate and how that may be impacting not only the reliability of power but the things that they need that power provides."

Panasonic Plans to Delay Making a Battery for Tesla
Panasonic said on Wednesday that it would delay the commercial production of its 4680 battery cells until next year as the company aims to improve their performance.
Panasonic, which will provide the battery to Tesla, had previously planned to start volume production as early as last month.
Panasonic is running a pilot 4680 production line at its Wakayama factory in Japan, while Tesla is already producing the 4680 battery cells, which its chief, Elon Musk, has touted as being key to making cheaper and compelling electric cars. But the carmaker struggled to meet its targets for production and performance of the cells.
Tesla's South Korean supplier LG Energy Solution said last month that it planned to set up a new 4680 production line at its domestic factory by the end of this year, but did not say when the batteries would start volume production. REUTERS
LABOR PRACTICES
VW Shareholder Meeting Is Disrupted by Protests
Volkswagen's annual shareholder meeting was briefly disrupted Wednesday by protests over the company's factory in China's Xinjiang province, with a shouting, topless activist interrupting the speech by the chief executive, Oliver Blume, before she was hustled away by security personnel.
Additionally a cakelike object was thrown during a speech by the board chairman, Hans-Dieter Poetsch, apparently in the direction of another board member, Wolfgang Porsche, who represents his family's shareholding in the company.
Photos showed a white, gooey substance resembling pastry stuck to the front of the dais behind which Mr. Porsche was sitting.
Volkswagen has said that it has found no evidence of human rights violations at its Xinjiang plant. The Chinese government has been accused of human rights abuses against its Muslim Uyghur population, including forced labor in detention camps. The U.S. State Department has described China's actions in the region as genocide. ASSOCIATED PRESS
CLIMATE LITIGATION
Greenpeace Suit Targets Italian Energy Company
Greenpeace and an environmental coalition including 12 Italian citizens are suing the Italian energy company ENI, accusing it of knowingly contributing to climate change.
The complaint names ENI and its two biggest shareholders, the Italian Economy Ministry and the Italian state lender and public investment bank, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. It is seeking past and future damages as a result of "climate change to which ENI has significantly contributed by its conduct in recent decades, while being aware of it," according to a statement from Greenpeace Italy.
In a statement, ENI said it would demonstrate in court the "groundlessness" of the lawsuit and the "correctness" of its decarbonization strategy, which it said balanced sustainability, energy security and competitiveness.
ENI said it would consider legal action on its own against one of the plaintiffs, ReCommon, claiming defamation. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Norway Blazes Trail to an Electric Vehicle Future: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: BAMBLE, Norway -- About 110 miles south of Oslo, along a highway lined with pine and birch trees, a shiny fueling station offers a glimpse of a future where electric vehicles rule.
Chargers far outnumber gasoline pumps at the service area operated by Circle K, a retail chain that got its start in Texas. During summer weekends, when Oslo residents flee to country cottages, the line to recharge sometimes backs up down the off-ramp.
Marit Bergsland, who works at the store, has had to learn how to help frustrated customers connect to chargers in addition to her regular duties flipping burgers and ringing up purchases of salty licorice, a popular treat.
"Sometimes we have to give them a coffee to calm down," she said.
Last year, 80 percent of new-car sales in Norway were electric, putting the country at the vanguard of the shift to battery-powered mobility. It has also turned Norway into an observatory for figuring out what the electric vehicle revolution might mean for the environment, workers and life in general. The country will end the sales of internal combustion engine cars in 2025.
Norway's experience suggests that electric vehicles bring benefits without the dire consequences predicted by some critics. There are problems, of course, including unreliable chargers and long waits during periods of high demand. Auto dealers and retailers have had to adapt. The switch has reordered the auto industry, making Tesla the best-selling brand and marginalizing established carmakers like Renault and Fiat.
But the air in Oslo, Norway's capital, is measurably cleaner. The city is also quieter as noisier gasoline and diesel vehicles are scrapped. Oslo's greenhouse gas emissions have fallen 30 percent since 2009, yet there has not been mass unemployment among gas station workers and the electrical grid has not collapsed.
Some lawmakers and corporate executives portray the fight against climate change as requiring grim sacrifice. "With E.V.s, it's not like that," said Christina Bu, secretary general of the Norwegian E.V. Association, which represents owners. "It's actually something that people embrace."
Norway began promoting electric vehicles in the 1990s to support Think, a homegrown electric vehicle start-up that Ford Motor owned for a few years. Battery-powered vehicles were exempted from value-added and import taxes and from highway tolls.
The government also subsidized the construction of fast charging stations, crucial in a country nearly as big as California with just 5.5 million people. The combination of incentives and ubiquitous charging "took away all the friction factors," said Jim Rowan, the chief executive of Volvo Cars, based in neighboring Sweden.
The policies put Norway more than a decade ahead of the United States. The Biden administration aims for 50 percent of new-vehicle sales to be electric by 2030, a milestone Norway passed in 2019.
A few feet from a six-lane highway that skirts Oslo's waterfront, metal pipes jut from the roof of a prefabricated shed. The building measures pollution from the traffic zooming by, a stone's throw from a bicycle path and a marina.
Levels of nitrogen oxides, byproducts of burning gasoline and diesel that cause smog, asthma and other ailments, have fallen sharply as electric vehicle ownership has risen. "We are on the verge of solving the NOx problem," said Tobias Wolf, Oslo's chief engineer for air quality, referring to nitrogen oxides.
But there is still a problem where the rubber meets the road. Oslo's air has unhealthy levels of microscopic particles generated partly by the abrasion of tires and asphalt. Electric vehicles, which account for about one-third of the registered vehicles in the city but a higher proportion of traffic, may even aggravate that problem.
"They're really a lot heavier than internal combustion engine cars, and that means that they are causing more abrasion," said Mr. Wolf, who, like many Oslo residents, prefers to get around by bicycle.
Another persistent problem: Apartment residents say finding a place to plug in their cars remains a challenge. In the basement of an Oslo restaurant recently, local lawmakers and residents gathered to discuss the issue.
Sirin Hellvin Stav, Oslo's vice mayor for environment and transport, said at the event that the city wants to install more public chargers but also reduce the number of cars by a third to make streets safer and free space for walking and cycling.
"The goal is to cut emissions, which is why E.V.s are so important, but also to make the city better to live in," Ms. Stav, a member of the Green Party, said in an interview later.
Electric vehicles are part of a broader plan by Oslo to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to almost zero by 2030. All city buses will be electric by the end of the year.
Oslo is also targeting construction, the source of more than a quarter of its greenhouse gas emissions. Contractors bidding on public projects have a better chance of winning if they use equipment that runs on electricity or biofuels.
At a park in a working-class Oslo neighborhood last month, an excavator scooped out earth for a decorative pond. A thick cable connected the excavator to a power source, driving its electric motor. Later, an electric dump truck hauled away the soil.
Normally, the crew would have been required to stop working when the children in a nearby kindergarten napped. But the electric equipment was quiet enough that work could continue. (Children in Norway nap outdoors, weather permitting.)
Espen Hauge, who manages city construction projects, said he was surprised at how quickly contractors substituted hard-to-find electric equipment for diesel machinery. "Some projects that we thought were impossible or very difficult to do zero emission, we still got the tender for zero emission," he said.
Ms. Stav acknowledged what she called the hypocrisy of Norway's drive to reduce greenhouse gases while producing lots of oil and gas. Fossil-fuel exports generated revenue of $ 180 billion last year. "We're exporting that pollution," Ms. Stav said, noting that her party has called for oil and gas production to be phased out by 2035.
But Norway's government has not pulled back on oil and gas production. "We have several fields in production, or under development, providing energy security to Europe," Amund Vik, state secretary in the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, said in a statement.
Elsewhere, Norway's power grid has held up fine even with more demand for electricity. It helps that the country has abundant hydropower. Even so, electric vehicles have increased the demand for electricity modestly, according to calculations by the E.V. Association, and most owners are charging cars at night, when demand is lower and power is cheaper.
Elvia, which supplies electricity to Oslo and the surrounding area, has had to install new substations and transformers in some places, said Anne Nysæther, the company's managing director. But, she added, "we haven't seen any issue of the grid collapsing."
Nor has there been a rise in unemployment among auto mechanics. Electric vehicles don't need oil changes and require less maintenance than gasoline cars, but they still break down. And there are plenty of gasoline cars that will need maintenance for years.
Sindre Dranberg, who has worked at a Volkswagen dealership in Oslo since the 1980s, underwent training to service electric-vehicle batteries. Was it difficult to make the switch? "No," he said, as he replaced defective cells in a Volkswagen e-Golf.
Electric vehicles are creating jobs in other industries. In Fredrikstad, 55 miles south of Oslo, a former steel plant has become a battery recycling center. Workers, including some who worked at the steel plant, dismantle battery packs. A machine then shreds the packs to separate plastic, aluminum and copper from a black mass that contains crucial ingredients such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and graphite.
The factory, owned by Hydrovolt, is the first of several the company plans to build in Europe and the United States. So far, there is not much to recycle, but eventually recycled batteries could greatly reduce the need for mining.
"If we can take the active material that already is within the product and create new ones, then we create a shortcut," said Peter Qvarfordt, the chief executive of Hydrovolt, a joint venture of the aluminum producer Norsk Hydro and Northvolt, a battery maker.
If anyone has to worry about their jobs, it's car dealers. The almost complete disappearance of gasoline and diesel vehicles from showrooms has reordered the industry.
The Moller Mobility Group has long been Norway's biggest auto retailer, with sales last year of $ 3.7 billion and dealerships in Sweden and the Baltic countries. Moller's Oslo outlet is filled with electric Volkswagens like the ID.4 and the ID.Buzz. There are only a few internal combustion cars.
Yet, Tesla is greatly outselling Volkswagen in Norway, grabbing 30 percent of the market compared to 19 percent for Volkswagen and its Skoda and Audi brands, according to the Road Information Council.
Sales of electric cars from Chinese companies like BYD and Xpeng are also growing. If that pattern repeats itself elsewhere in Europe and in the United States, some established carmakers might not survive.
Petter Hellman, the chief executive of Moller Mobility, predicted that traditional brands would regain ground because customers trust them and they have extensive service networks. "But clearly," he added, "Tesla has shaken the industry."
Circle K, which bought gas stations that had belonged to a Norwegian government-owned oil company, is using the country to learn how to serve electric car owners in the United States and Europe. The chain, now owned by Alimentation Couche-Tard, a company based near Montreal, has more than 9,000 stores in North America.
Guro Stordal, a Circle K executive, has the difficult task of developing charging infrastructure that works with dozens of vehicle brands, each with its own software.
Electric vehicle owners tend to spend more time at Circle K because charging takes longer than filling a gasoline tank. That's good for food sales. But gasoline remains an important source of revenue.
"We do see it as an opportunity," Hakon Stiksrud, Circle K's head of global e-mobility, said of electric vehicles. "But if we are not capable of grasping those opportunities, it quickly becomes a threat."

Electric vehicles, which account for about one-third of the registered vehicles in the city but a higher proportion of traffic, may even aggravate that problem.
“They’re really a lot heavier than internal combustion engine cars, and that means that they are causing more abrasion,” said Wolf, who, like many Oslo residents, prefers to get around by bicycle.
Another persistent problem: Apartment residents say finding a place to plug in their cars remains a challenge. In the basement of an Oslo restaurant recently, local lawmakers and residents gathered to discuss the issue.
Sirin Hellvin Stav, Oslo’s vice mayor for environment and transport, said at the event that the city wants to install more public chargers but also reduce the number of cars by one-third to make streets safer and free space for walking and cycling.
“The goal is to cut emissions, which is why EVs are so important, but also to make the city better to live in,” Stav, a member of the Green Party, said in an interview later.
Electric vehicles are part of a broader plan by Oslo to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to almost zero by 2030. All city buses will be electric by the end of the year.
Oslo is also targeting construction, the source of more than one-quarter of its greenhouse gas emissions. Contractors bidding on public projects have a better chance of winning if they use equipment that runs on electricity or biofuels.
At a park in a working-class Oslo neighborhood last month, an excavator scooped out earth for a decorative pond. A thick cable connected the excavator to a power source, driving its electric motor. Later, an electric dump truck hauled away the soil.
Normally, the crew would have been required to stop working when the children in a nearby kindergarten napped. But the electric equipment was quiet enough that work could continue. (Children in Norway nap outdoors, weather permitting.)
Espen Hauge, who manages city construction projects, said he was surprised at how quickly contractors substituted hard-to-find electric equipment for diesel machinery. “Some projects that we thought were impossible or very difficult to do zero emission, we still got the tender for zero emission,” he said.
Stav acknowledged what she called the hypocrisy of Norway’s drive to reduce greenhouse gases while producing lots of oil and gas. Fossil-fuel exports generated revenue of $180 billion last year. “We’re exporting that pollution,” Stav said, noting that her party has called for oil and gas production to be phased out by 2035.
But Norway’s government has not pulled back on oil and gas production. “We have several fields in production, or under development, providing energy security to Europe,” Amund Vik, state secretary in the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, said in a statement.
Elsewhere, Norway’s power grid has held up fine even with more demand for electricity. It helps that the country has abundant hydropower. Even so, electric vehicles have increased the demand for electricity modestly, according to calculations by the EV Association, and most owners are charging cars at night, when demand is lower and power is cheaper.
Elvia, which supplies electricity to Oslo and the surrounding area, has had to install new substations and transformers in some places, said Anne Nysæther, the company’s managing director. But, she added, “we haven’t seen any issue of the grid collapsing .”
Nor has there been a rise in unemployment among auto mechanics. Electric vehicles don't need oil changes and require less maintenance than gasoline cars, but they still break down. And there are plenty of gasoline cars that will need maintenance for years.
Sindre Dranberg, who has worked at a Volkswagen dealership in Oslo since the 1980s, underwent training to service electric-vehicle batteries. Was it difficult to make the switch? “No,” he said, as he replaced defective cells in a Volkswagen e-Golf.
Electric vehicles are creating jobs in other industries. In Fredrikstad, 55 miles south of Oslo, a former steel plant has become a battery recycling center. Workers, including some who worked at the steel plant, dismantle battery packs. A machine then shreds the packs to separate plastic, aluminum and copper from a black mass that contains crucial ingredients such as lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and graphite.
The factory, owned by Hydrovolt, is the first of several the company plans to build in Europe and the United States. So far, there is not much to recycle, but eventually recycled batteries could greatly reduce the need for mining.
“If we can take the active material that already is within the product and create new ones, then we create a shortcut,” said Peter Qvarfordt, the CEO of Hydrovolt, a joint venture of the aluminum producer Norsk Hydro and Northvolt, a battery maker.
If anyone has to worry about their jobs, it’s car dealers. The almost complete disappearance of gasoline and diesel vehicles from showrooms has reordered the industry.
The Moller Mobility Group has long been Norway’s biggest auto retailer, with sales last year of $3.7 billion and dealerships in Sweden and the Baltic countries. Moller’s Oslo outlet is filled with electric Volkswagens like the ID.4 and the ID.Buzz. There are only a few internal combustion cars.
Yet, Tesla is greatly outselling Volkswagen in Norway, grabbing 30% of the market compared with 19% for Volkswagen and its Skoda and Audi brands, according to the Road Information Council.
Sales of electric cars from Chinese companies like BYD and Xpeng are also growing. If that pattern repeats itself elsewhere in Europe and in the United States, some established carmakers might not survive.
Petter Hellman, the CEO of Moller Mobility, predicted that traditional brands would regain ground because customers trust them and they have extensive service networks. “But clearly,” he added, “Tesla has shaken the industry.”
Circle K, which bought gas stations that had belonged to a Norwegian government-owned oil company, is using the country to learn how to serve electric car owners in the United States and Europe. The chain, now owned by Alimentation Couche-Tard, a company based near Montreal, has more than 9,000 stores in North America.
Guro Stordal, a Circle K executive, has the difficult task of developing charging infrastructure that works with dozens of vehicle brands, each with its own software.
Electric vehicle owners tend to spend more time at Circle K because charging takes longer than filling a gasoline tank. That’s good for food sales. But gasoline remains an important source of revenue.
“We do see it as an opportunity,” Hakon Stiksrud, Circle K's head of global e-mobility, said of electric vehicles. “But if we are not capable of grasping those opportunities, it quickly becomes a threat.”

Newly Reviewed
Peter Shear
Through May 13. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Manhattan; 212-242-7727, cheimread.com.
Peter Shear's little paintings resemble terse, challenging poems. Painting and title resonate in the mind and eye. You decide whether these ricochets hold your interest.
Small size is the only constant here; otherwise, variations in color, suggestion, internal scale and style, prevail. "Same Day" (2021), the show's first painting, isolates a short band of meager, wobbly white lines and two narrow horizontal shapes, midway on the right edge of a dark brown field. It could depict outdoor furniture -- an earlier a center of lively human interaction -- abandoned on a beach as dusk darkens. There's an end-of-summer sadness that's a lot for a painting to sustain, but it does.
Next to it, in "Door to Door" (2022), Shear lavishes loaded brushes of white, blue, brown and green across the surface -- for a bit of forest stream, melting snow or rocky beach. Although an end in itself, this work evokes the painting-study genre and its pleasures. And soon thereafter, "Following Sea" -- which gives the show its title -- is again white on brown but solidly painted -- a suggestion of whitecaps at sea or trailed white garments left on the floor.
The paintings in the show's small first gallery are especially strong. In the two larger spaces that follow, you may find that you're able to resist and argue with more of them -- at least for a while. Shear's next direction may be signaled by the jewel-like, more solidly structured forms of "Match." ROBERTA SMITH
Michael McGrath
Through May 19. Crossing Art, 559 West 23rd Street, Manhattan, 212-359-4333, crossingart.com.
The artist Michael McGrath, who is based in Rhinebeck, in the Hudson Valley, paints what might be called the emoji landscape: screaming flowers; surprised-looking insects and trees. Scattered, wallpaper-like, across canvases whose titles nod to gods, witches and seasonal magic spells, his show "Moon Riot" at Crossing Art thrums with laid-back spiritualist energy.
McGrath's work took a radical turn a couple of years ago. (I discovered him on Instagram.) He was painting pleasingly anodyne landscapes and dark figures in the vein of Edvard Munch, and suddenly his work exploded with Day-Glo color and singing plants, unmoored in their compositions. Rather than serious or apocalyptic, his work is warm and funny, like folk art or children's drawings, and complemented by titles like "Intro to Hunting Gods," "Spring Training for Witches," "Redesigning Ghost Systems" and "Weekend Conference for Moons and Tiny Vampires."
The show includes a few missteps: It's overhung, and I could live without the fake-fur yeti figures that feel more like theme park mascots than sculpture. McGrath's work is refreshing, though, because it materializes the wonder of walking in the woods and a deeper sense that the world, minus humans, will be OK; everything regenerates, as it does in Thomas Cole's 19th-century Hudson River School masterpiece series "The Course of Empire" (1833-1836), which might be the first American paintings warning of the Anthropocene. McGrath has channeled something: maybe spirits, maybe gods, but mostly the anti-artifice of so-called outsider artists, who are plugged into a different frequency. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Enrique Chagoya
Through May 13. George Adams Gallery, 38 Walker Street, Manhattan; 212-564-8480, georgeadamsgallery.com.
In Enrique Chagoya's painting "Detention at the Border of Language" (2023), three Native American figures in a canoe marked "Border Patrol" appear to be abducting a woman who has the head of Donald Duck. As if with a squeegee, the greenery flanking the scene has been dragged by Chagoya across the still-wet surface, creating a Gerhard-Richteresque visual glitch. The work characteristically mashes up pop and abstract elements with historical sources -- in this case by reworking Charles Ferdinand Wimar's 1853 painting, "The Abduction of Daniel Boone's Daughter by the Indians." This and the 13 other paintings, prints and book works included in "Borderless" provide a potent introduction to the Mexican-born, Californian artist's method of exploding history so as to make collages from the wreckage in a process Chagoya calls "reverse anthropology."
Chagoya's father moonlighted as an artist while working for Mexico's central bank, where his day job involved identifying forged currency. Following this example, Chagoya went on to study economics before turning to art and printmaking. This background informs "The Enlightened Savage Guide to Economic Theory" (2009-2010), in which two golem-like figures battle: one made of oil rigs with the head of Saddam Hussein provided by his portrait from an Iraqi dinar bill, the other made of fighter-jet parts with George Washington's head sourced from a U.S. dollar. Chagoya's best work remains these "codex" formats, where pre-Columbian Mayan and Aztec book traditions nearly obliterated by Spanish Catholic colonizers are hybridized with comic books and steeped in art-historical allusions. Chagoya's good-troublemaking remains ever fresh. JOHN VINCLER
King Cobra
Through May 13. JTT, 390 Broadway, Manhattan; 212-574-8152, jttnyc.com.
The schlock shock attitude of the artist known as King Cobra (a.k.a. Doreen Lynette Garner) announces itself with the ghoulish "Salome's Revenge" (2023): a pink silicone cast of a human head wedged in a deli slicer. So when you come to the tondo layered with rubbery, flesh-like scraps, you know what it's made of. Cobra's previous sculptures have used similar grindhouse techniques to explore the brutal history of medical experimentation on the Black body. Here, the "meat" contains "dirt from J. Marion Sims's grave," damning the man who pioneered gynecology on enslaved Black women, often without anesthesia.
The exhibition, "White Meat," imagines the racial concept of whiteness as a kind of mortadella -- an abstract meat, flecked with nuts and fat. Cobra's metaphorical butchery asks whether abstraction is itself a racial concept. Did white men invent abstract art? Can you abstract an artwork (or a medical "achievement") from the monster who made it?
The show's tour de force is a life-size model of a necrotic shark, patched together with pigmented silicone, beads, hair weave, steel mesh and razor blades (for the teeth), suspended in an open steel frame -- a clear parody of Damien Hirst's formaldehyded blockbuster. Work in a second gallery includes a rope of blond dreadlocks and a giant necklace of white, dreadlocked scalps. Maybe it takes this kind of bloody overstatement to show whiteness its own cruelty. And if there were ever purity in abstract art, Cobra's rough way of working rejects that, too. TRAVIS DIEHL
Man Ray
Through June 2. Di Donna, 744 Madison Avenue, Manhattan; 212-259-0444, didonna.com.
Man Ray portrayed the artists and writers of Paris in the 1920s and '30s as indelibly as Nadar did their 19th-century predecessors. Indeed, Man Ray's deathbed photograph of Marcel Proust makes a fitting bookend to Nadar's of Victor Hugo. But Nadar, when he memorialized France's literary titan in 1885, was himself a venerable Paris institution, while Man Ray, who rushed to Proust's apartment in 1922 at the bidding of Jean Cocteau, was an American who spoke terrible French and had been living in Paris for little over a year.
The marvel of "Man Ray's Paris Portraits, 1921-1939" is his access as well as his artistry. Before relocating, Man Ray had been befriended by Marcel Duchamp and Tristan Tzara, two vanguard artists. They smoothed his Parisian entry, and are among the subjects in this exhibition of 72 vintage prints, mostly drawn from the collection of Timothy Baum, a private art dealer who knew Man Ray in the last years of his life and collaborated on this show.
Man Ray flattered his subjects. To soften wrinkles and other imperfections, he typically shot with a long lens from a distance, and he slightly overexposed the film. Yet his portraits were profoundly revealing: the knowing eyes of the poet Anna de Noailles, the glazed stare of the perennially pickled Sinclair Lewis, the burly forcefulness of a young Alexander Calder. And then there is his self-portrait, taken in his mid-30s -- tie intentionally askew, eyes penetrating, and mouth set in a line of unstoppable determination. ARTHUR LUBOW
Last Chance
Helen Lundeberg
Through May 6. Bortolami, 55 Walker Street, Manhattan; 212-727-2050; bortolamigallery.com.
In the 1930s the Angeleno modernist Helen Lundeberg advanced a style referred to as Post-Surrealism, an American splinter movement meant to temper the European version's weirder imagery (but not by much; one of her early efforts includes a wrench plucking a wilted nail out of a crimson pool). By contrast, the ‌10 bracing canvases ‌here share more with the strain of work Lundeberg created contemporaneously as a W.P.A. muralist in Southern California: hard-lined geometric abstraction rendered in plush color delineating domestic zones. But Lundeberg's feel for space wasn't entirely rigid, leaving room for Surrealism's psycho-geography to haunt its corners.
Made between 1952 and 1975, the selection here focuses on bands of vertical color, soft tones dialed up or down the spectrum to achieve an enigmatic interplay of shadow, flatness and depth -- an uncanny sense of spatial perception that collides classicism with the illogical dimensions of de Chirico, his empty arcades shot through with ‌Los Angeles's‌ sepia-smog light.
When Lundeberg's uniform fields are ruptured it's with beguiling effect: punctuated by three-dimensional still lifes, as in two versions of the same arrangement called "The Mirror and Pink Shell." The earlier painting, from 1952, appears to fuzz, its brushwork legible, while the later version, started in the same year but not completed until 1969, stiffens into focus, its fields smoothed and amplified. This vignette -- a simple chair, a mirror reflecting a bare bulb -- was one Lundeberg returned to for over ‌30 years, the contours of her life distilled into the metaphysical plane. MAX LAKIN
Erin Jane Nelson
Through May 6. Chapter NY, 60 Walker Street, Manhattan; 646-850-7486, chapter-ny.com.
Erin Jane Nelson's ceramics seem curiously alive -- not as recognizable creatures, but as biomorphic forms, maybe microorganisms blown up to visible size. Mounted on the wall, they have irregular, curvy shapes and short, spindly tentacles. They're almost always clumped together, in pairs or larger groups, as if each one were dependent on the others for its existence.
If you've seen some of these pieces before, like in Nelson's contribution to the 2021 New Museum Triennial, it may not come as a surprise that her current exhibition, "Sublunary," was inspired by the Okefenokee Swamp. There's a purposeful murkiness to the work of this Atlanta-based artist, who is also a curator and writer. Nelson's creations are rarely one thing or another, but hybrids that thrive in between.
"Sublunary" displays the outgrowths of a private performance Nelson conducted on multiple visits to the Okefenokee. There are quilted silks featuring photographs; a set of 365 glazed stoneware mounds titled, collectively, "Chronomicrobiome" (2023), that could represent a kind of ritualized, abstract calendar and the wall-bound ceramics, which still intrigue me most. They have rims and are covered with a clear layer of waterlike resin, so that looking at them recalls peering into a series of shallow pools.
What's inside? Sculpted mini-mounds, flowers, and fungi; multicolored patterns; and real photographs, sometimes of Nelson. If these complex artworks were alive, I would imagine them as swimming or slinking omnivores, accumulating bits of swamp and traces of Nelson's experiences as they go. JILLIAN STEINHAUER
Sarah Palmer
Through May 6. Mrs., 60-40 56th Drive, Maspeth, Queens; 347-841-6149, mrsgallery.com.
Photography was well on track to becoming Image Producer of the millennium -- then came smartphones. Now we are so inundated with images artists have to work like archivists to wade through the morass. Sarah Palmer, a Brooklyn-based artist, does this, using images from old catalogs, New York Public Library archives, slides bought on eBay and A.I.-generated images to create photomontages. The curious and uncanny results are on view in "The Delirious Sun" at Mrs.
Recycling and repurposing are essentially the subject of the work, immediately obvious in the jumble and juxtaposition of image fragments. But Palmer teases out some through lines, like how the female body is represented in photography. In "Age of Earth and Us All Chattering" (2022), an assemblage tinted an eerie orange, photos clipped from a vintage bondage catalog sit alongside an A.I. representation of a bouncy blonde. The bondage magazine images are attached with hot pink tape to a landscape photograph of the American West taken by Palmer, and rephotographed. "Under the Tangled Forest" (2023) visually rhymes human hair, tape and ribbons; other works feature a sculpture of a female torso and close-ups of the artist's pregnant belly.
Palmer scrambles the codes of photography that tell us what, when and why an image was produced -- which is what A.I. does too. However, by putting her own body in the image, Palmer reminds us that making, crafting and contemplating photographs remain a deeply human and embodied enterprise, even at a moment when machines, once again, seem to be taking over. MARTHA SCHWENDENER
Michael Ray Charles
Through May 6. Templon, 293 10th Avenue, Manhattan. 212-922-3745; templon.com.
In the 1990s and early 2000s, Michael Ray Charles's paintings excavated the ugly history of antebellum minstrelsy with nervy appropriations of ubiquitous racist imagery -- the grotesque faces and rictus grins of Sambos and mammy figures -- and not always to appreciative reception. He was accused of perpetuating painful stereotypes when many people would have preferred they remain buried. For the last 20 years he has shown sporadically, mostly in Europe.
The pictures in Charles's first New York exhibition since then finds an artist still surfacing that past, but with a slicker veneer. Where the demeaning depictions of minstrel performance and advertising were replicated at confrontational scale, unblinking in their harshness, here their bitter taste is blended into ornament. The shining obsidian bust in "(Forever Free) Veni Vidi" (2002) sits in a richly appointed Baroque interior, a recognition of the ways racism smooths itself into the background of modern life.
These are contextually complex paintings, incorporating ideas about performance (of gender, race, sexuality) and the theatricality of identity. Blackface caricatures still haunt the canvases, but they're flattened à la wheatpaste street art and spliced onto burlesque dancers and dominatrixes. The figures are often half-formed -- Black faces grafted onto white bodies missing limbs or segments of torso, obscured by gimp masks or African ones studded with cowrie shells, performing in circuses and masquerades -- a dizzying cascade of historical references that reveals the nightmare of our insatiable need for extravaganza. The metaphors can get tangled, but Charles's equation of American racism with entertainment is hard to shake, a sadomasochistic relationship dependent equally on pain and pleasure. MAX LAKIN
More to See
Mamie Tinkler
Through May 13. Ulterior, 424 Broadway, #601, Manhattan. 917-472-7784; ulteriorgallery.com.
I've never seen watercolors quite like Mamie Tinkler's. The still lifes of "A Troubling," her second solo show at Ulterior Gallery, depict densely patterned textiles, unusually tinted feathers, mirrors, skulls, curious rocks, glass globes and crackling flames. All these things shade imperceptibly into patches of saturated color that sometimes read as continuations of the pictures -- as red velvet backdrops, say, or deep black shadows -- and sometimes as a loosening into abstraction. The contrast between exactingly rendered detail and the paint's naturally soft edges is subtle, but it registers as an undertone of tension, even anguish. It's as if Tinkler is using her medium against itself.
This tension struck me as very apropos to a moment when many old certainties are melting away. Things that used to look solid, like science, journalism, the Arctic ice shelf or liberal democracy, are starting to seem more like passing apparitions. But it also says something about perception and knowing. In the show's title piece, a golden finch alights on a twig atop a blue celestial globe. Above it and beside it, as reflections or possibly familiars, two more finches rest on two more globes, their highlights indicated by larger or smaller circles of unpainted white paper. The "real" twig, in front, is loose and fuzzy, like a vision or a dream; the shadow it casts is as crisp as a razor blade. WILL HEINRICH
Chris Burden
Through June 24. Gagosian, 821 Park Avenue, Manhattan; 212-796-1228, Gagosian.com
There can't be many artists whose works are as textbook-famous and as rarely encountered as Chris Burden's. We can't expect to see repeats of the 1970s performances for which he was nailed to a Volkswagen Beetle or shot in the arm with a .22. He died in 2015, and even when he was living those were one-offs. But this rare Burden show presents other examples of the Angeleno's radical works of the 1970s. They shifted the boundaries of art, which makes them now look safely "artistic" and gallery-worthy.
The show gathers several of the "relics" -- Burden's term -- meant to stand for his performances: An empty display case represents "Disappearing," a piece for which he made himself scarce for three days; a telephone and cassette recorder represent "Wiretap," for which Burden taped calls with art dealers.
There's also footage of Burden's shooting and of "Bed Piece," a well-known performance that had him lying in a gallery for 22 days.
More surprising are the one-minute "TV Commercials" that let Burden infiltrate art into broadcast TV, after buying the ad space required. One of them, "Full Financial Disclosure," sits in Andy Warhol's Business Art genre, revealing the numbers for Burden's 1976 income and expenses -- and for his paltry profit. In "Chris Burden Promo," names of world-famous artists fill the TV one after another: "Leonardo da Vinci," "Michelangelo," "Rembrandt," "Vincent van Gogh," "Pablo Picasso" and then ... "Chris Burden." That final name would once have seemed a joke or wildly wishful thinking, but now it lives cozily with the others. BLAKE GOPNIK

Ex-Chief at Audi Will Plead Guilty To Role in Diesel Emissions Scandal: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Rupert Stadler, a former member of Volkswagen's management board, would be the highest-ranking executive to confess wrongdoing in a case that rocked the industry.
Rupert Stadler, the former chief executive of the automaker Volkswagen's Audi division, has agreed to plead guilty to charges in Germany related a vast emissions cheating scandal, becoming the highest-ranking executive to be convicted in the case, which changed the direction of the car industry.
A Munich state court said Wednesday that Mr. Stadler would accept a plea deal offered by a judge, which involves a suspended sentence of up to two years in exchange for a full confession and payment of a fine of 1.1 million euros, or $ 1.2 million.
Mr. Stadler, 60, who was also a member of Volkswagen's management board, was accused of allowing diesel cars made by Audi to remain on sale even after the parent company admitted in 2015 that millions of its vehicles were equipped with software designed to mask excess emissions.
The scandal cost Volkswagen tens of billions of dollars in fines, legal settlements and lawyers' fees and had a lasting impact on the auto industry. It inspired European lawmakers to impose much tighter limits on auto emissions, accelerating a transition from internal combustion engines to electric cars. Volkswagen became one of the first big German automakers to invest heavily in battery power, which executives saw as a way to restore the company's tarnished reputation.
Mr. Stadler has been on trial in Munich since September 2020. Testimony was nearing an end last week when Judge Stefan Weickert offered him the deal. In Germany, evidence is typically heard intermittently and trials can drag on for years. Judges sometimes offer defendants a plea agreement after concluding that the evidence against them is strong.
Wolfgang Hatz, who led motor development at Audi and Porsche and was tried alongside Mr. Stadler, pleaded guilty to related charges last week. A third defendant, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, a former Audi executive who was involved in designing emissions systems, also accepted a plea deal.
Mr. Stadler, who had insisted throughout the trial that he did nothing wrong, agreed to accept the plea deal during a hearing on Wednesday morning, the court said. Prosecutors in the case also support the deal.
Mr. Stadler is expected to make his confession in two weeks' time, allowing the trial to wrap up by late June, the court said.
The two men were among the most influential executives at Volkswagen, which continues to maintain in court that the cheating was the work of middle managers who hid the wrongdoing from the management board.
Mr. Stadler became chief of Audi, one of Volkswagen's most profitable brands, in 2007 after working as chief of staff to Ferdinand Piëch, the Porsche family scion who dominated Volkswagen for two decades beginning in the 1990s. Mr. Stadler left Audi in 2018 after spending several months in pretrial detention.
In 2017, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to fraud and other federal charges in Washington, after admitting that engineers rigged nearly 600,000 diesel cars sold in the United States to cheat on emissions tests. The cars were programmed to recognize when they were being tested on rollers in a lab. If so, the cars produced emissions that were compliant with regulations.
On the road, when regulators were not looking, the cars produced more toxic nitrogen oxides than a long-haul truck. Volkswagen diesels were not capable of consistently meeting emissions standards without suffering engine damage.
The software that enabled the cheating was originally developed by Audi, according to testimony and court documents, and adapted by Volkswagen engineers in 2007 after they had trouble getting their diesel engines to comply with United States standards. The illegal software was also deployed in Europe and other regions.
Volkswagen paid $ 4.7 billion in criminal and civil penalties as part of a settlement in 2017 with United States authorities. The company paid another $ 15 billion as part of a settlement with owners of VW, Audi and Porsche diesel cars.
The confessions of Mr. Stadler and Mr. Hatz mean that they will endure much lighter penalties than two lower-ranking executives, Oliver Schmidt and James Liang, who served multiyear prison sentences after being arrested in the United States and pleading guilty to charges.
A separate trial of several former Volkswagen managers is underway in Braunschweig. At least six others have been indicted in the United States but not arrested because they remained in Germany, which does not extradite its citizens.
Martin Winterkorn, the Volkswagen chief executive until he resigned in 2015 after the wrongdoing came to light, faces charges in the United States and Germany, but it is questionable whether he will ever face trial because of ill health. He has denied wrongdoing.
Volkswagen continues to suffer from the fallout of the scandal. The Securities and Exchange Commission is pursuing a civil case against the company, accusing it of defrauding bond investors by not fully informing them about the scope of the cheating. Volkswagen is contesting the suit, which is scheduled to go to trial next year.

Ford Motor Made $1.8 Billion As Shortage of Parts Eased: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Sales increased from a year earlier, when the automaker was hampered by parts shortages.
Ford Motor reported a solid profit in the first quarter, although the automaker indicated that its turnaround was not complete and that it had a ways to go before it starts making money on electric vehicles.
On Tuesday, the company said it made $ 1.8 billion in profit in the first three months of 2023 as a result of a substantial increase in revenue and in the number of vehicles it sold around the world, the company said Tuesday.
The positive result is a recovery from the same period a year ago, when the automaker lost $ 3.1 billion as the value of its stake in the electric-vehicle maker Rivian declined.
In 2022, Ford was slowed by shortages of computer chips and other key parts that prevented it from making as many vehicles as it had expected.
"When you look at the core and the quarter, it's solid," the company's chief executive, Jim Farley, said in a conference call with analysts. "We saw growth across all our key metrics. Our balance sheet is strong."
For the first quarter, the company reported revenue of $ 41.5 billion, up 20 percent from $ 34.5 billion in the year-earlier period. Globally, Ford sold 1.1 million cars and trucks in the first quarter, compared with 966,000 in the first three months of 2022.
Ford, which is trying to streamline its operations and cut costs, reiterated a forecast of $ 9 billion to $ 11 billion in profit for the full year before interest and taxes.
For the first time, Ford reported separate results for its electric vehicle division. The E.V. business lost $ 700 million before interest and taxes in the first quarter, while a unit making traditional gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles doubled its profit to $ 2.6 billion.
The E.V. business is not yet producing vehicles in sufficient volumes to generate profits. It was especially slowed in the first quarter, when the company halted production of the F-150 Lightning pickup to fix a battery defect and stopped making the Mustang Mach-E, a sport-utility vehicle, to modify its plant to roughly double output.
The production disruptions caused Ford's sales of the Mach-E to fall about 20 percent, to just under 5,400 vehicles. Sales of the F-150 Lightning totaled almost 4,300 trucks. That was higher than a low figure from a year ago, when the truck was just going into production, but fewer than Ford had been hoping for.
Separately on Tuesday, Ford said it was lowering prices of most versions of the Mach-E by $ 3,000 to $ 4,000. The vehicle, introduced two years ago, now competes with similar electric S.U.V.s from Hyundai, Volkswagen, Nissan, Tesla and other manufacturers.
"It's a competitive segment," Mr. Farley said.
Mr. Farley said that over the course of this year, Ford would narrow its losses on those two vehicles and the E-Transit, a delivery van. He also predicted that those three models would be profitable before interest and taxes by the end of 2024.
A third line of business, Ford Pro, which produces commercial trucks and services for fleet operators, nearly tripled its earnings before interest and taxes to $ 1.4 billion.
In the past, Ford broke out its operations geographically. The new form of reporting is intended to show how fast the company's E.V. business is growing, in hopes of attracting investors.
Ford plans to give investors a closer look at its strategy and operations in a two-day conference this month.
The earnings announcement came after the markets closed. Ford shares were down about 2 percent in extended trading.

Credits and Debits of E.V. Shopping: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Buying an electric car has become much more complicated because of restrictions on which models qualify for a federal tax credit of up to $ 7,500.
Designed to accelerate the shift to electric cars among other climate goals, the Inflation Reduction Act has in practice made buying such vehicles a lot more complicated.
In August, the law ruled out the full tax credit of $ 7,500 for electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids assembled outside North America. That may make it harder for consumers to take the financial or psychological leap to buy a battery-powered car.
The Treasury Department further tightened those rules this week by requiring that a certain percentage of the components and minerals in car batteries are sourced from the United States or in countries that are its trade allies -- numbers that will increase over time.
Just 11 electric cars from four automakers -- Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen -- now qualify for the full tax credit; several others can qualify for a partial $ 3,750 credit. The list is expected to grow as more automakers reconfigure their supply chains.
The rules are already driving big changes in the buying and selling of electric cars. Some automakers whose models are no longer eligible are now pushing leased electric cars. That's because the law allows leased vehicles to qualify as commercial vehicles, which the Inflation Reduction Act exempts from the restrictions that apply to cars bought by individuals.
For many car buyers, the availability of the tax credit is critical. Electric vehicle prices have fallen in recent months, but they still cost $ 58,940 on average in March, nearly $ 11,000 more than a typical new car, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Ethan Derner of Portland, Ore., and his fiancée, Lorien Sekora, share two Kia electric cars. Mr. Derner had considered replacing his car with a new model that could drive farther on a charge, but he gave up after realizing that the vehicles he wanted were either too expensive or no more practical than his current car. He has extended the lease on his Kia Soul and is waiting for more affordable models that can qualify for a tax credit.
"The only other model I'm considering now is a Rivian, but that's out of my price range," Mr. Derner said. Rivian's electric luxury models like the R1T pickup truck and R1S S.U.V. are built in Illinois and qualify for a $ 3,750 credit.
"Until I can drive to Seattle and back with no anxiety," Mr. Derner added, "I'm not going to buy a new E.V. outright."
His experience is common. About 80 percent of people who were shopping for an electric vehicle recently surveyed by Cars.com said tax credits played a big role in their decision to buy an electric car and the vehicle they planned to buy.
Many industry experts and consumers have praised the multipronged mission of the law to curb greenhouse gas emissions, create jobs in the United States and blunt China's dominance in batteries and mineral processing. Since President Biden took office, automakers, battery and other companies have announced plans to spend more than $ 100 billion to electrify the U.S. auto industry.
Yet the rules could hinder the goal of getting more people to buy electric vehicles -- at least for the next few years.
"They made it complex for a reason, but in the meantime it's creating all kinds of chaos for consumers," said Chris Harto, senior policy analyst for Consumer Reports. "In the short term, it's absolutely going to hurt the companies that aren't eligible and help the companies that are."
The reshuffled credits appear to deal an especially tough hand to Hyundai Motor, which also owns the Kia and Genesis brands.
Models like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 have won industry accolades and impressed buyers with attractive designs and some of the fastest charging times of any electric cars. But they are built in South Korea and, thus, not eligible for any federal tax breaks.
Even as sales of all Hyundai and Kia cars jumped in the first three months of the year, the brands' electric vehicle sales fell more than 25 percent, according to Kelley Blue Book. Electric car sales on the whole soared to another record in the first quarter, on a pace to top one million cars in 2023, and now account for 7.2 percent of all new cars sold.
The credit rules have been changing fast. Last month, Genesis' first American-built model, the Electrified GV70 sport utility vehicle, began rolling off a Hyundai line in Alabama after 16 hours of assembly. Genesis executives had hoped that the model could qualify for a credit, but the car did not meet the tougher rules the Biden administration released this week.
To make up for the loss of the tax breaks, Hyundai and other automakers are trying to lure buyers through leases. Under the administration's broad interpretations of the law, leased electric cars are eligible for tax credits even if they are made overseas and are not subjected to the government's rules on sourcing requirements for battery components and minerals, household income caps and vehicle price thresholds.
Car dealers can pass along the commercial credit to consumers by lowering the price of the car in lease transactions, which could reduce monthly payments. Under the rules of thumb for auto financing, applying the full $ 7,500 credit to a lease could save consumers about $ 225 per month over three years, or $ 125 per month over five years, said Russell Datz, a spokesman for Volvo.
Volvo, which is based in Goteborg, Sweden, sells two electric models in the United States that are made at a factory in Belgium and do not qualify for federal tax credits. The automaker will start assembling a new S.U.V., the EX90, at its factory in South Carolina this year.
Consumers are getting the money-saving message. In September, after the law's passage, just 7 percent of consumers leased an electric vehicle, according to Edmunds.com. By March, leases accounted for 34 percent of the electric car market.
Gary Murphy, a retired educator in Castle Rock, Colo., leased an Ioniq 5 in February from a dealer that learned of the commercial credit the day before.
"We had no plans to lease a car," Mr. Murphy said. "But when they confirmed you can get $ 7,500 on a lease, or nothing to buy, that's too big an incentive to pass up."
Before tracking down the Ioniq 5, he waited for months for three different electric models, which were in short supply. When cars were available, many dealers demanded several thousand dollars more than manufacturers' suggested retail prices.
"You can get the credit, but you can't get the car," Mr. Murphy said.
The use of credits for leased vehicles has angered some automakers and lawmakers who say it subverts the intent of Congress. Consumers can lease any electric vehicle for the $ 7,500 credit. For example, a couple making more than $ 300,000 -- the income limit for married people for the tax credit -- can lease a $ 148,000 Mercedes-Benz AMG EQS and claim a $ 7,500 credit even though the car is made in Germany and far exceeds the $ 55,000 price cap for electric sedans to qualify for the credit.
Treasury officials have said their decision to allow a tax credit for leased cars is legally sound. The Inflation Reduction Act exempted commercial vehicles from the restrictions to encourage rental car companies, local governments and other owners of car and truck fleets to buy electric vehicles.
Of course, many consumers prefer buying and owning cars, in part to avoid lease limits on how much they can drive and penalties for excessive wear and tear.
José Muñoz, the chief executive of Hyundai and Genesis Motor North America, insists the loss of buyer credits puts his brands at a huge marketplace disadvantage. But the chairman of Hyundai's national dealer council, Kevin Reilly, said models like the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 would remain competitive despite their financial handicap.
The Ioniq 6, which recently went on sale, is the longest-range and most energy-efficient mass-market electric car in the United States. It can be driven up to 361 miles on a full charge and gets the equivalent of 140 miles to the gallon, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
"I think our customers will evaluate the full landscape, not just whether an E.V. qualifies for credit," said Mr. Reilly, the owner and president of Alexandria Hyundai in Virginia.
Mr. Reilly said leasing offered other advantages. People who are anxious about switching to battery-powered cars can try one without a long-term commitment or worrying about resale value. And as electric vehicle technology advances and more affordable models hit the market, customers can easily upgrade when their lease is up.
Still, some car buyers said they would buy only electric cars eligible for tax credits because they supported the aims of the Inflation Reduction Act.
Jonathan Quarles, an entrepreneur in Detroit, said he spent more than $ 150 per week to fill up a Ford Expedition to ferry his three daughters around town. He is considering replacing it with an electric Ford Mustang Mach-E, which is eligible for a $ 3,750 federal tax credit. After watching manufacturing jobs leave the country for decades, he said, he has little sympathy for automakers whose cars did not qualify for credits.
"My perspective is," he said, "you should have been building those factories way before the credit."

Canada Outbids U.S. for Volkswagen Plant: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the assistance was needed to offset incentives offered by the United States.
Volkswagen's first North American battery plant for electric vehicles will be built in Canada, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Canadian politicians made it clear on Friday that the country had effectively been in a bidding war with the United States.
"We put up a lot of money," Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference in St. Thomas, Ontario, where six assembly lines covering 370 acres will be built. "Everyone wanted this."
Volkswagen announced last month that it would put its first battery plant outside Europe in Canada, but provided few details. On Friday, Canada and the province of Ontario said they would give the company a combined 1 billion Canadian dollars -- about $ 750 million in U.S. currency -- to construct the factory, which will cost 7 billion Canadian dollars overall.
A separate agreement will provide 8 billion to 10 billion Canadian dollars in subsidies over the next decade to match benefits that Volkswagen would have received under the Inflation Reduction Act if it had put the factory in the United States. That amount is tied to battery production.
Mr. Trudeau, speaking at a railway museum in front of a steam locomotive and two electric Volkswagen models, said that while it was impossible for Canada to broadly match U.S. industrial subsidies, the deal with Volkswagen had come out of a policy decision by Canada to strategically challenge its neighbor.
Volkswagen considered about a dozen other places in North America for the plant, which it said would eventually employ 3,000 people and make enough batteries annually for one million vehicles.
"Congratulations from our side for outperforming the competition and bringing this gigafactory to St. Thomas," said Frank Blome, the chief executive of PowerCo, Volkswagen's battery subsidiary. "That wasn't easy."
The Volkswagen plant will be the second major battery operation in Ontario. Last year, the automaker Stellantis and the South Korean company LG Energy Solution announced a factory in Windsor, where Stellantis has a large assembly plant that Chrysler built. That factory, which will employ 2,500 people and start production next year, also received substantial government subsidies toward its cost of 5 billion Canadian dollars.
Volkswagen will become the sixth automaker with large operations in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, and the first to establish operations there since Honda and Toyota arrived in the 1980s. St. Thomas was once home to a heavy-truck plant owned by Daimler of Germany as well as a Ford Motor factory that, in its final years, assembled cars primarily used as police cruisers and taxis. Both were closed by 2011 and not replaced by other industries.
After the initial announcement last month, Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party of Canada, criticized the government for subsidizing Volkswagen.
"This money belongs to Canadians," he wrote on Twitter. "Not to a foreign corporation. Not to Justin Trudeau."
But Andreas Schotter, an associate professor of international business at Western University in London, Ontario, and a former financial executive with Volkswagen North America, said subsidies were the reality for countries seeking to maintain their automotive industries.
"It's a good thing, but with a high risk," he said, noting that policy shifts, particularly in the United States, could slow the transition to electric vehicles or that other technologies, like hydrogen fuel cells, could dislodge batteries over time.
While St. Thomas, which is midway between Detroit and Toronto, is in the center of Canada's automotive corridor, it is a considerable distance from Volkswagen's North American factories in Tennessee and Mexico. It is, however, just down the road from a factory where General Motors recently began building electric delivery vans and a Toyota factory that makes hybrid crossovers.
Over time, Dr. Schotter said, the new factory may end up supplying batteries to other companies.

Tesla's Quarterly Profit Drops After a Series of Price Cuts: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The electric carmaker has reduced prices by thousands of dollars this year to bolster demand and fend off competition.
Tesla's profit fell sharply in the first three months of the year after it cut the prices of its electric vehicles, the company said on Wednesday.
The carmaker, led by Elon Musk, said it had made $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter, a drop from $ 3.7 billion in the last three months of last year and $ 3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022.
Tesla sold more electric cars in the United States last year than all its competitors combined. But its market share slipped as traditional carmakers like General Motors, Ford Motor and Volkswagen began selling electric cars that often undercut Tesla on price. In China, Tesla has been overtaken by BYD. Tesla's product line has not changed much, which can be a big disadvantage as rivals attract buyers with alluring new models.
To try to maintain its hold on the market, Tesla has made a series of price cuts this year across its four models. Because it has much wider profit margins than other automakers, the company is in theory in a strong position in a price war.
But the price cuts appear to be quickly eating into those margins. In the first quarter, the gross margin that measures the profitability of Tesla's auto business, excluding revenue from selling clean-energy credits, was 19 percent, down from nearly 27 percent for all of 2022.
The average selling price for Tesla's vehicles in the first quarter of this year was nearly $ 46,000, down from $ 51,400 in the last quarter of 2022. But despite that 11 percent decline, Tesla's vehicle deliveries were only 4 percent higher.
In a conference call to discuss the company's quarterly results, Mr. Musk said Tesla's profit margin remained among the highest in the industry. "We're taking a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here," he said, "versus a lower volume and a higher margin."
On the call, Zachary Kirkhorn, Tesla's chief financial officer, was asked to provide a 2023 forecast for the gross margin in Tesla's auto business, but he said doing so would be difficult because of economic uncertainty.
Tesla said it expected to sell 1.8 million cars in 2023, up from 1.3 million last year.
The company's adjusted per-share profits of 85 cents were in line with the expectations of Wall Street analysts, and its stock was down about 4 percent in extended trading on Wednesday. Tesla's shares are up nearly 50 percent this year but still down 56 percent from their high, reached in 2021. The stock came under pressure last year partly because Mr. Musk sold billions of dollars of Tesla shares to help finance his acquisition of Twitter.
Competition will intensify this year as traditional carmakers expand their electric lineups. Volkswagen's ID.4, a sport utility vehicle, starts at about $ 39,000, less than the $ 47,000 starting price for Tesla's Model Y S.U.V.
G.M. plans to begin selling an electric version of its Equinox S.U.V. for around $ 30,000, as well as electric versions of the Silverado pickup truck and Blazer S.U.V.
Investors have been waiting for Tesla to respond with new vehicles. The company has promised to begin selling the Cybertruck pickup this year, although it won't be available in large numbers until 2024. On Wednesday, Mr. Musk said the company was expecting a "delivery event" for the Cybertruck in the third quarter of this year.
"This is really a very radical product," he said. "It's not made in the way that other cars are made."
There is also speculation that Tesla will unveil a car priced below the Model 3 sedan, which starts at $ 39,990 before government incentives.
The company's strategy of cutting prices to shore up demand also risks offending Tesla owners by reducing the resale value of their cars. Prices for used Teslas have plunged in recent months.
Tesla's sales, like those of all carmakers, have been affected by rising interest rates, which make car payments more expensive for buyers. But Tesla has also been bolstered by changes in tax credits that electric cars receive in the United States.
Because it already makes batteries in the United States, Tesla had an easier time qualifying for new rules that took effect on Tuesday and determine which vehicles qualify for a $ 7,500 tax credit. To be eligible, the batteries must be made with lithium and other minerals mined or processed by a U.S. trade ally, and with battery components made in the United States, Canada or Mexico.
Tesla also sells solar panels, batteries for home power storage, and large batteries used by electric producers and distributors to store solar and wind power. Mr. Musk said this month that Tesla would build a factory in Shanghai with the aim of assembling 10,000 of the giant batteries annually.

Car Show Flaunts China's Switch to Electric: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Shanghai auto show, the largest in China since before the pandemic, had one theme: The dominance of electric vehicles in the world's largest car market is here to stay.
A hall showing off electric vehicles made by Nio, XPeng Motors, Zeekr and dozens of other Chinese companies was mobbed with visitors. An area nearby full of gasoline-powered cars by foreign brands barely got a second look by anyone.
At the same event, Volkswagen, which vies with Toyota to be the world's biggest seller of cars with combustion engines, issued a bold forecast: Within two years, half the cars sold in China, the world's largest automobile market, will be electric, up from only 6 percent in 2020.
The theme at the Shanghai auto show this week was clear. Electric cars are here to stay, and Chinese automakers are leading the field.
Silvio Pietro Angori, the chief executive and managing director of Pininfarina of Italy, a nearly century-old car design business, said the global industry was not going back.
The internal combustion engine, he said, "is done, it's gone, it doesn't exist any more."
The Shanghai auto show is one of the world's biggest, and the first of its size in China since 2019. During the pandemic, when China's borders were sealed because of "zero Covid" precautions, its auto industry was quietly transformed and the market share of foreign companies shrank. Today half the cars sold in Shanghai itself are already electric.
Brian Gu, the president and vice chairman of Xpeng, said his company planned to reduce the cost of building a powertrain -- primarily the battery and electric motor -- by 25 percent by the end of the year. Powertrains, particularly the batteries, make up about two-fifths of Xpeng's overall cost of building an electric car.
Ashwani Gupta, the chief operating officer of Nissan, one-upped Xpeng, saying his company's latest designs would cut powertrain costs by 30 percent. Shohei Yamazaki, the chairman of Nissan's China investments subsidiary, said Nissan would rely heavily on Chinese suppliers.
"Price competition in China is very fierce right now," he said.
Chinese brands have adopted unusual electric car designs while foreign companies and their Chinese joint ventures have played it safe. The wheels are nearly at the corners of the Chinese brand cars, an architecture that also allows more room for batteries under the floor in the middle. Nio and Xpeng have chosen sleek designs, while Changan, based in western China, is making cars so rectangular that they look faintly Cubist.
"Some of that comes from the freedom from legacy," said Felix Kilbertus, the chief creative officer at Pininfarina.
Great Wall, a Chinese maker of sport utility vehicles, has a new electric car brand, Ora, that is targeted to women. It named car models for cats, partly to appeal to lovers of the Hello Kitty brand. It has an electric car that strongly resembles a Volkswagen Beetle.
The main market for electric cars so far is China -- E.V.s were a quarter of China's market last year, compared with less than 6 percent in the United States.
Most of the cars displayed at the auto show use lithium batteries, the current industry standard, though companies are developing vehicles that run fully or partly on batteries made of sodium.
At the moment, there is a glut of lithium batteries, but long term many in the industry believe sodium can become a viable alternative or supplement to lithium as a key ingredient in E.V. batteries. For one thing, the production of sodium batteries would be better for the climate.
Toyota's chief scientist, Gill Pratt, contended at a session of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January that overall greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced more by replacing 90 gasoline cars with hybrid cars than by using the same amount of scarce lithium to build one battery-electric car.
"If you think about the total amount of lithium that the world has, the key is let's use it where it does the most good," he said.
Toyota has a vested interest in questioning the availability of lithium. It owns many key patents for hybrid cars, and has emphasized them over entirely electric cars that require far more lithium. American and European automakers like Ford Motor and Volkswagen, as well as most Chinese automakers, are still betting on battery-electric cars.
Prototype cars with all-sodium batteries that were disclosed in recent weeks by Chinese domestic carmakers and battery manufacturers have been low-budget microcars. One of them, the Sihao Huaxianzi from JAC Motors, in collaboration with HiNA, a sodium battery start-up, is designed for a top speed of 75 miles an hour.
Pulkit Khurana, a co-founder of Battery Smart, an Indian company that provides batteries for three-wheeled auto rickshaws, expressed doubt that any technology, including sodium, would displace conventional lithium batteries soon. And with the price of lithium having dropped by two-thirds since November, the cost of lithium batteries is likely to drop significantly, he said.
A midsize car or sport utility vehicle would have enough room for a far larger sodium battery than the low-cost subcompacts that Chinese manufacturers are initially building. Another possibility is to use a combination of sodium and lithium cells in a single car battery.
Using an artificial intelligence computer program, China's CATL, the world's largest manufacturer of electric car batteries, has figured out the complex electronics and programming for battery packs with some lithium cells and some sodium cells, said Huang Qisen, the deputy dean of company's research institute.
CATL -- the company's full name is Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. -- said at the auto show that it would make sodium battery cars in cooperation with Chery, a Chinese automaker that is strongest in manufacturing low-cost subcompacts. But both companies declined to provide any details.
Switching to sodium could solve one of the biggest problems with lithium batteries, which put out much less electricity in freezing temperatures.
Because of chemical differences between sodium and lithium, a sodium battery loses less than a tenth of its power at very cold temperatures, according to battery chemistry experts.
"It is promising," said Ouyang Chuying, the president of research and development at CATL. "Sodium has no resource limit."

U.S. Brands Gain Edge With Tax Breaks for E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Rules that take effect on Tuesday will limit the $ 7,500 credits to electric cars made domestically with minerals from the U.S. or trade allies.
American brands like Tesla and General Motors will benefit most from rules that determine which electric vehicles qualify for tax credits starting on Tuesday. Foreign carmakers like Hyundai will be at a significant disadvantage because of restrictions aimed at cutting China out of the supply chain.
Only 10 vehicles will initially qualify for tax credits of $ 7,500, less than a quarter of the battery-powered cars on sale in the United States. But those 10 include many of the most popular models and accounted for two-thirds of electric vehicle sales before the new rules took effect.
Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y, the best-selling electric vehicles in the United States, will qualify for the full $ 7,500 credit, with one exception, according to a list published by the Treasury Department on Monday. The least expensive version of the Model 3 will qualify for only half the credit because its battery is made in China.
G.M.'s Chevrolet Bolt, one of the cheapest electric vehicles on the market, will also qualify, as will sport utility vehicles and pickups that the company plans to begin selling this year.
Fewer Ford vehicles will qualify for the full $ 7,500 credit because of rules requiring that a certain percentage of the battery components and minerals like lithium come from either domestic sources or trade allies. Ford's Mustang Mach-E, the third-best-selling electric vehicle in the United States last year, according to Kelley Blue Book, will be eligible for only half the credit because its Polish-made battery does not meet domestic sourcing requirements. The F-150 Lightning pickup will continue to qualify for the full credit.
Chrysler and Jeep, divisions of Stellantis, do not yet sell cars that run solely on batteries, but several of their hybrid models will qualify for at least some of the credit. Hybrid vehicles can qualify if their batteries have a capacity of at least seven kilowatt-hours.
The rules give U.S. carmakers at least a temporary advantage over competitors like Toyota, Volkswagen and Nissan. No foreign automakers were on the Treasury list, which is expected to grow as companies adjust their supply chains.
Carmakers that qualify for the tax credits will now have a head start as sales of electric vehicles take off. "It causes a multiplier effect in the market," Paul Jacobson, G.M.'s chief financial officer, told reporters in New York this month. The rules, he added, are "very consistent with the strategy that we had already adopted."
The rules grow out of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed last year to fight climate change and encourage domestic manufacturing among other things. The Treasury Department was responsible for writing regulations based on the legislation.
The law seeks to reduce the auto industry's reliance on China, which makes most of the world's batteries and dominates the processing of raw materials. The law also establishes limits on sales prices and excludes individuals who earn more than $ 150,000 a year and couples who make more than $ 300,000. The rules also exclude vehicles made outside North America, including in allied countries like South Korea and Germany.
"We were not happy," José Muñoz, the chief executive of Hyundai and Genesis Motor North America, said in an interview at the New York International Auto Show this month. Hyundai's Ioniq 6 electric sedan was named World Car of the Year at the show, but will not be eligible for tax credits because it is assembled in South Korea.
Hyundai, based in Seoul, is investing $ 10 billion to build car and battery plants in Georgia, which will allow the company to meet the Inflation Reduction Act requirements -- but not for several years.
Officials at the carmaker and the South Korean government asked the Biden administration to allow Hyundai and Kia cars to qualify for credits while the factories were under construction, but were told that the law did not allow such an exception, Mr. Muñoz said.
The Hyundai car factory in Georgia is expected to begin producing cars in 2025. The battery plant, which Hyundai is building with SK On, will start production in 2026. "We are working on putting ahead that date so we can qualify earlier," Mr. Muñoz said.
Tesla had already told potential buyers that the least expensive version of the Model 3 sedan would qualify for only half the credit, or $ 3,750. This month, Tesla cut the price of that car by $ 1,000 to $ 41,990. After the partial credit is accounted for, the car will effectively cost many buyers a little more than $ 38,000, about as much as a top-of-the-line Honda Accord and cheaper than an entry-level BMW 3 Series sedan.
Other versions of the Model 3 and Model Y S.U.V. will continue to receive the full credit. Tesla sold more electric vehicles in the United States last year than all other carmakers combined, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Some auto executives have said the rules are too restrictive and undermine efforts to limit climate change. Other critics, like Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, have complained that the Biden administration's rules are too lenient.
Administration officials have argued that the regulations strike a balance between promoting electric vehicles and building a domestic supply chain.
By the administration's count, besides the 10 vehicles that qualify for the full credit, seven qualify for half the credit. Vehicles can qualify for half the credit if, for example, their battery components come from the United States, Canada or Mexico but the minerals used to make the batteries do not meet the sourcing requirements.
Ten vehicles that previously qualified, including the Nissan Leaf and the Volkswagen ID.4, will drop off the list, at least temporarily.
The ID.4, an S.U.V. made in Chattanooga, Tenn., did not make the new list because it is still assessing its supply chain. But Pablo Di Si, the chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America, said he expected the model to qualify. Volkswagen was fourth behind Tesla, G.M. and Ford in U.S. electric vehicle sales in the first three months of the year, according to Kelley Blue Book.
Five electric vehicles that G.M. sells or is planning to sell this year will qualify. In addition to the Bolt, the Cadillac Lyriq and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer S.U.V.s and the Silverado pickup will qualify for the full credit. G.M. and LG Energy Solution have begun producing battery cells at a factory in Ohio.
The new rules could be revised in response to comments from the public. It is up to carmakers to show that they qualify, but they are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service and could be penalized if they provide incorrect information. The I.R.S. publishes a list of eligible vehicles that is updated regularly.
A provision in the law for commercial vehicles allows companies to collect the credits for all leased vehicles even if the cars don't meet sourcing and manufacturing requirements. Automakers and their dealers can pass on the savings to people who lease cars, and, as a result, Hyundai has seen a spike in leases, Mr. Muñoz said. The company is also offering cars through monthly subscriptions to let customers benefit from tax incentives and try electric cars.
But that will not make up for lost sales, because most people prefer buying rather than leasing or renting cars, Mr. Muñoz said.
"We cannot compete unless we simply drop dramatically the price," he said. "It's impossible to make it work from a financial point of view."

Full text: The intense competition among the country's huge number of start-up carmakers has unsettled what had been a pillar of the economy in the last few years.
A cutthroat price war has erupted in the world's largest automobile market.
Within a week in March, Volkswagen's Chinese joint venture slashed prices on its ID.3 electric cars by 18 percent. Changan Automobile, one of China's state-owned car manufacturers, offered $ 3,000 cash rebates, free charging credits and other incentives for its electric vehicles. BYD, the country's biggest E.V. maker, unveiled a second round of markdowns in a month for some of its older models.
Amid slumping auto sales, car brands are going to extremes to stay competitive, offering dealership giveaways and deep discounts. Over 40 carmakers have discounted electric and gas-powered vehicles in China this year. The discounts have amounted to several hundred dollars for cheaper models, and tens of thousands of dollars for higher-end offerings.
"The severity of this cycle of price cuts is something that I've never seen," said Tu Le, a managing director at the Beijing consultancy Sino Auto Insights, who has worked in the automotive industry in China and the United States for 25 years.
The price competition has unsettled what was a pillar of strength in the last few years, even as strict pandemic measures shook China's economy and undermined efforts by the ruling Chinese Communist Party to instill confidence.
China's car sales fell 13 percent in the first three months of 2023. Sales of traditional automobiles plunged, while growth in electric vehicles slowed, according to the China Passenger Car Association.
China's E.V. market has grown rapidly since 2020 -- doubling in sales last year -- propped up partly by government subsidies. When that program expired in December after 13 years, the competition intensified to attract buyers in an already crowded segment of the market.
At the same time, traditional automakers are scrambling to unload inventory of older cars before tougher national emissions standards starting in July make it difficult to sell diesel- and gas-powered vehicles.
An already jittery market started to spiral in January when Tesla, the American company that makes electric vehicles in Shanghai, lowered prices in China for the second time in three months. Other manufacturers felt pressure to do the same.
This month, Wang Chuanfu, chairman and chief executive of BYD, proposed that the government extend tax exemptions, which reduce the cost of buying electric vehicles, to 2025 instead of allowing them to expire this year. And China's Auto Dealers Chamber of Commerce published an article last month calling for a six-month delay in the new emissions standards.
The price cuts are not limited to China. Tesla has also lowered prices in the United States and Europe, and its competitors have followed suit. But the intensity of competition reflects the reality that China is not only the biggest market for electric vehicles but also the most competitive.
Established domestic carmakers and local start-ups, supported by Beijing's policies encouraging growth of so-called new energy vehicles, flooded the sector, enticed by a once-in-a-generation opportunity to upend the balance of power in the car industry. By one measure, there are around 300 domestic E.V. manufacturers across China.
Didi, China's leading ride-hailing service, has developed an electric car with BYD exclusively for its drivers. Xiaomi, a maker of smartphones, has said it plans to debut an electric car next year. Even Evergrande, the beleaguered property developer, was building electric vehicles, although those plans may be in jeopardy because of its debt woes.
China is the leading market for electric cars, and more were sold there last year than in the rest of the world. Foreign automakers see an urgent need to gain a foothold in China to develop the know-how and manufacturing scale necessary to compete globally.
Cui Dongshu, secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association, said the price war "will definitely continue" because of the importance of producing E.V.s in large quantities.
"In the end, companies with small sales, or poor technology will be easily eliminated," Mr. Cui said.
Car companies and dealerships are now pulling out all the stops for customers. Some dealers are offering free vacations or bottles of perfume in exchange for test drives, while some eager sales teams are stalking charging stations in hopes of luring drivers away from the competition.
Last month, a promotional poster from a Toyota dealer in the southern city of Shenzhen generated buzz online. It advertised a free gas-powered sedan with the purchase of a bZ4X, the company's electric sport utility vehicle. A woman who answered the phone at the dealership said there was currently no such deal.
Kevin Yang, 29, said he visited a Volkswagen dealer in Chengdu last month to look at its electric vehicles. He was struck by a sense of desperation among the salespeople.
The salesman stayed well past the end of his workday to plead with him to take a test drive. After Mr. Yang agreed to take the car for a spin, he started receiving daily phone calls from the salesman with offers of lower prices if he was willing to return to the dealership.
"The rat race is really intense now," Mr. Yang said.
There are similarities between the frothy E.V. market in China and the early days of the smartphone boom, when a new technology product attracted scores of upstarts to jostle with established foreign brands.
In 2015, there were more than 100 Chinese smartphone manufacturers -- a number that has been whittled down significantly to four main domestic brands and Apple. Many non-Chinese brands, such as Samsung Electronics, once a mobile phone leader in China, barely register.
Zhu Jiangming, chairman and chief executive of the Chinese E.V. maker Leapmotor, said he saw another similarity. He expects electric car prices to come down faster than traditional cars because, like smartphone makers, E.V. manufacturers will benefit as the prices of components fall and features are improved.
It is possible, Mr. Zhu said, that an average to high-end electric vehicle in China could sell for around $ 7,000 in 10 years. The average price for an electric car in China is already significantly lower than in the rest of the world, around $ 35,000 compared with $ 60,000 in Europe and $ 70,000 in the United States.
William Li, chief executive of Nio, one of the top Chinese electric vehicle companies, said he planned to keep Nio out of the price war, which he called "unhealthy and unsustainable." For traditional gas-powered automakers, "cutting prices is their last resort in trying to secure market share," he said in a statement.
Some executives fear that consumers will become accustomed to waiting for price reductions. The China Automobile Dealers Association said last month that foot traffic to dealerships had soared after markdowns, but that orders had decreased.
Leapmotor and Li Auto sought to assure potential buyers with a guarantee offering to make up the difference if the company lowered prices or offered cash rebates in the next 90 days.
Mr. Yang, the car shopper in Chengdu, said he expected prices to go even lower.
"I heard that there will be more discounts soon," he said. "I'm going to wait a bit."

Companies In Germany Strengthen Ties to China: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Some are expanding in China, reluctant to leave a huge market they need to finance operations back home.
As Washington seeks to throttle economic ties with Beijing, two powerful engines of the German economy, Volkswagen and the chemical company BASF, are broadening their huge Chinese investments.
Volkswagen, which has more than 40 plants in China, announced a new effort to tailor models to Chinese customers' wishes, with features like in-dash karaoke machines, and will invest billions in local partnerships and production sites. It's part of a theme unveiled by the German automaker last year: "In China for China."
BASF, with 30 production facilities in China, is pushing ahead with plans to spend 10 billion euros ( $ 10.9 billion) on a new chemical production complex that would rival in size its massive headquarters complex in Ludwigshafen, which covers about four square miles.
Throughout Germany, executives are aware such investments run contrary to efforts by the United States to isolate China economically. They counter that revenue from China is essential for their businesses to thrive and grow in Europe.
Martin Brudermüller, BASF's chief executive, said earnings from China allowed the company to effectively offset losses from Europe's high energy costs and stringent environmental rules.
"Without the business in China, the necessary restructuring here would not be so possible," Mr. Brudermüller told reporters at his company's annual earnings conference in February. "Name me just one investment in Europe where we could make money."
Executives at Volkswagen privately concede the automaker is in a similar quandary. High energy and labor costs have left the company heavily reliant on sales from China to help underwrite operations in Europe.
Now ever-closer business ties are coming under scrutiny in Berlin. For months, at the urging of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, a policy proposal has been making the rounds of German ministries aiming to reset the country's relationship with China, its largest trade partner. The aim is to strike a balance between diversifying Germany's ties throughout Asia to avoid dependence on Chinese imports, while acknowledging the importance of doing business with China.
The Biden administration has pledged to make the United States more competitive with China by expanding American infrastructure and manufacturing, rather than negotiating new trade deals. German lawmakers and business leaders have made clear that their relationship with China is more nuanced: open to vigorous trade while trying to diversify into other Asian markets.
It is a policy being developed after a bruising year when Russia shut down natural gas shipments to Germany, a move that reminded lawmakers of the costs of relying on autocratic nations for materials essential to its industrial backbone. In the case of China, a big problem is Germany's dependence on its imports.
Germany depends on China to provide essential technology products, including mobile phones and LEDs, as well as raw materials, including lithium and rare earth elements. These are critical to Germany's plans to make a transition to cleaner energy and transportation.
Such a reliance must be carefully considered as Germany thinks strategically about its future dealings with China, said Katrin Kamin, a director of the Kiel Initiative in Geopolitics and Economics. Reducing its ties anytime soon is not a reasonable option.
"Germany will not be able to simply relax its relations with China in the short term," Ms. Kamin said. "The dependencies are too great for that."
The European Union has had a bumpier relationship with China. A breakthrough trade and investment deal between the bloc and China, a product of years of talks that was approved in 2020, was shelved less than a year later, after Beijing imposed sanctions on E.U. lawmakers for criticizing China's treatment of its Uyghur population. The deal would have made it easier for companies to operate on one another's territory.
Last week, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, traveled to Beijing with President Emmanuel Macron of France as part of an effort to "rebalance" economic ties with China. She called for the revival of talks about trade, but pointed out stumbling blocks like the support China offers its domestic manufacturers and the restrictions it places on foreign companies.
"China is a crucial trade partner, but E.U. businesses face many discriminatory hurdles," Ms. von der Leyen said after meetings with organizations in Beijing. "European companies have so much to offer China. But they need a level playing field to invest and provide their goods and services."
She told reporters that the stalled trade deal was not discussed in talks with China's leader, Xi Jinping, during the trip.
With foreign trade sales of €297.9 billion last year, China has been Germany's biggest trading partner for seven years in a row. But Germany's trade deficit with China has grown increasingly lopsided, a trend that worsened during the supply chain disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Last year, imports from China expanded by a third, to €191 billion, while exports grew only 3 percent, to €107 billion.
One area where Germany has long dominated ties with China is the automobile industry. German automakers, including BMW and Mercedes-Benz, sell roughly a third of all vehicles they produce in China -- exceeding sales in all of Western Europe. But recent data shows that Germans appear to be losing their grip on the Chinese market, especially as the popularity of domestically produced electric vehicles surges.
Auto insurance registration records show that only 2.4 percent of all electric vehicles sold in China last year were made by Volkswagen, while BMW and Mercedes failed to crack even 1 percent, according to the German business daily Handelsblatt. By comparison, German brands continue to dominate the Chinese market for combustion engine vehicles, but their popularity is giving way to E.V.s.
Perhaps ominously, Chinese electric brands, such as BYD and Nio, are entering the German market, posing a threat to German automakers on their home territory.
In a clear sign of his priorities, within months of taking over as the chief executive of Volkswagen in September, Oliver Blume spent weeks touring China and returned vowing to strengthen his company's partnerships there.
"We have to cooperate much more closely with our local partners in order to listen to the customers in the Chinese region," Mr. Blume told reporters at the company's annual earning meeting last month. "This will be part of a strategy for 2030."
A study by the Kiel Institute showed that decoupling from China would be very costly for all of Europe, but especially Germany, given the strength of its economic ties. Calculations by the institute, based on gross domestic product from 2019, showed that Germany could lose income worth more than €131 billion. And it could be even more if China retaliated.
Berlin would like to avoid another round of the upheaval it experienced after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leading to an energy war that cost Germany its affordable supply of natural gas. That will mean continuing to balance economic interests with security concerns, Jörg Kukies, an economic adviser to Mr. Scholz, told a gathering of German and American trade leaders.
"We want to have a positive approach to China," Mr. Kukies said. "Not an anti-China approach."

If It's Domestic and Electric, China's Car Buyers Want to Own It: [Foreign Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Domestic companies are now selling more vehicles than their multinational rivals, which have failed to keep up with Chinese consumers' demand for electric cars and S.U.V.s.
For years, foreign automakers in China had a bead on customers drawn to luxury brands, like the Cao family in Shanghai. Not anymore.
Ben Cao and his wife, Rachel, both 36, are trading down from two Porsches to one, a gasoline-fueled $ 290,000 Porsche 911 sports car, and buying their first electric vehicle, a $ 70,000 sport utility vehicle designed and manufactured in China by a company called Li Auto.
"If you're sitting in a Li Auto, the first feeling is of luxury," said Mr. Cao, a business consultant.
The rapid rise of Chinese electric carmakers like Li Auto, BYD, Nio and Xpeng Motors is the main preoccupation of the executives, engineers and designers arriving in Shanghai for the start of the city's auto show next Tuesday. The country is now the world's largest car market, and the home teams are routing multinational competitors that had until now mined the riches of China's giant pool of customers. Buyers like the Caos, and China's car companies, have embraced electric vehicles much more rapidly than almost anyone anticipated.
The rise of Chinese auto companies, often subsidized by local governments in cities where they have factories, is another illustration of the country's dominance in electric cars. China now manufactures and sells -- at home and abroad -- most of the world's electric cars. Its prowess extends to the entire value chain for electric cars: It makes almost all of the cars' electric motors and refines most of the chemicals used for lithium batteries. China even leads in developing what could be the next generation of technology, sodium batteries.
More than 80 percent of the electric cars sold in China last year were made by domestic automakers. Last autumn, they overtook multinational companies in the total number of gasoline-powered or electric cars sold each month.
"Multinationals' market share in China will likely continue to decrease due to the continuous development of Chinese automakers, especially in the electric car segment," said Stephen W. Dyer, a managing director in the Shanghai office of Alix Partners, a consulting firm.
As foreign automakers encounter problems in China, they are being pushed to shift more quickly to electric cars in Europe and the United States. The European Union and California want automakers to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. And the Biden administration this week proposed emissions rules that would effectively require about two-thirds of new passenger cars sold in the United States to be electric by 2032 -- standards that some automakers have complained are too stringent.
With a couple of exceptions like Tesla, which China welcomed in 2018 for its technology, Beijing has compelled foreign companies to operate through joint ventures with Chinese automakers. Over the past four decades, multinational companies have trained an entire generation of Chinese auto engineers -- many of whom now work for highly competitive domestic rivals.
Today the number of cars sold by the foreign companies' joint ventures has plummeted as sales of gasoline-powered vehicles have shrunk and E.V.s have soared. Electric cars were almost a quarter of China's market last year, compared with less than 6 percent in the United States, and are expected to be over a third by the end of this year.
Ford Motor sold one million cars and light trucks in China in 2016 and in 2017 but barely 400,000 last year. Hyundai Motor, the South Korean giant, sold 1.8 million cars in China in 2016 and only 385,000 last year.
General Motors, which once vied with Germany's Volkswagen for market leadership, has lost nearly half its sales in China. G.M. would be faring even worse if not for Wuling, a joint venture in which G.M. has a 44 percent stake. Wuling sells ultra-cheap pickup trucks and microvans that cost $ 4,800 to $ 21,800 and have slender profit margins.
The market share of China's domestic car companies rose to 52 percent in the last quarter of 2022, from 47 percent the year before, largely on a huge rise in electric vehicle sales. The best-selling brand is BYD, in which Warren E. Buffett was an early investor. It now holds 10.3 percent of the car market, up from 2.1 percent four years ago and supplanting the Volkswagen brand as China's leader.
Volkswagen has also lost share, although less so than most foreign automakers. It plans to hold the worldwide introduction of its new ID.7 electric sedan in Shanghai on Monday.
A Volkswagen spokesman said the company had already doubled sales of its ID. series of electric cars last year, and was refusing to cut prices like some competitors just to maintain the number of cars sold. G.M. plans to introduce four new electric vehicles this year in China for its Buick, Cadillac and Chevrolet brands, and plans to convert more than half its factory capacity in China to electric cars by 2030.
Volkswagen is so concerned about the China market that it chartered two flights from Germany to Shanghai to bring board members of the Volkswagen Group and its VW, Audi and Porsche brands to the auto show, said a person familiar with the company's plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were not public. Volkswagen declined to comment on its auto show travel arrangements.
Electric vehicle sales have grown more slowly this year after national subsidies for purchases expired at the end of December. Sales of gasoline-powered cars have plunged as a purchase tax on them has been restored after a suspension during the pandemic.
Tesla, which sells only electric cars, has had slower growth lately than Chinese electric car manufacturers, prompting the company to cut prices. That has set off a wave of discounting. Many consumers have waited to buy cars while watching whether electric car subsidies or purchase tax reductions will be restored.
"The weakness should be short term, because the weak sales were caused by the price chaos in March," said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.
Multinational companies including Volkswagen and G.M. had introduced electric cars that looked like their gasoline-powered models, with the hope of achieving a gradual transition. But Chinese consumers have gravitated instead toward the flashiest electric car exteriors and interiors available.
Mr. Cao, the Porsche enthusiast, dismisses most designs of multinational automakers as dull.
"They are far behind, no matter whether it is the U.S. ones and even the German ones," he said. "They don't even seem to be in the same age."
Car fashions change quickly in China. Mr. Cao said that he was active in a 350-member club of Chinese buyers of the Sport Turismo version of the Porsche Panamera sedan, and that he knew of at least 50 others who, like him, were buying the Li Auto L9 sport utility vehicle.
Unlike most large S.U.V.s on the global market, the L9 is electric. It has a small gasoline engine as a backup that can recharge the vehicle's hefty battery pack. But the engine does not provide power to move the vehicle itself.
Mr. Cao said he doubted he would need the backup engine. He plans to drive the S.U.V. for day trips to large parks on the outskirts of Shanghai, recharging it at home each night. Such outings have become popular in China with the end of "zero Covid" quarantines and municipal lockdowns. For longer travel to other cities, he said, he would fly or take one of China's many bullet trains.
Even the maneuvering for choice display locations at auto shows like the one in Shanghai has changed. Until the last several years, Chinese automakers vied to put their displays close to multinational brands like Mercedes-Benz, in the expectation that Chinese car buyers would flock to the multinational brands and might see the local brands along the way.
But now, it's Chinese electric car brands that other companies want to surround on the showroom floor, said Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chrysler China. "You want to be closer to them -- the Chinese companies have the hottest battery electric vehicles," he said. "Foreign automakers don't have the same halo now."

China’s Car Buyers Have Fallen Out of Love With Foreign Brands

SHANGHAI — For years, foreign automakers in China had a bead on customers drawn to luxury brands, like the Cao family in Shanghai. Not anymore.
Ben Cao and his wife, Rachel, both 36, are trading down from two Porsches to one, a gasoline-fueled $290,000 Porsche 911 sports car, and buying their first electric vehicle, a $70,000 SUV designed and manufactured in China by a company called Li Auto.
“If you’re sitting in a Li Auto, the first feeling is of luxury,” said Ben Cao, a business consultant.
The rapid rise of Chinese electric carmakers like Li Auto, BYD, Nio and Xpeng Motors is the main preoccupation of the executives, engineers and designers arriving in Shanghai for the start of the city’s auto show Tuesday. The country is now the world’s largest car market, and the home teams are routing multinational competitors that had until now mined the riches of China’s giant pool of customers. Buyers like the Caos, and China’s car companies, have embraced electric vehicles much more rapidly than almost anyone anticipated.
The rise of Chinese auto companies, often subsidized by local governments in cities where they have factories, is another illustration of the country’s dominance in electric cars. China now manufactures and sells — at home and abroad — most of the world’s electric cars. Its prowess extends to the entire value chain for electric cars: It makes almost all of the cars’ electric motors and refines most of the chemicals used for lithium batteries. China even leads in developing what could be the next generation of technology, sodium batteries.
More than 80% of the electric cars sold in China last year were made by domestic automakers. Last autumn, they overtook multinational companies in the total number of gasoline-powered or electric cars sold each month.
“Multinationals’ market share in China will likely continue to decrease due to the continuous development of Chinese automakers, especially in the electric car segment,” said Stephen W. Dyer, a managing director in the Shanghai office of Alix Partners, a consulting firm.
As foreign automakers encounter problems in China, they are being pushed to shift more quickly to electric cars in Europe and the United States. The European Union and California want automakers to sell only zero-emission vehicles by 2035. And the Biden administration this week proposed emissions rules that would effectively require about two-thirds of new passenger cars sold in the United States to be electric by 2032 — standards that some automakers have complained are too stringent.
With a couple of exceptions like Tesla, which China welcomed in 2018 for its technology, Beijing has compelled foreign companies to operate through joint ventures with Chinese automakers. Over the past four decades, multinational companies have trained an entire generation of Chinese auto engineers — many of whom now work for highly competitive domestic rivals.
Today the number of cars sold by the foreign companies’ joint ventures has plummeted as sales of gasoline-powered vehicles have shrunk and EVs have soared. Electric cars were almost a quarter of China’s market last year, compared with less than 6% in the United States, and are expected to be over a third by the end of this year.
Ford Motor sold 1 million cars and light trucks in China in 2016 and in 2017 but barely 400,000 last year. Hyundai Motor, the South Korean giant, sold 1.8 million cars in China in 2016 and only 385,000 last year.

Challenges Could Stall Biden's E.V. Revolution: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The administration's push to supercharge E.V. sales must now surmount resistance from manufacturers and consumers as well as likely legal challenges.
WASHINGTON -- Aggressive rules proposed by the Biden administration to drastically speed up the country's transition to electric vehicles, and significantly cut the auto pollution that is dangerously heating the planet, face several economic, logistical and legal challenges.
The plans, outlined Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency, are designed to ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars and a quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032. If enacted as proposed, the regulations would mean a quantum leap for the auto industry in the United States, where just 5.8 percent of new cars and less than 2 percent of trucks sold last year were all-electric.
Transportation is the single largest source of greenhouse gases generated by the United States, the second-biggest polluting country after China. To head off climate catastrophe, President Biden has promised to cut the nation's emissions in half by 2030. Shrinking tailpipe emissions is key to that plan.
But to transform the American automobile industry on the scale it envisions, the Biden administration has to surmount resistance from manufacturers and consumers as well as likely legal challenges from those who consider the regulations government overreach.
One of the most important aspects of a wholesale transition to electric vehicles has to do with timing.
Although nearly every automaker has already invested billions in electrification, the proposed regulations create a dilemma: how to continue to manufacture gasoline-powered vehicles, which provide profits, while investing even more in new electric facilities. The aggressive timeline envisioned by the government means the carmakers could also struggle to source the materials required for vehicle batteries, already difficult to obtain.
Market demand is another challenge. Even with federal tax incentives of up to $ 7,500 for consumers, electric vehicles cost more upfront than conventional cars and trucks. At the end of 2022, the price of an average new car was $ 49,507 compared with $ 61,448 for an electric vehicle, according to the Kelley Blue Book. But even for motivated consumers who can afford electric vehicles, a major stumbling block is what's known as range anxiety, the fear of being stranded because an electric vehicle cannot reach its destination on a single charge and not enough fast-charging stations exit.
"This was always a transformation that was going to happen over decades," said Stephanie Brinley, an automotive analyst at S&P Global. "Putting this aggressive a timeline on it means that there are a lot of things that have to happen consecutively and concurrently."
Looming over all of this is an all-but-certain legal and political threat: The new rules could be erased by the courts or a future president.
In many ways, the industry is already moving into an all-electric future. General Motors has set a goal of phasing out the sale of all internal combustion vehicles by 2035. Ford Motor has said it hopes E.V.s make up half of its sales by 2030. Volkswagen and Stellantis, the company formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, have similar targets. Hyundai and Nissan are also ramping up E.V. production.
But the proposed regulations would require even more of automakers.
Ford is on track to spend $ 50 billion between 2022 through 2026 on its electric vehicle production, with two battery factories under construction in Kentucky, and a third planned in Tennessee, along with an electric truck plant. In February it announced it would build a $ 3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan with a Chinese partner.
The automaker, however, will most likely need to spend billions more if electric vehicles are to make up two-thirds of the more than two million vehicles that it sells in North America annually.
The risks of accelerating the transition away from gasoline-powered vehicles are "high, if not very high," for the industry, said Matthias Heck, a vice president at Moody's Investors Service, "because electrification will require further substantial investments into new battery electric vehicles, battery technology, supply chain and manufacturing capacity, and charging infrastructure."
Ford and other automakers also have not yet secured sufficient sources of lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and other materials needed for automotive batteries, and it is unclear where they will get them.
While the Biden administration is betting that electric vehicle costs will come down with mass production, Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis, said the difficulty of sourcing materials worked against that. "The affordability is not there because the raw materials are scarce and very expensive, and, I would add, very volatile," Mr. Tavares said at a recent conference in Detroit.
Manufacturers are funding their electric vehicle production now from substantial profits on their gas-powered trucks and sport utility vehicles. But maintaining profitability as they produce more electric vehicles and fewer gas-powered models will be a challenge, experts say.
General Motors has said it is not yet making money on its electric vehicles, and Ford recently said its electric division was set to lose $ 3 billion this year. Both companies hope to turn the corner as they ramp up production of electric models but are also trying to cut costs now, especially in view of the uncertain economy.
G.M. is in the process of eliminating 5,000 jobs as part of an effort to reduce costs by $ 2 billion. Ford last year began to trim about 3,000 jobs from its work force.
"Getting to 50, 60 percent E.V.s is certainly possible," said Sam Abuelsamid, a principal research analyst at Guidehouse Insights. "But this isn't going to be easy. Not at all."
And while the pace of electric vehicle purchases is ticking up, many car buyers are uncertain about the new technology.
"We're making sales to early adopters and easy adopters but we need to get beyond them," said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents large U.S. and foreign automakers. "We have a long way to go."
The most basic hurdle is price.
The federal government will offer buyers up to $ 7,500 in tax credits for the purchase of an electric vehicle for the next decade, depending on how much of the vehicle was made in the United States. But of the 91 unique electric vehicle models now on the market in the country, fewer than 40 qualify for the tax credits, Mr. Bozzella said.
Drivers are also worried about charging electric vehicles. There are currently 130,000 public electric vehicle charging stations in the United States, according to the White House. Under the 2021 infrastructure law, the government will spend $ 7.5 billion to build half a million electric vehicle charging stations along federal highways. But a January report from S&P Global concluded that the nation would need more than 2 million public charging stations by 2030, in addition to private home and garage chargers.
Doug Freeman, an insurance executive in Amesbury, Mass., is an obvious customer for an electric vehicle. He has a 140-mile round trip commute to work, and currently drives a Chevrolet Volt hybrid. "For me, the green side isn't number one on the priority list, but the savings on fuel from an electric vehicle would be a lot more than for the average consumer," he said.
But the model he covets, the Kia EV6, is not made in the United States and doesn't qualify for the $ 7,500 tax credit. "Without the credit, it's $ 50,000 to $ 54,000," Mr. Freeman said. "I've never paid more than about $ 33,000 for a car."
Electric vehicle makers are making use of one way to win over consumers: rentals. In 2021, Hertz, the car rental company, bought 100,000 Teslas, making E.V.s 20 percent of its fleet. Most other major car rental companies are also adding electric vehicles to their fleets.
"Rental cars are an excellent way to move E.V.s from niche to mainstream," said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization. "It offers consumers a way to test-drive electric vehicles for a few days, see if they like them, see how they feel about range anxiety," he said.
By purchasing American-made electric vehicles such as Teslas, the rental companies receive $ 7,500 in tax credits per car. And the Biden administration has made it easier for the rental companies to resell the cars after a few years: buyers can receive up to $ 4,000 in tax credits for the used electric cars.
"Through the incentives and the new laws, the administration has put in place a lot of policies to help automakers get where this regulation says they need to go," Ms. Brinley of S&P Global said.
Even if companies can churn out affordable electric vehicles at a fast pace, and consumers get over range anxiety, the proposed regulations are certain to be hit with legal challenges or be subject to shifting politics.
Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, called the regulations "a major step toward a ban on the vehicles Americans rely on."
"As proposed, this rule will hurt consumers with higher costs and greater reliance on unstable foreign supply chains," Mr. Sommers said.
Former President Donald J. Trump relished rolling back the auto pollution regulations enacted by his predecessor, Barack Obama. A future president could do the same to the Biden regulations.
A group of Republican attorneys general, many of them from oil-producing states, has already challenged several of the Biden administration's climate polices, none of which are as ambitious as the proposed auto pollution regulations.
Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia suggested on Wednesday that the group would fight the newest proposals.
Steven G. Bradbury, who served as the chief legal counsel for the Transportation Department during the Trump administration, said the regulations would amount to government overreach.
"They are using this established, longstanding statute for an entirely new purpose, to force an entirely new goal: the transformation of the industry to electric vehicles," said Mr. Bradbury, a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas. "This is clearly driven by the president's directive to achieve these results. I don't think you can do this. Congress never contemplated the uses of statutes in this way."
Jody Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard University, who also served as a climate adviser to President Barack Obama, argued that the Clean Air Act has been used successfully for years to compel polluting industries to invest in new technologies to reduce emissions.
"All of that is part of the normal course of how E.P.A. has set standards," she said.
But she conceded that it may not be seen that way by the current Supreme Court, consisting of six judges appointed by Republican presidents, including three named to the court by Mr. Trump.
"It is a court that is very unsympathetic to regulation of any kind, and particularly hostile to the E.P.A.," Ms. Freeman said.

Full text: Jane Freilicher
Through April 22. Kasmin, 509 West 27th Street, Manhattan. 212-563-4474; kasmingallery.com.
Jane Freilicher's paintings of the late 1950s are technically abstractions, though like those of many of her second-generation Abstract Expressionist peers, they speak with a representational lilt, her washy daubs resolving into the open landscape of Southampton on Long Island, where she spent her summers. They're less a departure from the traditional compositions of intimate domestic scenes‌ -- cut flowers and still lifes -- she was making before than a layover, eventually returning to them.
Perhaps the East End, with its ghosts of Pollock, loosened Freilicher's brush. There's a stirring tension between form and object in the dozen pictures on view here, numinous, brushy oils made between 1958 and 1962. Maybe that's because they were not made en plein air but rather after Freilicher returned to her Greenwich Village studio, and so depict less the salt air and patchy scrub of South Shore marshes but inventions of them, their memory effervescing like sea spray.
Freilicher's dedication to her unfashionable subject matter is transfixing; she never tired of the languid view from her window -- "opulent beauty in a homespun environment," as she put it. "Untitled (Mecox Bay and Field)" circa 1958, with its loosely applied strokes on a creamy ground redolent of sand dunes, is like an exploded Bonnard, lyricizing the ambient East End light in blotches of gold and green refracted as if off water. These aren't so much about sentimentality than reverence. They flatten the space between foreground and background, their lack of pictorial depth contributing to a weightless quality, like a free-floating world tethered to but distinct from the visible one.

Chris Burden
Through June 24. Gagosian, 821 Park Avenue, Manhattan; 212-796-1228, Gagosian.com
There can't be many artists whose works are as textbook-famous and as rarely encountered as Chris Burden's. We can't expect to see repeats of the 1970s performances for which he was nailed to a Volkswagen Beetle or shot in the arm with a .22. He died in 2015, and even when he was living those were one-offs. But this rare Burden show presents other examples of the Angeleno's radical works of the 1970s. They shifted the boundaries of art, which makes them now look safely "artistic" and gallery-worthy.
The show gathers several of the "relics" -- Burden's term -- meant to stand for his performances: An empty display case represents "Disappearing," a piece for which he made himself scarce for three days; a telephone and cassette recorder represent "Wiretap," for which Burden taped calls with art dealers.
There's also footage of Burden's shooting and of "Bed Piece," a well-known performance that had him lying in a gallery for 22 days.
More surprising are the one-minute "TV Commercials" that let Burden infiltrate art into broadcast TV, after buying the ad space required. One of them, "Full Financial Disclosure," sits in Andy Warhol's Business Art genre, revealing the numbers for Burden's 1976 income and expenses -- and for his paltry profit. In "Chris Burden Promo," names of world-famous artists fill the TV one after another: "Leonardo da Vinci," "Michelangelo," "Rembrandt," "Vincent van Gogh," "Pablo Picasso" and then ... "Chris Burden." That final name would once have seemed a joke or wildly wishful thinking, but now it lives cozily with the others. BLAKE GOPNIK
sidony o'neal
Through April 23. Dracula's Revenge, 23 Pell Street, second floor, Manhattan; draculasrevenge.net.
The five works by sidony o'neal at Dracula's Revenge parse the argot of algebraic functions and personal poetry -- its energy comes from shuttling between the two. All from 2023, the installations and prints have titles like "U+220E 0" and "Mo osit." The name of one spindly, oiled steel sculpture, "Hash Table 4 Tensors Like Us," punningly invokes the vocabulary of computing: A "hash table" is a quickly searchable way to store large sets of data, but the sculpture is also a table, as in furniture. Its razor-blade-like legs and distended paisley top suggest the aesthetics of a head shop: "hash" as in hashish.
The language of abstract math underlies the show; its forms seem describable with ornate equations. The reaching fractal shape of the tabletop, and of two leggy gray prints framed with sloping hardwood, have the sense of being tugged by vectors and anchored by points. Abstract art, so-called, comes from the artist's head, while abstract math (for example, the Cartesian grid) derives from the observed world; they meet here in a kind of wild philosophy, where bodies and memories have lines of force and proper places in the matrix. "Generating fn," two unfurling holes roughly sliced in the gallery's grimy gray carpet, applies two mathematically pure shapes to the impurity of the built environment, stains and all; the imperfection of the world refutes the abstraction of algebra, while the floor also takes on some of the promise of a perfect plane. TRAVIS DIEHL
Tauba Auerbach
Through April 22. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, Manhattan, 212-255-1105; paulacoopergallery.com.
Bubbles combine the geometry of perfect spheres with the chaotic behaviors of floating, bursting, conjoining and pressing up against one another. In the dozen paintings, each titled "Foam" (all 2023), Tauba Auerbach finds a mass of bubbles a fitting subject for their coolly elegant art. The exhibition, titled "Free Will," is this New York-based artist's first hometown gallery show since the success of their 2022 San Francisco Museum of Modern Art survey exhibition. The paintings reproduce images of bubbled foam photographed through a microscope, here painted using accumulations of pointillist-like dots. When viewed up close, they resemble topographical maps marked by multicolored pins or even reptile skin.
Shown alongside the paintings on four low metal tables are six beaded glass sculptures, also all sharing a title, "Org" (2023 with one from 2022). In the front of the gallery, where light floods in from the street through frosted windows are seven semicircular arcs of kiln-fired glass mounted on vertical aluminum armatures, again all titled "Spontaneous Lace" (2023). These translucent half-moons feature colored powdered glass that after heating look delicately patterned, like melted lacework. The tabletop beaded sculptures suggest minimalist jewelry as well as instructional models of complex molecules. All of Auerbach's works here seem to capture order at a moment before seizing into chaos, or vice versa. The works may seem at a glance almost coldly scientific, but is there anything more human than the struggle of barely maintaining order with grace? JOHN VINCLER

WASHINGTON — Aggressive rules proposed by the Biden administration to drastically speed up the country’s transition to electric vehicles, and significantly cut the auto pollution that is dangerously heating the planet, face several economic, logistical and legal challenges.
The plans, outlined Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency, are designed to ensure that two-thirds of new passenger cars and one-quarter of new heavy trucks sold in the United States are all-electric by 2032. If enacted as proposed, the regulations would mean a quantum leap for the auto industry in the United States, where just 5.8% of new cars and less than 2% of trucks sold last year were all-electric.
Transportation is the single largest source of greenhouse gases generated by the United States, the second-biggest polluting country after China. To head off climate catastrophe, President Joe Biden has promised to cut the nation’s emissions in half by 2030. Shrinking tailpipe emissions is key to that plan.
But to transform the American automobile industry on the scale it envisions, the Biden administration has to surmount resistance from manufacturers and consumers as well as likely legal challenges from those who consider the regulations government overreach.
One of the most important aspects of a wholesale transition to electric vehicles has to do with timing.
Although nearly every automaker has already invested billions in electrification, the proposed regulations create a dilemma: how to continue to manufacture gasoline-powered vehicles, which provide profits, while investing even more in new electric facilities. The aggressive timeline envisioned by the government means that carmakers could also struggle to source the materials required for vehicle batteries, already difficult to obtain.
Market demand is another challenge. Even with federal tax incentives of up to $7,500 for consumers, electric vehicles cost more upfront than conventional cars and trucks. At the end of 2022, the price of an average new car was $49,507 compared with $61,448 for an electric vehicle, according to the Kelley Blue Book. But even for motivated consumers who can afford electric vehicles, a major stumbling block is what’s known as range anxiety, the fear of being stranded because an electric vehicle cannot reach its destination on a single charge and not enough fast-charging stations exist.
“This was always a transformation that was going to happen over decades,” said Stephanie Brinley, an automotive analyst at S&P Global. “Putting this aggressive a timeline on it means that there are a lot of things that have to happen consecutively and concurrently.”
Looming over all of this is an all-but-certain legal and political threat: The new rules could be erased by the courts or a future president.
In many ways, the industry is already moving into an all-electric future. General Motors has set a goal of phasing out the sale of all internal combustion vehicles by 2035. Ford Motor has said it hopes EVs make up half of its sales by 2030. Volkswagen and Stellantis, the company formed through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, have similar targets. Hyundai and Nissan are also ramping up EV production.
But the proposed regulations would require even more of automakers.
Ford is on track to spend $50 billion from 2022 through 2026 on its electric vehicle production, with two battery factories under construction in Kentucky, and a third planned in Tennessee, along with an electric truck plant. In February it announced it would build a $3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan with a Chinese partner.
The automaker, however, will most likely need to spend billions more if electric vehicles are to make up two-thirds of the more than 2 million vehicles that it sells in North America annually.
The risks of accelerating the transition away from gasoline-powered vehicles are “high, if not very high,” for the industry, said Matthias Heck, a vice president at Moody’s Investors Service, “because electrification will require further substantial investments into new battery electric vehicles, battery technology, supply chain and manufacturing capacity, and charging infrastructure.”
Ford and other automakers also have not yet secured sufficient sources of lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and other materials needed for automotive batteries, and it is unclear where they will get them.
While the Biden administration is betting that electric vehicle costs will come down with mass production, Carlos Tavares, the CEO of Stellantis, said the difficulty of sourcing materials worked against that. “The affordability is not there because the raw materials are scarce and very expensive, and, I would add, very volatile,” Tavares said at a recent conference in Detroit.
Manufacturers are funding their electric vehicle production now from substantial profits on their gas-powered trucks and sport utility vehicles. But maintaining profitability as they produce more electric vehicles and fewer gas-powered models will be a challenge, experts say.
GM has said it is not yet making money on its electric vehicles, and Ford recently said its electric division was set to lose $3 billion this year. Both companies hope to turn the corner as they ramp up production of electric models but are also trying to cut costs now, especially in view of the uncertain economy.
GM is in the process of eliminating 5,000 jobs as part of an effort to reduce costs by $2 billion. Ford last year began to trim about 3,000 jobs from its workforce.
“Getting to 50, 60% EVs is certainly possible,” said Sam Abuelsamid, a principal research analyst at Guidehouse Insights. “But this isn’t going to be easy. Not at all.”
And while the pace of electric vehicle purchases is ticking up, many car buyers are uncertain about the new technology.
“We’re making sales to early adopters and easy adopters, but we need to get beyond them,” said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents large U.S. and foreign automakers. “We have a long way to go."
The most basic hurdle is price.
The federal government will offer buyers up to $7,500 in tax credits for the purchase of an electric vehicle for the next decade, depending on how much of the vehicle was made in the United States. But of the 91 unique electric vehicle models now on the market in the country, fewer than 40 qualify for the tax credits, Bozzella said.
Drivers are also worried about charging electric vehicles. There are currently 130,000 public electric vehicle charging stations in the United States, according to the White House. Under the 2021 infrastructure law, the government will spend $7.5 billion to build 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations along federal highways. But a January report from S&P Global concluded that the nation would need more than 2 million public charging stations by 2030, in addition to private home and garage chargers.
Doug Freeman, an insurance executive in Amesbury, Massachusetts, is an obvious customer for an electric vehicle. He has a 140-mile round-trip commute to work, and currently drives a Chevrolet Volt hybrid. “For me, the green side isn’t No. 1 on the priority list, but the savings on fuel from an electric vehicle would be a lot more than for the average consumer,” he said.
But the model he covets, the Kia EV6, is not made in the United States and doesn’t qualify for the $7,500 tax credit. “Without the credit, it’s $50,000 to $54,000,” Freeman said. “I’ve never paid more than about $33,000 for a car.”
Electric vehicle makers are making use of one way to win over consumers: rentals. In 2021, car rental company Hertz bought 100,000 Teslas, making EVs 20% of its fleet. Most other major car rental companies are also adding electric vehicles to their fleets.
“Rental cars are an excellent way to move EVs from niche to mainstream,” said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research organization. “It offers consumers a way to test-drive electric vehicles for a few days, see if they like them, see how they feel about range anxiety,” he said.
By purchasing American-made electric vehicles such as Teslas, the rental companies receive $7,500 in tax credits per car. And the Biden administration has made it easier for the rental companies to resell the cars after a few years: Buyers can receive up to $4,000 in tax credits for the used electric cars.
“Through the incentives and the new laws, the administration has put in place a lot of policies to help automakers get where this regulation says they need to go,” Brinley of S&P Global said.
Even if companies can churn out affordable electric vehicles at a fast pace, and consumers get over range anxiety, the proposed regulations are certain to be hit with legal challenges or be subject to shifting politics.
Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and gas industry, called the regulations “a major step toward a ban on the vehicles Americans rely on.”
“As proposed, this rule will hurt consumers with higher costs and greater reliance on unstable foreign supply chains,” Sommers said.
President Donald Trump relished rolling back the auto pollution regulations enacted by his predecessor, Barack Obama. A future president could do the same to the Biden regulations.
A group of Republican attorneys general, many of them from oil-producing states, has already challenged several of the Biden administration’s climate polices, none of which are as ambitious as the proposed auto pollution regulations.
Attorney General Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia suggested Wednesday that the group would fight the newest proposals.
Steven G. Bradbury, who served as the chief legal counsel for the Transportation Department during the Trump administration, said the regulations would amount to government overreach.
“They are using this established, long-standing statute for an entirely new purpose, to force an entirely new goal: the transformation of the industry to electric vehicles,” said Bradbury, a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas. “This is clearly driven by the president’s directive to achieve these results. I don’t think you can do this. Congress never contemplated the uses of statutes in this way.”
Jody Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard University, who also served as a climate adviser to Obama, argued that the Clean Air Act has been used successfully for years to compel polluting industries to invest in new technologies to reduce emissions.
“All of that is part of the normal course of how EPA has set standards,” she said.
But she conceded that it may not be seen that way by the current Supreme Court, consisting of six judges appointed by Republican presidents, including three named to the court by Trump.
“It is a court that is very unsympathetic to regulation of any kind, and particularly hostile to the EPA,” Freeman said.

Myriam Ullens, 70, a Baroness Charitable Across the Globe, Dies: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A stepson was held on charges of shooting her over family money. She started institutions in Belgium, Nepal and China, including a major museum in Beijing.
Myriam Ullens, a pastry chef who married a billionaire Belgian aristocrat and turned his fortune into a globe-spanning source of philanthropy, was fatally shot on March 29 in Ohain, a village in the Walloon Brabant province of central Belgium. She was 70.
Her stepson Nicolas Ullens presented himself to the local police and said he had killed Ms. Ullens, the province prosecutor's office said. The authorities seized a handgun from him and proceeded to the home of Ms. Ullens and her husband, Guy Ullens, where they found her dead in a Volkswagen and Mr. Ullens beside her, in a state of shock, with a wounded leg.
According to the prosecutor's statement, Nicolas attributed his actions to a family fight over money and said that moments before he shot his stepmother he had been arguing with her and his father at their home and had been asked to leave. He was being held in jail and has been charged with premeditated murder and violating weapons laws, the prosecutor's office said.
Ms. Ullens's death was a sordid end to a life that had seemed like a fairy tale, or at least a fairy tale in the age of global capitalism.
In the early 1990s, Ms. Ullens (pronounced YU-lens) was raising two children on her own and seeking investors so that she could expand her small pastry business, which had shops in Brussels and Waterloo, Belgium. She arranged a meeting with Mr. Ullens, a titled baron and married father of four who had recently sold his family's beet sugar refinery for $ 1 billion.
When the door opened and he appeared, Ms. Ullens experienced a "coup de foudre" -- a French expression that equates love at first sight with a thunderbolt -- she told the French magazine Madame Figaro in 2014. "He is my Pygmalion, the man whom I love and who made me break out of my shell," she said.
Mr. Ullens, in a 2014 interview with The Kathmandu Post, fondly described her as the "queen of pastry" with a passion for charity.
In 1999, after Mr. Ullens divorced his wife, he married Myriam. The same year, his family firm, Artal, bought Weight Watchers for $ 735 million in what Forbes in 2018 called "one of the best private equity deals ever."
"Guy asked me to quit my company," Ms. Ullens told Global Citizen magazine in 2015. "I accepted, but told him I was going to get involved in philanthropy instead."
In 2000, Mr. Ullens -- whose full surname, which he often abbreviated, is Ullens de Schooten Whettnal -- retired from business, missing out on billions in potential future earnings, according to Forbes. With his new wife, he put his fortune in service to a charitable spending spree.
The Ullenses' most remarkable project, opening in 2007, was the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing.
It "was the first international-standard museum in China dedicated to contemporary art," Alexandra Munroe, senior curator of Asian art at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, said in an interview. "It had capacity in scale that no other museum in China had at the time of its opening, and that very few have even reached since then."
The museum's first exhibition, "'85 New Wave: The Birth of Chinese Contemporary Art," helped establish a new canon in art history. At the same time, the museum brought to China the work of foreign artists like Robert Rauschenberg.
The idea for the museum arose from Mr. Ullens's years of travel to China as a businessman, and from the passion for China he shared with his wife.
"When we started going there in the early 1990s, Chinese contemporary art was not as fashionable," she told Global Citizen.
"Artists hid themselves in the aftermath of 1989," she added, referring to the violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests at Tiananmen Square. "We would visit them in very hidden places, looking at the paintings with a torch in a staircase or a parking lot."
In 2017, the Ullenses sold the museum to Chinese investors in a deal put together by Lunar, a Shanghai private equity firm. Since then, its internationalist spirit has persisted. From this past October to January it presented "Somewhere Downtown: Art in 1980s New York," an exhibition that included more than a dozen works by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring.
The institution has also grown; it now includes three buildings throughout China that draw more than a million visitors a year. Its success has inspired several of the museum's Chinese benefactors to open art institutions of their own, Philip Tinari, the U.C.C.A.'s director, said in an interview.
Myriam Lechien, who was also known as Mimi, was born on Sept. 23, 1952, in Cologne, in what was then West Germany, where her father, Paul, a colonel in the Belgian Army, was stationed. Her mother, Monique (de Drijver) Lechien, was a homemaker.
Her parents sent her to a boarding school in Belgium near the country's border with West Germany. On a trip home, she met a young Belgian soldier named Roger Lemaire, who, like her father, was stationed in West Germany. She married him when she was 18.
The couple had two children, Gilles and Virginie, but divorced when Myriam was in her mid-20s. A second marriage, to Christian de Moffarts, a conference planner, also ended in divorce. In the late 1980s, she began baking pastries in the kitchen of her home and delivering them to restaurants.
Nevertheless, she still found time and energy to try to help those less fortunate than her. She began visiting Nepal after a friend told her that it was an affordable and practical place for charitable endeavors. Her fledgling efforts to help children with poor or absent parents culminated, after she met Mr. Ullens, in her establishment of an orphanage outside Kathmandu, the nation's capital. Nearby, the baron and baroness also built the Ullens School, which offers an international baccalaureate curriculum.
Her other projects included the Mimi Foundation, which created support systems for cancer patients in French and Belgian hospitals; Club des Combins, an organization that provides insurance to the mountain guides of Verbier, an alpine Swiss resort; and Maison Ullens, a clothing line that aims at "the perfect travel wardrobe," according to its website, with stores in Paris, New York and Aspen, Colo.
The European press described the Ullenses as friendly with European aristocrats like Prince Charles and Belgium's king and queen. Their travel between Switzerland, China, France, Belgium and the Maldives led Mr. Ullens to tell The Wall Street Journal in 2013, "Our main 'houses' are a plane and a boat." He complained about the lack of wall space in their Swiss chalet for hanging their art.
Since the fatal shooting, the Ullenses' munificence and glamour have been scrutinized and gossiped about in the Belgian news media. Nicolas Ullens was already a figure of some notoriety as a former Belgian intelligence officer who in recent years had made dramatic accusations of government corruption. Following Mimi's killing, Nicolas's sister, Brigitte Ullens, has publicly defended his character and accused their stepmother of financial selfishness and of dividing the family.
In addition to Nicolas and Brigitte Ullens, Ms. Ullens is survived by her husband; a brother, Philippe; a sister, Geneviève Lechien; her children from her first marriage; two more stepsons; five grandchildren; and many step-grandchildren and step-great-grandchildren.
One factor inspiring the Ullenses to build so many institutions was the pleasure they took in starting something new together, Laurent Degryse, the husband of Ms. Ullens's daughter, Virginie, said in a phone interview.
"They would wake up in the middle of the night, prepare jasmine tea and start a whole conversation," he said. "At the end of the night, the project would have taken another turn."

Automakers Face Test in Reaching U.S. Target for Electric Vehicles

The Biden administration’s plan to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles — reaching a two-thirds share of new cars in less than a decade — pushes automakers further in a direction they have already been going. But meeting the new timetable will be a challenge.
Most car companies are convinced that a transition to electric vehicles is necessary and inevitable, and they have been spending tens of billions of dollars to develop electric models and build the plants needed to produce the cars and their battery packs.
Ford Motor is aiming to have EVs make up half of its sales by 2030, a big step toward the administration’s target. General Motors has overhauled a Detroit factory to make EVs, and it recently started production at a new battery plant in Ohio. Volkswagen makes an electric model in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Toyota has plans for a battery plant in North Carolina.
But the industry and its customers have a long way to go. Although sales of EVs are rising, they accounted for only 5.8% of the 13.8 million new cars and trucks sold in the United States last year.
The Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday is expected to announce auto-pollution limits that are intended to ensure that all-electric models make up 54% to 60% of new vehicles sold in the United States by 2030, and 64% to 67% by 2032.
Those targets will raise the bar on ambitions outlined by President Joe Biden two years ago, when he issued an executive order putting the EV target at 50% of new cars by 2030.
Transportation is the largest source of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to changes in Earth’s climate. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law last year, provides $7,500 in tax incentives for buyers of EVs, which has helped lift EV purchases. The act also provides billions of dollars to support battery production in the United States and the mining and processing of lithium and other minerals needed for battery cells and electric motors.
Still, the push to put EVs into American garages may hinge on people such as John Torrance, of Hamburg, New York, a suburb of Buffalo. A salesperson for a packaging company, he agrees with the idea of cutting greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change, but he has a hard time imagining an EV fitting into his life.
The owner of a 2018 Ford F-150 pickup truck, he often has to haul around a trailer full of equipment for his job, and he sometimes tows a camper for vacations — driving patterns that are not very suitable for EVs. It’s also not unusual for him to have to drive 300 miles on a work trip, and farther when he visits relatives in Michigan.
“I’m a person who likes to go and not have a lot of stops,” he said. “If I’m working, I can’t really wait an hour or more to recharge an EV.”
On top of that, he lives in an apartment, so he would have no way to charge an EV at home.
Whether Americans are willing to accept changes to their work and lifestyle to drive EVs is only one of several hurdles and uncertainties. The biggest is perhaps lithium. The soft, silver-white metal is the key element in EV batteries, and the world produces only a small fraction of the amount that will be needed for a majority of car buyers to go electric in the United States, Europe and China, markets where more than 50 million cars were sold last year.
“Can we really produce enough lithium for that?” asked Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst who follows the electric car business. “We’re not even at 10% now, and it’s difficult for companies to get the lithium they need.”
Although mining companies are racing to expand lithium production, the pace at which they can is unclear. In North Carolina, for example, Albemarle is trying to reopen a pit mine along Interstate 85 near Kings Mountain, 32 miles west of Charlotte.
The mine was in operation from the 1940s to the 1980s, and to reopen it, the company must work out plans for protecting surrounding groundwater, determining if the mine’s steep walls are suitable for new operations and dealing with any contaminants that may be found in the pit lake at the mine’s bottom.
Extracting lithium from the hard ore at the site involves a more difficult and costly process than other sources, and residents in the area have begun working to block the resumption of mining operations.
The supply and production of other metals — including nickel, rare-earth metals, manganese and cobalt — must also increase to support a tenfold rise in EV sales.
On another front, the plants and assembly lines needed to produce millions of EVs every year don’t exist yet. Although GM, Ford and other manufacturers have plants under construction, they will have to produce twice or three times as many battery plants to hit their sales targets and those the Biden administration is setting.
Building and ramping up dozens of new plants will take years, and that process can be fraught. It took GM about three years to complete its battery plant near Lordstown, Ohio, and the start of production has been slow. In the first three months of this year, GM sold fewer than 1,000 EVs with battery packs from the Ohio factory.
Rivian and Lucid, two EV startups, have struggled for more than a year to get plants rolling at the expected pace. Even Ford, which started making its electric F-150 Lightning pickup a year ago, produced just over 2,000 of them a month in the first quarter of this year. Sales of another EV, the Mustang Mach-E, fell 20% that quarter. The company’s goal is to be able to produce 600,000 EVs a year by the start of 2024, and to make 2 million a year by the start of 2027.
Established automakers must balance how fast they increase sales of EVs with how fast they dial back production of the internal-combustion models that currently generate almost all of their profits. Ford recently said it expected its EV division to lose about $3 billion this year, although it forecasts that the unit will be solidly profitable by 2026.
Torrance’s issues with vehicle-charging and apartment-living highlight another obstacle. If tens of millions of people are driving EVs, an exponential increase in the number of public charging stations will be needed, especially of the DC-powered fast-charging stations.
Lastly, even with the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, EVs remain substantially more expensive than conventional vehicles.
Despite the difficulties, Ramsey thinks that continued efforts on all fronts could move the country close to the administration’s goals.
“Two years ago, I would have said there’s no way we get there,” he said. “Now, I’d say it’s at least possible.”

Full text: New federal rules are expected to speed the transition to E.V.s, a shift that car companies have embraced but will be challenged to carry out.

Hobie Landrith, 93, Major League Catcher Who Became the First New York Met: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A major league catcher for 14 seasons, he was the first player picked by the newly formed Mets in the expansion draft in 1961.
Hobie Landrith caught for seven teams in his 14 major league seasons. He was mostly a backup, good enough at handling pitchers but a light hitter. He was never an All-Star. But he did possess a modest claim to fame.
When Landrith died on Thursday at 93 in Sunnyvale, Calif., he was remembered as the original Met.
His death was announced on Saturday by Jay Horwitz, the Mets' vice president of alumni public relations.
The Mets and the Houston Colt .45s (now the Astros), founded as 1962 National League expansion teams, began stocking their rosters in an October 1961 draft. They alternated in selecting players whom the eight N.L. teams viewed as too young, too old or too ordinary to keep.
Houston chose Eddie Bressoud, a shortstop with the San Francisco Giants, as the first pick of the draft. The Mets chose Landrith, also a Giant, as their first selection.
When reporters asked Mets Manager Casey Stengel why Landrith, 31 years old, was anointed as the first Met, he replied: "You gotta have a catcher or you'd have a lot of passed balls."
The Mets played their first game on the night of April 11, 1962, facing the Cardinals in St. Louis. Landrith was catching Roger Craig, who was selected from the Los Angeles Dodgers as the Mets' sixth draft pick. Batting No. 8, Landrith went 0 for 4 and committed one of the Mets' three errors, an errant throw to second base on a steal attempt by Julian Javier, who eventually scored. The Cards stole three bases in their 11-4 victory.
Joe Ginsberg replaced Landrith for the Mets' second game and Chris Cannizzaro was behind the plate for their third game, both losses to the Pirates. The Mets went 0-9 before Jay Hook stopped Pittsburgh in a 9-1 complete-game victory.
Landrith, a left-handed batter, listed at 5 feet 10 inches and 170 pounds, played in 23 games for the Mets. His shining moment came on May 12 when he hit a ninth-inning, two-out, pinch-hit homer into the upper deck at the Polo Grounds off the Milwaukee Braves' future Hall of Fame left-hander Warren Spahn to give the Mets a 3-2 victory.
The Mets used seven catchers in their inaugural season. After Landrith, Ginsberg and Cannizzaro, they trotted out Choo Choo Coleman, Sammy Taylor, Joe Pignatano and Harry Chiti, whom they obtained from the Cleveland Indians in April for cash and a player to be named. That player turned out to be Chiti, whom the Mets returned to the Indians in June.
Landrith was traded to the Baltimore Orioles on June 7 although he was batting .289 with three doubles and his home run and had driven in seven runs. His departure completed a deal in May in which the Mets received first baseman Marv Throneberry, better known as Marvelous Marv for his stumbles in the field.
The Orioles sent Landrith to the Washington Senators in May 1963. They released him after that season and then hired him as a coach in 1964, his last year in baseball.
Landrith had a career batting average of .233 with 34 home runs and 203 runs driven in.
"I was in the major leagues more because I was a good defensive catcher, and the fact that I was good at handling pitchers," he once told the baseball history website This Great Game. "I always thought I was a fairly decent hitter, but I realized that I wasn't in the big leagues for my bat."
Hobart Neal Landrith was born on March 16, 1930, in Decatur, Ill., one of nine children of Charles and Edna (Spalding) Landrith. When he was a child, the family moved to the Detroit area, where his father owned a meat refrigeration business. He was catching in sandlot baseball in the summer of 1945 when a Detroit Tigers scout invited him to catch batting practice for the team.
Landrith was an outstanding catcher at Northwestern High School in Detroit and with Michigan State. The Cincinnati Reds' organization signed him out of college before the 1949 season. He played for the Reds from 1950 to 1955 and then had stints with the Chicago Cubs, the Cardinals and the Giants before joining the Mets.
After leaving baseball, he was a public relations executive with Volkswagen for many years.
Landrith is survived by his wife, Peggy; their sons David, Gary, and Randy; their daughters Carol Landrith, Beth Smith and Linda Warner; his brother Dale; 11 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.
Although Casey Stengel, 71 when the Mets played their first game, was reputed to have fallen asleep in the Mets' dugout at times, Landrith recalled how "Casey had an immense knowledge of baseball."
In a 2003 interview with the Society for American Baseball Research, Landrith remembered how Stengel greeted the 1962 Mets players on the first day of spring training with "one pant leg up, one down, his shirttail hanging out and his hat cocked."
"He looked like a character out of Norman Rockwell," Landrith said.
He noted that Stengel led the players on a tour of the bases, tutoring them on what they should be alert for at each stop if various situations arose and finally asking, "What do you do when you get to third base?"
Stengel answered that one himself: "You score, score, score, and that's what we're gonna do and that's why we're gonna win some ball games."
The 1962 Mets did win 40 games. But they lost 120.

Walmart Plans Network Of E.V. Charging Stations
Walmart plans to have its own network of electric vehicle charging stations by 2030 to tap into the growing adoption of E.V.s. The new fast-charging stations will be placed at thousands of Walmart and Sam's Club stores, alongside nearly 1,300 it already offers in a deal with the Volkswagen unit Electrify America. Walmart's more than 5,000 stores and Sam's Club warehouses are within 10 miles of about 90 percent of Americans. "We have the ability to address range and charging anxiety in a way that no one else can in this country," Vishal Kapadia, Walmart's recently appointed senior vice president of Energy Transformation, said in an interview. As E.V. charging infrastructure ramps up in the United States, there are widespread concerns over uptime, performance, ease of use and high installation costs of the machines. Mr. Kapadia said he expected there will be four chargers on average installed per store. REUTERS

Amazon's Bid for iRobot Faces Antitrust Scrutiny
British antitrust regulators have started investigating Amazon's purchase of the robot vacuum maker iRobot, adding further scrutiny to the $ 1.7 billion deal. The Competition and Markets Authority said Thursday that it was considering whether the deal will result in a "substantial lessening of competition" within the United Kingdom. In an initial step, the U.K. watchdog invited comments on the deal from "any interested party." The acquisition is already facing a review in the U.S. by the Federal Trade Commission amid worries about Amazon's growing market power. Consumer groups had voiced concerns after the deal was announced last year that it would further the e-commerce giant's dominance in the smart home market. The Bedford, Mass.-based company, which makes the popular Roomba robotic vacuum cleaners, said it "continues to work cooperatively with both the F.T.C. in the U.S. and other regulatory agencies in their review of the AmazoniRobot merger."

OpenAI Tries to Resolve Privacy Issue With Italy
The company behind ChatGPT will propose measures to resolve data privacy concerns that sparked a temporary Italian ban on the artificial intelligence chatbot, regulators said Thursday. The Italian data protection authority, known as Garante, last week blocked San Franciscobased OpenAI's popular chatbot, ordering it to temporarily stop processing Italian users' personal information while it investigates a possible breach of European Union data privacy rules. Experts said it was the first such case of a democracy imposing a nationwide ban on a mainstream A.I. platform. In a video call Wednesday between the watchdog's commissioners and OpenAI executives, including Sam Altman, the chief executive, the company promised to address the concerns. The regulators imposed the ban after some users' messages and payment information were exposed. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Ohio Races to Retool for Electric Car Revolution: [National Desk]

Full text: Erick Belmer has seen how tough the car business can be. He was working at a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, when it shut down in 2019, devastating the community.
Mr. Belmer, an industrial mechanic, got another job at a G.M. transmission factory in Toledo, but his commute is now 140 miles each way. His schedule gives him just a few hours with his family and a few hours of sleep.
Yet far from being bitter, Mr. Belmer says he is excited. G.M. is converting his factory to produce electric motors, part of an industrial transformation that will redefine manufacturing regions and jobs around the world.
G.M., Ford Motor and other carmakers announced investments of more than $ 50 billion in new factories in the United States last year, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. All but a small fraction of that money was to build and retool plants for electric vehicles and batteries.
Mr. Belmer is one of thousands of people who will also have to pick up new skills. "It's going to be a little bit of a learning curve," he said at the Toledo factory. "But our guys are well equipped to handle this."
Mr. Belmer and Ohio are bellwethers of how the transition to electric vehicles will play out. G.M., Jeep, Honda Motor and parts makers employ many thousands of people across this state.
Ohio produces more internal combustion engines than any other state, making an adjustment to electric cars particularly urgent. Nearly 90,000 people work in Ohio for carmakers or parts suppliers, and several times that many are employed by businesses that serve those autoworkers and their families.
The changes are putting Ohio at the forefront of a new technology that is critical to fighting climate change. But some jobs will become obsolete, and some companies will go bankrupt. It's an open question whether the winners will outnumber the losers.
"This is the largest transition in our industry since its inception," said Tony Totty, the president of a United Auto Workers local that represents G.M. workers in Toledo.
Mr. Totty is optimistic about the members of his local. But he is worried about other colleagues whose jobs are tied to gasoline engines, he said.
There is "an expiration date on those facilities and those communities," Mr. Totty said.
Warren, in eastern Ohio, knows what happens when a carmaker leaves town. The city has lost one-third of its population, about 20,000 people, since the 1970s, a process that accelerated after G.M. closed the factory in nearby Lordstown, which produced Chevrolet Cruze sedans, in 2019. Sales of that car had been fading as more Americans chose sport utility vehicles.
Even before that shutdown, auto production jobs had been declining. U.S. automakers and their parts suppliers employed about one million people at the end of 2018, down from more than 1.3 million in 2000. In the years before G.M. closed the Lordstown plant, it had reduced shifts and pared its work force.
"Our biggest export for the last 20 years has been talented young people," said Rick Stockburger, the president of Brite Energy Innovators, an organization in Warren that offers work space, advice and funding to start-ups.
Today, things are looking somewhat better. Ultium Cells, a joint venture of G.M. and LG Energy Solution, is ramping up production of batteries near the defunct factory.
Foxconn, a Taiwanese manufacturer, has taken over the old G.M. plant and plans to produce electric vehicles and tractors there. The complex will also house an "electric vehicle academy" established by Foxconn and Youngstown State University to train workers.
That surge in investment is helping to revive Warren's tidy but sleepy downtown. Doug Franklin, the mayor, who worked for G.M. in Lordstown, said he was pleased recently to step into a local restaurant where "nobody knew me, because we had so many new people."
Mr. Franklin represents the optimistic view -- that an industrial renaissance is underway. The pandemic and the supply chain chaos that it caused have made companies leery of components produced far away. That experience, plus billions in federal subsidies approved by Democrats last year, motivated manufacturers to build vehicles, batteries and other components in the United States.
"We're seeing a new level of hope that I haven't seen in decades," Mr. Franklin said.
But community leaders in Warren are also aware that the transition comes with risks.
Hopes that the old plant will become a buzzing electric vehicle factory have not panned out, so far. G.M. sold the factory to Lordstown Motors, a fledgling electric pickup truck company that ran into trouble and resold the plant to Foxconn.
Executives at Foxconn, which has long assembled electronic devices but has little experience making cars, declined interview requests. It's not clear when the company will mass-produce electric vehicles in Lordstown, if ever.
The Rev. Todd Johnson, the pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Warren and a member of the City Council, worries that his mostly African American parishioners won't benefit from the new jobs.
Mr. Johnson, whose parents worked for G.M., encourages young people to study subjects like robotics and coding, and has led after-church trips to a science and technology center in nearby Youngstown.
"There are going to be opportunities coming," he said, "and I desperately don't want to see the next generation of our children miss out."
One pressing question is what will happen to people whose skills are no longer needed.
G.M. is dealing with that issue at the Toledo factory, Toledo Propulsion Systems, which makes transmissions that electric cars won't need. The automaker has committed to retraining the Toledo workers to make electric motors, and to investing $ 760 million to convert assembly lines at the plant.
If anything, G.M. will need more workers, said Eric Gonzales, the executive director of the factory, as it replaces gasoline models with electric cars. "We're taking the employees with us."
The G.M. factory in Toledo will show whether established automakers can compete with Tesla, the fast-growing automaker that can focus all of its resources on electric vehicles because that's all it makes. Established carmakers need to keep earning money from internal combustion vehicles while ramping up a new technology that is not yet profitable.
G.M. has an advantage, Mr. Gonzales said, because it has factories equipped with sprinkler systems, high-voltage power and other essentials. "We already have the four walls here with the infrastructure," he said, speaking above the din of clanking machinery. "Somebody new, they have very expensive capital costs."
Other auto executives prefer to start fresh. Volkswagen's new Scout Motors unit looked at sites in Ohio and other states to produce electric pickup trucks and S.U.V.s, but chose to build a $ 2 billion factory in South Carolina.
It's cheaper and easier to build from scratch, said Scott Keogh, the chief executive of Scout. "You're not juggling this classic dynamic of a legacy internal combustion engine plant where you need to inject a new electric vehicle," he said.
Ohio is in intense competition with other states to attract investment. But Midwestern states, including Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, have been less successful than states in the South where Republican political leaders have courted investment aggressively -- even as they denounce the Democratic policies that helped create the boom.
Since 2020, automakers have announced investments of $ 51 billion in electric vehicle and battery production in the South, compared with $ 31 billion in states in the Great Lakes region, according to the Center for Automotive Research.
Southern states tend to have lower labor costs, in part because most auto plants there are not unionized. This could pose a problem for the United Auto Workers and President Biden, who want the switch to electric vehicles to create more high-paying union jobs. It could well be that most of the new electric car and battery jobs will end up in the South, where unions face political opposition, and not in the Midwest, where unions have political clout -- and where most of the jobs lost in combustion engine vehicles once were.
Ohio has some things going for it. In March, Honda Motor said it would convert one of two assembly lines at its decades-old plant in Marysville, near Columbus, to build electric vehicles. Honda, a Japanese company, is also building a battery factory about an hour away, in Jeffersonville, with LG Energy Solution.
In Ohio, Honda employs more than 14,000 people making cars and motors, and the company's plans will show whether electric vehicles, which require fewer parts than gasoline cars, will create or destroy jobs.
For the next several years, the transition will probably create jobs as carmakers make both gasoline and electric vehicles. Bob Nelson, the executive vice president of American Honda Motor, noted that, at the moment, there was a shortage of skilled labor. "We're going to need everybody," he said in Marysville, where Honda makes Accord sedans.
What happens later is less certain. "When you don't have the complexity that we're used to, with engines and transmissions and mufflers and radiators and exhaust systems and all those components that aren't going to be there anymore," said Bruce Baumhower, the president of a United Auto Workers local that represents employees of auto suppliers in Ohio, "it makes me wonder what's left."
Dana Incorporated, based in Maumee, near Toledo, is also grappling with that question. Dana's employees -- more than 40,000 of them -- make axles, drive shafts and other parts. Electric vehicles need axles but typically do not need long drive shafts because the motors can be placed close to the wheels.
James Kamsickas, Dana's chief executive, has spent time in China and has been struck by the proliferation of electric vehicles there. Recognizing the threat to some of Dana's products, Mr. Kamsickas acquired several firms with expertise in electric motors and other technology.
Dana now offers axles with electric motors built in, saving weight and energy, and it has deployed its expertise in gaskets to make equipment for cooling electric-car batteries that G.M. plans to use. Most of Dana's orders are for products related to electric vehicles.
Ohio's economic future hinges on whether other companies make similar leaps. "You don't have a choice," Mr. Kamsickas said. "Sooner or later, you'd be a melting iceberg."

TOLEDO, Ohio — Erick Belmer has seen how tough the car business can be. He was working at a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, when it shut down in 2019, devastating the community.
Belmer, an industrial mechanic, got another job at a GM transmission factory in Toledo, Ohio, but his commute is now 140 miles each way. His schedule gives him just a few hours with his family and a few hours of sleep.
Yet far from being bitter, Belmer said he is excited. GM is converting his factory to produce electric motors, part of an industrial transformation that will redefine manufacturing regions and jobs around the world.
GM, Ford Motor and other carmakers announced investments of more than $50 billion in new factories in the United States last year, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. All but a small fraction of that money was to build and retool plants for electric vehicles and batteries.
Belmer is one of thousands of people who will also have to pick up new skills. “It’s going to be a little bit of a learning curve,” Belmer said at the Toledo factory. “But our guys are well equipped to handle this.”
Belmer and Ohio are bellwethers of how the transition to electric vehicles will play out. GM, Jeep, Honda Motor and parts makers employ many thousands of people across this state.
Ohio produces more internal combustion engines than any other state, making an adjustment to electric cars particularly urgent. Nearly 90,000 people work in Ohio for carmakers or parts suppliers, and several times that many are employed by businesses that serve those autoworkers and their families.
The changes are putting Ohio at the forefront of a new technology that is critical to fighting climate change. But some jobs will become obsolete, and some companies will go bankrupt. It’s an open question whether the winners will outnumber the losers.
“This is the largest transition in our industry since its inception,” said Tony Totty, the president of a United Auto Workers local that represents GM workers in Toledo.
Totty is optimistic about the members of his local. But he is worried about other colleagues whose jobs are tied to gasoline engines, he said.
There is “an expiration date on those facilities and those communities,” Totty said.
Warren, in eastern Ohio, knows what happens when a carmaker leaves town. The city lost one-third of its population, about 20,000 people, after GM closed the factory in nearby Lordstown, in 2019, that produced Chevrolet Cruze sedans. Sales of that car had been fading as more Americans chose SUVs.
Even before that shutdown, auto production jobs had been declining. U.S. automakers and their parts suppliers employed about 1 million people at the end of 2018, down from more than 1.3 million in 2000. In the years before GM closed the Lordstown plant, it had reduced shifts and pared its workforce.
“Our biggest export for the last 20 years has been talented young people,” said Rick Stockburger, the president of Brite Energy Innovators, an organization in Warren that offers work space, advice and funding to startups.
Today, things are looking somewhat better. Ultium Cells, a joint venture of GM and LG Energy Solution, is ramping up production of batteries near the defunct factory.
Foxconn, a Taiwanese manufacturer, has taken over the old GM plant and plans to produce electric vehicles and tractors there. The complex will also house an “electric vehicle academy” established by Foxconn and Youngstown State University to train workers.
That surge in investment is helping to revive Warren’s tidy but sleepy downtown. Doug Franklin, the mayor, who worked for GM in Lordstown, said he was pleased recently to step into a local restaurant where “nobody knew me, because we had so many new people.”
Franklin represents the optimistic view: that an industrial renaissance is underway. The pandemic and the supply chain chaos it caused have made companies leery of components produced far away. That experience, plus billions in federal subsidies approved by Democrats last year, motivated manufacturers to build vehicles, batteries and other components in the United States.
“We're seeing a new level of hope that I haven’t seen in decades,” Franklin said.
But community leaders in Warren are also aware the transition comes with risks.
Hopes that the old plant will become a buzzing electric vehicle factory have not panned out so far. GM sold the factory to Lordstown Motors, a fledgling electric pickup truck company that ran into trouble and resold the plant to Foxconn.
Executives at Foxconn, which has long assembled electronic devices but has little experience making cars, declined interview requests. It’s not clear when the company will mass-produce electric vehicles in Lordstown, if ever.
The Rev. Todd Johnson, the pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Warren and a member of the City Council, worries that his mostly African American parishioners won’t benefit from the new jobs.
Johnson, whose parents worked for GM, encourages young people to study subjects like robotics and coding and has led after-church trips to a science and technology center in nearby Youngstown. “ There are going to be opportunities coming,” he said, “and I desperately don’t want to see the next generation of our children miss out.”
One pressing question is what will happen to people whose skills are no longer needed.
GM is dealing with that issue at the Toledo factory, Toledo Propulsion Systems, which makes transmissions that electric cars won’t need.
The automaker has committed to retraining the Toledo workers to make electric motors, and to investing $760 million to convert assembly lines at the plant.
If anything, GM will need more workers, said Eric Gonzales, the executive director of the factory, as it replaces gasoline models with electric cars. “We’re taking the employees with us.”
The GM factory in Toledo will show whether established automakers can compete with Tesla, the fast-growing automaker that can focus all of its resources on electric vehicles because that’s all it makes. Established carmakers need to keep earning money from internal combustion vehicles while ramping up a new technology that is not yet profitable.
GM has an advantage, Gonzales said, because it has factories equipped with sprinkler systems, high-voltage power and other essentials. “We already have the four walls here with the infrastructure,” he said, speaking above the din of clanking machinery. “Somebody new, they have very expensive capital costs.”
Other auto executives prefer to start fresh. Volkswagen’s new Scout Motors unit looked at sites in Ohio and other states to produce electric pickup trucks and SUVs but chose to build a $2 billion factory in South Carolina.
It’s cheaper and easier to build from scratch, said Scott Keogh, the CEO of Scout. “You’re not juggling this classic dynamic of a legacy internal combustion engine plant where you need to inject a new electric vehicle,” he said.
Ohio is in intense competition with other states to attract investment. But Midwestern states, including Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, have been less successful than states in the South where Republican political leaders have courted investment aggressively — even as they denounce the Democratic policies that helped create the boom.
Since 2020, automakers have announced investments of $51 billion in electric vehicle and battery production in the South, compared with $31 billion in states in the Great Lakes region, according to the Center for Automotive Research.
Southern states tend to have lower labor costs, in part because most auto plants there are not unionized. This could pose a problem for the United Auto Workers and President Joe Biden, who want the switch to electric vehicles to create more high-paying union jobs. It could well be that most of the new electric car and battery jobs will end up in the South, where unions face political opposition, and not in the Midwest, where unions have political clout — and where most of the jobs lost in combustion engine vehicles once were.
Ohio has some things going for it. In March, Honda Motor said it would convert one of two assembly lines at its decades-old plant in Marysville, near Columbus, to build electric vehicles. Honda, a Japanese company, is also building a battery factory about an hour away, in Jeffersonville, with LG Energy Solution.
In Ohio, Honda employs more than 14,000 people making cars and motors, and the company’s plans will show whether electric vehicles, which require fewer parts than gasoline cars, will create or destroy jobs.
For the next several years, the transition will probably create jobs as carmakers make both gasoline and electric vehicles. Bob Nelson, the executive vice president of American Honda Motor, noted that at the moment, there was a shortage of skilled labor. “We’re going to need everybody,” he said in Marysville, where Honda makes Accord sedans.
What happens later is less certain. “When you don’t have the complexity that we’re used to, with engines and transmissions and mufflers and radiators and exhaust systems and all those components that aren’t going to be there anymore,” said Bruce Baumhower, the president of a United Auto Workers local that represents employees of auto suppliers in Ohio, “it makes me wonder what’s left.”
Dana Inc., based in Maumee, near Toledo, is also grappling with that question. Dana’s employees — more than 40,000 of them — make axles, drive shafts and other parts. Electric vehicles need axles but typically do not need long drive shafts because the motors can be placed close to the wheels.
James Kamsickas, Dana’s CEO, has spent time in China and has been struck by the proliferation of electric vehicles there. Recognizing the threat to some of Dana’s products, Kamsickas acquired several firms with expertise in electric motors and other technology.
Dana now offers axles with electric motors built in, saving weight and energy, and it has deployed its expertise in gaskets to make equipment for cooling electric car batteries that GM plans to use. Most of Dana’s orders are for products related to electric vehicles.
Ohio’s economic future hinges on whether other companies make similar leaps. “You don’t have a choice,” Kamsickas said. “Sooner or later, you’d be a melting iceberg.”

For Her, Nothing Human Is Alien: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: In "Humanly Possible," Bakewell brings her signature blend of wit and philosophical sophistication to the complex, sometimes contentious 700-year history of humanist thought.
What does it mean to be human? It's an ancient question that's hard to answer, but easy to ask.
Each year, a steady stream of books and podcasts explain how to be human at work, in relationships, in a changing (or technical, or warming, or whatever) world. Meanwhile, in some intellectual quarters, "humanism" is seen as a mask for elitism, bourgeois complacency or worse -- when it isn't dismissed entirely as a uselessly squishy concept.
Enter Sarah Bakewell, who is no stranger to the art of applying sophisticated philosophical thinking to the urgent business of daily life. In 2010, she had a breakout hit with "How To Live," an experimental biography of the 16th-century French essayist Michel de Montaigne that brought a cheeky, self-help-inflected wit to the subject. (Step One: "Be born.")
Next came "At the Existentialist Café: Freedom, Being and Apricot Cocktails," her 2016 group portrait of Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Simone de Beauvoir and other thinkers who wrestled with the intertwined philosophical and political crises of the 20th century.
Now, she's back with "Humanly Possible: Seven Hundred Years of Humanist Freethinking, Inquiry and Hope," a history -- and defense -- of the grand humanist project, from the first stirrings of the Italian Renaissance to today's debates about technology, artificial intelligence and transhumanism.
That might sound big and, well, blobby. And even Bakewell acknowledges, in characteristically understated -- and British -- fashion, that the whole subject can be "gently foggy."
"Humanly Possible," published this week by Penguin, aims to bring some clarity to the issue, while also connecting two kinds humanism that are often seen as separate: the tradition of learning and inquiry that in the West goes back (at least) to the umanisti of Renaissance Italy, and the lineage of religious freethinkers who have tried to create a God-free system of ethics.
"I was interested in the big question: What is the relationship between these two kinds of humanism?" Bakewell said in a video interview from a small town in the Marche region of Italy where she spends part of the year. "I am very immersed in both of these traditions, which are often referred to as if they had nothing to do with each other, and it's just an accident they share the word."
Even today, she said, overtly nonreligious humanists are sometimes viewed with suspicion, and seen as too aggressive, too negative. For Bakewell, hopefulness, connection and good cheer are central to all humanist enterprise.
"My idea was to take what's presented as negative thing -- 'I don't want to be associated with that lot' -- and turn the whole investigation into a positive thing," she said. "What do they have in common? And what's interesting about the shared parts?"
Bakewell's books are anchors on the growing shelf of recent popular books exploring complex philosophical ideas, from historically-grounded narratives like Jim Holt's "Why Does the World Exist?" and Stephen Greenblatt's "The Swerve" to newer entries like Regan Penaluna's "How To Think Like a Woman" or Julian Baggini's "How to Think Like a Philosopher."
But the particular charm and power of Bakewell's writing, admirers say, is the way she focuses on "-ists" more than "-isms," treating ideas as grounded in the idiosyncrasies of individual lives.
Asked to sum up Bakewell's approach, Eric Banks, the director of the New York Institute for the Humanities, where Bakewell was a writer in residence in 2015, paused a moment, then offered a tentative "Bakewellian?"
"The generosity you can feel on the page, the enthusiasm -- that's her personality," he said.
He added: "There's the old joke about eating your vegetables. But with her, you never get a sense you're being told to read something that's good for you."
Bakewell, 59, was born in Bournemouth, England, to bookish parents who ran a small hotel. On her website, she recalls how they would "bundle me into a well-padded drawer and load me into the back seat of the car, then head off to Switzerland or Russia."
When she was around 6, the family spent two years wandering through India in a Volkswagen bus before settling in Sydney, Australia, where her father ran a university bookstore and her mother worked as a librarian. They moved back to Europe, taking off regularly for family backpacking trips through Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands.
At the University of Essex, in Britain, Bakewell started studying literature, then drifted to philosophy, spurred by the school's unusual mandatory curriculum for all first-year students, which was grounded in Continental philosophy, rather than the analytic, language-focused variety dominant in most Anglo-American universities.
She enrolled in the Ph.D. program, and planned on writing a dissertation about Martin Heidegger (whose tilt toward Nazism she discusses in "At the Existentialist Café"), but got disillusioned. "The wind really went out of my sails on that one," she recalled.
Instead she moved to London to become a writer, working a series of "really awful" day jobs, including one in a tea-bag factory. After doing a postgraduate degree in artificial intelligence, she got a job as a librarian and then a curator and cataloger of early modern books at the Wellcome Trust, a London-based charitable foundation dedicated to the relationship between health, culture and medicine.
Her first book, "The Smart," an 18th-century true crime story involving an infamous courtesan, was based on an obscure pamphlet she came across in the collection. It was followed by "The English Dane," about Jorgen Jorgenson, a 19th-century adventurer who founded the first European colony in Tasmania.
"How to Live" was inspired by another moment of serendipity. About 30 years ago, she was in Hungary, looking for something to read during a train ride, when she picked up a copy of Montaigne's essays. She was enthralled.
Montaigne pops up again in "Humanly Possible." Bakewell describes how he "trashes all the humanistic pieties on the subject of reading," defending, for example, the right to unapologetically toss a dull book aside.
"What he looks for in a book is to make some kind of contact with the person who wrote it, that sense of the personality of the author," Bakewell said. "I feel that too."
The pyramid of exemplary humanists featured on the cover of the U.S. edition includes Zora Neale Hurston and Frederick Douglass. But Bakewell takes a primarily European perspective, looking at the familiar, and often unfamiliar, dead white guys with fascination and sometimes irreverent intimacy.
Among her personal heroes, she says, is Lorenzo Valla, the 15th-century Italian humanist who exposed as a forgery a 4th-century text, "The Donation of Constantine," that was believed to cede the Italian peninsula to papal rule.
Valla "is a kind of philologist-hero," she said, with a laugh. "I like his fearlessness, the way he just attacks everything he thinks wasn't right, using a lot of humanist tools -- killer philology, but also historical argument. And all this massive rhetoric! 'You dolt,' 'You idiot' -- he did like to lay it on thick."
Bakewell also confesses "a soft spot" for the early 20th-century Oxford philosopher and activist Bertrand Russell and for the Victorian literary critic Matthew Arnold, hardly fashionable figures these days.
Today, Arnold's vision of culture as "sweetness and light" is often mocked as elitist hokum. But Bakewell sees in Arnold a democratizing spirit, as well as a "cheeky humor" that surprised her when she got around to actually reading his 1882 book "Culture and Anarchy."
As for Russell, she acknowledges his less savory sides -- he was likely a "sex addict," she writes, a relentless womanizer. But she admires his prickly humor and unflagging activism, from his pacifism in World War I to his support for nuclear disarmament in the 1970s.
"He really urged people to live with more hope and less fear," she said.
Bakewell, who mostly lives in London, did the bulk of her research at repositories like the British Library. But at one point, she thought she might need to supplement her French, Italian and German sources with some Esperanto. She only got so far as downloading lessons on Duolingo, but its creator, Ludwik Zamenhof, gets a chapter in the book.
Today, Esperanto may seem like little more than a colorful historical oddity. But Bakewell sees the dream of a universal language, and Zamenhof's less well-known effort to create a universal religion called "Homaranismo" -- Esperanto for "humanism" -- as connected with the centuries-long humanist project.
Bakewell also discusses the many critiques of humanism, from figures like the postcolonial writer Frantz Fanon and the philosopher Michel Foucault. She said she sees them as offering less a repudiation than "a valuable overhaul" of humanism.
But "Humanly Possible" is a fundamentally sunny, companionable, let's-get-along book, in keeping with Bakewell's own temperament.
While working on the book, she got involved with Humanists UK, founded in 1896, which advocates for "a tolerant world where rational thinking and kindness prevail." The updated Declaration of Modern Humanism, adopted in 2022 by Humanists International, is included in an appendix.
But unlike the so-called New Atheists, with their caustic dismissals of religion, Bakewell is hardly spoiling for a fight.
"Religion is itself a very distinctively human activity," she said. "And if you're trying to put human culture, human activity, at the center of your thinking, there's something very odd about turning your back completely on religion."
For Bakewell, the essence of humanism lies not in grand ideas but the idiosyncrasies of individual experience -- and the joyful strangeness of language itself.
Take "thitherward," a word Bakewell stumbled upon, delightedly, thanks to Arnold, who urged everyone to work "to enlarge and increase the volume of the human stream sweeping thitherward."
"I just love that word," she said. "We should bring it back."

Fewer E.V.s Will Qualify For Credits: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The Biden administration hopes its guidelines for up to $ 7,500 in tax credits will encourage automakers to reduce their reliance on China for batteries and raw materials.
The Biden administration on Friday released new rules that will significantly shorten the list of electric vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits. Officials hope the change will push carmakers to move their supply chains out of China and to the United States or its allies.
The rules, issued by the Treasury Department, are a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, which Democrats passed last year to fight climate change by encouraging the use of zero-emission vehicles and green energy. The law also seeks to reduce the industry's reliance on China, which makes most of the world's batteries and dominates the processing of critical raw materials.
For purchases of their electric cars to qualify for up to $ 7,500 in tax credits, automakers must meet strict requirements for where they assemble the cars and batteries and where they get the materials that go into batteries. Only a handful of vehicles are expected to qualify for the full credit when the rules, which are more stringent than previous requirements, go into effect April 18, down from 21 now.
The new rules, which could be revised in response to comments from the public, will require that a certain percentage of the components and minerals in each electric car's battery come from domestic sources or countries with which the United States has trade agreements.
The full list of qualifying cars will not be published for a couple of weeks, but Tesla has begun informing buyers that the changes would affect its lineup. The company said on its website that the least expensive version of its Model 3 sedan, one of the most popular electric cars, would no longer be eligible for the full credit. The car uses a battery made in China.
General Motors said Friday that three electric vehicles it plans to sell this year -- the Cadillac Lyriq and electric versions of the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer sport utility vehicles -- would qualify for the full credit.
James M. Wickett, a partner at Hogan Lovells who focuses on tax and energy policy, said the electric vehicle tax credit was "moving supply chains, to the tune of tens of billions."
"The details matter in a significant way," he added.
One significant detail on Friday expanded the program to include battery minerals from Japan and paved the way for adding more countries, such as the 27 members of the European Union.
Officials in the United States, Europe and elsewhere have also begun discussing plans to build a kind of buyers' club for critical minerals that could exert pressure over the global industry, including setting higher labor and environmental standards for mining, processing and manufacturing.
The race is on for manufacturers whose vehicles don't qualify for the U.S. tax credits to procure the minerals and components that will satisfy the requirements. The credit awards a significant competitive advantage to any car that makes the grade.
To be eligible, at least 50 percent of the components in an electric car battery must be made in North America. And 40 percent of the minerals used to make the batteries, which often contain nickel, manganese and cobalt, must come from domestic sources or from countries that have trade agreements with the United States. The minerals quota will rise every year until it reaches 80 percent by 2027, and the component quota will climb to 100 percent in 2029.
The administration said it would later issue rules clarifying how much investment that companies could receive from countries like China and Russia and still qualify for tax credits. The law includes prohibitions on using critical minerals and battery components from a "foreign entity of concern," a term that includes companies based in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.
Siyu Huang, the chief executive of Factorial Energy, a Massachusetts company that is developing advanced batteries with backing from Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai and Stellantis, welcomed the trade agreement with Japan. But she said it would be "very challenging" to acquire battery-grade lithium because almost all the refineries are in China.
"The critical part of this is really about where the lithium is coming from," Ms. Huang said.
In writing the rules, Biden officials have tried to balance two priorities: Encouraging Americans to buy cleaner cars to mitigate climate change, and trying to bring more factories for cars, batteries and battery materials to the United States and its allies.
Company executives, and some analysts, said the administration had come down on the side of the latter goal. Given the limited number of vehicles that currently qualify for tax credits, some consumers could decide to wait to buy an electric car until more become eligible in a few years, said William Reinsch, the Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
"What always happens if people are uncertain is they hold on to their wallets," Mr. Reinsch said.
Jennifer Safavian, the chief executive of Autos Drive America, which represents foreign carmakers like Toyota, Honda and Volkswagen, welcomed Japan's inclusion and said it would help strengthen supply chains. Yet, she added, the drop in the number of eligible cars would slow the growth of electric cars.
But some lawmakers complain the Biden administration has been too generous to foreign companies. Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a pivotal player in the Inflation Reduction Act's writing and passage, said this week that he may bring a court case challenging the administration's interpretation of the law.
In a statement Friday, Mr. Manchin said that the Treasury Department's guidance "completely ignores the intent" of the act.
"It is horrific that the administration continues to ignore the purpose of the law, which is to bring manufacturing back to America and ensure we have reliable and secure supply chains," he said. "American tax dollars should not be used to support manufacturing jobs overseas."
The legislation has already shaken up the car industry. Immediately after President Biden signed the bill in August, a provision excluded from the tax credits any electric vehicles not made in the United States, Mexico or Canada.
Hyundai and Kia cars made in South Korea no longer qualified, angering that nation's leaders, who felt betrayed by a close military and trade partner. Sales of South Korean-made electric vehicles have since lost market share in the United States.
The law also proved to be a major source of friction diplomatically. Leaders of the European Union, Japan and other U.S. allies feared the program would lure investment away from their countries or force them to offer more generous subsidies to compete with the United States.
Because the European Union, Japan and Britain do not have free-trade agreements with the United States, products from those countries, including battery materials, did not qualify for any portion of the tax credits.
Under pressure from foreign governments, the Biden administration proposed a workaround. In a news release, the Treasury Department said the law did not define the term "free trade agreement," which "could include newly negotiated critical minerals agreements." The Biden administration signed a limited trade deal with Japan on Tuesday covering critical minerals, and is negotiating a similar deal with the European Union.
But the strategy has been strongly criticized by lawmakers in Congress, who have said the administration failed to consult with them on trade policy, or argue that U.S. taxpayer money will now subsidize Japanese industry.
For consumers, the new rules are likely to make many electric vehicles more expensive.
At least some Tesla vehicles are likely to remain eligible. The company makes cars in California and Texas and batteries in Nevada. Ford Motor said it would "soon" disclose whether any of its vehicles qualify.
Carmakers will have to certify whether their vehicles meet the components and minerals requirements. The Internal Revenue Service will enforce the rules. Some vehicles may qualify for only half the credit if, for example, they meet the component quotas but not the minerals quotas.
The list of eligible cars is expected to grow as it becomes easier for companies to buy processed lithium and other materials from U.S. trade partners like Canada and Australia. Numerous companies are developing mines and building refineries. More cars will also qualify once Hyundai, Ford, Honda and other automakers finish building new car and battery plants in the United States.
And a loophole in the law allows companies to collect the credits if they lease vehicles to customers, even if the cars don't meet sourcing and manufacturing requirements. Automakers and their dealers could pass on those credits to consumers by reducing monthly lease payments.

Full text: Vfl Wolfsburg casts itself as an underdog in Germany and in the Champions League. That doesn't reflect reality.
The grounds for VfL Wolfsburg's inferiority complex are thin, at best. This is a club that has been crowned champion of Germany in five of the last six seasons. It has reached at least the quarterfinals of the Women's Champions League in every year of the competition's existence. It has made five finals, and won two of them.
Its squad drips with experience and talent: Alexandra Popp, the German talisman, and her international teammates Svenja Huth, Merle Frohms and Marina Hegering; Lena Oberdorf, arguably Europe's most exciting young player; the seasoned Dutch international Jill Roord, restored to Germany after a couple of years away in England.
By any measure, Wolfsburg is a bona fide superpower, a dominant force domestically and a longstanding contender internationally. And yet even its players seem to have internalized the idea that they are underdogs. A few weeks ago, Popp herself suggested that Bayern Munich -- Wolfsburg's only serious rival for the German title -- had started the season as "strong favorites, and that has been the case for the last couple of years."
It is not quite clear why anyone -- let alone Popp, fully aware of the quality of player lining up alongside her on the field -- should believe that to be the case. The most obvious rationale is that the Bayern's reputation, particularly in Germany, is such that it exerts a kind of reflexive gravity: It has sufficient weight that it is capable of bending light, and logic, around it.
As soon as Bayern started to invest heavily in its women's side, as it did around a decade ago, the natural assumption was that it would win. That is what Bayern does, after all: It wins. It is the club's calling card, an inevitability threaded into its DNA. And to an extent, that is true. Bayern has picked up three Bundesliga titles since 2015. It has been as good as its word. It has won. It has just not won as much as Wolfsburg.
And yet, somehow, the success of Popp and her teammates has still been overshadowed by the rise of Bayern. In truth, it is hard to shake the sense that Wolfsburg's location -- and what might best be described as its nature -- has not worked in the team's favor.
Wolfsburg is a factory town, its identity bound up with Volkswagen, the city's major employer and greatest claim to fame. Both the men's and women's divisions of VfL Wolfsburg are even now regarded, on some subconscious level, as factory teams.
When the women's side lifted its last Bundesliga title, Ralf Brandstätter, the chief executive of the car manufacturer, described the players as "personable and successful ambassadors for the club, for Wolfsburg and of course for Volkswagen." There is not, it does not need to be said, anything especially glamorous about being seen as ambassadors for Volkswagen.
And European women's soccer is undeniably drawn -- at this stage -- to glamour (a charge that can just as easily be laid at the men's game). The Champions League has, for some time, been the private fief of Lyon, a team whose recruitment strategy has long copied that of the Harlem Globetrotters: Its approach has been no more sophisticated than identifying the best players on the planet and working out how much it would take to persuade them to move to the banks of the Rhone.
That model has bled down, not just to Lyon's great domestic rival, Paris St.-Germain, but to the moneyed plains of England's Women's Super League, where Manchester City, Chelsea and, more recently, Manchester United have used their uncontested financial advantages to attract enviable collections of the best players in the world. Bayern has followed much the same blueprint.
Even Barcelona, which prided itself on its homespun approach to success, its idiosyncratic, characteristic style and its inviolable principles, has been unable to resist the pull of women's soccer's increasingly frenzied transfer market. Last summer, it made the English midfielder Kiera Walsh the most expensive player on the planet.
In that context, a team like Wolfsburg -- largely German, devoid of genuine star names (Popp and potentially Oberdorf apart) and based not in one of Europe's grand metropoles but in a city frequently caricatured as little more than a production line surrounded by houses -- is always likely to struggle for the spotlight.
Increasingly, though, Wolfsburg is becoming difficult to ignore. Tommy Stroot's side is on course for another Bundesliga title. If it can avoid defeat at Bayern this weekend and it would enter the home straight with a two-point lead at the top of the table. A second straight European semifinal is on the cards, too, after a 1-0 win at P.S.G. this week.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A quiet confidence is taking root among Stroot's squad that they have nothing to fear, even in the Champions League. "The only thing that can stop Wolfsburg winning it is ourselves," Popp told FIFA.com earlier this month.
Its victory in Paris, in front of a fervid, boisterous crowd, settled a few of the ghosts of last season, when Stroot's team froze in front of more than 91,000 fans at Camp Nou, losing to Barcelona, 5-1, in the first leg of their semifinal.
"We experienced the same noise from the crowd at Barcelona last season," said Dominique Janssen, the Dutch midfielder. "You try to take that experience away with you, and know that it gets easier the more it happens."
The club might not have lifted the Champions League trophy since 2014, but neither Lyon nor Barcelona looks quite as imposing this time around as they have in seasons past. Like Bayern, Chelsea and Arsenal, there is a sense at Wolfsburg that the field is leveling just a little. It might think of itself as an underdog, but the superteam that everyone has forgotten, in the place that nobody bothers to look, has no reason to feel inferior.
Doing Business in Public
The general rule of thumb, when it comes to prospective takeovers of major soccer teams, is that there is an inverse correlation between heat and light. The more public a suitor, the less likely they are to succeed. Among executives regularly involved in these transactions, the dictum runs that the serious bidders are also the quietest.
All of which, of course, has been upended by the ongoing process to find a new owner for Manchester United. As should have been expected, any interested party was made to sign a "strict" and "binding" nondisclosure agreement before being offered access to the club's detailed financial accounts. (There is a tautology here, obviously: Nondisclosure agreements are rarely described as "loose" or "really more of a guideline.")
Still, it might be worth checking the wording. It is not just that the identities of the two leading contenders tussling for the club -- Jim Ratcliffe, a petrochemical billionaire, and Sheikh Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, the son of a former Qatari prime minister and ABSOLUTELY NOT linked to the Qatari state -- have become public. It is that everything else has, too.
It has been possible, in fact, to follow this multibillion dollar transaction in surprisingly forensic detail. There were statements to accompany the submission of their bids, as well as ballpark figures of their valuations of the club. There have been details about when and where they have held further talks with United's current hierarchy ahead of a very public -- and completely artificial -- deadline for offers. Ratcliffe was even photographed at Old Trafford along with his negotiating team.
News organizations tend not to rail against transparency. The more people want to talk, the better, particularly when it pertains to a club that commands as much interest as United. In this case, though, it might be worth pausing to ask who benefits, exactly, from what would ordinarily be a faintly clandestine process playing out in the open.
For the contenders, it presents a chance to win hearts and minds, and perhaps that is no bad thing. For the Glazer family, the current owners, it is a way to smoke out as much interest as possible, and that is entirely their prerogative. For Raine, the bank that has been tasked with overseeing the deal, it is a chance to drive up the price, and by coincidence its commission.
Everyone involved, in other words, is using United -- a club that regards itself, not without cause, as the biggest sporting institution in the world -- for their own ends. United is reduced to a mere asset, a trinket to be haggled over and horse-traded, a passive participant in the proxy wars of billionaires. And that, when it comes down to it, is about as good a definition of modern soccer as you will find.
"Failure"
Julian Nagelsmann always wanted to be Bayern Munich manager. It was the job he coveted more than any other during his meteoric rise, back when he was European soccer's coming force, its baby-faced managerial prodigy, an outsider who was overturning conventional wisdom of what a coach should look like, what steps they needed to take, how old they really ought to be.
When he left his first job, at the equally neophyte Hoffenheim, for RB Leipzig, it was with the express purpose of positioning himself to take charge at Bayern. Leipzig was his designated intermediate step, the place where he would go to get from here to there, to where he always wanted to be.
And though the move worked, he never felt quite like a natural fit with Bayern Munich. The images, early on in his tenure, of him scooting around Bayern's training facility at Sabenerstrasse on a hoverboard felt somehow jarring, a Silicon Valley tech bro on vacation at Neuschwanstein. There always seemed to be just a hint of unease in the air: a hunt for a mole here, an unwarranted, unedifying outburst there.
If the timing of his demise is curious -- he was fired on Friday, with his team in second place in the Bundesliga, a point behind its next opponent, and with a Champions League quarterfinal on the horizon -- then the fact of it was not. Bayern places great stock in having a coach whose face fits. It is a shifting, vague criterion, but one that condemned him in the end. Nagelsmann never felt right, not quite.
His solace, of course, is not simply the Bundesliga title he picked up in his first and only full season in Munich -- proof that nobody fails at Bayern, not in any meaningful sense of the word -- but the fact that he will be able to parlay that experience into something else soon enough.
Bayern, it turns out, will not be his final destination. Nagelsmann will now be a contender for any of the handful of elite jobs that becomes available. Once a manager has broken through that ceiling, after all, it quickly transforms into a floor. The best evidence for that is the man who is replacing him: Thomas Tuchel, fired by Paris St.-Germain and fired by Chelsea, but hired in an instant by Bayern. For Nagelsmann, Munich will be just another step along the way.
Correspondence
We are moving away from the many and varied failings of penalties and onto socks this week, courtesy of Shawn Donnelly. "What's the deal with these Premier League players' socks?" he asked, in the tone (I am assuming) of Jerry Seinfeld. "Half of them seemed to be ripped up in the back. Is this a new style, or can the sportswear brands not produce a sock strong enough for the rigors of the Premier League?"
This is a good question, and in a rare stroke of good fortune, it is one I can actually answer. It is to do with reducing pressure on the calf muscles. Kyle Walker, the Manchester City defender, seems to have been the pioneer in this particular realm of what we may as well, for want of a better word, call science, and now it is almost de rigueur.
Moshe Arenstein, meanwhile, makes a perfectly coherent point of logic. "As we enjoy this great part of the year with amazing Champions and Europa League games, why on earth would the final game be just one game? Isn't the best part of this tournament the home and away? Do we not deserve a final that has two games as well?"
That, of course, was exactly how one European tournament functioned until relatively recently: the UEFA Cup, the forerunner of the Europa League, only switched to a single, showpiece final in 1998. (The Intercontinental Cup, the predecessor of the Club World Cup, ran as a home-and-away affair until 1980.)
This newsletter is not above a dash of misty-eyed nostalgia, of course, but on this one I err on the side of modernity: there is an appeal to a two-legged final, but there is no drama greater than a one-and-done, surely?
And Tom Gantz, rightly, takes issue with my description of dead-rubber group stage games in the expanded men's World Cup as being "pointless soccer."
"Pointless to whom, exactly?" Tom asks. "The chance to watch the best soccer players once every four years is something I won't pass up even if the outcome of every game doesn't actually affect progression in the tournament."
I will cede that point as graciously as possible: No soccer match is truly pointless, is it? And I say that as a man who once attended a group stage game in a minor cup competition in which both teams had already been eliminated, and yet it ended in a penalty shootout anyway.

Germany Pushing E.U. For Exemption to Build Synthetic-Fuel Vehicles: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Berlin and Brussels are scrambling for a solution after Germany calls for allowing cars to run on synthetic fuels. The move could endanger the E.U.'s climate goals.
Germany is negotiating with the European Union to win an exception to the proposed 2035 ban on internal combustion engines to permit cars to run on carbon-neutral synthetic fuels, the country's Transportation Ministry said on Wednesday.
Berlin's abrupt decision in early March to seek a change in the measure on the eve of its final vote has caused a rift among E.U. governments and even automakers, and threatens to undermine legislation that is a cornerstone of the European Union's ambitious plans to make the 27-member bloc carbon-neutral by 2050.
The move is supported by some carmakers, including Porsche, but it has provoked criticism from other manufacturers that have begun spending huge sums to shift their production toward electric vehicles in anticipation of the ban.
Ford Motor and Volvo were among several dozen companies that signed a letter on Monday addressed to European leaders, warning that watering down the terms of a transition to electric vehicles could endanger their businesses as well as the environment.
"The lack of a strong regulatory framework could have significant consequences for businesses' decarbonization plans," the letter read.
Germany's Transport Ministry said it was in talks with European Commission regulators seeking a provision in the measure that would allow for the sale of cars with engines that were capable of running only on such synthetic fuels, known as e-fuels. Tim Alexandrin, a spokesman for the ministry, described the talks as "advanced" and "complex."
The commission is striving to reach an agreement with Berlin before leaders of the 27 member states arrive for a European Council summit on Thursday.
"I am confident that we can find a way to make sure that the interpretation we give to the agreement is also to the satisfaction of the German authorities," Frans Timmermans, the vice president of the European Commission who oversees the bloc's push toward climate neutrality, said last week.
E-fuels are made using electricity generated from renewable sources like wind or solar to separate hydrogen from water, and then combining the hydrogen with carbon dioxide captured from air or other sources. When the resulting fuel is burned in an engine, carbon dioxide comes out of the tailpipe, but the idea is that those emissions are offset by the carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere to produce the fuel.
But e-fuels tend to be expensive and not easily available, and there are doubts about the ability to scale up production by 2035.
If Germany is successful in forcing through a carve-out on e-fuels, it will be the latest time that Berlin has intervened on behalf of its powerful automobile industry to water down Brussels's efforts to curb transportation emissions. More than a quarter of all carbon-dioxide emissions in the European Union are generated by vehicles, according to government statistics.
But with its 800,000 jobs and annual revenue of about 411 billion euros ( $ 443 billion), the automobile industry flexes outsize influence in Germany, Europe's largest economy.
It has long held sway over the country's leaders. Chancellor Angela Merkel intervened in 2013 to prevent European legislation that would tighten emissions rules and, four years later, lobbied again to weaken E.U. emissions testing procedures that were intended to prevent cheating of the kind that Volkswagen committed with its diesel engines.
This time it is Germany's luxury car industry that is pushing back against Brussels's latest attempt to rein in vehicle emissions. Porsche is among the leading proponents of e-fuels and has backed a production facility that opened in Chile last year, even as it continues to develop its popular electric Taycan model.
"E-fuels are a feasible alternative to reduce CO2 emissions rather quickly," Oliver Blume, who is chief executive at both Porsche and Volkswagen, told reporters last week. He said the 1.3 billion vehicles with combustion engines already on the global market would still be driven for decades, especially in developing economies, and would benefit from fuel with no net emissions.
"If you look at climate protection as a whole, this is not only a German or a European issue alone, it is a worldwide affair," Mr. Blume said.
Several companies that supply Germany's auto industry support including e-fuels in the European rules, including Bosch, Mahle and ZF, as well as major energy companies, including Exxon Mobil.
Italy, home to Ferrari and Fiat, joined the resistance after Germany raised concerns, along with the Czech Republic, Austria and Poland. If enough countries decide not to pass the measure, that could endanger its prospects.
But e-fuels have usually been seen as a future fuel for industrial uses, not cars. Even with plans to increase production, the amount of e-fuels projected to be available in Germany by 2035 would be sufficient to meet only 10 percent of the country's fuel needs in its air, shipping and chemical industries, according to a study by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Unlike cars, those industries cannot rely on electrification alone to reduce their carbon footprint, the institute said.
Volker Wissing, a member of the Free Democrats party who serves as Germany's minister of transport, argues that despite such warnings, all options need to be kept open in the push to reach climate neutrality.
"We are convinced that we need every technological solution to achieve our ambitious climate protection targets and keep society mobile," Mr. Wissing said.
But analysts point out that his party, the smallest of the three partners that make up the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, may have been driven by more than just concern for the environment in promoting e-fuels. Since entering the government, the party has seen its popularity nearly halved to just 6 percent, with key state elections planned in Bavaria and Hesse this year. Challenging Brussels could be seen as a way to reverse that slide by attracting approval from Germans who favor combustion engines.
"The Free Democrats always have to worry a bit about their parliamentary existence," said Uwe Jun, a political scientist at the University of Trier, referring to the fact that the party fell out of Parliament in 2013 after failing to meet the 5 percent threshold needed for representation.
Senior German government officials insist that they are confident that the Free Democrats will not let the standoff reach a point of actually sinking the European policy, saying that internally, the party has made clear it would accept a compromise.
"It remains our goal to reach an agreement," Mr. Alexandrin said.

Ans Westra, 86, Incisive Chronicler Of Social Changes in New Zealand: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: She created a comprehensive record of the country's social history, her focus often falling outside New Zealand's white conservative mainstream.
MELBOURNE, Australia -- Ans Westra, a Dutch-born photographer who created the most comprehensive record of New Zealand's social history, comprising more than 300,000 powerful images, died on Feb. 26 at her home outside Wellington, New Zealand's capital. She was 86.
The cause was cardiac complications, said David Alsop of Suite Gallery in Wellington, her friend and gallerist.
From her arrival in New Zealand more than six decades ago until the end of her life, Ms. Westra chronicled the lives of her compatriots with unflinching determination in frames that were praised for their realism and spontaneity. The subjects of her Rolleiflex camera typically fell outside the white conservative New Zealand mainstream, including Māori, New Zealand's Indigenous people.
Her wide-ranging focus sometimes led her into controversy.
"Washday at the Pa," her 1964 book about a rural Māori family with nine children living in poverty, was to be distributed in New Zealand schools. But it became a "political football," as she would later describe it, and all 38,000 copies were recalled, with many being pulped, after the Māori Women's Welfare League said that the images cast Māori in an unfair and unflattering light.
Yet Ray Ahipene-Mercer, whose mother had campaigned against the book, said Ms. Westra's images possessed a rare candor, and that the tempest had been an early example of "what is now universal in Māori circles -- 'nothing about us without us."'
"She saw us," he said at a memorial service for Ms. Westra in Wellington, "and reflected us back on ourselves."
Anna Jacoba Westra was born on April 28, 1936, in the western Dutch city of Leiden. The only child of Pieter Westra, a jewelry merchant, and Hendrika van Doorn, a storekeeper, she recalled a lonely childhood in which she learned to amuse herself.
She was first exposed to photography by her stepfather, who had a Leica camera. A more formative experience came in 1956, when she saw the traveling exhibition "The Family of Man," which across more than 500 photographs sought to portray the universal human condition.
The show, which originated at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, would leave a lasting impact on her choice of style and themes, which were sometimes described as intimate or humanist by her fans and sentimental by her detractors.
In 1957, Ms. Westra graduated from Industrieschool voor Meisjes, a women's technical college in Rotterdam, with a diploma in arts and crafts teaching. That same year she went to New Zealand to visit her father, who had relocated to Auckland, the country's largest city, after the dissolution of her parents' marriage.
Ms. Westra hoped to create a record of the lives of Indigenous New Zealanders that reflected a people in flux, amid intensive urbanization and forced assimilation. Unlike the hackneyed images of Māori created for the tourist market, "my pictures were more natural," she said in an interview with Art New Zealand magazine in 2013, adding, "I was wanting to observe life as it happened, without interrupting it as much as possible."
After working at a pottery factory in West Auckland, Ms. Westra moved to Wellington, where she took a job in a camera shop until she had saved enough money to purchase a secondhand Volkswagen, allowing her to more easily photograph life in rural New Zealand.
By 1962, she was a full-time freelance photographer, traveling around the country, as well as to Tonga and the Philippines, and selling her images to a magazine run by the Department of Māori Affairs and to publications intended for schools. The fees she was paid typically just covered her expenses.
Over the decades that followed, Ms. Westra doggedly recorded life in New Zealand, training her lens on gang members, holidaymakers, rugby players, Māori land rights activists, Islamic New Zealanders, sex workers and many other groups. Snapping from the sidelines, she was an uncommon presence, standing 5 feet 10 inches tall and speaking with a strong Dutch accent, which she retained all her life.
A single mother of three children, Ms. Westra never married and never found alternate employment; she eked out a frugal existence throughout the 1960s and '70s as a freelancer. She struggled at times with her mental health, and she was briefly admitted to a psychiatric ward in the early 1990s.
Photography remained at the heart of her life: Her children often recalled being piled into the back seat of her car to accompany her to marae (Māori meeting houses) for shoots, and living in homes where a room was always reserved for developing film. She celebrated what she saw as her valuable outsider's gaze -- one that gave her distance, even as it later led to criticism.
"I can understand where they are coming from, their questioning it. Why I am the one who has the validity to document them?" she said of her photographs of Māori in the Art New Zealand interview. "I find that being an outsider gives you a clearer vision, but I can understand that questioning of whether my approach is the right one."
After "Washday at the Pa," Ms. Westra produced images for multiple books. While "Māori" (1967) and "Whaiora: The Pursuit of Life" (1985), which was written with Kāterina Mataira, a Māori writer, again focused on Indigenous New Zealanders, "Notes on the Country I Live In," published in 1972, took a broader view of society. And "Ngā Tau ki Muri: Our Future," a full-color book published in 2013, focused on environmental degradation in the New Zealand countryside.
As Ms. Westra's archive grew and she became more established in the New Zealand art world, she began to exhibit her work more widely. In 1985, she established a relationship with the national Alexander Turnbull Library, which retains her black-and-white negatives. Her images have been exhibited at galleries around the world, including in a two-month solo show at the Manhattan photography gallery Anastasia Photo beginning in December 2019. She has been the subject of books and documentaries.
Ms. Westra is survived by her three children, Erik John Westra, Lisa Christina van Hulst and Adrian Jacob van Hulst; six grandchildren; and her half sister, Yvonne van Westra.
In 2013, Ms. Westra went on a six-week road trip around New Zealand accompanied by Mr. Alsop, her gallerist, in which she revisited many of the communities she had captured in the 1960s and '70s, including the village where she had shot photographs for "Washday at the Pa."
Spending a week in each place, she held exhibitions and returned many of her images to her subjects and their descendants.
"It was like bringing the past to the present, through the photographs," Mr. Alsop said in a phone interview. "That was really what we came to do."

Volkswagen Points $193 Billion at E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The German automaker announced a plan to accelerate its transition to battery-powered vehicles and bolster operations in China and North America.
Volkswagen said on Tuesday that it would spend $ 193 billion on software, battery factories and other investments as it aimed to make every fifth vehicle it sold electric by 2025.
The automaker, the world's second biggest after Toyota, will also focus on expanding its presence in North America, where it has struggled for years, and becoming more competitive in China, one of its most important markets, said Oliver Blume, Volkswagen's chief executive.
Mr. Blume laid out a 10-point plan for helping Volkswagen pivot to electric vehicles, a path it began in earnest when it effectively abandoned diesel technology after an emissions cheating scandal in 2015. The plan's centerpiece are investments totaling 180 billion euros, or about $ 193 billion. Two-thirds of that sum will be channeled into producing battery cells, developing software and shoring up supply chains of critical raw materials.
"For me, it is important that we have a clear orientation of where we are going," Mr. Blume told reporters, adding that 2023 would be "a decisive year" for the company. It is his first as chief executive; he took over in September from Herbert Diess, who aggressively pushed Volkswagen to embrace electric cars but was forced out after just four years because of disagreements with the company's board.
Mr. Blume hopes to use some of the proceeds of a 2022 initial public offering of Porsche, where he is also chief executive, to strengthen Volkswagen's electrification strategy. The listing brought in €43 billion.
Volkswagen reported a net profit in 2022 of €15.8 billion, or $ 16.7 billion, an increase of 2.6 percent from the previous year, as supply chains disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic began to normalize.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year caused energy prices to rise and contributed to high inflation, especially in Germany. Addressing those challenges, while balancing the demand for combustion-engine vehicles as the company pivots to electric-vehicle production, will be the main focus in Europe, Volkswagen said.
"We must transform ourselves into a technology and mobility services group," Arno Antlitz, Volkswagen's chief financial and operating officer, said at the Tuesday media event. "We need to focus on our platforms, such as our hardware for battery-powered electric vehicles, a unified software stack, batteries, mobility, autonomous driving."
In the short term, Volkswagen will continue to produce combustion-engine cars, which generate profits that the company needs to pay for the transition to battery-powered vehicles. In 2022, Volkswagen sold 8.2 million cars and trucks.
Despite the German government's call for companies to diversify their operations in Asia, pivoting away from China, Volkswagen is continuing to invest in the country in partnerships with local companies.
Volkswagen is the leading producer of combustion-engine vehicles in China, but has lost ground to domestic carmakers in the fast-growing market for electric cars. Last year, Volkswagen introduced an "in China for China" strategy that it plans to expand, including developing technology and software specifically for consumers there, including in-car karaoke.
The automaker's problems in North America are somewhat different. After years of trying to become a bigger player in the United States specifically, it remains far behind U.S. automakers like General Motors and Ford Motor and Asian companies like Toyota and Hyundai.
Volkswagen retooled its plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., last year to begin producing electric vehicles, and it now produces the ID.4 sport utility vehicle there. On Monday, Volkswagen said it had chosen a site in Ontario for a new battery plant. And earlier in March, the company said it would put up a factory in South Carolina to build pickup trucks and S.U.V.s that would be sold under the moribund Scout brand.
In Europe, a key element of the company's focus includes its first battery cell plant, a €2 billion factory that is rising out of a field in Salzgitter, Germany, near the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg. The new plant sits behind a site where Volkswagen has been building engines for more than 50 years and is slated to become the main provider of battery cells for the automaker.

The Chunky Dunkleosteus: This Tuna-Like Brute Is No Chicken of the Sea: [Science Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: A fossil fish called Dunkleosteus was less svelte shark and more rotund tuna, but that only made it a fiercer predator in the seas of the Devonian Period.
With a bite that could split a shark in two and an armored mug only a mother could love, Dunkleosteus was one of Earth's earliest apex predators, terrorizing subtropical seas 360 million years ago during the Devonian Period. By some estimates, the monster fish measured as long as a school bus.
However, a new study is taking a sizable bite out of Dunkleosteus's estimated size. Russell Engelman, a paleontologist pursuing his Ph.D. at Case Western Reserve University, recently compared the proportions of Dunkleosteus's armor-clad head to the skull sizes of hundreds of living and fossil fish. Last month, in the journal Diversity, Mr. Engelman concluded that these ancient fish maxed out at only 13 feet and were shaped more like stocky tuna than svelte sharks.
For the study, Mr. Engelman examined several Dunkleosteus terrelli specimens at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Many of these fossils were discovered nearby in cliffs along the Rocky River, making specimens of the "Dunk" a prehistoric icon in the city. But little research had been done on Dunkleosteus's size, and some of the past measurements seemed fishy to Mr. Engelman.
Dunkleosteus belonged to an ancient faction of fish known as the arthrodires that ruled the seas during the Devonian. Because the bulk of Dunkleosteus's body was most likely composed of fragile cartilage, only the thick armor plates that encased its head and neck were preserved as fossils. While these plates preserve the predator's jagged jaws, they reveal little about the rest of its body. As a result, most efforts to size Dunkleosteus relied on extrapolating from the proportions of its much smaller relatives.
According to Mr. Engelman, head length is a reliable proxy for body size in fish: Short fish species generally have shorter heads, and long fish species longer heads. He focused on the region between a fish's eye and the back of its head. "The organism can't mess with the size of this area too much because that's where the brain and the gills are," Mr. Engelman said. "If your gills get too small, you suffocate."
He compared the size of this region in Dunkleosteus to the head proportions of nearly 1,000 other species of fossil and modern fish, ranging in size from smallmouth bass to large sharks. After running the measurements through several models, he concluded that the average Dunkleosteus head, which measured around 24 inches, correlated to a fish slightly longer than 11 feet. The largest known Dunkleosteus topped out at around 13.5 feet. Instead of bus-size behemoths, these fish were closer to Volkswagen Beetles, but still bugs that could deliver bone-crushing bites.
Reducing Dunkleosteus's length also alters its proportions. Most reconstructions depict Dunkleosteus with the elongated body of a shark. However, more complete arthrodire fossils reveal that these fish had squatter, cylindrical bodies. Mr. Engelman thinks Dunkleosteus probably resembled a rotund tuna.
This full-figured fish was like an armored Pac-Man. It had a mouth twice as large as a great white's and probably outweighed longer sharks. "People say it's pudge, but that's probably just solid muscle," Mr. Engelman said.
Since the paper's publication, several people have called the fossil fish "Chunkleosteus" on social media. But Mr. Engelman does not think the new estimates take anything away from the ancient predator's prowess.
"People think this is a downgrade, but this is actually an upgrade," he said.
Far from a slow-swimming bottom dweller, Dunkleosteus appears to have been built for fast movements in open water. And even a shorter Dunkleosteus was still the undisputed king of Devonian seas.
Not everyone is totally convinced Dunkleosteus rocked a dad bod. Caitlin Colleary, a paleontologist at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, said it's tough to tell for sure what Dunkleosteus really looked like without more of its body. While cartilage is rarely fossilized, the Cleveland Shale has yielded the cartilaginous bodies of sharks that lived alongside Dunkleosteus.
"Don't get me wrong, I love a chunky 'Dunk,"' said Dr. Colleary, who was not involved in the new study. "But I'm not going to get too attached because in science, especially paleontology, it just takes one new discovery to change everything."

Volkswagen to Build E.V. Batteries in Canada
Volkswagen announced Monday it plans to build a major plant for electric vehicle batteries in Canada.
The European automaker said the Volkswagen Group and its battery company PowerCo will establish its first overseas "gigafactory″ for battery cell manufacturing in St. Thomas, in southwestern Ontario. The start of production is planned for 2027.
The company signed an agreement last year with the Canadian government to work to identify suitable sites for such a facility in Canada.
St. Thomas Mayor Joe Preston said it will be the largest automotive industrial complex in Canada's history.
Ontario Economic Development Minister Vic Fedeli said Canada has gone from being behind the pack in the electric vehicle manufacturing sector to being one of the top players in the battery supply chain remarkably quickly. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Pfizer to Buy Seagen
For Its Cancer Drugs
Pfizer is spending about $ 43 billion to reach deeper into new cancer treatments that target tumor cells while sparing surrounding healthy tissue.
The pharmaceutical giant said Monday it will pay $ 229 in cash for each share of Seagen Inc. Pfizer then plans to let the biotech drug developer "continue innovating," except with more resources than it would have alone, Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla told analysts.
"We are not buying the golden eggs," he said. "We are acquiring the goose that is laying the golden eggs."
Bothell, Washington-based Seagen Inc. specializes in working with antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, technology. Its key products use lab-made proteins called monoclonal antibodies that seek out cancer cells to help deliver a cancer-killing drug while sparing surrounding tissue.
Cancer treatments brought in $ 12 billion in revenue for Pfizer last year. ASSOCIATED PRESS
LABOR
Caterpillar Workers Ratify New Six-Year Contract
Unionized workers at Caterpillar have approved a new six-year contract with the company that includes a $ 6,000 ratification bonus, 19 percent in pay raises and 8 percent worth of lump-sum payments.
Members of the United Auto Workers union approved the deal over the weekend that covers 7,000 workers in Illinois and York, Pennsylvania. The new contract is effective immediately.
Workers will get 7 percent pay raises immediately, plus 4 percent general wage increases in March of 2025, 2027 and 2028. They'll also get 4 percent lump-sum payments in March of next year and in 2026.
The Irving, Texas, company also agreed not to close any factories for the life of the agreement.
By the end of the agreement, workers hired after 2005 will be on the same wage schedule as those hired before 2005, the company said.

A Refuge, of Sorts, for the Climate Conscious: [Real Estate Desk]

Full text: The former industrial town in Minnesota is coming to terms with its status as a refuge for people moving from across the country because of climate change.
DULUTH, Minn. -- Surfing in Minnesota is just like surfing in Southern California, John Jenkins says, as long as you ignore the icicles on your wet suit.
Mr. Jenkins, 38, is a child of Orange County. But a decade ago, looking to escape overpopulation and intensifying wildfires, he took a chance and settled in Duluth, Minn., where temperatures can dip 30 degrees below zero.
Hundreds of like-minded new residents have since joined him, coming from California, Colorado and New Mexico and changing the face of this erstwhile manufacturing town on the western edge of Lake Superior. Dubbed "climate-proof Duluth" in 2019 by Jesse Keenan, a Tulane University professor who was lecturing at Harvard at the time, Duluth has been hailed for its ample supply of freshwater, as well as its location -- buffered from sea-level rise in the Upper Midwest -- and temperatures, which run mild in the summer and colder than cold in the winter.
The majority of the population growth in the United States remains in the Sun Belt, where homes have traditionally been more affordable than in the north -- although sky-high inflation is quickly changing the equation. But rising temperatures are becoming a factor for many buyers, and climate migration -- choosing to move because of climate change -- is now shifting from projection to reality. Duluth is coming to terms with its status as a refuge.
In the second half of the 20th century, Duluth's population fell off a cliff, shrinking to about 84,000 by 2008 from nearly 107,000 in 1960. Its massive steel and cement manufacturing complex -- the largest employer in the city -- closed, and other factory closures followed. Grain shipments to its port slowed. By the early 1980s, the economic situation in Duluth was so grim that a billboard popped up on the highway leading out of town, bearing the message "Will the last one leaving Duluth please turn out the light?".
Today, the traffic is flowing in the other direction. Duluth saw 2,494 new residents from out of state over the last five years, according to the American Community Survey. Many came armed with cash from home sales in more expensive cities and towns, as well as a newfound ability to do their jobs remotely. Real estate agents in Duluth say that nearly every out-of-town client now mentions concerns about rising temperatures and natural disasters as a motivation for their move.
"Real estate and climate change cannot be separated," said Shawn McCoy, a professor of real estate and economics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. He studies what he refers to as "the tug of war between risks and amenities" in the real estate market, and said that as knowledge of climate change increases, its influence on where people settle is growing.
Since Mr. Jenkins and his wife, Giselle Hernandez, moved to Duluth in 2014, they've built their own village of new transplants. The couple welcomed two children and then were joined by both his mother and Ms. Hernandez's mother; his stepfather and Ms. Hernandez's sister; plus three longtime friends. All are California natives. During the long winter, when stubborn clouds can bring monthlong gray skies and seven-foot-high snowdrifts, they dabble in ice climbing and snowshoeing. And when Mr. Jenkins gets homesick for California, he climbs into his 1970 Volkswagen bus and drives with his surfboard to Lake Superior, where, thanks to winter winds, the frigid waves are at their biggest between November and February.
"My decision wasn't based on just one thing, but climate was a big one," Mr. Jenkins said of choosing Duluth. "It's safer here."
He now owns and runs a local restaurant, New London Cafe, where diners gather around wood tables crafted from repurposed pickle barrels and can order menu items like breakfast burritos and huevos rancheros. His wife and sister co-own a cafe and juice bar, Juice Pharm, which is Duluth's first vegan restaurant.
"We tried to bring California with us here," Mr. Jenkins said.
They own investment property, too: In addition to his four-bedroom, two-bath home, which he and Ms. Hernandez bought in 2017 for $ 210,000, he also collects rent on eight rental properties, comprising 18 housing units. He asks between $ 900 and $ 1,400 for a two-bedroom apartment.
"When we came out here, it was literally the beginning of the boom," he said of Duluth's real estate market, where the median sales price of homes grew 9 percent between December 2021 and December 2022, compared with 2.3 percent nationwide. About 22 percent of those sales were all cash, according to data from Lake Superior Area Realtors, a local realty company.
He said that despite the cold -- and the chunks of ice he has to navigate when surfing -- he has no regrets. "We still visit California, but whenever we're away, we always just think, man, it's gonna be so nice to just go back home to Duluth," he said.
For other new residents, the transition hasn't come so easily.
"Duluth is the city that keeps getting named," said Karen Pagel Guerndt, a Duluth native and local realtor who estimates that 25 to 30 percent of her clients now come from out of state. Ten years ago, she said, that number was less than 2 percent. "In some ways, they describe us as this big utopia. But we have lots of cloudy days, a lot of cold weather and a lot of snow. For many people, that's not always perfect."
Amy Thomas, 48, is one of them. She grew up in Duluth, but for nearly 30 years, she lived in Colorado, growing used to winter sunshine. She and her wife, Jess Meyer, are avid mountain bikers, and in September 2020, Ms. Meyer developed exercise-induced asthma from cycling outdoors in air tinged with wildfire smoke.
They decided to leave Denver, setting their sites on Durango, Colo., a small city near the border with New Mexico. They sold their home for $ 565,000 and purchased a plot of land. But before they could build, a different wildfire tore through their property.
Ms. Thomas decided it was time to return home to Duluth.
The couple bought a home for $ 338,000 and say they love Duluth's local cycling community, as well as the proximity to environmental treasures like the Boundary Waters. But it's been harder than Ms. Thomas anticipated to make lasting friends.
"Those friends in Colorado were my family," she said. "I underestimated that."
For Jamie Beck Alexander, 40, there have also been challenges. She never planned to come to Duluth, but in the summer of 2020, exhausted from Covid-19 lockdowns, she, her husband, and two children, now 5 and 7, rented a camper van and drove east from San Francisco. They were in southern Minnesota when they saw pictures of the sky in Northern California, which was turning apocalyptic orange from wildfires.
"That was the point when we said, wow, maybe we won't go back," said Ms. Alexander. Climate adaptation is familiar to her -- she is the director of Drawdown Labs, a nonprofit that works with tech companies on climate solutions. So she admits she kicked herself a little when, a year after settling in Duluth, wildfire smoke blowing across the border from Canada created air quality too poor to go outside.
"We moved here with a Pollyannish idea that we were moving to safety," she said. "But as someone who works in climate change, I know that planet systems are connected. You cannot pick up one part of the world and separate it from the rest of the planet."
Despite a rough adjustment, Ms. Alexander said she and her children are happy now in Duluth, in large part to the culture of "Minnesota nice" -- a widespread politeness and friendliness that is a local point of pride. Indeed, in dozens of interviews, longtime Duluth locals insisted that the newcomers to their city were warmly welcomed, even if their presence was driving up real estate costs across the board.
"These folks are coming from places where they sold their home for maybe a million dollars, or the high hundreds of thousands, and they come out here and think nothing of it. But Duluth is enhanced by the money coming in," said Steve Marshall, 60, whose family-owned hardware store, Marshall Hardware, has been a community fixture since 1939. The cash register used by his grandfather still sits on the counter. "It's great to see the community getting vibrant, and also there's new food coming in. It's not just hamburgers anymore."
Even as they welcome the newcomers to their city, however, longtime residents are feeling the pinch of rising prices.
"I'm glad that people find value in Duluth. It's a beautiful place. But I still long for the days when housing prices were reasonable," said Lynne Maine, 56, an occupational therapist who grew up in Duluth. She has three children, ages 27, 23 and 17, and worries about their ability to now buy a house in their hometown.
"It hurts my heart," she said. "I want my kids to be able to get their foot in the door and establish a homestead, and then potentially buy a bigger house when they get married and have kids. But it doesn't seem like they can even afford that first house."
Duluth is not the only city in America that's been branded a climate refuge, and others, like Buffalo, have leaned into the label with outreach and marketing campaigns. But in Duluth, Mayor Emily Larson is distancing herself from the idea.
"The idea that we are so ignoring the needs of our planet that people have to move is terrifying. It's dystopian," she said in an interview at Duluth's city hall, a grand, cavernous granite building with Doric columns and arched windows. Built in 1928 as part of a Beaux-Arts civic center, it sits in the heart of Duluth's now blighted downtown, where cocktail bars and co-working spaces form a checkerboard with abandoned storefronts. "I don't want to prey on that."
Ms. Larson, the city's first female mayor, is in her second term and has made sustainability initiatives -- reducing the city's greenhouse gas emissions; investing in solar power -- a cornerstone of her administration. She estimates that Duluth, whose current population is shy of 87,000 people, has infrastructure to accommodate 130,000. But its housing stock is aging, and limited -- affordable housing is scarce, and in 2021, its rental housing vacancy rate was a mere 2 percent.
Before inviting an influx of new residents, Ms. Larson said, the city needs to build for its current ones, or as she put it, "put our own oxygen mask on first." They need to create more multifamily units, she said, and rehab many of the city's older structures that are in disrepair.
"People need climate refuge, but there's the potential of a seismic conflict. So far, we're navigating it," she said. John Jenkins grew up in Southern California, surfing in the Pacific Ocean.

DULUTH, Minn. — Surfing in Minnesota is just like surfing in Southern California, John Jenkins says, as long as you ignore the icicles on your wet suit.
Jenkins, 38, is a child of California’s Orange County. But a decade ago, looking to escape overpopulation and intensifying wildfires, he took a chance and settled in Duluth, where temperatures can dip 30 degrees below zero.
Hundreds of like-minded new residents have since joined him, coming from California, Colorado and New Mexico and changing the face of this erstwhile manufacturing town on the western edge of Lake Superior. Dubbed “climate-proof Duluth” in 2019 by Jesse Keenan, a Tulane University professor who was lecturing at Harvard at the time, Duluth has been hailed for its ample supply of freshwater, as well as its location — buffered from sea-level rise in the Upper Midwest — and temperatures, which run mild in the summer and colder than cold in the winter.
The majority of the population growth in the United States remains in the Sun Belt, where homes have traditionally been more affordable than in the north — although sky-high inflation is quickly changing the equation. But rising temperatures are becoming a factor for many buyers, and climate migration — choosing to move because of climate change — is now shifting from projection to reality. Duluth is coming to terms with its status as a refuge.
In the second half of the 20th century, Duluth’s population fell off a cliff, shrinking to about 84,000 by 2008 from nearly 107,000 in 1960. Its massive steel and cement manufacturing complex — the largest employer in the city — closed, and other factory closures followed. Grain shipments to its port slowed. By the early 1980s, the economic situation in Duluth was so grim that a billboard popped up on the highway leading out of town, bearing the message “Will the last one leaving Duluth please turn out the light?”
Today, the traffic is flowing in the other direction. Duluth saw 2,494 new residents from out of state over the past five years, according to the American Community Survey. Many came armed with cash from home sales in more expensive cities and towns, as well as a newfound ability to do their jobs remotely. Real estate agents in Duluth say that nearly every out-of-town client now mentions concerns about rising temperatures and natural disasters as a motivation for their move.
“Real estate and climate change cannot be separated,” said Shawn McCoy, a professor of real estate and economics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. He studies what he refers to as “the tug of war between risks and amenities” in the real estate market, and said that as knowledge of climate change increases, its influence on where people settle is growing.
Since Jenkins and his wife, Giselle Hernandez, moved to Duluth in 2014, they have built their own village of new transplants. The couple welcomed two children and then were joined by both his mother and Hernandez’s mother; his stepfather and Hernandez’s sister; and three longtime friends. All are California natives. During the long winter, when stubborn clouds can bring monthlong gray skies and 7-foot-high snowdrifts, they dabble in ice climbing and snowshoeing. And when Jenkins gets homesick for California, he climbs into his 1970 Volkswagen bus and drives with his surfboard to Lake Superior, where, thanks to winter winds, the frigid waves are at their biggest between November and February.
“My decision wasn’t based on just one thing, but climate was a big one,” Jenkins said of choosing Duluth. “It’s safer here.”
He now owns and runs a local restaurant, New London Cafe, where diners gather around wood tables crafted from repurposed pickle barrels and can order menu items such as breakfast burritos and huevos rancheros. His wife and sister co-own a cafe and juice bar, Juice Pharm, which is Duluth’s first vegan restaurant.
“We tried to bring California with us here,” Jenkins said.
They own investment property, too: In addition to his four-bedroom, two-bath home, which he and Hernandez bought in 2017 for $210,000, he also collects rent on eight rental properties, consisting of 18 housing units. He asks between $900 and $1,400 for a two-bedroom apartment.
“When we came out here, it was literally the beginning of the boom,” he said of Duluth’s real estate market, where the median sales price of homes grew 9% between December 2021 and December 2022, compared with 2.3% nationwide. About 22% of those sales were all cash, according to data from Lake Superior Area Realtors, a local realty company.
He said that despite the cold — and the chunks of ice he has to navigate when surfing — he has no regrets. “We still visit California, but whenever we’re away, we always just think, man, it’s gonna be so nice to just go back home to Duluth,” he said.
For other new residents, the transition hasn’t come so easily.
“Duluth is the city that keeps getting named,” said Karen Pagel Guerndt, a Duluth native and local real estate agent who estimates that 25% to 30% of her clients now come from out of state. Ten years ago, she said, that number was less than 2%. “In some ways, they describe us as this big utopia. But we have lots of cloudy days, a lot of cold weather and a lot of snow. For many people, that’s not always perfect.”
Amy Thomas, 48, is one of them. She grew up in Duluth, but for nearly 30 years, she lived in Colorado, growing used to winter sunshine. She and her wife, Jess Meyer, are avid mountain bikers, and in September 2020, Meyer developed exercise-induced asthma from cycling outdoors in air tinged with wildfire smoke.
They decided to leave Denver, setting their sites on Durango, Colorado, a small city near the New Mexico state line. They sold their home for $565,000 and purchased a plot of land. But before they could build, a different wildfire tore through their property.
Thomas decided it was time to return home to Duluth.
The couple bought a home for $338,000 and say they love Duluth’s local cycling community, as well as the proximity to environmental treasures such as the Boundary Waters. But it has been harder than Thomas anticipated to make lasting friends.
“Those friends in Colorado were my family,” she said. “I underestimated that.”
For Jamie Beck Alexander, 40, there have also been challenges. She never planned to come to Duluth, but in the summer of 2020, exhausted from COVID-19 lockdowns, she and her husband and two children, now 5 and 7, rented a camper van and drove east from San Francisco. They were in southern Minnesota when they saw pictures of the sky in Northern California, which was turning apocalyptic orange from wildfires.
“That was the point when we said, wow, maybe we won’t go back,” said Alexander. Climate adaptation is familiar to her — she is the director of Drawdown Labs, a nonprofit that works with tech companies on climate solutions. So she admits she kicked herself a little when, a year after settling in Duluth, wildfire smoke blowing across the border from Canada created air quality too poor to go outside.
“We moved here with a Pollyannish idea that we were moving to safety,” she said. “But as someone who works in climate change, I know that planet systems are connected. You cannot pick up one part of the world and separate it from the rest of the planet.”
Despite a rough adjustment, Alexander said she and her children are happy now in Duluth, in large part to the culture of “Minnesota nice” — a widespread politeness and friendliness that is a local point of pride. Indeed, in dozens of interviews, longtime Duluth locals insisted that the newcomers to their city were warmly welcomed, even if their presence was driving up real estate costs across the board.
“These folks are coming from places where they sold their home for maybe a million dollars, or the high hundreds of thousands, and they come out here and think nothing of it. But Duluth is enhanced by the money coming in,” said Steve Marshall, 60, whose family-owned hardware store, Marshall Hardware, has been a community fixture since 1939. The cash register used by his grandfather still sits on the counter. “It’s great to see the community getting vibrant, and also there’s new food coming in. It’s not just hamburgers anymore.”
Even as they welcome the newcomers to their city, however, longtime residents are feeling the pinch of rising prices.
“I’m glad that people find value in Duluth. It’s a beautiful place. But I still long for the days when housing prices were reasonable,” said Lynne Maine, 56, an occupational therapist who grew up in Duluth. She has three children, ages 27, 23 and 17, and worries about their ability to now buy a house in their hometown.
“It hurts my heart,” she said. “I want my kids to be able to get their foot in the door and establish a homestead, and then potentially buy a bigger house when they get married and have kids. But it doesn’t seem like they can even afford that first house.”
Duluth is not the only city in America that’s been branded a climate refuge, and others, such as Buffalo, New York, have leaned into the label with outreach and marketing campaigns. But in Duluth, Mayor Emily Larson is distancing herself from the idea.
“The idea that we are so ignoring the needs of our planet that people have to move is terrifying. It’s dystopian,” she said in an interview at Duluth’s city hall, a grand, cavernous granite building with Doric columns and arched windows. Built in 1928 as part of a beaux-arts civic center, it sits in the heart of Duluth’s now-blighted downtown, where cocktail bars and coworking spaces form a checkerboard with abandoned storefronts. “I don’t want to prey on that.”
Larson, the city’s first female mayor, is in her second term and has made sustainability initiatives — reducing the city’s greenhouse gas emissions; investing in solar power — a cornerstone of her administration. She estimates that Duluth, whose current population is shy of 87,000 people, has infrastructure to accommodate 130,000. But its housing stock is aging, and limited — affordable housing is scarce, and in 2021, its rental housing vacancy rate was a mere 2%.
Before inviting an influx of new residents, Larson said, the city needs to build for its current ones, or as she put it, “put our own oxygen mask on first.” They need to create more multifamily units, she said, and rehab many of the city’s older structures that are in disrepair.
“People need climate refuge, but there’s the potential of a seismic conflict. So far, we’re navigating it,” she said. This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: California has unique rules that require drivers to install chains on their tires in snowy conditions.
In most of the United States, tire chains are a rare sight. But when winter storms sweep through the Sierra Nevada, drivers cannot travel treacherous stretches of highway without them. And California's strict regulations frequently take visitors by surprise.
Last week, during the heavy snowstorms that shut down highways in the Lake Tahoe region and closed Yosemite National Park, the Sierra Nevada was crisscrossed with miles and miles of roads under chain controls. At Caltrans checkpoints along the highway, drivers must either confirm they have tire chains installed or, in some cases, four-wheel or all-wheel drive with snow tread tires. Hapless vacationers, unprepared for the mountain conditions, are often turned away.
"People come up there from the Bay Area or from out of state and they have no idea that they're going to need chains or the conditions that they're going to be driving into," said Steve Nelson, the chief public information officer for Caltrans District 3, which includes the Lake Tahoe region.
Although tire chains can damage the roads, they are necessary to traverse the steep slopes of the Sierras, Nelson said. Traveling over Donner or Echo Summits means driving over 7,000 foot elevations with 6 percent road gradients.
For drivers unfamiliar with tire chains, Nelson advises putting them on in a driveway to practice before being caught in a snowstorm.
"If you're out there and it's 15 degrees and you're getting pelted with snow and you're trying to put chains on for the first time, that's kind of a nightmare," he said.
During heavy storms, many drivers rely on the services of chain installers like Alexys Llamas. Llamas, 32, who runs Tahoe Chain Installers in South Lake Tahoe, has been deluged with calls for assistance. During last week's blizzard, he served more than 300 customers in three days, he said.
"It has been literally crazy," he said. "People are super unprepared. When they tell you there's a storm warning, take that very seriously, because it gets bad up here."
Llamas's customers are typically motorists stranded on the highway or vacationers who realize they won't be able to make it up to their rental homes. When he arrives to install chains, the process is often quick, although the work can be treacherous.
"We've got to be on our tippy toes at all times, very aware of what's going on around us, because it takes a second for someone to slide out," he said.
California has a long history of chain installers, once known as "chain monkeys." Demand for their services surged in the 1960s and '70s, as ski resorts opened in the Sierra Nevada, according to The Los Angeles Times.
But in recent years, the number of permits that Caltrans has issued for chain installers in District 3 has declined, Nelson said. S.U.V.s with all-wheel drive and other cars that don't require tire chains are increasingly popular. Long gone are the days when Nelson's family would try to reach Tahoe in a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle, banking on its tire chains.
"Even Teslas have all-wheel drive with snow tires equipped with them, so you can drive a Tesla through chain controls," he said.
Elsewhere in the United States, tire chain regulations are few and far between. Most states allow tire chains during winter conditions but do not require them.
In snowy Minnesota, drivers tend to use snow tires in the winter and the state generally does not permit studs or tire chains, with a few exceptions for dangerous conditions, according to Anne Meyer, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota Department of Transportation.
Farther east, the Vermont Agency of Transportation recommends snow tires and does not require tire chains, except sometimes for commercial vehicles under certain conditions, said Nicholas Cartularo, the agency's assistant public outreach manager.
"Compared to California, we don't have mountains," he said. "We have hills."
The rest of the news
Snowfall: Record snowfall and freezing temperatures have altered the landscape and the lives of millions of people in California in recent weeks.
Reparations task force: Nearly two years into its work, the state reparations task force has yet to make key decisions about how the state should compensate Black residents for harms caused by slavery, The Associated Press reports.
Still snowed in: A week of intense snowfall in the San Bernardino Mountains has left residents and tourists rationing food and pleading for help.
Pacific Island fight prep: A 10-day mock battle across Southern California gave a new Marine regiment the chance to test war-fighting concepts the Pentagon might one day need in a battle with China.
Evacuation order: An evacuation order for the Sierra Spring Mobile Home Park near Bass Lake was issued Sunday afternoon, with heavy snowfall creating a weight hazard on the roofs of the homes, The Fresno Bee reports.
Sexual abuse: A Bay Area probation officer sexually abused children under his care, according to 11 recently filed lawsuits that claim that San Mateo County officials knew about the abuse but failed to stop it, The Mercury News reports. The officer died in 2020, four years after retiring.
Fentanyl overdoses: A survey by the Bay Area News Group found that schools in nearly a dozen Bay Area districts are not prepared to save an overdosing student, The Mercury News reports.
What we're eating
Orange rolls.
Where we're traveling
Today's tip comes from Catherine Chimenti, who recommends a drive along Skyline Boulevard in the Santa Cruz Mountains:
"The road travels along a high ridge with spectacular ocean and mountain vistas. Most of the land is part of Peninsula Open Space Trust and can never be developed. Many trails are accessible and offer endless redwoods, oak, bay and other tree species. My go-to favorite trail winds through the forest to a high ridge line where it suddenly opens to a truly magnificent view of successive mountain ranges and the ocean. Grandeur defined. But the real reward is the honorary stone bench dedicated to my favorite author Wallace Stegner. A perfect setting for quiet reflection and a chat with my mom, whose ashes I scattered nearby years ago."

And before you go, some good news
Baby boomers accounted for nearly 70 million residents in the United States in 2021 and, as more get older, it's increasingly important they maintain an active and social lifestyle. That's where senior centers have come in.
Senior centers across the country function as de facto community centers. While a lot of these centers are routinely run through membership fees and private foundations, Petaluma Senior Center is funded entirely through the city. It is one of only a select few in the area that do so, The Press Democrat reports.

Teslas Could Be Made in Mexico by '24: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The governor of Nuevo León said a Tesla official had told him that the company's plant there would be among its biggest and go up in record time.
Tesla's new factory in the Mexican state of Nuevo León will cost $ 5 billion, will employ up to 7,000 people and could start churning out cars as early as next year, the state's governor said on Friday.
Tesla announced this week that it planned an assembly plant in Mexico -- its fifth worldwide -- but provided few details about the investment, including how much it would spend, when construction would start, how many people would work at the factory or how the company would deal with regional water shortages.
Samuel García, Nuevo León's 35-year-old governor, filled in some of the blanks. He said Tesla executives had told him that the factory -- outside Monterrey, the state's capital -- could grow to be the company's largest, producing not only cars but also batteries, semiconductors and software. Over time Tesla could double or triple the initial $ 5 billion investment, Mr. García said in a telephone interview.
"These opportunities, I think they happen once every 100 years," he said.
Tesla's plans in Mexico could help make the country a central player in the development of lithium and lithium-ion batteries in the Western Hemisphere. Mexico has one lithium mine under development in the northwestern state of Sonora, and the Tesla plant could encourage the country to undertake more projects.
Latin America has lots of lithium, and Chile is a major producer of the metal. But efforts to mine it in Argentina and Bolivia have been less successful.
President Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico is a strong proponent of oil production, and has been criticized for being slow to embrace green energy. But Mr. García, who is not a member of Mr. López Obrador's party or one of the primary opposition parties, said he was satisfied that the president supported investment in lithium.
It seems unlikely that any Tesla factory will surpass the company's plant in Shanghai, which serves the fast-growing Chinese market and exports vehicles to other Asian countries and Europe.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Still, Mr. García's comments suggest that the Tesla factory will be a centerpiece of the company's operations, allowing the company to build cars more cheaply than it could in the United States and better respond to growing competition from established automakers like General Motors and Volkswagen. Those companies already offer electric vehicles that cost less than Teslas, like the Chevrolet Bolt and the Volkswagen ID.4, and are planning to sell many more mass market models in the coming months.
Volkswagen announced a new challenge to Tesla's dominance of the electric vehicle market on Friday, saying that it would spend $ 2 billion on a factory near Columbia, S.C., to produce pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles under the Scout brand. The German carmaker is reviving the U.S. off-road vehicle brand that was used by International Harvester in the 1960s and '70s. Scouts were among the first mass-produced off-road vehicles, which have become a lucrative segment of the U.S. auto market. Tesla, so far, does not make off-road vehicles.
Tesla executives said Wednesday during an investor presentation that the Mexico factory would produce a new vehicle priced below the Model 3, which starts at $ 43,000 in the United States. The company has not unveiled a design for the vehicle or disclosed other details, but its effort in Mexico could help attract a wider customer base.
The company's investment in Mexico is part of a trend by American manufacturers to reduce their dependence on China while keeping costs low. Mexico has car and auto parts factories that produce Fords, Chevrolets, Volkswagens, BMWs and many other cars.
Under the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Democrats last year, electric cars and batteries made in Mexico are eligible for federal incentives not available to vehicles made in Asia or Europe.
Vehicles made in Mexico have long been shipped to the United States and Canada duty free. Tesla, like other large manufacturers, will have its own lane at the border allowing trucks to clear customs in minutes rather than hours.
Mr. García said he had been told by Tom Zhu, who leads Tesla's factory operations, that the company wanted to build the plant faster than its Shanghai facility, which began producing cars in late 2019, less than a year after breaking ground. Mr. Zhu oversaw construction of the Chinese plant, and his record there explains why Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, put him in charge of factories worldwide.
"He told me that he was very optimistic that he will break again his record," Mr. García said, referring to Mr. Zhu.
The governor said Tesla had received the needed state approvals and that it was sending teams to begin work on a site in Santa Catarina, a city adjacent to Monterrey. Tesla needs federal permits, Mr. García said, but he expressed optimism that those would be granted soon.
Monterrey, about 140 miles from a major U.S. border crossing, is a manufacturing hub. Its explosive population growth has strained public services, particularly the water supply. Last year, some neighborhoods went weeks without running water.
Auto body painting equipment, essential to the manufacturing process, uses lots of water, raising the question about how Tesla would justify straining Monterrey's resources while portraying itself as an environmental pioneer.
Mr. García pointed to an array of new infrastructure projects, including an aqueduct and dam, that he said would ensure a steady supply of water. Tesla's factory will use recycled water, he added.
Monterrey gets most of its energy from natural gas, but Mr. García said Tesla would provide impetus for the region to switch to green energy.
Tesla's investment will be part of a transition, Mr. García said, "from fossil fuels to renewable energy for our state and for our country, Mexico."

Tesla’s new factory in the Mexican state of Nuevo León will cost $5 billion, will employ up to 7,000 people and could start churning out cars as early as next year, the state’s governor said Friday.
Tesla announced this week that it planned an assembly plant in Mexico — its fifth worldwide — but provided few details about the investment, including how much it would spend, when construction would start, how many people would work at the factory or how the company would deal with regional water shortages.
Samuel García, Nuevo León’s 35-year-old governor, filled in some of the blanks. He said Tesla executives had told him that the factory — outside Monterrey, the state’s capital — could grow to be the company's largest, producing not only cars but batteries, semiconductors and software. Over time, Tesla could double or triple the initial $5 billion investment, García said in a telephone interview.
“These opportunities, I think they happen once every 100 years,” he said.
Tesla’s plans in Mexico could help make the country a central player in the development of lithium and lithium-ion batteries in the Western Hemisphere. Mexico has one lithium mine under development in the northwestern state of Sonora, and the Tesla plant could encourage the country to undertake more projects.
Latin America has lots of lithium, and Chile is a major producer of the metal. But efforts to mine it in Argentina and Bolivia have been less successful.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is a strong proponent of oil production and has been criticized for being slow to embrace green energy. But García, who is not a member of López Obrador’s party or one of the primary opposition parties, said he was satisfied that the president supported investment in lithium.
It seems unlikely that any Tesla factory will surpass the company’s plant in Shanghai, which serves the fast-growing Chinese market and exports vehicles to other Asian countries and Europe.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Still, García's comments suggest that the Tesla factory will be a centerpiece of the company's operations, allowing the company to build cars more cheaply than it could in the United States and better respond to growing competition from established automakers such as General Motors and Volkswagen. Those companies already offer electric vehicles that cost less than Teslas, including the Chevrolet Bolt and the Volkswagen ID.4, and are planning to sell many more mass-market models in the coming months.
Volkswagen announced a new challenge to Tesla’s dominance of the electric vehicle market Friday, saying that it would spend $2 billion on a factory near Columbia, South Carolina, to produce pickup trucks and SUVs under the Scout brand. The German carmaker is reviving the U.S. off-road vehicle brand that was used by International Harvester in the 1960s and ’70s. Scouts were among the first mass-produced off-road vehicles, which have become a lucrative segment of the U.S. auto market. Tesla, so far, does not make off-road vehicles.
Tesla executives said Wednesday during an investor presentation that the Mexico factory would produce a new vehicle priced below the Model 3, which starts at $43,000 in the United States. The company has not unveiled a design for the vehicle or disclosed other details, but its effort in Mexico could help attract a wider customer base.
The company’s investment in Mexico is part of a trend by American manufacturers to reduce their dependence on China while keeping costs low. Mexico has car and auto-parts factories that produce Fords, Chevrolets, Volkswagens, BMWs and many other cars.

Chinese Electric Car Maker Takes on German Market: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: BYD is a powerhouse in China and sells the most electric vehicles of any company in the world. Now it has a plan to attract buyers in Europe's largest economy.
Germans take huge pride in their automotive industry, and have never been eager to abandon their Audis, BMWs or Mercedes-Benzes for foreign makes. But with a goal to change that, a Chinese automaker that sells the most electric cars in the world has begun offering three of its models in Germany.
BYD, founded in 1995 under the name Build Your Dreams, has become a behemoth in China, the world's largest auto market, by focusing on electric vehicles. Last year it sold 1.86 million battery-powered cars, including plug-in hybrids, which have both an electric motor and a gas-powered engine.
That topped Tesla's sales total of 1.3 million cars in 2022, all of them battery-powered.
So far, the vast majority of BYD cars are sold in China. But the company, based in Shenzhen, is looking to expand in other parts of the world, including Europe and, in particular, Germany.
Buoyed by the surging demand for electric vehicles, coupled with the supply chain struggles still troubling European automakers, BYD introduced three models in Germany at the start of the year: the Atto-3, a compact sport utility vehicle; the Han, a sedan; and the Tang, a full-size S.U.V. In the coming months, the company plans to introduce several more. There have been reports that it is considering opening an assembly plant in Germany, which has Europe's largest economy.
BYD is willing to take its time to become competitive in Germany, said Jan Grindemann, chief operating officer for Hedin Mobility Group, a Swedish company that is handling BYD's imports into the country.
"I don't think that it will happen overnight," Mr. Grindemann said. "We need to build BYD up as a brand, and the way that we will convince people is through quality."
It may not be easy. Germany has a crowded market -- domestic automakers already produce 90 electric models and are racing to expand and improve their offerings. At the end of last year, a special government subsidy for electric vehicles came to an end. Then there's the fact that BYD is largely unknown among car buyers outside China.
But the company is not unknown among investors. In 2008, Warren E. Buffett paid about $ 230 million for a nearly 10 percent stake in BYD, which started as a maker of rechargeable batteries. Last week, Charlie Munger, the vice chairman of Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, said that investment was now worth "about $ 8 billion," CNBC reported.
The company already has made inroads in Europe with one kind of vehicle: electric buses. BYD has sold over 3,000 battery-powered buses throughout the continent, and last year delivered its first five buses to Deutsche Bahn, Germany's leading public transportation company, which plans to fully electrify its fleet by 2040.
BYD's move into Germany's auto dealerships was preceded by launches in Scandinavia. In late 2021, it started offering cars in Norway, which has Europe's highest percentage of battery-powered vehicles. A year later, it moved into Sweden, where its compact S.U.V. became the fifth-most-sold battery-powered vehicle the month that it debuted.
In both countries, BYD teamed up with an established distributor to help navigate the market, as it is doing in Germany. But Mr. Grindemann refused to draw comparisons between the experiences, pointing out that Scandinavia's automobile market is dwarfed by the nearly 2.7 million cars registered last year in Germany.
As part of efforts to get more of its vehicles into circulation in Germany, BYD struck a six-year deal in October to sell about 100,000 cars to the country's largest rental company, Sixt.
BYD's cars "are well suited to the expectations and needs of European customers with a quality feel," Sixt said when announcing the deal.
For manufacturers, the chance to let rental drivers try out electric vehicles may lead to more sales. "We know that renting an electric vehicle can help people to overcome any reservations they may have, leading them to decide to go electric when they buy their next car," said Vinzenz Pflanz, chief business officer at Sixt.
Such subtle promotion fits with the overall strategy of how BYD plans to make inroads in the German market, Mr. Grindemann said.
"I always had the feeling that there are a lot of reservations about Chinese brands," he said. "But when you get someone into the car and they are sitting in it, they are immediately convinced."
Still, in a country where automobiles and their production are woven into the history and society, brand loyalty can span generations.
U.S. brands have struggled over the years to gain a foothold in Germany. General Motors lost money for more than a decade with its Opel unit before finally selling the division in 2017. (Opel is now part of Stellantis.) Ford Motor is winding down production of its gas- and diesel-powered cars and plans to sell a factory in southwest Germany, and BYD is one of a dozen companies that have been in talks about potentially taking it over. Although Ford's sales in Germany grew in 2022, they amounted to only about a quarter of vehicles sold by Volkswagen, the country's leading automaker.
"People in Germany buy cars based on the brand," said Helena Wisbert, a professor of automobile economics and director of the C.A.R. Center Automotive Research, in Duisburg. "The brand is decisive."
One exception is Tesla, which entered the German market a decade ago and was able to lure some Germans hungry for an electric vehicle and enamored of the entrepreneurial, Silicon Valley vibe of the cars and their company's chief executive, Elon Musk. Last year, as Tesla opened its first major factory in Europe, outside Berlin, Tesla's Model Y became Europe's most popular electric vehicle, eclipsing models from Volkswagen, Fiat and Peugeot. In January, every fifth new car registered in Germany was a Tesla.
That surge by an outsider has put Europe's carmakers on edge, said Matthias Schmidt, an analyst who publishes a monthly report on the electric car market. In addition to BYD, several other Chinese brands, including SAIC Motor and Nio, have entered the German market in recent years -- almost exclusively with electric vehicles.
"Incumbents are far more sensitive to the threat of new manufacturers entering the region," Mr. Schmitt said of the threat posed by competitors in the electric vehicle sector.
Volkswagen, the overall sales leader in Germany thanks to the persistent popularity of its internal-combustion motor vehicles, recently announced a five-year plan to quicken its shift to electric vehicles by focusing on software, platforms and updates at its plants.
For all of its ambitions, BYD is entering the German market at a challenging time. A government subsidy for electric vehicles ran out in December, leading registrations of new electric cars to plunge in the first month of 2023, the German Association of the Automotive Industry said. Although sales of battery-powered cars are projected to increase 8 percent to around 510,000 units this year, several factors have heightened uncertainties among consumers.
The price for electricity in Germany is more than double that in the United States. A lack of charging stations, especially in cities, is also an obstacle -- across the country, there are 23 electric vehicles for every spot to recharge. Finally, the authorities have expressed concern about the stability of the country's power grid, given the increase in electric-powered heating systems and vehicles.
Tesla's swift expansion of its own charging infrastructure across Germany helped it to gain a competitive edge. In the coming years, BYD is considering offering complete packages to consumers, including solar panels for generating electricity and batteries that can be installed in a private garage for storing and charging -- options that are possible because BYD's roots are in battery production.
Aytac Cicek, who sells BYDs for the Torpedo Group in Frankfurt, said customers had been impressed with the quality of the vehicles, especially their fast software and high safety ratings. But one of the biggest selling points so far is delivery times that are half of what most German makers can currently meet.
"Delivery times are a big issue in the German market," Mr. Cicek said. "When you order a BYD, they can deliver it in three to four months, the standard time -- or what the standard time was before the pandemic."

BERLIN — Germans take huge pride in their automotive industry, and have never been eager to abandon their Audis, BMWs or Mercedes-Benzes for foreign makes. But with a goal to change that, a Chinese automaker that sells the most electric cars in the world has begun offering three of its models in Germany.
BYD, founded in 1995 under the name Build Your Dreams, has become a behemoth in China, the world’s largest auto market, by focusing on electric vehicles. Last year it sold 1.86 million battery-powered cars, including plug-in hybrids, which have both an electric motor and a gas-powered engine.
That topped Tesla’s sales total of 1.3 million cars in 2022, all of them battery-powered.
So far, the vast majority of BYD cars are sold in China. But the company, based in Shenzhen, is looking to expand in other parts of the world, including Europe and, in particular, Germany.
Buoyed by the surging demand for electric vehicles, coupled with the supply chain struggles still troubling European automakers, BYD introduced three models in Germany at the start of the year: the Atto-3, a compact sport utility vehicle; the Han, a sedan; and the Tang, a full-size SUV. In the coming months, the company plans to introduce several more. There have been reports that it is considering opening an assembly plant in Germany, which has Europe’s largest economy.
BYD is willing to take its time to become competitive in Germany, said Jan Grindemann, chief operating officer for Hedin Mobility Group, a Swedish company that is handling BYD’s imports into the country.
“I don’t think that it will happen overnight,” Grindemann said. “We need to build BYD up as a brand, and the way that we will convince people is through quality.”
It may not be easy. Germany has a crowded market — domestic automakers already produce 90 electric models and are racing to expand and improve their offerings. At the end of last year, a special government subsidy for electric vehicles came to an end. Then there’s the fact that BYD is largely unknown among car buyers outside China.
But the company is not unknown among investors. In 2008, Warren Buffett paid about $230 million for a nearly 10% stake in BYD, which started as a maker of rechargeable batteries. Last week, Charlie Munger, the vice chair of Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, said that investment was now worth “about $8 billion,” CNBC reported.
The company already has made inroads in Europe with one kind of vehicle: electric buses. BYD has sold more than 3,000 battery-powered buses throughout the continent, and last year delivered its first five buses to Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s leading public transportation company, which plans to fully electrify its fleet by 2040.
BYD’s move into Germany’s auto dealerships was preceded by launches in Scandinavia. In late 2021, it started offering cars in Norway, which has Europe’s highest percentage of battery-powered vehicles. A year later, it moved into Sweden, where its compact SUV became the fifth-most sold battery-powered vehicle the month that it debuted.
In both countries BYD teamed up with an established distributor to help navigate the market, as it is doing in Germany. But Grindemann refused to draw comparisons between the experiences, pointing out that Scandinavia’s automobile market is dwarfed by the nearly 2.7 million cars registered last year in Germany.
As part of efforts to get more of its vehicles into circulation in Germany, BYD struck a six-year deal in October to sell about 100,000 cars to the country’s largest rental company, Sixt.
BYD’s cars “are well suited to the expectations and needs of European customers with a quality feel,” Sixt said when announcing the deal.
For manufacturers, the chance to let rental drivers try out electric vehicles may lead to more sales. “We know that renting an electric vehicle can help people to overcome any reservations they may have, leading them to decide to go electric when they buy their next car,” said Vinzenz Pflanz, chief business officer at Sixt.
Such subtle promotion fits with the overall strategy of how BYD plans to make inroads in the German market, Grindemann said.
“I always had the feeling that there are a lot of reservations about Chinese brands,” he said. “But when you get someone into the car and they are sitting in it, they are immediately convinced.”
Still, in a country where automobiles and their production are woven into the history and society, brand loyalty can span generations.
U.S. brands have struggled over the years to gain a foothold in Germany. General Motors lost money for more than a decade with its Opel unit before finally selling the division in 2017. (Opel is now part of Stellantis.) Ford Motor is winding down production of its gas- and diesel-powered cars and plans to sell a factory in southwest Germany, and BYD is one of a dozen companies that have been in talks about potentially taking it over. Although Ford’s sales in Germany grew in 2022, they amounted to only about one-quarter of vehicles sold by Volkswagen, the country’s leading automaker.
“People in Germany buy cars based on the brand,” said Helena Wisbert, a professor of automobile economics and director of the CAR Center Automotive Research, in Duisburg. “The brand is decisive.”
One exception is Tesla, which entered the German market a decade ago and was able to lure some Germans hungry for an electric vehicle and enamored of the entrepreneurial, Silicon Valley vibe of the cars and their company’s CEO, Elon Musk. Last year, as Tesla opened its first major factory in Europe, outside Berlin, Tesla’s Model Y became Europe’s most popular electric vehicle, eclipsing models from Volkswagen, Fiat and Peugeot. In January, every fifth new car registered in Germany was a Tesla.
That surge by an outsider has put Europe’s carmakers on edge, said Matthias Schmidt, an analyst who publishes a monthly report on the electric car market. In addition to BYD, several other Chinese brands, including SAIC Motor and Nio, have entered the German market in recent years — almost exclusively with electric vehicles.
“Incumbents are far more sensitive to the threat of new manufacturers entering the region,” Schmitt said of the threat posed by competitors in the electric vehicle sector.
Volkswagen, the overall sales leader in Germany thanks to the persistent popularity of its internal-combustion motor vehicles, recently announced a five-year plan to quicken its shift to electric vehicles by focusing on software, platforms and updates at its plants.
For all of its ambitions, BYD is entering the German market at a challenging time. A government subsidy for electric vehicles ran out in December, leading registrations of new electric cars to plunge in the first month of 2023, the German Association of the Automotive Industry said. Although sales of battery-powered cars are projected to increase 8% to around 510,000 units this year, several factors have heightened uncertainties among consumers.
The price for electricity in Germany is more than double that in the United States. A lack of charging stations, especially in cities, is also an obstacle — across the country, there are 23 electric vehicles for every spot to recharge. Finally, authorities have expressed concern about the stability of the country’s power grid, given the increase in electric-powered heating systems and vehicles.
Tesla’s swift expansion of its own charging infrastructure across Germany helped it to gain a competitive edge. In the coming years, BYD is considering offering complete packages to consumers, including solar panels for generating electricity and batteries that can be installed in a private garage for storing and charging — options that are possible because BYD’s roots are in battery production.
Aytac Cicek, who sells BYDs for the Torpedo Group in Frankfurt, said that customers had been impressed with the quality of the vehicles, especially their fast software and high safety ratings. But one of the biggest selling points so far is delivery times that are half of what most German makers can currently meet.
“Delivery times are a big issue in the German market,” Cicek said. “When you order a BYD, they can deliver it in three to four months, the standard time — or what the standard time was before the pandemic.” This article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Full text: DEADHORSE, Alaska -- Really? That's it?
The United States military is capable of many things, but finding the remnants of an unidentified flying object scattered across a blinding expanse of Arctic ice in minus-30-degree weather using six available hours of daylight is not one of them.
The search for a downed U.F.O. began and ended near this oil-camp town at the frozen edge of the world, where Navy pilots flying P-8 Poseidons finally gave up on Friday, ending their mission with no answers.
Hours later and some 500 miles away, Canadian forces searching for the shreds of a second object in the Yukon Territory retreated empty-handed. The same thing happened on Lake Huron, where Coast Guard captains docked their boats without finding whatever it was that F-22 fighter pilots shot out of the sky with a $ 400,000 Sidewinder missile. (The pilots actually shot two missiles; the first one missed.)
The three objects were intercepted in quick succession on Feb. 10, 11 and 12, just days after the United States shot down a giant Chinese spy balloon on Feb. 4. But as quickly as the national craziness over aerial phenomena began, the military packed up and went home, leaving the answers encased in Arctic ice and under the whitecaps of Lake Huron.
In Deadhorse -- permanent population: 25 -- life had already moved on by Saturday morning. Oil workers left for their shifts while it was still dark, and they would be back in the evening for early dinners and early bedtimes. Nancy Bremer, a receptionist at the Aurora Hotel -- home to the only restaurant in town, a buffet-style assembly line that serves ahi tuna steaks and cheeseburgers -- said people here were focused on work, and not concerned with any looming threat of an object shot down over ice.
"If we find it," she asked, "should I call you?"
The good people of Deadhorse notwithstanding, many of us still had a lot of questions. For a nation that has been riveted by this saga since the aerial assaults on mysterious objects began -- Pop! Pop! Pop! -- the end felt incomplete.
Were aliens involved? (No, says the White House.) Surveillance devices of mysterious provenance? (No, says the White House.) Hobby balloons? (We may never know, says the White House.)
But of course, this is America. When was the last time we let anything go?
Perhaps some answers are in Illinois, where, according to two people familiar with the investigation, F.B.I. agents have interviewed a team of hobby aviation enthusiasts who said their balloon had gone missing somewhere over the southwest coast of Alaska last Saturday, during its seventh trip around the Earth.
No one from the government or the hobby club has confirmed that any of the objects shot down were the group's weather-chasing pico balloon, but the club has taken down its website after an onslaught of inquiries.
The Biden administration is leaving it up to the public to piece together an answer. President Biden, apparently seeking to ease a diplomatic rift with the Chinese, told the public on Thursday that the three unidentified objects were probably not surveillance devices.
"The intelligence community's current assessment is that these three objects were most likely balloons tied to private companies, recreation or research institutions studying weather or conducting other scientific research," Mr. Biden said. He also said he had no regrets about shooting down the first one. (On Saturday, China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, called the American reaction "absurd and hysterical.")
Sam Lyman, a pilot who commutes to Deadhorse from Albuquerque, said the government's explanation for shooting down the flying objects -- that they were traveling at an altitude that made them a potential threat to civilian aircraft -- made sense to him.
The object floating over Alaska was traveling at around 40,000 feet when it was shot down.
During 30 years of flying, Mr. Lyman, 47, said he had seen countless weather and party balloons -- a graveyard of HAPPY BIRTHDAYs and GET WELL SOONs in the sky -- and said that a large weather balloon could conceivably get in the way of an aircraft, causing "disastrous" results, like collapsing over the front of an airplane.
If, in fact, it really was a balloon -- which the White House says it cannot confirm.
"The only information we have is what they put on the internet," Mr. Lyman said. "I'll leave it at that."
So here are a few facts, according to a senior U.S. military official who was not authorized to speak publicly:
NORAD, the air defense organization perhaps best known for its Christmas Eve Santa-tracking website, scans the skies each day, looking for serious threats. All three objects, which were about the size of Volkswagen Beetles, were picked up after NORAD adjusted its systems in the wake of the spy balloon to pick up a wider range of objects at different speeds and altitudes.
Pilots who shot down the object over the Arctic said that it was metallic and broke into pieces -- whether those were soft or hard pieces is unknown. The pilots lost sight of the material as it fell through the clouds.
Whatever those three objects were, they were much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon, which was gathered from a square-mile debris field off the coast of South Carolina, and contained thousands of pounds of material. Military officials said letting the Chinese spy balloon float across the country and out to sea gave them time to assess it for counterintelligence purposes.
But Alaskan lawmakers, who believe their last-frontier state has become the first line of defense against a number of threats to national security -- including floating ones -- have criticized the Biden administration for not shooting down the Chinese balloon sooner.
"At what point do we say, a surveillance balloon, a spy balloon coming from China is a threat to our sovereignty?" Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said during a Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on Feb. 9. "It should be the minute -- the minute it crosses the line -- and that line is Alaska."
The next day, a Sidewinder took out a U.F.O. over Deadhorse.
To help find the object, Alaska National Guard soldiers have flown Chinooks and Black Hawks over frigid islands, landing and walking onto the ice to search places that looked promising. But the conditions were extreme.
"Iraq was a punishing environment," said Col. Elizabeth Mathias, the public affairs director for NORAD and U.S. Northern Command. "But it wasn't the Arctic."
Locals agreed: "It's like 100 haystacks and finding one needle," Mr. Lyman said.
In a masterful attempt at looking on the bright side, John F. Kirby, a White House spokesman, addressed the absurdity of the situation, in which fighter pilots may well have used air-to-air missiles to shoot down a hobby balloon, by telling reporters this was a "better outcome" than a more sinister alternative.
"If it turns out that they were, in fact, civilian or recreational use or weather balloon and therefore benign -- which is what the intelligence community thinks -- isn't that a better outcome than to have to think about the possibility of greater threats to our national security?" Mr. Kirby asked reporters on Friday.
Mr. Kirby added that the president had asked for a "new set of rules" for the government to assess floating objects, "so that we can now deal with these in perhaps a different way in the future."
Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, said in an interview that he's not so sure the U.F.O.s were innocuous.
"There's no briefing that I've been in, or that I've received, that supports what John Kirby is out there saying," Mr. Sullivan said. "It should be the default position when you don't know what the answer is on the smaller objects, is to initially assume the worst until you have the right answer."
Other experts say that this episode is proof that there should be a more formalized effort to identify what, exactly, is going on in the sky.
Hobbyists can cheaply launch weather-tracking balloons. The National Weather Service sends over 180 balloons into the sky every day. (None of theirs are missing, according to a spokeswoman.) China sends over spy balloons, including at least three during the Trump administration that went unreported. (One of those is definitely gone.) And then other phenomena go unexplained.
Robert Powell, a board member of the Scientific Coalition for U.A.P. Studies -- the abbreviation that has replaced U.F.O. and means "unidentified aerial phenomena" -- has been pushing for Congress to fund formalized research of the craft. In January, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report that documented 366 recent unidentified sightings, many of which were drones, birds or trash.
People like Mr. Powell are focused on getting answers about the many sightings that do not have an explanation. He does not consider the three downed objects to be in that category. In this case, he said, the government had released just enough information without offering a fulsome explanation.
Even though he is a stickler for answers, he can see why.
"If it turns out that the second, third and fourth object were a hobbyist balloon or some university's research balloon or what have you," Mr. Powell said, "it would not look good that we shot those down with a half-million-dollar missile."
The frozen expanse of the Arctic Ocean where the wreckage of a balloon shot down by U.S. fighter jets last week is believed to have fallen. "If we find it, should I call you?" a hotel receptionist asked.; Deadhorse, Alaska, permanent population 25, where Prudhoe Bay oil workers were more concerned about their shifts than with the unidentified object that was shot down at 40,000 feet.; Sam Lyman, a pilot with a charter service, agreed that unknown aircraft posed a threat to aviation.

Full text: An agreement with the White House to allow electric cars made by other automakers is part of a broad effort to improve charging and increase sales of battery-powered vehicles.
Tesla will open some of its fast chargers, which had been exclusive to its customers, to all electric vehicles by the end of next year, the Biden administration said on Wednesday as it announced a broad effort to improve charging and encourage more people to buy battery-powered vehicles.
The company's network of fast chargers has been a key element in the company's success by giving drivers confidence that they will be able to charge cars during longer trips. The company's network also has a reputation for being faster and more reliable than the networks available to owners of electric vehicles made by other manufacturers. Those chargers require drivers to download special apps and often are hard to use or out of commission.
Tesla accounts for more than half the fast chargers in the United States, and its network could provide a significant boost to the Biden administration's plans to encourage electric vehicle ownership and fight climate change. Financial incentives to car buyers and manufacturers, part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Democrats in Congress last year, are already making some electric vehicles as cheap to buy as comparable gasoline cars.
The Biden administration said 7,500 Tesla chargers will be open to other vehicles by the end of 2024. Of those, 3,500 are fast chargers capable of recharging a vehicle in about half an hour to an hour. The rest are slower chargers at hotels, restaurants and other destinations that are already available to owners of other car brands if they buy an adapter.
Tesla has about 17,700 fast chargers in the United States, according to the Department of Energy, meaning that most of the network will remain closed to electric vehicles made by General Motors, Ford Motor, Volkswagen and others.
Tesla said the opening of its network would be part of a major expansion. "Our U.S. network will more than double by the end of 2024 to support our growing Tesla fleet and new E.V. customers," the company said on Twitter without providing further details.
By opening its network, Tesla can earn revenue from owners of its competitors' vehicles, but may also diminish one of its main advantages as it faces stiffer competition from established carmakers.
"It's a double-edged sword for Tesla," said Ben Rose, president of Battle Road Research. "It helps to grow the industry. It demonstrates that Tesla wants to be a team player. On the other hand, this reduces a competitive advantage vis-à-vis the other manufacturers who are way behind in creating their own charging networks."
Tesla already allows other vehicles to use its chargers in a pilot program in 14 European countries, including France, Germany and Britain. The company's network in Australia and Iceland is also open to other cars.
Tesla's decision to open its network means the company will become eligible for some of the $ 7.5 billion in grant money that Congress authorized as part of a bipartisan infrastructure law passed in 2021. The money is meant to help create a nationwide charging infrastructure. The administration announced rules for the program Wednesday, including requirements that the equipment be manufactured in the United States, and that chargers function without specialized mobile phone apps.
Chargers will be required to accept a standard form of payment, such as credit cards. Charging companies will be required to offer toll-free numbers where drivers can pay by phone. Another possibility is that apps for charging networks like ChargePoint or EVgo would be programmed to work with other networks, in the same way that an A.T.M. card from one bank can be used at the machines owned by other banks. California, which has more electric vehicles on the road than any other state, already requires chargers to accept major credit cards.
The fragmented charging system in the United States is a major frustration for electric vehicle owners, who often find that they must download apps and enter personal details and payment information before they can charge. The procedures used to activate charging equipment also differ from company to company, leading to confusion.
Companies that offer charging must also ensure that the network works 97 percent of the time, a requirement that could cull weaker providers and force the industry to make its equipment and software more reliable. Charging systems must be standardized, the administration said in a fact sheet.
The requirements are achievable, said Mike Calise, Americas president for Tritium, an Australian manufacturer of charging equipment that has a factory in Lebanon, Tenn.
"This is very good for the industry, very good for E.V. adoption," Mr. Calise said of the administration's plan. Tritium said Wednesday that it would increase its work force in Tennessee by 50 percent, to 750 employees, to help meet increased demand.
The Biden administration's goal is to build a network of 500,000 chargers in the United States by 2030, up from 130,000 today, and increase electric vehicles' share of new car sales to 50 percent, compared with 6 percent last year. All 50 states are participating in a program designed to line major highways with fast chargers no more than 50 miles apart.
Manufacturers including Mercedes-Benz, G.M. and Ford plan to install charging equipment at dealerships and other locations. ChargePoint, Volvo and Starbucks will work together to install chargers at 60 Starbucks locations between Denver and Seattle. The truck stop operators Pilot Flying J and Travel Centers of America also plan to install chargers.
Most owners of electric cars charge their vehicles at home using a dedicated 220-volt connection that can typically fill up a car battery in about eight hours, but that is often not an option for people who rent homes or apartments. Charging electric cars using a standard 110-volt outlet can take up to 60 hours.
Executives in the electric vehicle industry said they were glad that the administration had established rules for charging infrastructure. "This regulatory certainty is going to make it easier to move forward," said Anne Smart, vice president of global policy for ChargePoint, which has installed chargers at stores, restaurants, gas stations and other locations. Expansion of the charging system "will move quickly," she added. "It's a lot of funding."

Tesla Workers at a Factory in Buffalo Begin a Campaign to Form a Union: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: If successful, the workers who help develop Tesla's Autopilot driver-assistance system will be the first group at the company to organize.
A group of workers at a Tesla factory in Buffalo began a campaign on Tuesday to form a union, saying they want better pay and benefits. If successful, the effort could establish the first union at the fast-growing auto and energy company, which has fiercely resisted efforts to organize its employees.
The factory in Buffalo makes solar panels and components for charging equipment, according to Tesla's website, and also has about 800 workers who help develop driver-assistance software for cars. The software workers initiated the union drive, and went public Tuesday in an effort to win broader support at the site.
Tesla pays workers in Buffalo less than national averages and they receive little sick time, workers involved in the drive said. "We are only asking for a seat in the car that we helped build," Keenan Lasch, a member of a group calling itself Tesla Workers United, said in a statement.
The employees are working with Workers United, which is affiliated with the Service Employees International Union. The union campaign was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.
Attempts to organize Tesla workers have so far failed. Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, has been openly hostile to unions. In 2021, the National Labor Relations Board found that Tesla had illegally fired a worker involved in organizing at the company's car factory in Fremont, Calif., and that Mr. Musk had illegally threatened workers with the loss of stock options if they unionized.
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
The company's nonunion workplaces potentially give the company a cost advantage over established automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor and Stellantis, whose employees are represented by the United Auto Workers in the United States. Unionized workers generally receive better pay and benefits than workers who are not represented.
The U.A.W. has so far been frustrated in its attempts to expand beyond the Michigan automakers. In recent years, attempts to organize workers for foreign automakers with factories in the South, including Nissan, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota, have failed.
Tesla is the latest big technology company to be the target of labor organizers. Amazon workers at a warehouse on Staten Island voted in April to unionize, but workers at an Amazon facility in Albany, N.Y., voted in October against union representation.
The drive in Buffalo has the support of Jaz Brisack, who gained national prominence for her efforts to organize Starbucks workers in Buffalo.
"So incredibly glad to be working with the Tesla workers on their campaign!" Ms. Brisack said on Twitter on Tuesday.
The Autopilot workers in Buffalo analyze data collected by cars to improve the software, which has been blamed for numerous crashes, some fatal. Federal officials have asked Tesla for documents related to the self-driving software, the company disclosed last month.
Tesla has openings for jobs in Buffalo that entail labeling images and videos collected from cars. No experience in artificial intelligence or data labeling is required, according to two job postings on its website.
Workers said they were committed to Tesla's mission but wanted a greater voice. In an open letter to fellow workers, they said they wanted to form a union that would "be as innovative as the company we work for and to build an even more collaborative environment that will strengthen the company."
"As much as I love my job, it can feel very disheartening living paycheck to paycheck when I work for one of the most successful companies in the world," Zahra Lahrache, who has worked at Tesla in Buffalo for five months, said in a statement issued by the workers, "and that is why I am exercising my right to unionize."

Cloud Technology Firm Announces More Layoffs
Cloud communications company Twilio said on Monday it was eliminating about 17 percent of positions and closing some offices as part of a restructuring effort to focus on profitability.
Technology firms have laid off thousands of workers recently as they brace for a period of lower demand, high interest rates and macro economic instability.
The move, which is the second instance of job cuts in five months, sent the company's share up 2 percent. The stock fell 81 percent last year but has gained a quarter of its value this year.
Twilio had just under 9,000 employees as of September. Twilio will reorganize the company into two units, Twilio Communications and Twilio Data and Applications.
"This is because the two parts of our business -- communications and software -- are at different life-cycle stages and have different operating needs," Jeff Lawson, the chief executive officer and co-founder, said in a blog post. REUTERS

In Venezuela, Credit Cards Now Said to Be Useless
Credit cards are becoming increasingly useless in Venezuela because of high inflation and government restrictions, hurting people already struggling to meet daily needs on low salaries, banking industry sources, analysts and consumers said.
The country's government imposed strict lending requirements during Venezuela's economic collapse -- allowing banks to lend a maximum of 27 percent of their cash flow -- sending local business owners abroad to seek loans.
And though the government of President Nicolas Maduro loosened currency controls in 2019 and let local banks open dollar-denominated accounts, many credit restrictions remain.
"They are useless," administrator Lina Pereira, from the central city of Valencia, said of her two credit cards, which both have low limits. "My parents bought appliances and computers with their credit cards, but that's a memory for Venezuelans." REUTERS

Companies' Climate Plans Do Not Bear Scrutiny
Climate commitments by companies aren't always as green as they seem. A new report concludes major brands are exaggerating how ambitious their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions are -- in effect misleading consumers, investors and governments.
The report published Monday by the Europe-based environmental think tanks NewClimate Institute and Carbon Market Watch examined 24 companies, including KitKat manufacturer Nestlé, French retailer Carrefour and automaker Volkswagen. It found that only one company -- shipping firm Maersk -- had climate plans with "reasonable integrity" while the rest were assessed to be moderate to very low.
"For the majority of companies, we found their climate strategies to be lacking," said Thomas Day, a researcher at the NewClimate Institute who co-authored the report. ASSOCIATED PRESS

Electric Vehicle Prices Are Closing In on Gas Cars: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Competition, government incentives and falling raw material prices are making battery-powered cars more affordable sooner than expected.
More quickly than seemed possible a few months ago, sticker prices for electric vehicles are falling closer to the point where they could soon be on a par with gasoline cars.
Increased competition, government incentives and falling prices for lithium and other battery materials are making electric vehicles noticeably more affordable. The tipping point when electric vehicles become as cheap as or cheaper than cars with internal combustion engines could arrive this year for some mass market models and is already the case for some luxury vehicles.
Prices are likely to continue trending lower as Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and their battery suppliers ramp up new factories, reaping the cost savings that come from mass production. New electric vehicles from companies like Volkswagen, Nissan and Hyundai will add to competitive pressure.
The battery-powered version of G.M.'s Equinox crossover, for example, will start around $ 30,000 when it arrives this fall, the carmaker has said. That is $ 3,400 more than the least expensive gasoline-fueled Equinox. But factoring in government incentives, the electric Equinox should be cheaper. Like all electric vehicles, the car will need less maintenance, and the electricity to power it will cost less than the gasoline used by its combustion engine equivalent.
Only a few months ago, electric vehicle buyers faced long waiting lists, and dealers marked up sticker prices by thousands of dollars. Used electric vehicles sometimes sold for more than new ones because buyers were willing to pay a premium to get one right away. At the end of 2022, the average price of an electric vehicle was $ 61,488, compared with $ 49,507 for all passenger cars and trucks, according to Kelley Blue Book.
There are still waiting lists for some models like the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but it has become easier and cheaper to find and buy new and used electric models.
The first major crack in the trend of rising prices came in January when Tesla cut prices for the Model 3 and Model Y, the two best-selling electric cars, by thousands of dollars. With a starting price of $ 43,500 before government incentives, a Model 3 is now $ 300 less than the least expensive BMW 3 Series sedan. A Model Y, at $ 55,000 before tax credits, costs about as much as a comparable Lexus RX.
Ford also cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E, the best-selling electric vehicle in the United States after the Teslas. Even Lucid Motors, a maker of expensive electric sedans that do not qualify for tax credits, is feeling pressure to cut prices and this week began offering $ 7,500 discounts on cars that start at $ 107,400.
Tesla "saw there is increasing competition and some of the competition is quite good," said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book. He added, "If the No. 1 seller of a certain type of car reduces their prices, that is going to have an impact on the average."
Major impetus for the price cuts came from the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed by Democrats in Congress last year that provides tax credits of up to $ 7,500 for electric car buyers. To qualify, battery-powered or plug-in hybrid sedans have to sell for less than $ 55,000, while pickups and sport utility vehicles qualify only if the retail price is below $ 80,000. By cutting prices, Ford and Tesla increased the number of models that could benefit from the tax credits.
Manufacturers "are working to continue to pull in shoppers by making these vehicles eligible for tax credits," said Jenni Newman, editor in chief of Cars.com, an online auto sales site.
Potentially more significant are subsidies paid to companies that manufacture batteries in the United States, part of a drive by the Biden administration to establish a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China.
The subsidies, which were also part of the Inflation Reduction Act, could cut the cost of making electric vehicles by as much as $ 9,000. That break and the tax credits for buyers of electric cars could allow battery-powered vehicles to achieve price parity with gasoline cars as soon as this year, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research and advocacy group. That is three to five years sooner than would be the case without incentives.
"If the automakers pass that on to consumers, consumers will really benefit," said Stephanie Searle, a program director at the council who oversees research on passenger vehicles.
Declines in new car prices are pushing down used electric vehicle prices, too. They have fallen 17 percent since July, according to Recurrent, which tracks the used car market. That's largely because Tesla cut the price of the Model 3 and G.M. lowered the price of the Chevrolet Bolt by almost $ 6,000 last year. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, used cars can also qualify for a tax credit of up to $ 4,000. That is important because most people buy used vehicles.
Falling prices for materials like lithium and cobalt have also helped. The price of lithium used in batteries has fallen 20 percent from its peak in November, though the metal still costs more than twice as much as it did at the end of 2021. Cobalt has fallen by more than half since May, in part because carmakers are selling some models that do not require it, reducing demand.
New lithium mines are beginning to produce ore, which could keep a lid on prices. Sigma Lithium will begin shipping raw material from a site in Brazil to LG Energy Solution, its main customer, as early as April, Ana Cabral Gardner, Sigma Lithium's chief executive, said in an interview. The site will be the first new source of lithium in Latin America for several years.
"It's doable, and we're there," Ms. Cabral Gardner said.
Of course, these advantages could fade because of new supply chain problems. Lithium remains in short supply, and prices could spike again. Beginning next month, new regulations governing the $ 7,500 tax credits will require electric car batteries to be made in the United States, Canada or Mexico with raw materials from North America or another U.S. trade ally. It is unclear how many vehicles will meet those requirements.
Right now, the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are available to vehicles assembled in North America, which partly shields the U.S. automakers from competitors like Hyundai. The company's Ioniq 5 has sold well, but it is imported from South Korea. Hyundai is building a factory in Georgia that will start assembling electric vehicles in 2025. (Buyers may still collect a tax credit indirectly if they lease foreign-made electric vehicles.)
The Treasury Department, which is responsible for carrying out the Inflation Reduction Act, gave in to auto industry lobbying this month and classified several popular crossovers as S.U.V.s rather than sedans. That allows vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and all versions of the Model Y to qualify for tax credits if they sell for $ 80,000 or less. Before that change, the Mustang and lighter versions of the Model Y were classified as sedans, subject to the $ 55,000 limit.
The decision removes some pressure on the carmakers to keep prices low. Tesla quickly raised the price of the Model Y by $ 2,000. Ford said it had no plans to raise prices of the Mach-E.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also under attack by many congressional Republicans even though automakers and battery companies are building factories in states, like South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, where voters tend to elect Republicans.
But arguably the most powerful force driving down prices is not the commodity markets or Washington.
As electric vehicle sales soar -- rising 66 percent in the United States last year to 810,000, according to Kelley Blue Book -- automakers are getting better at making them. Ford has reduced the weight of the Mach-E by 70 pounds, increasing range and lowering cost, by eliminating some wiring, Jim Farley, the company's chief executive, told investors this month.
General Motors and LG Energy Solution began producing batteries at a new plant in Ohio last year through a joint venture, Ultium Cells. A second Ultium plant, in Tennessee, is expected to begin production this year, and a third is slated for Michigan. Generally speaking, costs come down as companies produce more of a product.
Auto executives say they are finding it is easier and cheaper to design and build new electric models than gasoline-powered ones.
The battery cells made by Ultium, for example, are part of a collection of components that can be mixed and matched in many types of vehicles. Carmakers have long used the same platforms in multiple models, but the strategy works even better with electric vehicles because the cars have far fewer parts than internal combustion vehicles.
The Ultium platform cuts the time needed to develop a new vehicle by almost two years, Dan Nicholson, vice president of electrification at G.M., said at a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference in January.
As a result, G.M. will be able to introduce three Chevrolet electric vehicles this year: the Equinox, a Silverado pickup truck and a Blazer S.U.V. "That's how we get the economies of scale," Mr. Nicholson said.
Suppliers have been looking for efficiencies, too. Matthews International, based in Pittsburgh, has developed a process for coating the metal foil that separates the positive and negative electrodes of a battery. Instead of a liquid solution, the process uses a powder.
The process requires less equipment and a lot less space, said Greg Babe, the company's chief technology officer. Those kinds of incremental improvements reduce costs without major technical breakthroughs.
Interest in the approach developed by Matthews has soared since President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. "It changed almost overnight," Mr. Babe said. "The floodgates opened."

More quickly than seemed possible a few months ago, sticker prices for electric vehicles are falling closer to the point at which they could soon be on a par with gasoline cars.
Increased competition, government incentives and falling prices for lithium and other battery materials are making electric vehicles noticeably more affordable. The tipping point when electric vehicles become as cheap as or cheaper than cars with internal combustion engines could arrive this year for some mass market models and is already the case for some luxury vehicles.
Prices are likely to continue trending lower as Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and their battery suppliers ramp up new factories, reaping the cost savings that come from mass production. New electric vehicles from companies like Volkswagen, Nissan and Hyundai will add to competitive pressure.
The battery-powered version of GM’s Equinox crossover, for example, will start around $30,000 when it arrives this fall, the carmaker has said. That is $3,400 more than the least expensive gasoline-fueled Equinox. But factoring in government incentives, the electric Equinox should be cheaper. Like all electric vehicles, the car will need less maintenance, and the electricity to power it will cost less than the gasoline used by its combustion engine equivalent.
Only a few months ago, electric-vehicle buyers faced long waiting lists, and dealers marked up sticker prices by thousands of dollars. Used electric vehicles sometimes sold for more than new ones because buyers were willing to pay a premium to get one right away. At the end of 2022, the average price of an electric vehicle was $61,488, compared with $49,507 for all passenger cars and trucks, according to Kelley Blue Book.
There are still waiting lists for some models like the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but it has become easier and cheaper to find and buy new and used electric models.
The first major crack in the trend of rising prices came in January, when Tesla cut prices for the Model 3 and Model Y, the two bestselling electric cars, by thousands of dollars. With a starting price of $43,500 before government incentives, a Model 3 is now $300 less than the least expensive BMW 3 Series sedan. A Model Y, at $55,000 before tax credits, costs about as much as a comparable Lexus RX.
Ford also cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E, the bestselling electric vehicle in the United States after the Teslas. Even Lucid Motors, a maker of expensive electric sedans that do not qualify for tax credits, is feeling pressure to cut prices and last week began offering $7,500 discounts on cars that start at $107,400.
Tesla “saw there is increasing competition, and some of the competition is quite good,” said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book. He added, “If the No. 1 seller of a certain type of car reduces their prices, that is going to have an impact on the average.”
Major impetus for the price cuts came from the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed by Democrats in Congress last year that provides tax credits of up to $7,500 for electric-car buyers. To qualify, battery-powered or plug-in hybrid sedans have to sell for less than $55,000, while pickups and sport utility vehicles qualify only if the retail price is below $80,000. By cutting prices, Ford and Tesla increased the number of models that could benefit from the tax credits.
Manufacturers “are working to continue to pull in shoppers by making these vehicles eligible for tax credits,” said Jenni Newman, editor-in-chief of Cars.com, an online auto-sales site.
Potentially more significant are subsidies paid to companies that manufacture batteries in the United States, part of a drive by the Biden administration to establish a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China.
The subsidies, which were also part of the Inflation Reduction Act, could cut the cost of making electric vehicles by as much as $9,000.

That is three to five years sooner than would be the case without incentives.
“If the automakers pass that on to consumers, consumers will really benefit,” said Stephanie Searle, a program director at the council who oversees research on passenger vehicles.
Declines in new-car prices are pushing down used electric-vehicle prices, too. They have fallen 17% since July, according to Recurrent, which tracks the used-car market. That’s largely because Tesla cut the price of the Model 3 and GM lowered the price of the Chevrolet Bolt by almost $6,000 last year. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, used cars can also qualify for a tax credit of up to $4,000. That is important because most people buy used vehicles.

The price of lithium used in batteries has fallen 20% from its peak in November, though the metal still costs more than twice as much as it did at the end of 2021.

Eugene Lee, Set Designer for Broadway and 'S.N.L.,' Is Dead at 83: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: He won Tony Awards for "Wicked" and other shows while also overseeing the sets for the late-night franchise's fast-paced sketch comedy.
For decades it was possible for Saturday night theatergoers in New York to get a double dose of Eugene Lee's work, though it's likely that few would have realized they were doing so. They might have taken in "Sweeney Todd," "Ragtime," "Wicked" or other Broadway shows whose striking sets were designed by Mr. Lee, then could arrive home in time to tune into "Saturday Night Live" -- a show for which he served as production designer when it began in 1975, and on which he was still working this season.
Mr. Lee, an inventive and remarkably prolific set designer who was also known for his decades with Trinity Repertory Company, a respected regional theater in Providence, R.I., died on Monday in Providence. He was 83.
His family announced the death, after a short illness that was not specified.
Mr. Lee won or shared three Tony Awards for his Broadway sets -- for "Candide" in 1974, "Sweeney Todd" in 1979 and "Wicked" in 2003 -- and six Emmy Awards for "Saturday Night Live," most recently in 2021.
In theater, he was known for imaginative designs imbued with authenticity.
"Eugene loved real objects, objects with history," Oskar Eustis, artistic director of the Public Theater, who worked with Mr. Lee at Trinity Rep and elsewhere, said by email, "but he'd use them in utterly nonrealistic ways onstage."
He was known for reconfiguring entire theaters, as he did for "Candide," the musical based on Voltaire, which was staged at the 180-seat Chelsea Theater Center in Brooklyn in 1973 before moving to the much larger Broadway Theater in Midtown Manhattan the next year. Mr. Lee, working with his partner at the time, Franne Lee, and the director Harold Prince, turned the Chelsea into "a ramped and runwayed circus midway," The New York Times wrote, "surrounded by booths and mini-stages that could be changed, in a twinkling, from a corpse-littered battlefield to a vizier's seraglio."
"The audience sat up, down and all around," The Times said, "on stools, benches and ballpark-style 'bleachers,' between the ramps or along the runways or anywhere they wouldn't be in the actors' way."
Preserving that staging when the show transferred to Broadway took some effort, which included removing numerous seats, and for the first few performances some theatergoers asked for refunds because of problems with sight lines and other issues. But eventually the bugs were worked out.
The show ran for almost two years and won five Tonys, including one for Mr. Lee and Franne Lee for scenic design. (Their relationship lasted for most of the 1970s but they were nevermarried, Patrick Lynch, Mr. Lee's assistant and fellow designer, said by phone.)
Five years later, for the Stephen Sondheim musical "Sweeney Todd" (which, like "Candide," had a book by Hugh Wheeler and was directed by Mr. Prince), Mr. Lee brought pieces of an old iron foundry from Rhode Island and turned the Uris Theater into a stylized Industrial Age scene out of Victorian London.
"The stagehands at the theater still remember how heavy the set was," Mr. Lee told The Boston Globe in 2007. "You had to knock away bricks to support it. You can still see the scars all these years later."
The designs won him a second Tony Award, and a third came with "Wicked." For that show, whose set featured an imposing dragon and a time motif, Mr. Lee drew inspiration in part from smashing apart old clocks in his Providence workshop and fiddling with the innards.
Mr. Lee had more than two dozen Broadway credits, including "Agnes of God" (1982), "Show Boat" (1994), "Ragtime" (1998), "Glengarry Glen Ross" (2012) and, most recently, "Bright Star" (2016). While working on those projects and others, he oversaw the sets for "Saturday Night Live," including creating the basic stage look that has remained largely unchanged since the show began in 1975.
Lorne Michaels, the show's creator and executive producer, said in a phone interview that when he began formulating "S.N.L.," he had recently seen "Candide" and was impressed with the look the Lees had created.
"In those days, television was always on the floor," he said -- filmed on one level, with a polished sort of look -- but Mr. Lee, still working with Franne Lee, had a different idea.
"He said, 'Well, I think we should probably build stages," Mr. Michaels said. "And that meant we'd build a balcony, basically turn the studio into a theater."
"It looked like the city," Mr. Michaels added of the look Mr. Lee created. "Something about it rang true."
Over the decades -- taking a break only when Mr. Michaels did for five years in the 1980s -- Mr. Lee would travel from his home in Providence to oversee the show's design each week, whether it included a living room, a fake Oval Office or a special setting for the musical guest.
In his work on "S.N.L." Mr. Lee encountered many up-and-coming comedians, and he helped some of them branch out, working on the Broadway shows of Gilda Radner ("Live From New York," 1979), Colin Quinn ("An Irish Wake," 1998) and Will Ferrell ("You're Welcome, America," 2009). He also became production designer for "The Tonight Show" when Jimmy Fallon took it over in 2014.
"When we were discussing the 'Tonight Show' set, he just had such a clear vision on the look and the stage and the curtain and the color of the wood," Mr. Fallon said by email. "Every inch of it had meaning."
Whoever was in the "S.N.L." cast in a given year, Mr. Michaels said, owed a debt to Mr. Lee.
"He built this place for us to play in and do the show," he said, "and it feels whole when we're in it."
Eugene Edward Lee was born on March 9, 1939, in Beloit, Wis. His father, also named Eugene, was an engineer, and his mother, Elizabeth (Gates) Lee, was a pediatric nurse.
His academic history was a patchwork.
"I don't think I have a degree from any place," he told American Theater magazine in 1984. "Maybe I have a degree from Yale; I can't remember."
He started out studying at the University of Wisconsin.
"Then I saw Helen Hayes talking on television about Carnegie Tech and the stage," he told The Times in 2000, referring to what is now Carnegie Mellon University. "So I got in my Volkswagen, which my grandmother had given me, and I arrived at the front door and said, 'I'm here."'
He had a similarly casual approach to the Yale School of Drama, where he arrived in 1966 and studied for a time, although he did not finish his degree. (Some two decades later, the school granted him a master's degree -- "a real degree, not even an honorary one," he told Yale Alumni Magazine in 2017.)
With or without degrees, by the second half of the 1960s he was getting plenty of design work, including at Trinity Rep, where Adrian Hall, the founding artistic director, brought him in as resident designer. (Mr. Hall died on Feb. 4 in Van, Texas.) When Mr. Hall added the job of artistic director of the Dallas Theater Center in 1983, Mr. Lee worked with him there as well.
Wherever he was working, Mr. Lee favored the genuine over the artificial.
"Once you start painting, it has a painted look," he told American Theater. "What please me are real textures used in the way nature left them. There's nothing like a real piece of rusted tin -- really rusted -- put up on the stage. I don't care how heavy it is, how dirty it is."
Mr. Eustis recalled one production -- "Hope of the Heart" in 1990 -- on which Mr. Lee's enthusiasm for the realistic had to be reined in.
"Eugene could be risky, even reckless," he said. "When I first worked with him at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, he insisted that the actors should use live ammunition (mercifully, only BBs) in the course of the show. We had to do a full-scale test, with a dozen of us wearing goggles, to prove to him that BBs would fly all over the auditorium and blind the audience if we used them. Reluctantly, he agreed to abandon the idea."
Mr. Lee married Brooke Lutz in 1981. She survives him, along with his twin brother, Thomas; a son from his relationship with Franne Lee, Willie; a son from his marriage, Ted; and two grandchildren.
Mr. Lee was known as a man of few words, and a man who loved the water. Mr. Eustis recalled that Mr. Lee took him out on Narragansett Bay on his sailboat when they were working on Trinity's production of "A Long Day's Journey Into Night" in 1995.
"We spent a couple hours on the water, talking but not referring to the play, and then he said, 'It would be too bad if they actually left the stage when they say they are leaving,"' Mr. Eustis recalled. "That was our whole conversation. He delivered one of the most brilliant and beautiful designs I'd ever seen."
Iris Fanger, reviewing the production in The Boston Herald, described that set as a series of rooms "that seem to stretch back into eternity."

More quickly than seemed possible a few months ago, sticker prices for electric vehicles are falling closer to the point at which they could soon be on a par with gasoline cars.
Increased competition, government incentives and falling prices for lithium and other battery materials are making electric vehicles noticeably more affordable. The tipping point when electric vehicles become as cheap or cheaper than cars with internal combustion engines could arrive this year for some mass market models and is already the case for some luxury vehicles.
Prices are likely to continue trending lower as Tesla, General Motors, Ford Motor and their battery suppliers ramp up new factories, reaping the cost savings that come from mass production. New electric vehicles from companies like Volkswagen, Nissan and Hyundai will add to competitive pressure.
The battery-powered version of GM’s Equinox crossover, for example, will start around $30,000 when it arrives this fall, the carmaker has said. That is $3,400 more than the least expensive gasoline-fueled Equinox. But factoring in government incentives, the electric Equinox should be cheaper. Like all electric vehicles, the car will need less maintenance, and the electricity to power it will cost less than the gasoline used by its combustion engine equivalent.
Only a few months ago, electric-vehicle buyers faced long waiting lists, and dealers marked up sticker prices by thousands of dollars. Used electric vehicles sometimes sold for more than new ones because buyers were willing to pay a premium to get one right away. At the end of 2022, the average price of an electric vehicle was $61,488, compared with $49,507 for all passenger cars and trucks, according to Kelley Blue Book.
There are still waiting lists for some models like the Ford F-150 Lightning pickup truck, but it has become easier and cheaper to find and buy new and used electric models.
The first major crack in the trend of rising prices came in January, when Tesla cut prices for the Model 3 and Model Y, the two bestselling electric cars, by thousands of dollars. With a starting price of $43,500 before government incentives, a Model 3 is now $300 less than the least expensive BMW 3 Series sedan. A Model Y, at $55,000 before tax credits, costs about as much as a comparable Lexus RX.
Ford also cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E, the bestselling electric vehicle in the United States after the Teslas. Even Lucid Motors, a maker of expensive electric sedans that do not qualify for tax credits, is feeling pressure to cut prices and this week began offering $7,500 discounts on cars that start at $107,400.
Tesla “saw there is increasing competition, and some of the competition is quite good,” said Brian Moody, executive editor for Kelley Blue Book. He added, “If the No. 1 seller of a certain type of car reduces their prices, that is going to have an impact on the average.”
Major impetus for the price cuts came from the Inflation Reduction Act, legislation passed by Democrats in Congress last year that provides tax credits of up to $7,500 for electric-car buyers. To qualify, battery-powered or plug-in hybrid sedans have to sell for less than $55,000, while pickups and sport utility vehicles qualify only if the retail price is below $80,000. By cutting prices, Ford and Tesla increased the number of models that could benefit from the tax credits.
Manufacturers “are working to continue to pull in shoppers by making these vehicles eligible for tax credits,” said Jenni Newman, editor-in-chief of Cars.com, an online auto-sales site.
Potentially more significant are subsidies paid to companies that manufacture batteries in the United States, part of a drive by the Biden administration to establish a domestic supply chain and reduce dependence on China.
The subsidies, which were also part of the Inflation Reduction Act, could cut the cost of making electric vehicles by as much as $9,000. That break and the tax credits for buyers of electric cars could allow battery-powered vehicles to achieve price parity with gasoline cars as soon as this year, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation, a research and advocacy group. That is three to five years sooner than would be the case without incentives.
“If the automakers pass that on to consumers, consumers will really benefit,” said Stephanie Searle, a program director at the council who oversees research on passenger vehicles.
Declines in new-car prices are pushing down used electric-vehicle prices, too. They have fallen 17% since July, according to Recurrent, which tracks the used-car market. That’s largely because of Tesla cutting the price of the Model 3 and GM lowering the price of the Chevrolet Bolt by almost $6,000 last year. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, used cars can also qualify for a tax credit of up to $4,000. That is important because most people buy used vehicles.
Falling prices for materials like lithium and cobalt have also helped. The price of lithium used in batteries has fallen 20% from its peak in November, though the metal still costs more than twice as much as it did at the end of 2021. Cobalt has fallen by more than half since May, in part because carmakers are selling some models that do not require it, reducing demand.
New lithium mines are beginning to produce ore, which could keep a lid on prices. Sigma Lithium will begin shipping raw material from a site in Brazil to LG Energy Solution, its main customer, as early as April, Ana Cabral Gardner, Sigma Lithium’s chief executive, said in an interview. The site will be the first new source of lithium in Latin America for several years. “It’s doable, and we’re there,” Cabral Gardner said.
Of course, these advantages could fade because of new supply-chain problems. Lithium remains in short supply, and prices could spike again. Beginning next month, new regulations governing the $7,500 tax credits will require electric-car batteries to be made in the United States, Canada or Mexico with raw materials from North America or another U.S. trade ally. It is unclear how many vehicles will meet those requirements.
Right now, the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are available to vehicles assembled in North America, which partially shields the U.S. automakers from competitors like Hyundai. The company’s Ioniq 5 has sold well, but it is imported from South Korea. Hyundai is building a factory in Georgia that will start assembling electric vehicles in 2025. (Buyers may still collect a tax credit indirectly if they lease foreign-made electric vehicles.)
The Treasury Department, which is responsible for carrying out the Inflation Reduction Act, gave in to auto industry lobbying this month and classified several popular crossovers as SUVs rather than sedans. That allows vehicles like the Mustang Mach-E and all versions of the Model Y to qualify for tax credits if they sell for $80,000 or less. Before that change, the Mustang and lighter versions of the Model Y were classified as sedans, subject to a $55,000 limit.
The decision removes some pressure on the carmakers to keep prices low. Tesla quickly raised the price of the Model Y by $2,000. Ford said it has no plans to raise prices of the Mach-E.
The Inflation Reduction Act is also under attack by many congressional Republicans even though automakers and battery companies are building factories in states like South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee, where voters tend to elect Republicans.
But arguably the most powerful force driving down prices is not the commodity markets or Washington.
As electric-vehicle sales soar — rising 66% in the United States last year to 810,000, according to Kelley Blue Book — automakers are getting better at making them. Ford has reduced the weight of the Mach-E by 70 pounds, increasing range and lowering cost, by eliminating some wiring, Jim Farley, the company’s chief executive, told investors this month.
GM and LG Energy Solution began producing batteries at a new plant in Ohio last year through a joint venture, Ultium Cells. A second Ultium plant, in Tennessee, is expected to begin production this year, and a third is slated for Michigan. Generally speaking, costs come down as companies produce more of a product.
Auto executives say that they are finding it is easier and cheaper to design and build new electric models than gasoline-powered ones.
The battery cells made by Ultium, for example, are part of a collection of components that can be mixed and matched in many types of vehicles. Carmakers have long used the same platforms in multiple models, but the strategy works even better with electric vehicles because the cars have far fewer parts than internal combustion vehicles.
The Ultium platform cuts the time needed to develop a new vehicle by almost two years, Dan Nicholson, vice president of electrification at GM, said at a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference in January.
As a result, GM will be able to introduce three Chevrolet electric vehicles this year: the Equinox, a Silverado pickup truck and a Blazer SUV. “That’s how we get the economies of scale,” Nicholson said.
Suppliers have been looking for efficiencies, too. Matthews International Corp., based in Pittsburgh, has developed a process for coating the metal foil that separates the positive and negative electrodes of a battery. Instead of a liquid solution, the process uses a powder.
The process requires less equipment and a lot less space, said Greg Babe, the company’s chief technology officer. Those kinds of incremental improvements reduce costs without major technical breakthroughs.
Interest in the approach developed by Matthews has soared since Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act. “It changed almost overnight,” Babe said. “The floodgates opened.”

U.S. Loans $ 2 Billion
To Support Battery Effort
The Energy Department on Thursday announced a $ 2 billion loan to help a Nevada company step up production of critical components of electric vehicle batteries.
The company, Redwood Materials, plans to use the loan to expand a manufacturing campus near Reno, Nev., where it makes some of the components from new and recycled sources. The company was founded by J.B. Straubel, a former top Tesla executive, and has partnerships with Panasonic, Ford Motor, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo.
After construction is complete, Redwood aims to produce enough battery materials at the Nevada campus to support production of more than one million electric vehicles a year. The loan will help to create about 3,400 construction jobs, Redwood and the Energy Department said. The company said it expected about 1,600 full-time employees to work at the campus when it was finished.
The announcement was the latest loan from the department to support domestic battery manufacturing as the Biden administration seeks to bring more of the supply chain for electric vehicles to the United States and reduce reliance on China. Last month, the department said it would lend $ 700 million to support a mining project in Nevada. In December, the department announced a $ 2.5 billion loan for Ultium Cells, a battery-making joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution. NIRAJ CHOKSHI
RIDE HAILING
Lyft Blames Bad Weather
For Bleak Revenue Forecast
Lyft on Thursday forecast current-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates, blaming extremely cold weather in some of its major markets and lower prices, especially during peak hours, sending its shares down 23 percent in extended trading.
The company's outlook was in contrast to that of its larger rival, Uber, whose strong presence globally is helping it ride a boom in demand for ride-hailing services from travelers and officegoers
Lyft's bigger presence on the West Coast, a region that analysts have said was trailing the rest of the United States in return to pre-Covid demand, could be hurting its recovery compared with Uber's.
Lyft forecast first-quarter revenue of about $ 975 million, which fell below analyst estimates of $ 1.09 billion, according to Refinitiv data. REUTERS
FAST FOOD
Chick-fil-A Will Test
Plant-Based Sandwich
Chick-fil-A said Thursday that it's testing its first plant-based entrée -- a breaded cauliflower sandwich -- at restaurants in Denver; Charleston, S.C.; and the Greensboro, N.C., area. The test begins Monday.
The Atlanta-based company said its culinary team spent four years developing the sandwich after guests told the chain they wanted to add more vegetables to their diets. Chick-fil-A tested mushrooms, chickpeas and chopped vegetables formed into patties but kept returning to cauliflower for its mild flavor.
Like Chick-fil-A's signature chicken sandwich, the cauliflower steak is marinated, breaded, pressure-cooked and then served on a bun with two pickle slices.
Chick-fil-A is a relative latecomer to the plant-based fast food scene. Burger King started selling its Impossible Whopper -- featuring a plant-based burger made by Impossible Foods -- in 2019. Starbucks launched an Impossible sausage sandwich in 2020. McDonald's debuted its McPlant burger -- developed with Beyond Meat -- in the United Kingdom in 2021. And KFC began selling Beyond Meat nuggets last year. ASSOCIATED PRESS

50 Years of Hip-Hop in 15 Minutes: [The Arts/Cultural Desk]

Full text: The Roots drummer and D.J. was tapped by the Recording Academy to fit 50 years of rap history into 15 minutes. For once, the awards show gave the genre a fitting spotlight.
Will Smith, once known as the Fresh Prince, couldn't make it. Lil Wayne and Future dropped out at the last minute. Countless other rap luminaries were never even invited, owing to inevitable time and scheduling constraints. Yet with a climactic, decade-spanning, region-representing, 15-minute medley on Sunday night, the Grammys managed to do something that had proved a struggle for the show since 1989: It pleased hip-hop fans.
Putting Grandmaster Flash next to GloRilla, LL Cool J alongside a TikTok-dancing Lil Uzi Vert, and DJ Drama on the same stage as Flavor Flav, the producers of the show celebrated the forthcoming 50th anniversary of the first hip-hop party with a fittingly sprawling and unwieldy tribute that mixed deep cuts with pop smashes and recognizable icons with overlooked innovators.
"It was a lot of mountains to move to make this happen," said Questlove, the drummer of the Roots and a go-to rap ambassador for mainstream America, in an interview a few days before the show.
Tapped around Christmas by the Grammys as a curator, D.J. and connector for the centerpiece segment, Questlove, 52, a superfan above all else, knew more than most the deep resentment that many hip-hop legends feel toward the Grammys, after years of perceived disrespect.
"It took a lot of cajoling for this particular generation to come to a function that has systematically treated them as stepchildren," he said.
Multiple acts who ended up onstage, including LL Cool J, Salt-N-Pepa and DJ Jazzy Jeff, were even part of the inaugural class of hip-hop artists who in 1989 boycotted the first Grammy ceremony to include a rap award, because it was not being televised, which they called "ghettoizing" at the time.
"I explained to them all that I understand the historical significance of it," Questlove continued, "but you've got to understand that there is a new generation that has a seat at the table. Our job is to make it right." He recalled telling his idols, "I know this reeks of a lot of overcompensatory acts, but just trust me, the old guard is gone and the new guard is the establishing guard. What should've been due to you 35 or 40 years ago is coming to light now."
And it worked -- almost across the board. There were the "major coups," Questlove said of booking LL Cool J, Queen Latifah, Method Man and Ice-T, each of whom is currently starring in a television show. Grandmaster Flash, at Questlove's rap-nerd insistence, worked his old-school drum machine (or "beat box") in addition to the record-scratching he is better known for. And they locked in Lil Uzi Vert for the youth-oriented grand finale with a personalized phone call last week.
"Probably the greatest coup of all was getting Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott, who is world famous for the word 'no,"' Questlove added, comparing his persuasion techniques to "damn near Jerry Maguire levels."
Smith -- who has hardly appeared onstage, let alone on live TV, since slapping Chris Rock at the Academy Awards -- had planned to be there, too. "Will Smith was all of 99.4 percent in," Questlove said, but the actor was due on set for "Bad Boys 4." The drummer had suggested that Smith take it all the way back to DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince's "Brand New Funk."
Even Public Enemy bought in. The group that once forcefully declared its lack of interest in a "goddamn Grammy," on "Terminator X to the Edge of Panic," appeared onstage, although they were asked not to perform that particular track. "That's the one battle I lost," Questlove said of the song. (Ice Cube, formerly of N.W.A, was also not available for a "___ Tha Police" moment, Questlove added.)
Of course, some artist absences were more glaring than others. There was no MC Hammer, Puff Daddy, Lil' Kim, 50 Cent, Eminem, Nicki Minaj, Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West or Drake, who has taken to boycotting the show himself. (Jay-Z, who rapped along from the audience, performed later in the show with DJ Khaled instead.) But this was always going to be the case.
"I knew that 12 minutes to tell a 50-year story was going to be tricky," Questlove said, fondly recalling the "'12 Angry Men'-esque battle" that took place with the producers Jesse Collins and Fatima Robinson. "But with my generation of hip-hop, it always starts with the lists and the debates -- that's the fun part."
On the telecast, LL Cool J got ahead of those criticisms from the outset. "We wish we could have included every single hip-hop artist from 1973 to 2023 -- I know, I know, I know," he cautioned. (Harvey Mason Jr., the chief executive of the Recording Academy, said in an interview that a "full two-hour celebration" of hip-hop, hosted by the Grammys, was being planned for August.)
Those who did take the stage, including Run-DMC, Rakim, Big Boi of Outkast, Busta Rhymes and Lil Baby, needed to represent not only the various eras of hip-hop, but also its regionalism, Robinson, the producer and veteran choreographer, said in an interview.
"I started dancing in the clubs around '88, '89, and we never would've thought that hip-hop -- that I -- would still be here doing this," she said. "I thought I was doing this as a hobby, it was a fad. But I never knew I would make a career out of it. I've known Puff since he was a D.J. at a club and drove a beat-up Jetta. I've known Jay-Z since he was Big Daddy Kane's hype man and we performed on high school football fields because we didn't even have a venue."
"It is American culture, hip-hop," Robinson added. "I think people showed up for that."
Still, only two rap albums have ever won the Grammy for album of the year, with the last coming nearly two decades ago, in 2004, when Outkast took home the top prize for "Speakerboxxx/The Love Below." And while a single joyous genre survey may not heal all lingering wounds between the Recording Academy and Black artists -- especially after a night that ended with Beyoncé losing her fourth best album trophy to a fourth white artist -- the leadership behind the Grammys wants everyone to know they are working on it.
"This show, and this hip-hop 50th anniversary segment, is a celebration of that genre of music, but it's also an acknowledgment that we've come a long way as an academy," Mason said ahead of the Grammys. "We haven't always honored that genre of music properly or accurately. But that was then -- this is now. It's a new day, it's a new academy."
"What we're doing," he added, "is we're trying to be better."

Activision Agrees to Pay $ 35 Million Settlement
Government regulators on Friday announced that the video game maker Activision Blizzard has agreed to pay $ 35 million to settle charges that it failed to maintain controls to collect and assess workplace complaints with regard to disclosure requirements and violated a federal whistle-blower protection rule.
The lack of necessary controls left Activision, the maker of Candy Crush, Call of Duty, Overwatch and World of Warcraft, "without the means to determine whether larger issues existed that needed to be disclosed to investors," said Jason Burt, director of the S.E.C.'s Denver office.
In paying the settlement, Activision neither admitted nor denied the S.E.C.'s findings and agreed to a cease-and-desist order, the agency said.
Just over a year ago, Microsoft said it was paying a hefty $ 68.7 billion for Activision, but the deal is being held up by regulators in the U.S. and Europe over anti-competitive concerns. ASSOCIATED PRESS
ELECTRIC VEHICLES
Treasury Makes More E.V.s
Eligible for Tax Credits
The Treasury Department on Friday said that it was making more electric vehicles eligible for tax credits of up to $ 7,500 under new vehicle classification definitions.
The revised standards for E.V. tax credits follow lobbying by automakers that had pressed the Biden administration to change vehicle definitions to allow higher priced vehicles to qualify for a maximum tax credit. Tesla's C.E.O., Elon Musk, met with top aides to President Biden last week to discuss the E.V. industry and the broader goals of electrification.
The decision raises the retail price cap for tax credits to $ 80,000 for G.M.'s Cadillac Lyriq, Tesla's five-seat Model Y, Volkswagen's ID.4 and Ford's Mustang Mach-E and Escape plug-in hybrid.
Ford and Tesla both said in recent weeks that they are cutting prices on some E.V. models in part to qualify for the new federal tax credit and spur buyer interest. ASSOCIATED PRESS
AUTO SAFETY
U.S. Warns Honda Drivers
About Dangerous Airbags
Honda and the U.S. government are urging owners of about 8,200 older vehicles not to drive them until dangerous airbag inflators are replaced.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday issued a "Do Not Drive" advisory for the 2001 through 2003 vehicles with Takata inflators that have a high possibility of exploding and hurling shrapnel in a crash.
The safety agency says the risk to drivers and passengers is dire. If the inflators blow apart, they can shoot shrapnel toward a driver's face that could kill them or cause serious injuries.
The agency says the Honda and Acura vehicles were recalled previously but records show that repairs have not been made in the affected vehicles. Honda already has replaced 99 percent of the dangerous inflators.
"These inflators are two decades old now, and they pose a 50 percent chance of rupturing in even a minor crash," the NHTSA's acting administrator, Ann Carlson, said in a statement.
Since 2009, the exploding airbags have killed at least 33 people worldwide, including 24 in the United States.

Full text: Aiming to make a million electric vehicles a year by 2025, General Motors is investing in a Nevada lithium mine to help with battery production.
General Motors on Tuesday reported solid profits for 2022, after overcoming the computer chip shortages and softening demand that has slowed much of the auto industry last year.
The company reported $ 9.9 billion in net income, slightly below the total from the year before, while revenue rose 23 percent to $ 157 billion. It sold 3.6 million vehicles globally, up from 2.9 million in 2021.
"Our team rose to every challenge that was thrown at them in 2022," G.M.'s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a conference call.
In the fourth quarter, when rising interest rates began to slow sales of new cars and trucks, G.M. generated $ 2 billion in profit, an increase of 15 percent from a year earlier. Revenue rose 28 percent to $ 43 billion. Vehicle sales increased 30 percent to 967,000.
G.M. shares rose more than 8 percent in trading on Tuesday, closing above $ 39.
The automaker forecast that profit in 2023 will be $ 8.7 billion to $ 10.1 billion. "We expect that our momentum will help us deliver strong results once again in 2023," Ms. Barra said.
She also said G.M. would seek to cut costs by about $ 2 billion and expected to reduce its work force through attrition. "We are not planning layoffs," she said.
In electric vehicles, G.M. has been gearing up to compete head-on with Tesla, the leader. G.M. said that it expected to produce about 400,000 electric vehicles from 2022 through the first half of 2024, and that it would be capable of annual E.V. production of more than one million in North America in 2025.
A new battery plant in Ohio began production in August, and a second battery plant is to open in Tennessee this year. The company has started selling some high-end electric vehicles using battery packs made in Ohio, and it expects its E.V. sales to increase this year as it adds more affordable models, like an electric Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck and electric Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer sport utility vehicles.
All told, G.M. should have nine electric models available in the United States by the end of the year, Ms. Barra said.
To support its E.V. push, G.M. announced Tuesday, it is investing $ 650 million in a mining company, Lithium America, to develop a Nevada mine extracting lithium, a key battery ingredient. Production there is expected to start in 2026, Ms. Barra said.
But competition is getting keener. Automakers including Ford Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai and Kia have also rushed new E.V.s to the U.S. market. And on Monday, Ford cut prices of its Mustang Mach-E electric S.U.V., after Tesla cut its prices in mid-January by as much as 20 percent.
Garrett Nelson, an analyst with the financial research firm CFRA, said more than 100 E.V. models would be offered in the U.S. market by 2025. "We view the risk of market oversaturation as very high, and an industry pricing war should pressure margins," he said. "We remain skeptical that G.M. will achieve sales success with many of its new E.V. models."

Neighbors Help Moscow Sidestep West's Sanctions: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: A surge in trade by Russia's neighbors and allies hints at one reason its economy remains so resilient after sweeping sanctions.
WASHINGTON -- A strange thing happened with smartphones in Armenia last summer.
Shipments from other parts of the world into the tiny former Soviet republic began to balloon to more than 10 times the value of phone imports in previous months. At the same time, Armenia recorded an explosion in its exports of smartphones to a beleaguered ally: Russia.
The trend, which was repeated for washing machines, computer chips and other products in a handful of other Asian countries last year, provides evidence of some of the new lifelines that are keeping the Russian economy afloat. Recent data show surges in trade for some of Russia's neighbors and allies, suggesting that countries like Turkey, China, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are stepping in to provide Russia with many of the products that Western countries have tried to cut off as punishment for Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Those sanctions -- which include restrictions on Russia's largest banks along with limits on the sale of technology that its military could use -- are blocking access to a variety of products. Reports regularly filter out of Russia about consumers frustrated by high-priced or shoddy goods, ranging from milk and household appliances to computer software and medication, said Maria Snegovaya, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in an event at the think tank this month.
Even so, Russian trade appears to have largely bounced back to where it was before the invasion of Ukraine last February. Analysts estimate that Russia's imports may have already recovered to prewar levels, or will soon do so, depending on their models.
In part, that could be because many nations have found Russia hard to quit. Recent research showed that fewer than 9 percent of companies based in the European Union and Group of 7 nations had divested one of their Russian subsidiaries. And maritime tracking firms have seen a surge in activity by shipping fleets that may be helping Russia to export its energy, apparently bypassing Western restrictions on those sales.
While Western countries have not banned the shipment of consumer products like cellphones and washing machines to Russia, other sweeping penalties were expected to clamp down on its economy. They include a cap on the price that Russia can charge for its oil as well as restricted access to semiconductors and other critical technology.
Some companies, including H&M, IBM, Volkswagen and Maersk, halted operations in Russia after the invasion, citing moral and logistical reasons. But the Russian economy has proved surprisingly resilient, raising questions about the efficacy of the West's sanctions. Countries have had difficulty reducing their reliance on Russia for energy and other basic commodities, and the Russian central bank has managed to prop up the value of the ruble and keep financial markets stable.
On Monday, the International Monetary Fund said it now expected the Russian economy to grow 0.3 percent this year, a sharp improvement from its previous estimate of a 2.3 percent contraction.
The I.M.F. also said it expected Russian crude oil export volume to stay relatively strong under the current price cap, and Russian trade to continue being redirected to countries that had not imposed sanctions.
Most container ships have stopped ferrying goods like phones, washing machines and car parts into the port of St. Petersburg. Instead, such products are being carried on trucks or trains from Belarus, China and Kazakhstan. Fesco, the Russian transport operator, has added new ships and new ports of call to a route with Turkey that transports Russian industrial goods and foreign appliances and electronics between Novorossiysk and Istanbul.
Sergey Aleksashenko, former deputy minister of finance of the Russian Federation, said at an event this month that 2023 would be "a difficult year" for the Russian economy, but that there would be "no catastrophe, no collapse."
Some parts of the Russian economy are struggling, he said, pointing to car factories that shut down after being unable to secure parts from Germany, France, Japan and South Korea. But military expenditures and higher energy prices helped prop it up last year.
"We may not say that Russian economy is in tatters, that it is destroyed, that Putin lacks funds to continue his war," Mr. Aleksashenko said, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin. "No, it's not true."
Russia stopped publishing trade data after its invasion of Ukraine. But analysts and economists can still draw conclusions about its trade patterns by adding up the commerce that other countries report with Russia.
Matthew Klein, an economics writer and a co-author of "Trade Wars Are Class Wars," is one of the people drawing conclusions about this Russia-size hole in the global economy. According to his calculations, the value of global exports to Russia in November was just 15 percent below a monthly preinvasion average.
Global exports to Russia most likely fully recovered in December, though many countries have not yet issued their trade data for the month, he said.
"Most of that recovery has been driven overall by China and Turkey particularly," Mr. Klein said.
It's unclear how much of this trade violates sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe, but the patterns are "suspicious," he said. "It would be consistent with the idea that there are ways of trying to get around some of the sanctions."
Silverado Policy Accelerator, a Washington nonprofit, recently issued a similar analysis, estimating that the value of Russian imports from the rest of the world had exceeded prewar levels by September.
One of the case studies in that report was the jump in Armenian smartphone sales. Andrew S. David, the senior director of research and analysis at Silverado, said the trends reflected how supply chains had shifted to continue providing Russia with goods.
Samsung and Apple, previously major suppliers of Russian cellphones, pulled out of the Russian market after the invasion. Exports of popular Chinese phone brands, like Xiaomi, Realme and Honor, also initially dipped as companies struggled to understand and cope with new restrictions on sending technology or making international payments to Russia.
But after an "adjustment period," Chinese brands started to take off in Russia, Mr. David said. Overall Chinese exports to Russia reached a record high in December, helping to offset a steep drop in trade with Europe. Apple and Samsung phones also appeared to begin to find their way back to Russia, rerouted through friendly neighboring countries.
"Armenia is certainly not the only one," Mr. David said. "There's a lot coming through central western Asia, Turkey and the former Soviet republics."
Shipments to Russia of other products, like passenger vehicles, have also rebounded. And China has increased exports of semiconductors to Russia, though Russia's total chip imports remain below prewar levels.
One major open question is how effectively the Western price cap will hold down Russia's oil revenue this year.
The cap allows Russia to sell its oil globally using Western maritime insurance and financing as long as the price does not exceed $ 60 per barrel. That limit, which is essentially an exception to Group of 7 sanctions, is designed to keep oil flowing on global markets while limiting the Russian government's revenue from it.
Some analysts have suggested that Russia is finding ways around the effort by using ships that do not rely on Western insurance or financing.
Ami Daniel, the chief executive of Windward, a maritime data company, said he had seen hundreds of instances in which people from countries like the United Arab Emirates, India, China, Pakistan, Indonesia and Malaysia bought vessels to try to set up what appeared to be a non-Western trading framework for Russia.
"Basically, Russia has been gearing up toward being able to trade outside of the rule of law," he said.
Mr. Daniel said his firm had also seen a sharp uptick in shipping practices that appeared to be Russian efforts to contravene Western sanctions. They include transfers of Russian oil between ships far out at sea, in international waters that are not under the jurisdiction of any country's navy, and attempts by ships to mask their activities by turning off satellite trackers that log their location or transmitting fake coordinates.
Much of this activity had been taking place in the mid-Atlantic Ocean. But after media coverage of suspicious practices in this region, the hub moved south, off the coast of West Africa, Mr. Daniel said.
"They're exploding," he said of deceptive shipping practices. "It's happening at an industrial scale."
So far, the oil price cap appears to be accomplishing its goal of reducing the price that Russia can charge while keeping global supplies flowing. But it remains to be seen whether this shadow fleet of ships is big enough to allow Russia to buy and sell oil outside the cap, said Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, during a January panel discussion.
"If that fleet is big enough for Russia to really operate outside the reach" of the Group of 7 countries, the cap probably "won't have the kind of leverage that policymakers wanted," Mr. Cahill said. "I think we should know within a couple of months."

Following Tesla's Example, Ford Slashes Prices on E.V.s: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The automaker reduced the price of the Mustang Mach-E by up to $ 5,900 after Tesla slashed prices of its cars by as much as 20 percent.
Ford Motor said on Monday that it was cutting prices on its top-selling battery-powered model, the Mustang Mach-E, and increasing production of the sport utility vehicle. It was the latest sign of intensifying competition in the electric car market.
Two weeks ago, Tesla slashed prices of its electric cars by as much as 20 percent in response to softening demand around the world.
The price cuts for the two most affordable versions of the Mach-E amounted to less than $ 1,000 each. Other models, with longer-range batteries and premium options, were reduced $ 3,680 to $ 5,900, reductions of 6 percent to 9 percent.
"We want to make E.V.s more accessible, so we're increasing production and reducing prices across the Mach-E lineup," Ford's chief executive, Jim Farley, said on Twitter. He added that "with higher production, we're reducing costs, which allows us to share these savings with customers."
The lowest-priced Mustang Mach-E -- a rear-wheel-drive model with a standard battery -- now has a list price of $ 45,995, a reduction of $ 900. The high-performance Mach-E GT with an extended-range battery now sells for $ 63,995, a cut of $ 5,900.
Tesla's least expensive car is the Model 3, which is smaller than the Mustang Mach-E and starts at $ 43,990. The all-wheel-drive Model Y, a more direct competitor of the electric Mustang, starts at $ 53,490. An all-wheel-drive Mustang Mach-E with comparable battery range now lists for $ 53,995.
Electric vehicles priced below $ 55,000 can qualify for federal tax credits of $ 7,500 that were made available starting Jan. 1 under the Inflation Reduction Act. Ford's price cuts will make more versions of the Mach-E eligible for the credit.
Ford said the new prices would automatically apply to customers who had placed orders and were waiting for their cars. Ford's credit division is also offering subsidized interest rates as low as 5.34 percent on Mach E orders placed between Jan. 30 and April 3.
Tesla has long dominated the electric car market, which it largely had to itself until the last couple of years, but is increasingly encountering stiff competition. Its rate of growth has slowed in China, where its is now outsold by a local manufacturer, BYD. In addition to Ford, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Kia and other automakers have introduced electric models in the United States that are selling well and are generally cheaper than Tesla's luxury models.
In 2022, Ford sold just under 40,000 Mach-Es, about 45 percent more than in 2021. That made the Mach-E the third-best-selling electric model after Tesla's Model Y and Model 3.
For much of the last two years, Tesla, Ford and other automakers raised prices of electric vehicles because demand for battery-powered cars far outstripped supply. But demand for cars and other big-ticket goods has weakened in recent months as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates significantly. Fed policymakers are expected to slow their rate increases at their first meeting of the year on Wednesday.

Despite Tesla's 'Incredibly Challenging Year,' Carmaker's Profit Rose 12% in Fourth Quarter: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The electric car company is facing intensifying competition, supply chain disruptions and concerns about the behavior of Elon Musk.
Tesla reported a respectable jump in profit for the last quarter of 2022, but slipping profit margins and slowing sales growth underlined the challenges that have weighed on the carmaker's stock.
The profit increase of 12 percent capped a tumultuous year that included intensifying competition, supply chain disruptions and concerns about the behavior of its chief executive, Elon Musk. There is no sign from Tesla's report to shareholders on Wednesday that those problems are going away.
The year was dominated by Mr. Musk's acquisition of Twitter, which led to complaints by Tesla investors that he was neglecting his duties at the carmaker at a critical time.
Tesla shares fell 65 percent during 2022 as investors doubted whether the company was reacting energetically enough to a long list of challenges and risks.
Among other things, investors worried that Mr. Musk would sell more of his stake in Tesla to finance his Twitter acquisition, flooding the market. They worried about Tesla's prospects in China, the world's largest car market, because of problems maintaining the supply of critical parts and growing competition from rivals like the Chinese manufacturer BYD. During 2022, BYD surpassed Tesla in total electric cars sold in China.
At the same time, slowing economic growth and rising interest rates in the United States threatened to reduce the number of people who can afford a Tesla. Fourth-quarter deliveries rose 18 percent, to 405,000 vehicles, the company said on Jan. 2, a lot less than Wall Street analysts had expected and short of Tesla's own targets.
"It was our best year ever on every level," Mr. Musk said during a conference call with investors on Wednesday. But he acknowledged that "2022 was an incredibly challenging year."
Mr. Musk also addressed criticism that his statements on Twitter had alienated some potential buyers. His 127 million followers on the platform, he said, "suggests I'm reasonably popular."
While acknowledging that he might have offended some people, he maintained that his presence on the platform helps Tesla. "Twitter is actually an incredible tool for driving demand," he said.
Tesla shares recouped some of their losses in January after the company slashed prices on most of its electric cars in the United States and Europe to revive sales. The price of a Model 3 sedan, the least expensive Tesla, dropped by $ 3,000, selling now for $ 44,000 in the United States before government incentives.
The markdowns appear to have prompted a surge in orders and helped reassure investors that Tesla had a plan to retain its dominance in electric cars. Tesla faces a stronger challenge from established car companies like Hyundai, Ford Motor, General Motors and Volkswagen, which are selling more battery-powered vehicles and at lower prices than Tesla.
Although the price cuts helped to promote sales, they also took a toll on Tesla's profit margin. The gross profit margin on car sales slipped to 26 percent in the fourth quarter from 28 percent in the third quarter of 2022 and 31 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Tesla said on Wednesday it would begin production of its long-awaited Cybertruck by the end of the year, although it won't be able to ramp-up manufacturing of large numbers of the vehicle until 2024. Delays in the truck, which was unveiled in 2019, have allowed rivals like Rivian and Ford to beat Tesla to market with electric pickups.
"The fact the Cybertruck is on schedule is a big positive," Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said in a note to clients.
Net profit for the quarter was $ 3.7 billion, up from $ 3.3 billion in the third quarter, Tesla said. For the full year, Tesla's profit more than doubled to $ 12.6 billion from $ 5.5 billion in 2021. Sales for the year, including revenue from solar panels, energy storage and other businesses, rose to $ 81.5 billion from $ 53.8 billion the previous year.
Tesla said it expected to produce 1.8 million cars in 2023, up from 1.4 million in 2022. That would be a more modest rate of growth than in 2022, when production increased by nearly 50 percent.
Tesla's shares have risen by one-third since the beginning of January, though the stock price is still more than 60 percent below the high it set in November 2021.
Tesla earnings were among the most closely watched numbers on Wall Street this week. It remains the world's most valuable car company by far and is growing much faster than more established automakers.

Full text: Enlarge this image.
Tesla reported a respectable jump in profit for the last quarter of 2022, but slipping profit margins and slowing sales growth underlined the challenges that have weighed on the carmaker’s stock.
The profit increase of 12% capped a tumultuous year that included intensifying competition, supply chain disruptions and concerns about the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. There is no sign from Tesla’s report to shareholders Wednesday that those problems are going away.
The year was dominated by Musk’s acquisition of Twitter, which led to complaints by Tesla investors that he was neglecting his duties at the carmaker at a critical time.
Tesla shares fell 65% during 2022 as investors doubted whether the company was reacting energetically enough to a long list of challenges and risks.
Among other things, investors worried that Musk would sell more of his stake in Tesla to finance his Twitter acquisition, flooding the market. They worried about Tesla’s prospects in China, the world’s largest car market, because of problems maintaining the supply of critical parts and growing competition from rivals including Chinese manufacturer BYD. During 2022, BYD surpassed Tesla in total electric cars sold in China.
At the same time, slowing economic growth and rising interest rates in the United States threatened to reduce the number of people who can afford a Tesla. Fourth-quarter deliveries rose 18%, to 405,000 vehicles, the company said Jan. 2 — a lot less than Wall Street analysts had expected and short of Tesla’s own targets.
“It was our best year ever on every level,” Musk said during a conference call with investors on Wednesday. But he acknowledged that “2022 was an incredibly challenging year.”
Musk also addressed criticism that his statements on Twitter have alienated some potential buyers. His 127 million followers on the platform, he said, “suggests I’m reasonably popular.”
While acknowledging that he might have offended some people, he maintained that his presence on the platform helps Tesla. “Twitter is actually an incredible tool for driving demand,” he said.
Tesla shares recouped some of their losses in January after the company slashed prices on most of its electric cars in the United States and Europe to revive sales. The price of a Model 3 sedan, the least expensive Tesla, dropped by $3,000, selling now for $44,000 in the United States before government incentives.
The markdowns appear to have prompted a surge in orders and helped reassure investors that Tesla had a plan to retain its dominance in electric cars. Tesla faces a stronger challenge from established car companies such as Hyundai, Ford Motor, General Motors and Volkswagen, which are selling more battery-powered vehicles and at lower prices than Tesla.
Although the price cuts helped to promote sales, they also took a toll on Tesla’s profit margin. The gross profit margin on car sales slipped to 26% in the fourth quarter from 28% in the third quarter of 2022 and 31% in the fourth quarter of 2021.
Tesla said Wednesday that it would begin production of its long-awaited Cybertruck by the end of the year, although it won’t be able to ramp up manufacturing of large numbers of the vehicle until 2024. Delays in the truck, which was unveiled in 2019, have allowed rivals like Rivian and Ford to beat Tesla to market with electric pickups.
“The fact the Cybertruck is on schedule is a big positive,” Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said in a note to clients.
Net profit for the quarter was $3.7 billion, up from $3.3 billion in the third quarter, Tesla said. For the full year, Tesla’s profit more than doubled to $12.6 billion from $5.5 billion in 2021. Sales for the year, including revenue from solar panels, energy storage and other businesses, rose to $81.5 billion from $53.8 billion the previous year.

Tesla Will Build Plant in Nevada to Make Electric Semi Trucks: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: The $ 3.6 billion investment, which also includes a new battery factory, presents a challenge to traditional truck makers that have been slow to sell electric vehicles.
Tesla will build a factory in northern Nevada that will manufacture electric semi trucks, the company said Tuesday, putting pressure on traditional truck makers like Daimler and Volvo that are just beginning to sell battery-powered vehicles.
The factory, along with a new battery plant, will add 3,000 employees at an existing Tesla facility east of Reno. Tesla said it would invest $ 3.6 billion in the truck plant and the new factory to build the company's most advanced battery cells.
The construction of a factory signals that Tesla is serious about the semi truck, which it unveiled in 2017 but has so far built in limited numbers. In December, Tesla delivered a few of the trucks to PepsiCo, its first customer.
Manufacturers like Daimler Truck, Volvo and Traton, a unit of Volkswagen, have said they are committed to producing vehicles that generate no tailpipe emissions, but trucks powered by diesel fuel still dominate the industry.
If the Tesla truck is a success, it could put the same kind of pressure on established truck makers that carmakers faced from Tesla's electric cars and sport utility vehicles. The success of Tesla cars forced General Motors, Ford Motor, Volkswagen and other automakers to reply with their own electric vehicles, upending the industry.
But it is unclear how many truck buyers will switch to electric vehicles, and how quickly. Fleet owners pay close attention to the cost of ownership of the vehicles they buy, carefully calculating the price of fuel, maintenance and driver downtime. Tesla's semi is likely to cost more to buy than a conventional heavy truck, and will be attractive only if customers figure they can make up the difference in lower fuel and maintenance expenses.
Tesla advertises that its truck will have a range of 500 miles, which probably makes it most suitable for relatively short routes. There is no comprehensive charging network for trucks. Until a network exists, the semi is likely to appeal mostly to customers that run trucks from depots where they can charge overnight.
Daimler, which owns Freightliner Trucks, is banking on hydrogen fuel cells as the best way to eliminate tailpipe emissions from long-haul trucks. Volvo, the second-largest truck maker worldwide after Daimler, is pursuing a similar strategy. But neither has begun mass-producing hydrogen-fueled trucks, and hydrogen remains much more expensive than diesel.
News of Tesla's decision to build the truck factory emerged on Monday when Nevada's governor, Joe Lombardo, mentioned it during a speech.

Carl H. Hahn, 96, Who Turned a Vehicle Into a Pop Culture Icon: [Biography]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: As president of Volkswagen of America, he pushed the "Think Small" ad campaign that helped create a counterculture icon.
Carl H. Hahn, a German automobile executive who helped transform the humble Volkswagen Beetle into an American pop culture icon and one of the most widely produced cars in the world, died on Jan. 14 at his home in Wolfsburg, Germany. He was 96.
His death was confirmed by his son Christopher Hahn.
During Mr. Hahn's chairmanship of Volkswagen A.G. from 1982 to 1993, the company graduated into a global brand and Europe's leading automobile manufacturer.
He was still in his 20s in 1954 when he wrote an unsolicited letter to Heinrich Nordhoff, the German engineer who had rejuvenated Volkswagen after World War II, persuading him to hire Mr. Hahn. He became Mr. Nordhoff's assistant and was quickly promoted to chief of export promotion.
Mr. Hahn served as president of New York-headquartered Volkswagen of America from 1959 to 1964, and upon arriving in the United States he toured the country in a VW minibus.
"I learned, apparently very fast, to get to know and understand America," he would later say. "And I loved it."
Volkswagen avoided the fins and other frills with which U.S. manufacturers larded their vehicles. Instead, the company and its advertising agency, Doyle Dane Bernbach, promoted "our philosophy of a car that doesn't change for the reason of change, only for the benefit of the consumer," Mr. Hahn said at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2011.
The ads persuaded buyers to "Think Small," embrace their cars' distinctive rounded back and bug-eye headlights and to prioritize efficiency and quality control.
Coupled with marketable if less visible engineering advances, the campaign transmogrified the cookie-cutter low-cost automobile that Hitler commissioned as "the people's car" in the 1930s into the American counterculture's adorable "Love Bug."
"Without him, there would likely not have been the ads, which did indeed change the whole story for VW outside of Germany and did indeed result in a lot of needed healing, as well as revenue," Andrea Hiott, the author of "Thinking Small: The Long, Strange Trip of the Volkswagen Beetle" (2012), said in an email.
While Detroit was wooing car buyers with luxurious behemoths, the black-and-white Volkswagen ads featured a photograph of the diminutive Beetle surrounded by an expanse of white space that spoke simplicity.
The campaign, which Advertising Age ranked as one of the best of the 20th century, featured another ad with the headline "Lemon." It touted the car's reliability and resale value and boasted that Volkswagen had more quality-control inspectors in its factory than cars.
In 1964, at the age of 38, Mr. Hahn was named the parent company's head of sales and left the States, moving to Wolfsburg, the city in the Lower Saxony region of northern Germany where Volkswagen AG is headquartered.
Carl Horst Hahn Jr. was born on July 1, 1926, in Chemnitz, in eastern Germany, to Carl Hahn Sr. and Marie (Kusel) Hahn.
His father, Carl Sr., was a director of DKW, which became the world's biggest motorcycle maker in the 1920s; he was also a founder, in 1932, of Auto Union, a forerunner to what became Audi AG. He was a practicing Roman Catholic who joined the Nazi Party in 1933 after Hitler signed a treaty with the Vatican in which he guaranteed the church's rights in Germany, Carl Jr. wrote in a memoir.
Carl Jr. was drafted into the German military as a teenager and served in the tank corps. He was captured near the end of the war and released from a U.S.-run prisoner-of-war camp in late July 1945.
After the war, Carl Jr. left Communist East Germany.
He studied business administration at the University of Cologne and the University of Zurich and received his doctorate in economics from the University of Bern in Switzerland in 1952.
He worked as an economist for the European Productivity Agency (EPA) in Paris before he was hired by Volkswagen.
In 1972, the Beetle became the world's best-selling car. That same year, Mr. Hahn left the company to join Continental Gummi-Werke, Germany's biggest rubber and tire company, which he helped turn around as chief executive.
Returning to Volkswagen in 1982, he promoted the Golf model, and the company began producing vehicles in China, the former East Germany and Eastern Europe.
"The unification of the two German states puts an ultimate end to the chapter of horrors of World War II and its consequences," Mr. Hahn told The New York Times in 1990.
At the end of 1992, he left his job as chief executive but remained on the company's supervisory board until 1997.
Meanwhile, high labor costs in Germany and competition from less expensive Japanese and even American cars were challenging Volkswagen's pre-eminence.
After leaving his full-time role at the carmaker, Mr. Hahn was chairman of a Swiss engineering group and board member of numerous U.S. and European corporations. He also established the Carl and Marisa Hahn philanthropic foundation.
His wife, Marisa (Traina) Hahn, died in 2013.
In addition to his son Christopher, he is survived by two other sons, Carl and Peter; a daughter, Pia Hahn; 11 grandchildren; a brother, Wolfgang; and two sisters, Anna Renata Schulz and Caroline Odefey.
On numerous occasions, he predicted confidently that the automobile industry's future rested less on individual ownership of vehicles than on the provision of transportation through readily available self-driving cars and other means.
As the head of Volkswagen, he would routinely forsake his chauffeur-driven vehicle to try the latest models by his company and its competitors. As his son Christopher recalled, "He loved his Trabant convertible that he had at his summer house -- besides riding motorcycles on weekends, which my mom did not appreciate."

Tesla Cuts Its Prices Sharply As It Moves to Lift Demand: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The price reductions in the United States will make more of the company's electric vehicles eligible for a federal tax credit.
Tesla has cut prices on most of its electric cars in the United States and Europe by as much as 20 percent in a bid to spur slackening demand.
The automaker faces increasingly stiff competition in the global market for electric vehicles. It also must contend with rising interest rates in the United States, which have increased the cost of financing vehicle purchases.
"I think Tesla recognizes they are not the only game in town and the Detroit companies are jumping into the deep end with E.V.s," said Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst. "I think the price cuts mean Tesla is going to rip the Band-Aid off and try to go on the offensive."
Tesla stock fell sharply in early trading Friday after the price cuts were reported, but ended the day less than 1 percent lower. The share price has fallen roughly 70 percent since November 2021.
The cuts will allow some of Tesla's lower-priced models, depending on optional features, to qualify for federal tax credits of $ 7,500 that were made available starting Jan. 1 under the Inflation Reduction Act. The credit is available on electric cars priced under $ 55,000.
Tesla has enjoyed rapid growth for the last decade but now must contend with a variety of challenges, including concerns that its chief executive, Elon Musk, is too preoccupied with Twitter, the social media platform he acquired last year for $ 44 billion.
Mr. Musk has sold billions of dollars of Tesla stock to finance the Twitter acquisition, which has depressed Tesla's stock price, and he has come under fire for firing a large portion of Twitter's employees. He has also aired polarizing political views on the social media platform -- including several messages that appeared to support Russia in its war against Ukraine -- that have hurt his and Tesla's reputation with some consumers.
Tesla is not alone in dealing with slowing sales. U.S. auto sales fell about 8 percent last year to fewer than 14 million cars and trucks, the lowest level since 2011, mainly because shortages of computer chips prevented manufacturers from producing as many vehicles as consumers wanted to buy. In addition, rising borrowing rates made customer financing more expensive.
Sales of electric vehicles, however, rose 66 percent to more than 808,619, according to Kelley Blue Book, a market researcher. And while Tesla continues to dominate the segment, several automakers are gaining ground. Ford, Volkswagen and several other automakers posted sizable increases in E.V. sales last year and offer many models that were significantly more affordable than Tesla's. Hyundai and its affiliate Kia together sold more than 43,000 electric vehicles in the United States in 2022, up from a just few hundred in 2021.
New competitors are on the way, too. This year, General Motors is supposed to start making electric versions of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup and Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox sport utility vehicles.
Tesla has also had trouble in China, its largest market, where a local manufacturer, BYD, is now the No. 1 electric vehicle brand. Tesla recently lowered prices in China and reported a global sales total for 2022 that was below analysts' expectations.
While still hailed for the advanced technologies it packs into its cars, and their sleek styling, Tesla has been slow to add to its model line. It offers only four vehicles, and two are luxury models out of reach of most mainstream consumers. It last introduced a car in 2020, when the Model Y went into production.
Since 2019, Tesla has promised to introduce a pickup, called the Cybertruck, but has delayed its production several times. The company now hopes to begin making it this year. The Cybertruck has an angular, futuristic design and is expected to be sold as a luxury vehicle, which could limit its appeal. In the past, Mr. Musk has expressed a desire to produce an electric car that can sell for around $ 25,000, but he has laid out no formal plans.
In December, Tesla began delivering a small number of battery-powered semi trucks to PepsiCo, its first customer.
"We see demand problems remaining until Tesla is able to introduce a lower-priced offering in volume, which may only be in 2025," Toni Sacconaghi, a Bernstein analyst, said in a report this month.
In cutting the prices of its current models, Tesla is indicating that it is willing to concede some profit in order to increase sales volume. The company typically shows gross profit margins of 26 percent -- more than double that of some rival automakers -- a factor that led investors to bid up its stock, making it the world's most valuable car company.
The latest price cut on Tesla vehicles appeared on the company's website late Thursday. The automaker now shows a high-end Model 3 Performance compact selling in the United States for just under $ 54,000, down from $ 63,000, a cut of 14 percent.
The most affordable version of the Model 3 now sells for just under $ 44,000, a reduction of about $ 3,000 or 6 percent. The Model Y now starts at $ 53,000, a cut of 20 percent from the previous price of $ 66,000.
The company's websites for Germany, France and other European nations showed similar price cuts. The base Model 3 is now listed at 44,000 euros, a reduction of about 12 percent from the previous price.
In the past, Tesla's sales were helped by $ 7,500 tax credits provided by an earlier federal program. Those credits were no longer available after Tesla sold 200,000 vehicles in the U.S. market, but the company's sales continued to grow rapidly. Tesla has forecast that its sales will grow about 50 percent a year for the next few years.
Tesla sold 1.3 million cars in 2022, a 40 percent increase from the year before but short of the 50 percent target.
The company seemed to weather the computer chip shortage early in the pandemic better than most other automakers. Many had to idle plants temporarily at times because of shortages of certain electronic parts. Although Tesla, too, was affected, it said it was able to rewrite software that could run on substitute chips that were in more plentiful supply.
Tesla's fourth-quarter production of 440,000 cars was 34,000 more than the company delivered, suggesting that the sluggishness went beyond supply chain problems and production issues.

Full text: The police in Guangzhou detained a 22-year-old man, who appeared to throw money in the air after striking the people. Thirteen people were injured.
A driver sped into pedestrians in a busy intersection in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, killing at least five people and injuring more than a dozen others, according to the police and videos posted online.
Officers arrested a 22-year-old man and were trying to determine a motive, according to the city's public security bureau. Videos appeared to show the driver throwing money into the air after hitting the people and before being apprehended.
The incident, which took place on Wednesday during the afternoon rush hour, set off shock and anger online and in Guangzhou, a city of more than 18 million people and the capital of Guangdong Province.
Footage of the scene, in the busy Tianhe district, showed a black BMW S.U.V. entering the intersection of Tianhe Road and Tiyu East Road at high speed, making turns as it struck pedestrians and motorists in multiple crossings.
Afterward, victims lay immobile and bloodied on the roads, stray shoes and phones scattered around them. "There was a collective wail," Hym Chu, a 25-year-old photographer, wrote in a post on Weibo, a Twitter-like social platform. "Everyone ran."
Mr. Chu said he stayed for two hours at the chaotic scene, retrieving belongings for the injured and helping to move the damaged motorcycle of a delivery worker.
In one video of the driver, filmed while he was being held to the ground, he shouted that his uncle was Huang Kunming, the Communist Party secretary of Guangdong Province. It was unclear whether that was true.
It is rare for vehicles to be deliberately driven into crowds in China, but reckless driving involving luxury cars has sometimes stoked public anger, touching a nerve in a country with a stark wealth gap.
More than a decade ago, in the northeastern city of Baoding, the son of Li Gang, a deputy police chief, killed a college student while drunkenly driving his Volkswagen sedan. As he was apprehended, he yelled, "My father is Li Gang!" Propaganda officials tried to cover up the incident, but the phrase became a grim joke symbolizing the impunity of powerful local officials and those connected to them.
Within hours of the Guangzhou incident on Wednesday, it became one of the top trending topics on Weibo, with many users decrying the senseless deaths and disparaging the driver. By Thursday morning, several graphic videos and photos from the scene had been taken down by censors.

Mercedes Plans to Build Charging Network in U.S.: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: The network could help increase the low number of charging stations, encouraging more people to buy electric vehicles.
Mercedes-Benz said Thursday that it would install a network of 2,500 high-powered chargers in the United States by 2027, a sign the German carmaker is expanding its commitment to electric vehicles by borrowing a page from Tesla's playbook.
The fast chargers, distributed among 400 stations, will operate under the Mercedes brand. Owners of the company's cars will have preferential access, although the network will be open to cars from other manufacturers.
Tesla started building charging stations years ago, and the network has been essential to the automaker's success by allaying the fears of car buyers that they won't have enough places to plug their vehicles in and could be stranded on the side of the road. Those U.S. fast chargers work only with Tesla cars, although the company has said it will open the network to other brands.
Mercedes's planned charging network is the latest sign that the company, which has lost customers to Tesla, is serious about electric vehicles. Last year, the company opened a battery factory in Alabama and began building an electric sport utility vehicle, the EQS, at its plant near Tuscaloosa, Ala.
Even when complete, Mercedes's network will be only about one-third as large as Tesla's is now. Still, the effort is more ambitious than any by other traditional automakers. Electrify America has 3,400 fast chargers at 790 locations in the United States, but does not prominently display the Volkswagen brand even though the German company founded the network and owns a majority of the business.
"This is a strategic decision to put our money where our mouth is," Ola Källenius, the chief executive of Mercedes-Benz, told reporters Thursday.
The company, already a partner in Ionity, a European charging network, also plans to install Mercedes-brand chargers in Europe and China but is beginning with the United States.
Mercedes will split the cost of the network with MN8, a solar energy producer that will provide energy to the sites. The companies said they planned to apply for federal subsidies available to companies that build chargers.
Mercedes owners will be able to reserve charger time at the network, which will be designed to work automatically with Mercedes cars so that drivers won't need to do anything except plug in the vehicle.
Charging and payment "all happens under the covers, in an invisible way," Pasquale Romano, the chief executive of ChargePoint, a maker of chargers that will supply charging equipment to Mercedes, said Thursday.
The automaker plans to start building the charging hubs this year. At least some of the devices will pump energy into cars at 350 kilowatts per hour, much faster than chargers typically found in the United States.
The hubs will be close to restaurants and restrooms, Mercedes said, for example near luxury malls that are frequented by the company's well-heeled customers. The hubs will have surveillance cameras for security.
Mercedes is trying to address complaints by electric vehicle owners that they feel unsafe while using chargers in isolated areas. The hubs will be in "a safe location," Markus Schäfer, the chief technology officer of Mercedes, said, "not in the backyard of a shopping center next to the dumpster."

In China, Tesla Sales Are Slumping: [Business/Financial Desk]

Abstract: None available.

Full text: Worry about the carmaker's sales in the world's largest car market is one reason the shares have plunged.
Tesla sales in China, the world's largest car market and a crucial element of the company's fortunes, slumped at the end of 2022 as domestic manufacturers like BYD gained ground with lower-priced electric vehicles, according to data published Thursday.
Tesla sold around 56,000 cars in China last month, a decline of 21 percent from a year earlier, and 44 percent from the previous month. For the full year, Tesla's Chinese sales rose nearly 50 percent, according to data published by the China Passenger Car Association.
China accounts for roughly 40 percent of Tesla's sales. Concern about the carmaker's performance there has been a significant factor in the precipitous decline of Tesla's share price last year. The company's stock closed down about 3 percent on Thursday.
Tesla has grown rapidly in China but is facing increasingly stiff competition from companies like BYD, which sells well-regarded cars at lower prices and is the country's No. 1 electric vehicle brand. BYD sales including hybrid vehicles more than doubled in December from a year earlier, and rose 2 percent in December from November, according to the Passenger Car Association's data.
China is considered key to Tesla's global ambitions. In contrast to the United States and Europe, overall auto sales there are still rising because many people do not own cars, or own just one vehicle. The Chinese government has heavily promoted electric vehicle ownership as a solution to urban air pollution, though it has slashed subsidies recently.
"When you are not active in the largest market in the world, you are nowhere," Axel Schmidt, a senior managing director at Accenture who oversees the consulting firm's automotive division, said before publication of the sales figures.
Tesla's factory in Shanghai is considered one of the company's most efficient plants and supplies cars to Europe and other parts of Asia in addition to China. The figures published Thursday include exports. The Shanghai factory was forced to shut down repeatedly during 2022 because of supply chain problems and pandemic lockdowns.
China is in the midst of a pandemic crisis after the government abandoned its "zero Covid" policy in the face of public protests, lifting draconian quarantine and lockdown measures and triggering a surge in cases.
The Tesla sales decline has to be viewed "in the context of the massive Covid outbreak" in December, Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, an investment firm that owns Tesla shares, said on Twitter.
Overall, sales of hybrids and cars powered solely by batteries in China were flat in December compared with November, the association said.
There have been other signs that Tesla was suffering from softening demand for its products in China. The company has cut prices for the Model Y and Model 3, the two vehicles it makes in Shanghai. The company's website says vehicles can be delivered in as little as a week -- last year, waits stretched to months.
Analysts say Tesla could be vulnerable to political tensions between the United States and China. Elon Musk, the company's chief executive, has courted the Chinese government, suggesting, for example, that Taiwan become a special administrative zone of China as a way of ceding more control to Beijing. Taiwan refuses to relinquish any control to China or compromise its independence, and Mr. Musk's remark angered leaders in Taipei.
Another concern for Tesla: BYD and other Chinese automakers have begun selling cars in Europe. Their expansion could cost Tesla, Volkswagen and other automakers sales and market share when many European car buyers are replacing combustion engine vehicles for battery-powered cars.
"The major worry now overhead for Tesla is that the demand story, especially out of China, is showing heavy cracks in the armor at a time that E.V. competition is steadily increasing," Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note to clients on Wednesday.

Tesla, Short of Expectations, Causes Wall Street Concern: [Business/Financial Desk]

Full text: Wall Street has grown decidedly pessimistic about Tesla, fearful that Elon Musk, its chief executive, is too focused on Twitter. Tesla said Monday that deliveries in the last three months of the year rose 18 percent from the previous quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts and adding to pressure on Elon Musk, the company's chief executive, to focus on making cars rather than overhauling Twitter.
Tesla said it delivered 405,000 electric cars from October through December. Wall Street analysts had predicted that Tesla would sell around 420,000 vehicles, up from 343,000 vehicles in the third quarter.
The company sold a total of 1.3 million cars in 2022, a 40 percent increase from the year before. That was short of the 50 percent annual growth target Tesla had set for itself.
While the increases were impressive by auto industry standards, Tesla has become the most valuable carmaker in the world by growing at the sizzling rates more commonly associated with Silicon Valley technology companies.
In recent months, Tesla has appeared vulnerable to competition from established carmakers and to rising borrowing rates which made its electric cars more expensive for people taking out loans. Indications that Tesla is mortal have contributed to a 65 percent decline in Tesla shares in 2022, and led investors to focus more on conventional measures like sales and profits rather than dreams of world domination.
Fourth quarter deliveries were below the forecasts of analysts, who had already lowered their expectations, and less than Tesla executives had suggested just a few months ago. Tesla said it produced 440,000 cars during the quarter, 34,000 more than it delivered, suggesting that supply chain problems and production woes were not the main explanation for disappointing sales.
Martin Viecha, head of investor relations at Tesla, said on Twitter that the gap between deliveries and production reflected vehicles in transit to customers.
There was no trading in New York Monday because of the New Year's holiday. But the numbers will probably reinforce investor fears that Mr. Musk is too focused on Twitter, which he acquired in October.
"No way to sugarcoat this," Gary Black, managing director of the Future Fund, an investment fund, said on Twitter. He predicted that analysts would reduce their estimates of Tesla sales and profits in 2023. Tesla will report 2022 earnings on Jan. 25.
Last week, Mr. Musk tried to reassure Tesla employees, telling them not to fixate on the stock price and repeating assertions that the carmaker would become the most valuable company in the world, Reuters reported.
China, the world's largest car market, is a big focus of investor concerns. The sharp rise of Covid cases in China has weighed on demand and forced the company to periodically suspend production at its biggest factory, in Shanghai.
In addition, The Chinese manufacturer BYD has raced past Tesla in electric vehicle sales in China, casting further doubt on Mr. Musk's ability to achieve world domination in the auto industry.
The growth of Tesla sales exceeds any major rival in percentage terms. The company is also among the most profitable carmakers in the world and is ramping up new factories in Texas and Germany.
But the company faces more intense competition from traditional carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen. Those companies have decades of experience mass producing vehicles cheaply, and some investors believe that those carmakers could catch up with Tesla more quickly than expected.
Tesla also faces softening consumer demand, partly because of rising interest rates. Wait times for Tesla models have shrunk, and the company has cut car prices in China and offered incentives to buyers in the United States.
Car buyers, especially the left-leaning, environmentally aware consumers who tend to buy electric cars, also appear to be turning away from Tesla because of Mr. Musk. His erratic behavior at Twitter and heated rhetoric on the social media platform have endeared him to conservatives and Silicon Valley executives but outraged other people.
Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has pleaded with Mr. Musk to focus his energy on Tesla, said the fourth-quarter deliveries were decent considering the difficult economic environment. "We believe this was a relatively good performance," Mr. Ives said on Twitter.
Tesla sales could get a boost after its cars became eligible for federal incentives on Jan. 1. A new law abolished a limit on the number of vehicles from any one manufacturer that were eligible for tax credits of up to $ 7,500. Tesla had used up its quota.
Tesla cars made at the company's factories in Texas and California also meet the requirement that vehicles must by manufactured in the United States, Canada or Mexico to be eligible for credits.
Mr. Musk, a prolific user of Twitter, did not immediately react to the delivery numbers Monday. On Sunday he wished his followers a "a great day 1 2023," adding, "One thing's for sure, it won't be boring." This article appeared in print on page B2.

Tesla said Monday that it delivered 405,000 electric cars during the last three months of the year, an 18% increase from the previous quarter that fell short of analyst estimates and may reinforce investor fears that the electric car company is losing momentum.
Wall Street analysts had predicted that Tesla would sell around 420,000 vehicles from October through December, up from 343,000 vehicles in the third quarter.
The company sold a total of 1.3 million cars in 2022, a 40% increase from the year before. That was short of the 50% annual growth target Tesla had set for itself.
The increases in deliveries were impressive compared with established carmakers, but were less than analysts had predicted and Tesla executives had suggested just a few months ago. Wall Street has grown decidedly pessimistic about Tesla, fearful that Elon Musk, its CEO, is too focused on Twitter, which he acquired in October.
Tesla’s problems include the sharp rise of COVID-19 cases in China, which is weighing on demand and forcing the company to suspend production at its biggest factory, in Shanghai. The company is also facing more intense competition from traditional carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen, and softening consumer demand as interest rates increase. Wait times for Tesla models have shrunk, and the company has cut car prices in China and offered incentives to buyers in the United States.
Tesla shares have plummeted in value this year as investors lose faith in Musk’s vow that the company would sell twice as many cars as Toyota, the world’s largest automaker by volume, by the end of the decade.
China, the world’s largest car market, is a big focus of investor concerns. Chinese manufacturer BYD has raced past Tesla in electric-vehicle sales in China, casting further doubt on Musk’s ability to achieve world domination in the auto industry. Tesla has had to repeatedly shut down production in China because of supply-chain problems and rising COVID cases.
Last week, Musk tried to reassure Tesla employees, telling them not to fixate on the stock price and repeating assertions that the carmaker would become the most valuable company in the world, Reuters reported.
The growth of Tesla sales exceeds any major rival in percentage terms. The company is also among the most profitable carmakers in the world and is ramping up new factories in Texas and Germany.
But investors are focused on the risk that traditional carmakers, which have decades of experience mass producing vehicles cheaply, could catch up with Tesla more quickly than expected.
Car buyers, especially the left-leaning, environmentally aware consumers who tend to buy electric cars, also appear to be turning away from Tesla because of Musk. His erratic behavior at Twitter and heated rhetoric on the social media platform have endeared him to conservatives and Silicon Valley executives but outraged many other people.

Climate Activists Block German Roads, Raising Awareness and Animus: [Foreign Desk]

Full text: Extreme tactics have pushed the climate crisis to the top of the public discourse but also stirred debate over whether the activists are going too far.
The radical climate activists tried hunger strikes. They glued themselves to famous paintings. They tried to disrupt a classical concert. They confronted lawmakers trying to enter Parliament. They even desecrated an official Christmas tree of the city of Berlin.
It took them donning neon vests, walking into traffic at rush hour and gluing themselves to the streets in Berlin and Munich, causing miles-long backups and bringing drivers to murderous rage, to make their protest impossible to ignore.
With their actions, carried out with increasing frequency as 2022 drew to a close, they have attracted enormous attention in a country where cars reign supreme, home to BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and the autobahn. But they have also united almost everyone in politics in Berlin, and much of the public, against them.
They have become a target for conservatives and embarrassment for the governing Green Party, which has long been working within the political system toward the same goals. And their tactics have stirred debate even within the broader environmentalist movement over how much is too much in pursuit of climate goals.
The answer from the protesters, who are the German chapter of an environmental group called Last Generation, is that the climate crisis warrants drastic action. Founded in 2021 when a small number of activists went on a weekslong hunger strike in front of the Parliament building in Berlin, the group is now well-funded and has since grown to include a few hundred active members, whose actions have earned, among other things, a reference in the president's Christmas speech last week -- a sign that their protests have struck a nerve.
Their immediate demands -- things like ending food waste, enforcing strict speed limits to reduce emissions and subsidizing rail travel -- may seem tame, but their ultimate message is urgent: The world is in a climate emergency and business as usual is not an option.
"They mix claims really easy to implement, majority-winning policy claims -- things that are quite accessible for a majority of the population -- with a system criticism," said Daniel Saldivia Gonzatti, who studies protests at WZB Berlin Social Science Center. "It's effective."
And enraging. Friedrich Merz, the head of the conservative opposition, called Last Generation a criminal organization and wants the authorities to test whether it could be declared illegal. Another politician, Alexander Dobrindt, the parliamentary leader of the Bavarian conservative party, compared the group to the Red Army Faction, a notorious band of left-wing terrorists who robbed, murdered and kidnapped in the 1970s.
But to Last Generation's members, extreme action is the answer to government inaction.
"The government has ignored over one million people on the streets in Germany alone and the government is ignoring scientists," said Carla Rochel, a 20-year-old student who was one of the early members of Last Generation, referring to Fridays for Future, a series of peaceful protests that peaked before the pandemic. "That's why we decided to take to the streets and simply not go away anymore."
The mass-market daily Bild has called the traffic-stopping protesters "climate hacks" and has published unflattering portrayals of individual participants. In some states the legal system has gone into overdrive: Bavaria locked up more than a dozen Last Generation members preventively for days, and elsewhere state prosecutors raided the activists' homes and confiscated personal electronics while investigating whether the group constitutes a "criminal gang."
For group members, who besides being committed are also often well-spoken and photogenic, the negative attention has worked in their favor to an extent, giving them a prominent place in the German news media, including on televised debate shows alongside powerful politicians.
"From being called terrorists to sitting with the justice minister in a talk show in the span of the week is quite a measure of success," said Mr. Saldivia Gonzatti, the academic studying protests.
The group has drawn criticism even in environmental circles over whether its more extreme actions, which are also being used by climate activists in countries like Britain, may be backfiring and are becoming a distraction that is turning people off from the climate cause.
Luisa Neubauer, a prominent member of the Fridays for Future climate movement, said that while the group's reason for blocking traffic was legitimate, she worried that the public had become so focused on the activists that the problem of climate change had become less visible.
In much German public debate, she said, "The question has become 'How do you stand on the Last Generation?' and not 'How do you stand on the climate crisis?"'
On a recent and exceedingly chilly and damp weekday morning, six protesters from Last Generation walked into a crosswalk on a busy road leading to the storied Potsdamer Platz, one of downtown Berlin's most traffic-jam-prone spots, and unfurled banners and then little rubber seating mats.
After a second's pause, they sat down in unison and with seemingly choreographed motion each began gluing one of their hands to the wet pavement.
Within seconds, drivers starting honking and trying to go around the protesters onto the median. Within minutes, the police arrived and tried to pull away the protesters. Because the pavement was wet, the officers managed to pull four of the activists onto the sidewalk -- two more could not be budged and a special unit had to be dispatched dissolve the glue using oil and solvents.
"One of the scariest moments is when the cars start rolling toward you, pushing themselves through people as though they don't intend to stop," said Irma Trommer, 26, who has taken part in similar human road blocks dozens of times.
Not everyone thinks their form of activism is productive.
"It annoys me, maybe that's embarrassing," said Renate Künast, a Green Party stalwart and former federal minister, who has spent nearly two decades in federal politics. Democracy is a process, she said, and even in her position she can't make climate dominate the conversation in Parliament.
The activists gained a new level of infamy in November when a cyclist in Berlin died after being pinned by a cement mixer during one of the group's traffic jams.
Early reports suggested the woman could have survived if a specialized emergency vehicle could have made it through the backup. Reaction was swift, with many condemning the activist group. It later turned out that a doctor on site had already decided on a different course of action that did not require the traffic-bound emergency vehicle.
"Now at the latest we should say goodbye to the fairy tale of the harmless protest," the speaker of a powerful police union said at the time.
Polls taken just after the accident found that 80 percent of Germans were critical of the group's action and 86 percent thought the actions ended up hurting the cause of fighting climate change.
The notoriety has only galvanized the group, whose numbers have grown from just a couple of dozen in the summer to hundreds of activists and supporters. In December the group was blocking traffic in Berlin on three to four mornings a week, sometimes at multiple locations.
"The future I personally am heading for, if climate policy does not change, is so much more uncertain than anything I am taking on here," said Ms. Trommer, referring to not just the very real possibly of violence she faces from frustrated drivers, but a permanent criminal record she could walk away with.
"My hope is that by showing that I'm willing to risk myself doing these actions, how crazy threatening the global situation is for people of my age," she said, rubbing her hand, which was torn off the pavement by a policeman before the glue had set.

Stranded at the Airport
Thousands of travelers were stranded in airports across the country over the holidays as Southwest Airlines canceled more than 2,900 flights on Monday and roughly 5,000 over Tuesday and Wednesday, more than 60 percent of its schedule. The disruptions were the result of staffing shortages and longstanding technological problems compounded by a fierce winter storm. Many customers said Southwest had done little or nothing to get them to their destinations. The airline's chief executive of 10 months, Bob Jordan, apologized, and the company said it had called on over 1,000 corporate employees to manually schedule crews for new flights. But Southwest's reputation is in tatters, and the scale of the chaos -- which one industry analyst called "the worst round of cancellations for any single airline" in recent memory -- has prompted the Department of Transportation to announce that it would look into whether Southwest was meeting its obligations to customers.
A Bare-Bones Twitter
As part of a series of drastic cost-cutting measures, on Christmas Eve Elon Musk sent members of his staff to a data center in Sacramento, one of Twitter's three main computing storage facilities, to disconnect servers key to keeping the site running smoothly. (And many users seemed to notice.) The company is facing eviction from its Seattle office and has cut security and janitorial services at others, with some employees bringing their own toilet paper to the increasingly bare-bones operation. Mr. Musk has also continued to conduct smaller-scale layoffs after the mass job cuts he carried out when he first took over the company in late October: He now says there are about 2,000 people working for Twitter, far fewer than the 7,500 he started with. And workers expect still more layoffs as the company faces a depressed advertising environment and increased costs, like the debt payments from Mr. Musk's purchase.
Accusations Against JPMorgan Chase
The attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands has filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase, accusing the bank of helping to conceal the exploitation of women and girls by the convicted financier Jeffrey Epstein and continuing to provide him with banking services after he pleaded guilty to sex charges in 2008. Mr. Epstein had been a client of the bank's for 15 years, including for five after his conviction; the bank ejected him in 2013. The suit, filed on Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan, described JPMorgan as "indispensable to the operation and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise," arguing that the bank's delay in cutting ties with Mr. Epstein helped enable his sexual abuse. The legal filing originated in the Virgin Islands because of Mr. Epstein's illegal activities at a villa on an island in the territory, Little St. James Island, which he owned.
What's Next? (Jan. 1-7)
New Year, New S&P?
We may be able to make resolutions for more positive habits in the new year. But will the stock markets follow suit? After a tumultuous year that was its worst annual performance since 2008, some analysts believe things will start to look up for the S&P 500 in 2023. But predictions, perhaps predictably, are mixed. Some forecast a serious downturn on the horizon, while others feel optimistic that markets will lift as a result of a pivot from the Federal Reserve, which has aggressively raised rates in 2022 but could begin slowing down as inflation continues to moderate. According to Bloomberg, the average forecast for the index is that it will end the year at 4,009, which is the most bearish outlook in more than two decades. But the range of predictions -- from a low of 3,400 to a high of 4,500 -- represents an unusually wide gulf in opinion.
Incentives for E.V. Drivers
A law that takes effect Sunday will both expand and scramble the list of electric vehicles eligible for federal tax credits, including models from Ford Motor, Nissan, Volkswagen, Tesla and Volvo. Under the legislation, which is part of the climate and energy package that was approved by Congress in August, drivers of those and other eligible vehicles qualify for up to $ 7,500 in the credits. But auto industry representatives have said that the law, meant to give incentives to companies to make battery-powered vehicles and customers to buy them, comes with too many strings attached. Also confusing: Other parts of the legislation will not be carried out until March, when the Biden administration intends to add new rules devised to force carmakers to buy batteries and raw materials from domestic suppliers and trade allies.
The Latest Jobs Numbers
The last three consecutive jobs reports have been in close range. Employers added 263,000 jobs in September, 261,000 in October and 263,000 in November, a sign that despite a considerable drop-off since earlier in the year, the labor market is still strong. So far, it's been more resistant to the Fed's efforts to slow down the economy than officials would like. But on Friday, the latest data from the Labor Department could show that the Fed is starting to make a bigger dent in the jobs numbers, with analysts forecasting 200,000 new jobs in December. The Fed is aiming for a target of 100,000 jobs added per month.
What Else?
Employees at Google have so far escaped the mass layoffs sweeping the tech industry, but they are bracing for cuts. After President Biden helped impose a contract on railroad workers, some union leaders called into question his claims of being the "most pro-union president." Brian X. Chen, The Times's consumer tech columnist, predicts virtual reality and A.I. tools will become more entrenched in 2023.
